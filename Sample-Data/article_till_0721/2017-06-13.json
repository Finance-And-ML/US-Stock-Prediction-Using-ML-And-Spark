[{"content": "BEIJING\u2014Anbang Insurance Group Co. said Chairman and Chief Executive       Wu Xiaohui       has handed over his duties for personal reasons, hours after a media report said he could be in trouble with the Chinese government.Mr. Wu can\u2019t perform his duties temporarily and has turned them over to other executives, the company said in a one-sentence statement dated Tuesday, without specifying a time frame or other details.The statement said the company was operating as normal. It isn\u2019t clear how long Mr. Wu\u2019s absence might last and the company didn\u2019t immediately say who is in charge.Stocks in which Anbang has significant stakes tumbled in Wednesday trading in Shanghai. China State Construction Engineering Corp., developer             Gemdale Corp.        600383 2.41%       and             Poly Real Estate Group Co.       fell 3.1%, 3.4% and 2.7%, respectively.       Jacky Zhang,        an analyst at BOC International, said he saw little risk for broader market contagion, though he said investors should avoid Anbang-related shares and other insurers. The Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.5% in early trading.Anbang hasn\u2019t addressed the torrent of speculation that has swirled around it for weeks, which was fueled anew by a report in an influential Chinese financial magazine. The report said Mr. Wu was taken away in recent days by Chinese authorities. That report, published on the website of Caijing late Tuesday, made the rounds on the Chinese internet before being censored by the government.A company spokesman declined early Wednesday to provide comment beyond the statement. Mr. Wu couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Anbang was known for its overseas deal-making, including the purchase of New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria Hotel. At home, the company helped redefine China\u2019s insurance industry with products that resembled short-term, high-yield deposits.The Chinese government recently forced the huge insurer to pull back, saying its strategies were risky.The company has tried to defuse concerns about its business and Mr. Wu in the past. This year, it slowed its overseas expansion and made a switch to more traditional types of insurance products at home.A concerted government campaign this year to rein in risks in the financial system has run in tandem with a broader, more than four-year-old crackdown on corruption that has targeted high-level officials and led to the detention of high-profile business people for questioning and, in some cases, prosecution.China\u2019s political leadership has also shown rising concern about the power of well-connected businessmen, with one tycoon living in exile taking to             Twitter                   and other social media to lob allegations of corruption at senior Chinese leaders.Anbang and other insurers came into the crosshairs of regulators late last year for taking large stakes in banks and other listed companies. In February, China\u2019s insurance regulator banned the chairman and founder of Foresea Life Insurance Co.,       Yao Zhenhua,        from the sector for a decade. In April, the Communist Party\u2019s antigraft agency said it was investigating the chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission,       Xiang Junbo.Just over a year ago, Anbang appeared to epitomize China\u2019s push to invest abroad with back-to-back bids in early 2016 totaling nearly $20 billion for U.S. hotels, following its purchase of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel for nearly $2 billion in 2014.Back in China, Anbang was helping to redefine its industry by selling nontraditional types of insurance. Instead of providing long-term risk coverage, the type of insurance sold by Anbang and a number of newly formed firms resembled short-term, high-yield deposits. One popular product is known as universal life and regulators expressed concern that Anbang\u2019s reliance on raising money in this manner could cause cash-flow problems, particularly when money is borrowed from customers for a short period but invested into long-term bets like real estate.More recently, Anbang put its eye-catching deals on pause as the government worried that money was flowing out of China too haphazardly and that the insurer\u2019s preferred source of domestic funding with short-term borrowing from individuals was bringing risks to the economy.In recent months, as rumors circulated in Chinese media and among analysts that Mr. Wu and Anbang faced trouble, he was unexpectedly summoned at least once to meet with government officials, The Wall Street Journal has reported.Anbang representatives have repeatedly said operations were fine.In April, Mr. Wu took a step that analysts viewed as a move to dispel concerns about him and the company, giving an interview with the state-run Beijing News in which he expressed support for government policies while defending Anbang\u2019s international deal making. The comments appeared the same day the company\u2019s largest subsidiary, Anbang Life Insurance Co., reported that in 2016 the value of its overseas assets surpassed domestic assets, about 60% of the total 1.45 trillion yuan ($210 billion) the company had under management last year. Mr. Wu used the interview to refute suggestions the company took money out of the country by saying, \u201cAnbang\u2019s overseas investments haven\u2019t used a single penny of foreign exchange.\u201dTensions escalated the following month when Anbang found itself in a public war of words with the publishers of an investigative Chinese magazine, Caixin. In response to a report published in the magazine that questioned Anbang\u2019s transparency and capital structure, the insurer filed suit.Anbang was also grabbing unwelcome headlines overseas for talks that fell apart with Kushner Cos. over participation in a planned $7.5 billion tower in Manhattan amid an outcry over possible conflicts of interest involving the Trump administration. Kushner Cos. is owned by relatives of Mr.       Trump\u2019s       son-in-law and adviser,       Jared Kushner,        and the Chinese company was working on a deal that would underwrite the family\u2019s largest investment to date.\u2014Yifan Xie contributed to this article.Write to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com and James T.

It was unflagging Chinese demand for iron ore, coal and other commodities that kept Australian mines in business through the global financial crisis. China buys one third of Australia\u2019s exports, and Chinese tourists are the biggest spenders Down Under.Many colleges would struggle to make ends meet without Chinese students on full fees. Moreover, the country\u2019s long-term prospects have been greatly improved by an influx of Chinese migrants bringing investment and skills.Yet some Australians are fearful. Greed breeds economic dependency\u2014and, potentially, a political opportunity for Beijing to exploit.A report last week by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. and             Fairfax Media                   has stirred a public debate by mapping China\u2019s inroads into Australia\u2019s national politics and academia, as well as its Chinese-language media and student bodies.The most explosive allegation is that the Australian Security Intelligence Organization had cautioned the major political parties about receiving donations from two billionaires of Chinese descent identified as having links to the Chinese Communist Party. If true, those warnings went unheeded; the real-estate tycoons have handed out millions of dollars in political contributions.In light of Mr. Abbott\u2019s greed-and-fear formula, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that Australia finds itself grappling with impossible tensions. Its economy is now entwined with an emerging superpower with clashing political values and conflicting strategic goals. Washington is dealing with its own version of the same dilemma.So are other countries. The unsatisfactory solution is to hedge economic engagement with military deterrence. Australia is sending a powerful signal to Beijing this year by hosting a squadron of U.S. F-22 Raptor stealth fighters.The Australian predicament, however, is deepening. China, which pledges a public commitment to the principle of noninterference, is asserting its interests in countries in its neighborhood with mounting confidence. If anything, it\u2019s been emboldened by the Trump administration\u2019s lack of regard for allies, Australia included.In the wake of the investigative report,       Rory Medcalf,        the head of the National Security College at the Australian National University, wrote that \u201ca picture is emerging of excessive [Chinese] influence through money, censorship and coercion.\u201dCanberra has nodded to the concerns. \u201cJust as modern China was based on an assertion of national sovereignty, so China should always respect the sovereignty of other nations, including, of course, our own,\u201d Prime Minister       Malcolm Turnbull       told reporters.Mr. Turnbull\u2019s government is working on legislation to ban foreign donations to political parties. That would bring Australia into line with practice in the U.S., Britain and many other Western countries.Open societies are particularly susceptible to secret manipulation by authoritarian regimes\u2014one reason governments are now scrutinizing Russian attempts to affect democratic elections in the U.S. and Europe.Australia\u2019s vulnerabilities to Chinese meddling are magnified by all the factors that give it economic vitality: geographical proximity, natural endowments that so perfectly match the Asian giant\u2019s industrial requirements and, above all, migration flows.More than one million Australians claim Chinese roots; almost half were born in China. They are indispensable to Australia as bridge-builders between their adopted homeland and their ancestral one.Yet Beijing also targets them as part of a global project to construct what it calls \u201ccomprehensive national strength.\u201dPlenty of countries tap their diaspora for a similar purpose. Turkey funds dozens of expatriate groups; India looks out for its overseas kin; Israel supports Jewish organizations. No country, though, comes close to matching the size of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council, or the scale of its ambition: to win the sympathy of 48 million Chinese scattered across the globe, and mobilize them to support its political, diplomatic and military aims.Around the world, according to James Jiann Hua To, an academic authority on overseas Chinese affairs, that means co-opting Chinese newspapers and radio stations, gaining the loyalty of ethnic Chinese tycoons, summoning Chinese students to shout down anti-China protests and keeping tabs on activists critical of Beijing\u2019s human-rights practices. Australia is no exception.One voice calling for calm is former Foreign Minister       Bob Carr.       \u201cIt\u2019s an arrogant assumption,\u201d Mr. Carr writes in The Australian, \u201cthat the Chinese in Australia are so simple they can be corralled and marshaled by Chinese agents.\u201dOne of the real-estate developers named in the investigative report,       Huang Xiangmo,        used a nationalist-leaning Chinese newspaper, the Global Times, to attack the Australian media for singling out his political contributions. It was, he said, \u201cnot only racist, but also snobbish.\u201dThat\u2019s perhaps the greatest danger: a backlash against a Chinese population in a country that for decades pursued a \u201cWhite Australia Policy\u201d to keep out Asian immigrants.Write to Andrew Browne at andrew.browne@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Deep Ties to China Leave Australia in a Bind.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 23:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/australias-china-predicament-1497353692", "news_title": "Fear and Greed: Why Are Australians So Anxious About Chinese Influence?", "keywords": "abc,andrew browne,andy browne,australia,australia-china,australian brooadcasting,china's world,chinese meddling,chinese students,fairfax,four corners,infiltrating australia,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,primary metals,iron,steel,ferroalloys,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "On a day when Uber Technologies Inc. was hoping to begin piecing back together its reputation, tattered by accusations of pervasive sexism and sexual harassment, a sexist remark has instead felled board member and private-equity billionaire       David Bonderman.Mr. Bonderman, the co-founder of private-equity firm TPG, resigned from Uber\u2019s board hours after he made a disparaging remark about women during a companywide meeting on Tuesday to address problems with the ride-hailing company\u2019s workplace culture, according to a statement from him sent by TPG and Uber.His exit from Uber\u2019s board was a stunningly quick turn of events at the end of a day in which the company laid out plans to reform its work culture in the wake of a former software engineer\u2019s February blog post alleging chauvinism at the San Francisco company.TPG retains an Uber board seat and said it is working to determine who will fill the role.Mr. Bonderman\u2019s resignation is effective Wednesday.\u200b\u201cI directed a comment to my colleague and friend       Arianna Huffington       that was careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable,\u201d Mr. Bonderman said in a statement about his resignation from Uber\u2019s board. \u201cThe comment came across in a way that was the opposite of what I intended, but I understand the destructive effect it had, and I take full responsibility for that. \u201d\u200bMr. Bonderman\u2019s disparaging remark ironically came in the opening minutes of an all-hands meeting about sexual harassment, sexism and inclusion. The private-equity billionaire appeared to try to offer light humor when he interrupted fellow Uber director and media magnate Arianna Huffington, who in her remarks announced to applause the company\u2019s recent appointment of a second female board member,       Wan Ling Martello.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of data,\u201d Ms. Huffington said, \u201cthat shows when there\u2019s one woman on the board it\u2019s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board.\u201d\u201cActually,\u201d Mr. Bonderman said, \u201cwhat it shows is that it\u2019s much more likely to be more talking.\u201dThe comment drew a rebuke from Ms. Huffington, who said, \u201cOh, come on, David.\u201dIn a statement Ms. Huffington said, \u201cI appreciate David doing the right thing for Uber at this time of critical cultural changes at the company.\u201dMr. Bonderman, 74 years old, who has served on Uber\u2019s board for four years, was at Uber\u2019s San Francisco headquarters addressing employees about the results of the investigation, carried out by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder.       The probe is leading to a series of changes in management practices, and it has contributed to the departure Monday of a top executive,       Emil Michael,        and to Chief Executive       Travis Kalanick\u2019s       decision to take a leave of absence.The chairman and co-founder of private-equity firm TPG, Mr. Bonderman had apologized earlier in the day in an email to all Uber staff, saying the off-the-cuff comment was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cinappropriate,\u201d according to a copy of the email sent by a TPG spokesman. \u201cI also want to apologize to all Uber employees who were offended by the remark. I deeply regret it.\u201dMr. Bonderman\u2019s remarks at the meeting were reported earlier by Yahoo Finance.Uber recently appointed Ms. Martello, a             Nestl\u00e9 SA       executive, to the board which would make her just the second female and one of eight voting directors.Uber ordered a probe of its workplace led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and released an executive summary of the findings on Tuesday, which were presented to staff by Mr. Bonderman and Ms. Huffington, among other officials.The ride-hailing firm said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, would take an indefinite leave of absence, and it put into place recommendations from Mr. Holder\u2019s team including mandatory sensitivity training and the renaming of Chief Diversity Officer       Bernard Coleman\u2019s       title to encompass \u201cInclusion.\u201dMr. Bonderman has served on Uber\u2019s board for about four years, following TPG\u2019s investment in the company in 2013. A graduate of Harvard Law School and a Texas resident, Mr. Bonderman in 1992 co-founded TPG, one of the largest private-equity firms, known for high-profile bets on companies such as Burger King and wireless carrier Alltel Corp. In more recent years, TPG has invested in fast-growing Silicon Valley startups, including Uber and home-rental service Airbnb Inc.Aside from running TPG, Mr. Bonderman is the chairman of low-cost carrier             Ryanair Holdings                   PLC and serves on the boards of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation and the Grand Canyon Trust, among others.\u2014Matthew Jarzemsky contributed to this article.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Board Member Steps Down After Sexist Remark.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 22:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-director-david-bonderman-apologizes-for-inappropriate-comment-about-women-1497399061", "news_title": "David Bonderman Resigns From Uber Board in Wake of Disrespectful Comment", "keywords": "comment,david bonderman,female board members,pe people,resignation,resigns,talking,tpg,uber board,uber director,vc people,women,Uber Technologies,TPG,David Bonderman,Arianna Huffington,management,management moves,labor,personnel,board of directors,corporate,industrial news,workplace discrimination,political,general news,society,community,discrimination,human rights,civil liberties,social issues,women's rights,retail,wholesale,etailing,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,e-commerce,financial services,internet,online,investing,securities,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive       Travis Kalanick       said he would take an indefinite leave from the company he built into the world\u2019s most valuable startup, as the ride-hailing giant announced sweeping changes to its workplace culture in response to a series of scandals.Mr. Kalanick said in an email to Uber\u2019s 12,000 employees Tuesday that he would shift his responsibilities to 14 direct reports while he is away, stepping in only for major strategic decisions. The move by the 40-year-old co-founder creates another void in Uber\u2019s already thinning executive ranks. \u201cIf we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,\u201d Mr. Kalanick wrote.His message came just as Uber announced partial results of a nearly four-month investigation into its culture by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder\u2019s       law firm. The executive summary from Covington & Burling LLP, made public as Uber addressed staff in an all-hands meeting at its San Francisco headquarters, made broad recommendations that were approved by the company\u2019s seven-member board.The recommendations include transferring some of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s responsibilities to other managers, including a new chief operating officer position that Uber has been recruiting for but hasn\u2019t filled. The report also calls for Uber to install more independent board seats; elevate the role of the recently hired chief diversity officer, Bernard Coleman; create an oversight committee; establish leadership coaching for executives; and roll out mandatory sensitivity training for employees.The report\u2019s summary also zeroed in on aspects of a corporate culture it says reinforces exclusionary and other poor behavior. Uber\u2019s 14 cultural values, for instance, include mandates such as \u201calways be hustlin\u2019\u201d and \u201ctoe stepping.\u201d The report suggested restrictions on alcohol consumption and the use of controlled substances at the office, as well as romantic relationships among colleagues.But the summary stopped short of exposing any incidents at Uber or identifying employees. It isn\u2019t clear whether any employees will be dismissed or reprimanded as a result of the investigation, though Uber on Monday parted ways with       Emil Michael,        the chief business officer and a confidant of Mr. Kalanick, as a result of the probe, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Michael declined to comment.Tuesday\u2019s meeting with employees was clouded by a sexist remark by Uber investor and director       David Bonderman       that prompted him to resign from Uber\u2019s board later in the day. While director       Arianna Huffington       was addressing employees at the meeting about the addition of a second woman to the board, Mr. Bonderman interrupted and said, \u201cActually, what it shows is that it\u2019s much more likely to be more talking.\u201dMr. Bonderman, the billionaire founder of private-equity firm TPG Capital, later apologized for the comment, saying in an email to Uber employees that it was inappropriate and disrespectful, according to a TPG spokesman. Mr. Bonderman later said in a statement he had stepped down from the board as a result of the comment.\u201cI directed a comment to my colleague and friend Arianna Huffington that was careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable,\u201d Mr. Bonderman said in the statement. \u201cThe comment came across in a way that was the opposite of what I intended, but I understand the destructive effect it had, and I take full responsibility for that.\u201dUber is trying to repair its reputation after a damaging February blog post by former software engineer Susan Fowler Rigetti, who alleged a male-dominated workplace permissive of sexual harassment and sexism. The claims compelled Uber to hire Covington & Burling LLP to conduct an investigation, which included interviews with more than 200 employees and separate online focus groups. Ms. Fowler Rigetti left Uber in December.Some investors praised the report\u2019s recommendations as well as Mr. Kalanick\u2019s leave, saying Uber has an opportunity to change negative perceptions.\u201cThe leave should help reset Travis\u2019s greatest value to Uber,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, an investor and previous political consultant to Uber. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s focusing on innovation and growth.\u201d Investors       Mitch Kapor       and Freada Kapor Klein, who previously criticized the company\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d work culture, called the recommendations \u201cthoughtful and extensive\u201d in a statement.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s announcement that he will take a leave of absence is a surprising twist in the controversial eight-year history of Uber. The company, guided by a CEO with a pugnacious leadership style, bulldozed into new markets while battling local regulators and competitors around the world, raising over $15 billion in funding in the process. A self-described \u201chustler,\u201d Mr. Kalanick is known for instituting hard-charging business tactics and a workplace that rewarded high performers above all else. He has also ensured that all major decisions go through him, while diminishing his deputies\u2019 roles.Nonmedical leavesof absences for CEOs are rare for a company of Uber\u2019s size, employment experts say, and often leaders don\u2019t return. Mr. Kalanick also is grieving the death of his mother, who was killed last month in a boating accident that left his father seriously injured.Mr. Kalanick is protected in his position because of his share-based voting power. Along with co-founder Garrett Camp and early employee and former Uber CEO       Ryan Graves,        he has a large majority of the voting shares. The rest of the board is currently made up of insiders and investors, though Uber on Monday named         Nestl\u00e9 SA      executive Wan Ling Martello       as an independent director.In recent months, Mr. Kalanick has lost about a half-dozen direct reports and several other senior executives\u2014through resignations or firings\u2014including the leaders of operations, marketing, finance, communications and self-driving car development. Mr. Michael, whose last day was Sunday, was effectively considered Mr. Kalanick\u2019s No. 2. Uber is actively searching for financial and operating chiefs as well as a general counsel.In Mr. Kalanick\u2019s absence, Uber said it would be run by a committee of 14 executives, including the chief technology officer, regional managers and heads of legal, product, operations and other areas. The executives will be divided among four management committees overseeing business affairs, product and engineering, people and organization and legal, safety, policy and communications, Uber said.Mr. Holder\u2019s team emphasized the role of an eventual chief operating officer as a \u201cfull partner with the CEO.\u201d A former No. 2 to Mr. Kalanick,       Jeff Jones,        left in March after just six months, calling the values of Uber out of line with his own. Uber has interviewed executives for the role with public company experience, including from         Walt Disney Co.       and         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       though some have already removed their names from the running.Companies often conduct internal investigations, but rarely make them public because of liability and other concerns, say employment law experts. The situation is unique because of the public nature of Ms. Fowler Rigetti\u2019s allegations, which immediately spread on social media and were dissected for weeks in the media.Over the past several weeks, Uber workers have been summoned to the nearby San Francisco office of Covington & Burling to describe their experiences, according to employees who have been interviewed or were requested to be.Another law firm, Perkins Coie LLP, which Uber hired in part to investigate Ms. Fowler Rigetti\u2019s claims, also brought in workers for interviews. Uber said last week that it received 215 complaints out of that probe, and fired more than 20 workers as a result. That investigation continues.The probes have left many employees on edge. They say the constant questioning, looming allegations, management departures and media scrutiny have become painful distractions and threaten Uber\u2019s ability to attract talent.Some current and former employees said Tuesday they were surprised other top leaders weren\u2019t reprimanded for their roles in creating and sustaining Uber\u2019s culture.In her blog post, Ms. Fowler Rigetti said a supervisor propositioned her for sex and human-resources officials transferred her to another team instead of addressing her complaints. She said she was told she could either work for another group at the company or risk getting a poor performance review.Ms. Fowler Rigetti also alleged the company discouraged her from making complaints to human-resources officials. Managers changed her positive performance review to a poor one to deny her a promotion, she wrote. Uber fired her supervisor about five months after her initial complaints, according to people familiar with the matter. He now works at another technology firm.Ms. Fowler Rigetti, who was mentioned in both the Holder report and in the all-hands meeting, took to         Twitter               to express disappointment with the report\u2019s findings, noting she had seen illegal behavior at Uber. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten nothing but aggressive hostility from [Uber]\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s all optics.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Uber CEO Takes a Break as Scandals Roil Firm.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 22:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-to-release-findings-of-harassment-probe-on-tuesday-1497360231", "news_title": "Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to Take Leave of Absence ", "keywords": "uber,uber blog post,uber ceo leave of absence,uber ceo leaves,uber discrimination,uber harassment probe,uber investigation,uber sexual harassment,vc people,Uber Technologies,Covington & Burling,Susan Fowler Rigetti,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,retail,wholesale,etailing,legal services,business,consumer services,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       has given the Pentagon unilateral authority to send thousands of new American troops to Afghanistan at its discretion, a U.S. official said Tuesday, clearing the way for the U.S. military to intensify its fight against the Taliban and Islamic State extremists in the region.The decision to delegate control over troop decisions to the Pentagon, which is expected to be announced Wednesday, sets the stage for U.S. commanders to begin sending more forces to the country, after years of reductions made in the hope Kabul could handle internal threats on its own.Earlier Tuesday, Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the U.S. is \u201cnot winning\u201d the war in Afghanistan and that he was ready to take steps to address resurgent Taliban militants.The White House decision to cede authority to Mr. Mattis is another reflection of Mr. Trump\u2019s push to give the military wide latitude around the world. The White House has already given the Pentagon more power to carry out strikes in Yemen and Somalia.In April, Mr. Trump gave Mr. Mattis similar freedoms in Iraq and Syria when he lifted a troop cap set by his predecessor. But, unlike Iraq and Syria, the power is expected to have a bigger impact in Afghanistan, where the Pentagon could move expeditiously to send thousands of troops back into a 16-year-old war that has claimed the lives of more than 2,300 members of the U.S. military since 2001.The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan has been urging the Trump administration for months to send more troops to Afghanistan. But a decision to do so has met with resistance from some members of the administration, who are wary of being dragged back into a fight that could require more forces, firepower and money.The U.S. once had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, after then-President       Barack Obama       approved a military surge in 2009 at a time when the war against the Taliban appeared to be in danger of failure.Before leaving office, Mr. Obama declared an end to major military operations and dramatically scaled back the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. There now are fewer than 9,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, primarily to help advise and train Afghan forces, which have struggled to secure their country.The Pentagon has been weighing plans to send between 3,000 and 5,000 troops to Afghanistan. But that decision could still take weeks, the U.S. official said.Mr. Mattis, testifying Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he expected to complete a military strategy for Afghanistan by next month. That could mean a decision on troop numbers could occur simultaneously, or sometime afterward.Islamic State militants have established a foothold in Afghanistan. Last month, a massive truck bomb killed more than 150 people in Kabul, the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the Taliban were forced from power in 2001.Over the weekend, three U.S. soldiers were killed by an elite Afghan commando, raising new concerns about the reliability of the country\u2019s best trained fighters.Write to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com and Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Pentagon to Decide Afghan Force Levels.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 21:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-hands-say-over-afghan-troop-levels-to-military-1497404106", "news_title": "White House Hands Say Over Afghan Troop Levels to Military ", "keywords": "afghanistan troop levels,afghan troop levels,mattis afghanistan,pentagon afghanistan,trump afghanistan,trump pentagon,u.s. afghanistan,u.s. taliban,Taliban,Jim Mattis,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "Soupman               Inc., of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d fame, filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday, just weeks after a top company executive was indicted on charges of tax evasion.The Staten Island-based company licenses the recipes, likeness and name of Al Yeganeh, the man who inspired the \u201cSoup Nazi\u201d character in the television show.Federal prosecutors last month unsealed an indictment charging the company\u2019s chief financial officer with 20 counts of failing to pay federal income taxes, Medicare and Social Security for Soupman\u2019s employees.

He also refused to discuss the content of any conversations he had with President Trump on the subject.Mr. Sessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama and a top adviser to Mr. Trump during the campaign, spoke forcefully before the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying he needed to defend himself from \u201cscurrilous\u201d accusations.Mr. Sessions was at times combative and folksy in answering and parrying questions as he sought to dispel some of the shadows cast in part by Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony last week about the attorney general\u2019s behavior.Mr. Sessions alternated between strong denials and hazy recollections, saying he couldn\u2019t recall whether he had a passing encounter with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington or any other undisclosed interactions with Russian officials.Tuesday\u2019s hearing became heated at times, as Mr. Sessions said he didn\u2019t appreciate the \u201cinnuendo being leaked out there about me\u201d while Sen.       Ron Wyden       (D., Ore.) suggested Mr. Sessions was \u201cstonewalling\u201d by declining to answer questions about his conversations with the president.Mr. Sessions said he was protecting the president\u2019s \u201cconstitutional right\u201d to keep such conversations confidential and citing a Justice Department policy on not commenting on conversations between the attorney general and the president.Such answers didn\u2019t satisfy the Democratic senators on the committee.Sen. Martin Heinrich (D., N.M.) accused Mr. Sessions of blocking the Senate inquiry. \u201cYou took an oath,\u201d the senator said. \u201cYou raised your right hand here today and said that you would solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And now you\u2019re not answering questions. You\u2019re impeding the investigation.\u201dTestimony last week from Mr. Comey before the same panel intensified attention on Mr. Sessions\u2019 interactions with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. But he said his two meetings with Mr. Kislyak had nothing to do with the campaign. \u201cI have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. He also said he had \u201cracked my brain\u201d to see if he could recall a third meeting but couldn\u2019t.The Senate Intelligence Committee and several other congressional panels are investigating Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election. The Russian government denies that, and Mr. Trump has called the probes a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d He has said no one on his campaign coordinated with the Kremlin.The attorney general\u2019s highly anticipated testimony came after Mr. Comey portrayed Mr. Sessions as an attorney general who did little to manage a relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey that was becoming increasingly problematic. The former FBI director also hinted that there were reasons Mr. Sessions had to step away from the investigation into Russian interference in the election beyond what was publicly known.Mr. Comey\u2019s abrupt firing on May 9 set off a chain of events that led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the FBI\u2019s Russia probe.Democrats have raised questions in recent days about why Mr. Sessions recommended that the president dismiss Mr. Comey, given Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that he fired Mr. Comey at least in part because of his handling of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Russia probe.During his January confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions said he would recuse himself from any investigations involving Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent in the campaign,       Hillary Clinton.       In March, he stepped aside from any investigations into the 2016 campaign, including into Russian interference, after it emerged he hadn\u2019t disclosed two meetings with Mr. Kislyak he had during the campaign.In response to senators\u2019 questions about why he then played a role in Mr. Comey\u2019s firing, Mr. Sessions said the recusals do \u201cnot and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35,000 employees.\u201dHe added: \u201cI recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for president, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations.\u201dMr. Sessions declined to say if he had talked about Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation with Mr. Trump. And he couldn\u2019t explain the disparity between the reasons he and Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       gave for firing Mr. Comey\u2014namely the director\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation\u2014and Mr. Trump\u2019s claim in an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt that \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d played into the decision.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what was in his mind explicitly,\u201d Mr. Sessions said on Tuesday.White House officials said at the time that Mr. Trump had for months been contemplating the possibility of removing Mr. Comey, and that the dismissal wasn\u2019t connected to the Russian probe.Senators focused on a private meeting between the president and Mr. Comey that the former director described in his testimony. The meeting in February was one day after former national security adviser       Mike Flynn      was forced to resign after having misled Vice President       Mike Pence       and other Trump administration officials over the nature of Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversations in December with Mr. Kislyak.Mr. Comey had told the committee that after a meeting at the Oval Office with several top officials, the president asked the rest of the attendees, including Mr. Sessions, to depart, leaving Mr. Comey alone with Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump then asked him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn, which Mr. Trump denies.Mr. Comey said he later asked the attorney general to ensure he wouldn\u2019t be left alone with Mr. Trump again. Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t respond to that request, in Mr. Comey\u2019s telling.Mr. Comey told the committee last week: \u201cI have a recollection of him just kind of looking at me\u2026His body language gave me the sense like, \u2018What am I going to do?\u2019...He didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dIn contrast, Mr. Sessions testified Tuesday that when Mr. Comey raised concerns about being left alone with the president, he agreed with the director about the importance of handling such conversations properly and not discussing current investigations. Mr. Sessions said he encouraged Mr. Comey to \u201cabide by the well-established rules governing any communications with the White House.\u201dMr. Sessions also said there is \u201cno prohibition\u201d on private meetings between the president and the FBI director. He added that he thought Mr. Comey should have raised his conversations with Mr. Trump more explicitly with the deputy attorney general.He broadly confirmed Mr. Comey\u2019s vivid description of Mr. Trump asking everyone but the FBI director to leave the room, with Mr. Sessions being among the last to do so.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to me to be a major problem,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cI knew that Director Comey, with longtime experience in the Department of Justice, could handle himself well.\u201dWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com, Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com and Del Quentin Wilber at del.wilber@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Sessions Denounces Claims Of Collusion With Russia.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 20:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sessions-denies-meeting-russian-officials-at-mayflower-hotel-1497380680", "news_title": "Jeff Sessions Calls Russian Collusion Allegation an \u2018Appalling and Detestable Lie\u2019", "keywords": "james comey firing,jeff sessions,russia election intereference,russian ambassador, russia probe, russia probe recusal, senate intelligence committee,special counsel,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house"}, {"content": "A Fresno, Calif., man allegedly posted a copy of the movie \u201cDeadpool\u201d on his             Facebook                   page while the hit film was still in theaters, according to the U.S. Justice Department, which charged him with copyright infringement.Trevon Maurice Franklin,        21 years old, used the screen name \u201c      Tre-Von M.

He reiterated his arguments that insurance woes in many of their states gave them no choice but to act, arguments which were also touted in analyses from Mr. Trump\u2019s top health officials this week.In a speech at the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday, Vice President       Mike Pence       projected a map showing clusters of counties in Missouri, Ohio and Washington state at risk of having no individual plans available through the health law next year.Mr. Trump said he and fellow Republicans had all made a commitment to repealing Obamacare, and \u201cthat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen,\u201d the president said. \u201cI really believe they\u2019re going to be able to do it.\u201d He echoed those remarks in a brief speech in Wisconsin later Tuesday.Rep.       Greg Walden       of Oregon, who helped shepherd the party\u2019s health-care overhaul bill through the House last month, also predicted Tuesday that a final bill will pass the Senate. Speaking at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CFO Network meeting in Washington, he said a bill would land on the president\u2019s desk before the August congressional recess.And even Democrats eager to protect the law they see as a signature achievement for themselves and President       Barack Obama       continued to argue that a GOP deal could come any day. They accused Republicans of seeking to do it behind closed doors while the Democratic activist base is distracted by other controversies.Only Senate Republicans say they don\u2019t know if legislation will emerge. Asked about the future for health-care legislation at the CFO Network meeting, Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.) replied: \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think we\u2019ll know this week. If I came back next week, I think I\u2019d have a much better handle on it.\u201dIn the White House meeting with senators after media access to the lunch ended, Mr. Trump called the House health-care bill \u201cmean\u201d and said the Senate bill should be more generous, GOP aides said.The White House declined to comment on the president\u2019s remarks, saying \u201cwe aren\u2019t going to comment on rumors about private conversations that may or may not have happened.\u201dSen.       John Thune       of South Dakota, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said some senators pressed Mr. Trump at the meeting to keep making controversial payments to insurers to maintain coverage under the ACA afloat.The payments, which subsidize out-of-pocket costs for low-income consumers, are the subject of litigation brought by House Republicans who argue the administration lacks an explicit authorization to make them. At the same time, insurers have relied on the payments and say that if they are abruptly cut off, it could trigger widespread disruption in the already fragile insurance markets.\u201cThe president, I think, was open to suggestions that we have about the best way to maintain stability in the marketplace in the near term,\u201d Mr. Thune said. He added that it\u2019s not clear whether Congress would and could appropriate those funds, potentially as part of a \u201ctwo-step process\u201d alongside the health-care bill.In another move that could win over wary Republicans in tenuous insurance markets, the Senate health plan could include $15 billion in 2018 and another $15 billion in 2019 aimed at steadying them, several sources said.The money could be used to set up a system that helps reimburse insurers\u2019 losses, according to sources who said the main goal of the funding package would be to help keep premiums affordable.The plan retains a number of the ACA\u2019s taxes, which has spurred opposition lobbying from employers and some industry groups.The Senate Republicans\u2019 focus on efforts to stabilize the individual markets is considered key to creating a smooth transition from the ACA to their new plan. Insurers are closely monitoring the Senate plans and pressing for faster and more immediate financial measures to induce them to participate in the ACA\u2019s insurance exchanges next year.Senate Republicans are also considering allocating funding in September to continue the high-stakes subsidies that go to insurers, several sources said.They could seek to get temporary funding for the subsidies when Congress votes in September on an appropriation for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201cThey would appropriate cost-sharing reduction payments in a transition period,\u201d said one person familiar with the Senate Republican discussions.GOP senators have also been trying to figure out how to prevent any federal funds from covering abortion, which some argue could happen if they provide financial help for people to buy health insurance on their own if they don\u2019t get it through an employer.Provisions restricting the use of the tax credits proposed in a House bill passed last month have hit procedural hurdles in the Senate.Sen.       Ted Cruz       (R., Texas) warned on Monday that it would be \u201cvery problematic\u201d to not have abortion restrictions in place around the tax credits.The Susan B. Anthony List, a group that supports antiabortion candidates for federal office, was first signatory on a letter to the Hill late last week that said the restrictions\u2014along with a ban on Medicaid funds flowing to health providers such as Planned Parenthood who also perform abortions\u2014\u201care essential to the bill, and must be retained all the way to final passage.\u201dGOP aides said lawmakers are considering keeping the basic structure of the 2010 health-law\u2019s subsidies in place but tweaking them.The ACA subsidies, which are advance tax credits paid to insurance companies to lower the cost of health-insurance premiums, currently can\u2019t be used by insurance companies to cover the cost of abortions.But such a move risks drawing opposition from some conservatives and outside groups who already view the Senate GOP bill as too similar to the 2010 health law Republicans have vowed to repeal.\u2014Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Senate GOP Pushes to Reach Health Deal.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-republicans-consider-keeping-elements-of-aca-tax-credits-1497379187", "news_title": "Senate Republicans Push to Reach Health Deal ", "keywords": "abortion,abortion funding,aca,affordable care act,antiabortion,funding,health care law,obamacare,senate bill,tax credits,regulation,government policy,government aid,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,lower house,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Until recently, the name       Jennifer Doudna       was not widely known. Among scientists, she was recognized as a prominent biochemist. She ran her own lab, at Yale, then at the University of California, Berkeley. She made important findings, such as elucidating the three-dimensional structure of RNA, a molecular workhorse that carries genetic information and catalyzes protein synthesis in the cell. Her days revolved mainly around petri dishes and test tubes. Then along came Crispr.Crispr, an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is part of the immune system of bacteria, helping ward off attacks by viruses. Ms. Doudna and a key collaborator,       Emmanuelle Charpentier,        figured out a way to program Crispr-Cas9\u2014a tool that includes Cas9, an enzyme produced by the Crispr system\u2014to target and edit DNA in a test tube.As Ms. Doudna writes in \u201cA Crack in Creation,\u201d written with       Samuel H. Sternberg,        a biochemist and former member of her lab, Crispr will allow an organism\u2019s DNA to become \u201calmost as editable as a simple piece of text.\u201d Using Crispr, scientists will have the capacity to alter, insert and delete genes in plants, animals and, yes, humans. The discovery, published in the journal Science in 2012, set off a frenzy of interest that has not yet subsided.Suddenly Ms. Doudna seemed to be everywhere. Accepting a $3 million prize for her role in the Crispr discovery, she was photographed wearing an evening gown and standing next to the actress       Cameron Diaz.       She and Ms. Charpentier appeared on Time magazine\u2019s list of the 100 most influential people. She joined then-Vice President       Joe Biden       on the dais at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and talked about Crispr\u2019s potential for finding cures for cancer. There had been gene-editing tools before Crispr, but none had caught on in quite the same way. Crispr will permit scientists to make changes in many genes at the same time, and it is easier, cheaper and faster to use.By Jennifer A. Doudna and Samuel H. Sternberg  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 281 pages, $28In 2015 Ms. Doudna organized a meeting in Napa, Calif., attended mainly by scholars and scientists, to debate whether Crispr should be used to perform so-called human germ-line editing, a process that involves changes to sperm, egg or embryo. Scientists remain excited by the potential for using Crispr to edit genetic mutations and treat diseases: In one lab recently, for instance, researchers corrected a gene mutation that causes sickle-cell anemia in humans and transferred the edited cells to mice, the first step toward finding a cure for the condition. But it is quite another thing to edit the germ line\u2014that is, to make changes that would be passed on to future offspring. Would it be permissible, Ms. Doudna asks, to lower an unborn child\u2019s risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease? If so, would it also be permissible to edit for greater intelligence or athleticism or even, say, for a particular hair color? While all such uses would ultimately require regulatory and institutional review, it is the notion of building a social consensus that is particularly fraught.Scientific discussions, Ms. Doudna acknowledges, too often take place behind closed doors. Long before the public even realizes what is happening, scientists \u201cdefine the terms of the debate,\u201d she notes. By then, it may be too late for the public to have any influence. In the most interesting chapters of \u201cA Crack in Creation,\u201d Ms. Doudna wrestles with her ambivalence about the tool she has helped create. She concludes that she no longer feels comfortable operating inside her \u201cfamiliar scientific bubble\u201d: She must take on a role as a public citizen and address not just the power of gene editing but the ethics of it. At stake, she believes, is \u201cnothing less than the future of our world.\u201dIt is hard not to applaud this conviction, and \u201cA Crack in Creation\u201d does contribute to a public understanding of Crispr, explaining science in terms that are understandable for a general reader. There are fascinating peeks inside the operations of a lab, where certain decisions can be \u201cdriven more by convenience than by preference,\u201d as Ms. Doudna writes. In the experiment at the heart of the seminal Crispr paper, the researchers decided to target a spot in a jellyfish\u2019s DNA simply because they happened to have the gene available for immediate use in their freezers and didn\u2019t want to delay their work any longer in the rush to write the paper.The debates surrounding Crispr are not only scientific and ethical. They also include a patent battle over who controls the intellectual property of the discovery. Money has poured into Crispr-focused companies, including three that Ms. Doudna helped found and from which she may profit. To her credit, she doesn\u2019t hide these facts, but she doesn\u2019t delve into them much either. She calls the patent dispute\u2014between a group led by her institution, Berkeley, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard\u2014\u201ca disheartening twist\u201d but stops there.Indeed, \u201cA Crack in Creation\u201d offers little insight into how the human side of science\u2014fights over credit, the potential for profit, a desire for recognition\u2014may affect the presentation or analysis of data. Nor does Ms. Doudna discuss how it feels to be at the center of a scientific rivalry or what toll the patent fight may have taken on her relationships with fellow scientists. When it comes to sharing her personal feelings, Ms. Doudna often seems to hold back.Ethical discourse regarding Crispr or any other scientific breakthrough requires full disclosure and mutual trust. At one point, Ms. Doudna describes the divide between her personal and professional lives\u2014her neighbors and the parents of her son\u2019s friends on one side, scientific specialists on the other. As she notes, it is at the intersection of these worlds that a candid conversation about Crispr and its ramifications must take place. \u201cA Crack in Creation\u201d is an important start, but there is still more to know\u2014not only about Crispr but also about the views of all those who will be affected by it.Ms. Dockser Marcus is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Boston.Appeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'The Ethics Of Gene Editing.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ethics-of-gene-editing-1497395330", "news_title": "The Ethics of Gene Editing", "keywords": "book review,Jennifer Doudna,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,health,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,reviews,biotechnology,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "A New York police officer was indicted\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0for allegedly transporting more than a kilogram of cocaine for money, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said.Nysia Stroud, a 29-year-old officer with the New York Police Department\u2019s Fleet Services Division, moved the cocaine, as well as marijuana, for an undercover officer posing as a drug trafficker, prosecutors said.Officer Stroud pleaded not guilty in state court in Manhattan. Her attorney, Alex Grosshtern, said Officer Stroud \u201cvehemently denies the allegations.\u201d An NYPD spokesman said she was suspended without pay.\u201cAs alleged, this type of criminal behavior erodes trust in law enforcement, making it harder for every police officer to do their job,\u201d said NYPD Commissioner James P.

Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen\u2019s       term runs through January, and President       Donald Trump      didn\u2019t rule out her reappointment in an April interview.Ms. Yellen\u2019s reappointment isn\u2019t an outcome many observers expect because of Mr. Trump\u2019s fierce criticism of her during the final weeks of last year\u2019s presidential campaign. But his willingness to consider her speaks to the amicable relationship they have forged since Mr. Trump took office, observers say.Since taking office, the president and his advisers haven\u2019t publicly questioned the Fed\u2019s actions\u2014including its decision to raise short-term interest rates in March. The Fed has also signaled it is likely to raise rates again at its two-day meeting that concludes Wednesday.An alternative to Ms. Yellen could be Mr. Cohn, who became Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser after a 26-year career at             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       Mr. Cohn has emerged as a key intermediary in the administration\u2019s relationship with the central bank.When publicly asked if he is interested in the Fed job, Mr. Cohn and other White House officials have said he is focused on his current job. But former colleagues said he has cultivated an appreciation for the power of the Fed during his long career on Wall Street and for the institution\u2019s relative freedom during his current stint in Washington.While Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 criticisms of Ms. Yellen suggested the central bank would face a rough time with the new administration, the president and Ms. Yellen are off to a surprisingly smooth start.Weeks after his inauguration, Mr. Trump held court with Ms. Yellen in the Oval Office. Seated behind the office\u2019s Resolute desk, he told her she was doing a good job, according to people familiar with the exchange. Ms. Yellen sat across from Mr. Trump in a chair next to Mr. Cohn, who arranged the meeting.The Republican president told Ms. Yellen he considered her, like himself, a \u201clow-interest-rate\u201d person, those familiar with the exchange said. During a conversation that lasted about 15 minutes, they discussed how economic policy might help the millions of U.S. citizens who felt left behind during the postcrisis recovery.Mr. Trump\u2019s April comments marked a reversal from last year, when he accused Ms. Yellen of keeping rates low to help Democrats.Mr. Trump and his administration have, so far, opted to stay neutral in public on Fed decisions, a contrast to his administration\u2019s criticisms of other nonpartisan institutions such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Congressional Budget Office and the courts.\u201cThe Fed will do what they need to do, and we respect the powers of the Fed,\u201d Mr. Cohn said in a March interview on Fox News, one of his rare public comments on the central bank.Mr. Trump wants a fast-growing economy, and that means he won\u2019t want the Fed raising interest rates so aggressively that it thwarts any boom. Ms. Yellen, for her part, wants to preserve the independence of an institution that faces more political hostility than at any time in a generation.On paper, the White House and the Fed appear headed for a collision. The president wants to raise the economy\u2019s annual growth rate to at least 3%, but Fed officials think demographic trends and slow productivity growth mean the economy can grow sustainably at around a 2% rate.With the unemployment rate at 4.3%, the Fed would likely accelerate interest-rate increases if Mr. Trump\u2019s administration took steps to lift growth in a way that simply boosted short-term demand. This hasn\u2019t been a problem yet because Mr. Trump\u2019s administration hasn\u2019t managed to move its agenda through Congress.\u2018There was a lot of uncertainty about how this was going to play out. I would say, \u2018So far, so good.\u2019 \u2019Some observers caution against reading much into Mr. Trump\u2019s silence on Fed policy because the central bank hasn\u2019t done anything to upset the administration.Stocks have moved to record highs while federal borrowing costs have fallen. A likely Fed move Wednesday would lift its benchmark rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%, a very low level historically.But if the Fed takes action Mr. Trump perceives to be threatening, he could become more vocal, said Peter Conti-Brown, a financial historian at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.\u201cThe minute that \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 has a report about a Fed action that could harm Donald Trump, set an egg timer and see how long before he tweets,\u201d Mr. Conti-Brown said.Though Mr. Trump and Ms. Yellen were born two months apart in neighboring boroughs of New York City, they couldn\u2019t be more different.One, from Queens, is the brash celebrity developer who relies heavily on his gut, professes little interest in academic expertise and brings a deep skepticism of established institutions to Washington.The other, from Brooklyn, is a risk-averse economist who prepares meticulously for speeches and meetings, has vacationed with suitcases full of books and has spent her career in the halls of academia and central banking.Their placid relationship reflects Mr. Cohn\u2019s leading role. Ms. Yellen meets regularly with Mr. Cohn and Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin,        who also spent much of his career at Goldman Sachs.Mr. Cohn has emphasized to colleagues the importance to markets of not publicly second-guessing monetary-policy decisions, following a rule established in the Democratic administration of former President       Bill Clinton       by another Goldman-executive-turned-presidential-counselor, Robert Rubin, who later became Treasury secretary.Mr. Cohn takes pride in convincing Mr. Trump of the economic benefits of respecting the Fed\u2019s independence, including not firing off verbal or Twitter attacks on the central bank, according to people who have discussed the issue with him.Mr. Trump can put his stamp on the institution by filling three open seats on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board of governors.The Fed chairman and vice chairman jobs come open next year. Many Wall Street and Washington observers expect Mr. Trump to select his own candidate for the top job, possibly Mr. Cohn.Mr. Cohn knows several central-banking officials from their time at Goldman Sachs, including New York Fed President       William Dudley,        the bank\u2019s former chief economist, who met with Mr. Cohn in the early weeks of the administration.All of this comes at a time when the Fed is facing the most intense political scrutiny in decades. The financial crisis and its aftermath prompted lawmakers to debate monetary policy in a way not seen since       Paul Volcker       was Fed chairman in the 1980s.The harshest criticism has come from congressional Republicans. Many resented the Fed\u2019s extraordinary measures to boost economic growth long after the 2007-09 recession, with ultralow borrowing costs making former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       deficits smaller than forecast.Republican lawmakers also said the Fed worked too closely with Mr. Obama\u2019s Democratic administration and Democrats in Congress to overhaul postcrisis regulation through the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.Some vitriol aimed at the Fed may ease once Mr. Trump makes his appointments, senior White House officials said.Fed officials have defended the regulations. \u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished a lot. We have a much safer system,\u201d Ms. Yellen told graduate students in Ann Arbor, Mich., in April.Some White House officials believe Dodd-Frank gave the Fed too much power. They are preparing to nominate a Fed vice chairman for bank supervision, Randal Quarles, who served in the Treasury Department of former GOP President       George W. Bush,        who could favor a lighter touch.White House officials also have expressed reservations internally over the Fed\u2019s postcrisis purchases of mortgage-backed securities\u2014one of the extraordinary measures it took to stimulate growth. Some critics said the purchases amounted to fiscal policy by determining the allocation of credit in the economy. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is considering nominating Marvin Goodfriend, a respected monetary economist who has articulated those reservations, to the Fed board.These concerns haven\u2019t been aired publicly by the administration, in contrast with Mr. Trump\u2019s comments during last year\u2019s election, when he said Ms. Yellen should be \u201cashamed of herself\u201d for keeping rates low.\u201cThere was a lot of uncertainty about how this was going to play out,\u201d said       Donald Kohn,        a former Fed vice chairman who met with Mr. Cohn in February. \u201cI would say, \u2018So far, so good.\u2019\u201dWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com and Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Search for Fed Chief Begins, Led by Goldman Veteran.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beneath-the-uneasy-peace-between-donald-trump-and-janet-yellen-1497346203", "news_title": "Wall Street Veteran Leads Search for Next Fed Chief", "keywords": "donald trump,fed,fed announcement,federal reserve,federal reserve chairman,fed rate,fed rate hike,janet yellen,Federal Reserve,Janet Yellen,Gary Cohn,Donald Trump,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Another school year, another accolade for New York City\u2019s Success Academy Charter Schools.On Monday Success Academy was awarded the Broad Prize for Public Charter Schools. A press release noted that the Success schools \u201cdemonstrated the best overall academic performance while closing achievement gaps and serving low-income students and students of color.\u201d Liberals insist that the learning gap between white students and their black and Hispanic peers stems primarily from poverty and racial segregation, but the track record of Success Academy challenges both notions.Students at Success schools, the first of which opened in 2006, are chosen by lottery. Detractors complain that charter schools teach more-motivated students, but random-assignment studies that control for self-selection bias have found that charter students tend to outperform their counterparts in traditional public schools and are more likely to finish college. Today, there are 41 Success schools serving 41,000 K-12 students\u201476% of whom are poor and 93% black or Hispanic. In 2016, for the eighth consecutive year, Success schools were among the highest performing in New York state. Ninety-four percent of Success students eligible to take state tests were proficient in math, and 82% were proficient in English\u2014both more than double the statewide average.\u201cIn 2016, black and Hispanic students at Success Academy, on average, performed better than their white peers across the entire state of New York and low-income students performed better, on average, than their non-low-income peers across the state at both the Proficient and Advanced levels in all three tested subjects\u2014English, math and science,\u201d according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Similarly, Success students with disabilities and English-language learners outperformed students without disabilities and native English speakers, respectively, providing more evidence that charters not only accept such students but do a superior job of teaching them.In other words, Success Academy and its tireless leader,       Eva Moskowitz,        have brought to urban ghettos the high-quality education normally found in affluent suburban communities. She\u2019s proving that children reared in the most difficult circumstances\u2014engulfed in chaos and exposed daily to all manner of antisocial behavior\u2014are capable of not merely learning but thriving academically. And we know that children who succeed in school have a better chance of escaping those circumstances and leading productive lives.For her troubles, however, Ms. Moskowitz has been vilified. Mayor       Bill de Blasio,        a progressive Democrat who professes deep concern for underprivileged minorities, is hell-bent on stopping the spread of charter schools in general and Success schools in particular. In the meantime, the waiting list swells. The New York Post reported in April that the Success network has received more than 17,000 applications for about 3,000 openings next year. It\u2019s the third straight year the waiting list has exceeded 10,000.That charters are a boon for inner-city blacks is difficult to refute on the merits, but the merits matter less to politicians like Mr. de Blasio than the support of teachers unions. Charter schools typically have little use for union labor, which is why labor groups like the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association so strenuously resist their creation and expansion. The preferences of union leaders are more important to the political left than the preferences of black and brown parents.In a better world, Success Academy\u2019s empirically proven education model\u2014along with those of previous Broad Prize charter network recipients such as KIPP, Uncommon Schools and YES Prep\u2014would also inform the continuing debate over classroom racial diversity. Actually, it\u2019s not much of a debate at all. Many high-performing charter schools are criticized for a lack of racial balance, and the implicit assumption of critics is that racism is the motivating factor. The reality is that charter operators like Ms. Moskowitz locate in communities where the need for better education choices is most pronounced, and based on the high demand for admission, the residents want them there. The racial composition of the schools is incidental.Evidence that classroom diversity has a significant impact on academic outcomes is far from overwhelming, and the busing disaster of the 1970s demonstrated the perils of forced integration. On the other hand, proof that predominantly black schools can excel academically is ample, and it predates today\u2019s high-performing charter schools by several decades. During the       Jim Crow       era, students at one black public high school in Washington, D.C., regularly performed as well or better on standardized tests than the city\u2019s top white high schools, and sent most graduates to college.That\u2019s not a call for segregated learning, but it does suggest that other factors may matter more to academic success than seating black and white students next to one another.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nothing-succeeds-like-success-academy-1497396932", "news_title": "Nothing Succeeds Like Success Academy", "keywords": "charter school,eva moskowitz,success academy,teachers unions,trump,political,general news,society,community,education,ethnic minorities,school,social issues,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. isn\u2019t for sale.After announcing plans earlier this year to explore a potential deal, Chief Executive       Karen Katz       said Tuesday the talks have ended and the luxury department store chain has the right strategy to go it alone.\u201cWe believe that we can deliver better shareholder value by remaining an independent retailer,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cAny discussions about a partial or full sale of the company have been terminated.\u201dThe Wall Street Journal reported in March that Saks Fifth Avenue parent             Hudson\u2019s Bay Co.

Last week, the Journal reported that the talks had collapsed after the parties couldn\u2019t agree on a price, according to people familiar with the situation.Ms. Katz said Neiman Marcus is continuing to invest in e-commerce, which accounts for a third of total sales. The company is building an analytics team to better target potential customers, and is tackling the issue of how to offer better service online. \u201cWe are committed to investing in new technology so we can remain a leader in the online luxury business,\u201d Ms. Katz said.The upscale retailer nevertheless continues to face significant challenges, including nearly $5 billion in debt piled on through two leveraged buyouts, and softer demand for luxury goods.On Tuesday, Neiman Marcus reported that sales for the three months through April 29 fell 4.9% to $1.11 billion.The company had a net loss of $24.9 million compared with a quarterly profit of $3.8 million a year earlier.In April, Neiman\u2019s owners\u2014Ares Management LP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board\u2014chose to issue new debt to cover interest payments through Oct. 14.

If lawmakers passed such a plan, it would supercharge the economy and create millions of jobs.The challenge is how to get from here to there, given the rules of Congress.Tax reform can be enacted with a simple majority in the Senate under the process known as budget reconciliation\u2014but only if various complicated procedures are followed. One of these, called the Byrd rule after the late Sen. Robert Byrd, says that bills passed under reconciliation cannot increase the deficit outside of the budget window\u2014traditionally 10 years.The practical result? Tax cuts passed under reconciliation magically disappear in year 11, like Cinderella\u2019s carriage turning into a pumpkin at midnight. That is why the Bush tax cuts, passed in 2001, would have ceased to exist in 2011 had they not been temporarily extended for two years. Some parts then were made permanent in 2013.But any tax reform meant to spur economic growth should be permanent so that corporations and entrepreneurs can plan ahead. If they don\u2019t know what the rules will be a few years down the road, it is tougher to build factories, hire new workers, invest in equipment, or spend on research and development.Conventional wisdom says that the only way to pass lasting tax cuts is to offset them with corresponding tax increases, base broadening or, best of all, permanent spending cuts.There\u2019s another option: Extend the budget window to 25 years\u2014or longer. The 10-year window is not set in stone. The Budget Act of 1974 simply says that the window has to be at least five years in duration.The idea of modifying the time frame isn\u2019t new, and it certainly isn\u2019t radical. The budget window was expanded in fiscal year 1995 from five years to seven. Congress used the 10-year window for the first time in 2000, but then went back to five years again as recently as 2007.We say extend the budget window to 25 years. Why? Because the people creating jobs and investing in new products think long-term. Depreciation schedules for new plant and equipment often run to 25 years or more.Lawmakers simply should write this year\u2019s budget to say that all tax cuts can last 25 years, which would allow rate reductions to go into effect now and be offset later with revenue from higher growth or spending restraint.If Congress is serious about boosting the economy, it should pass a net tax cut within the extended 25-year budget window. As President       Trump       says, \u201cprime the pump\u201d now and the economy will start to flow, creating millions of jobs and more tax money for Washington.Fortunately for taxpayers, Sen.       Pat Toomey       (R., Pa.) has taken the lead in promoting this pathway to recovery. \u201cNothing in the law prevents us from using a 20- or even 30-year timeframe,\u201d Mr. Toomey wrote in an op-ed last month. \u201cA 20- or 30-year tax reform would be as close to permanent as we can get since Congress would be likely to overhaul the tax code within that period anyway.\u201dThis brings to mind the classical story of the Gordian knot. It was a knot so complicated that legend said the man who could untie it would go on to rule all of Asia. That man was Alexander the Great, who didn\u2019t wrestle with the knot as all the others had but picked up his sword and cut it in two, causing it to unravel.That\u2019s what Mr. Toomey wants to do. Extending the budget window to 25 years would cut the Gordian knot, unravel the Byrd rule, and allow serious tax reform to create millions of jobs in the years to come.Mr. Norquist is the president of Americans for Tax Reform.

Net farm income has fallen by half since 2013, and commodity prices across the board are below the cost of production. This is especially detrimental given the number of jobs agriculture provides our economy. Direct on-farm employment accounted for 2.6 million American jobs in 2015, and another 18.4 million jobs were supported by agriculture, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.The U.S. should consider expanding the agricultural market in its backyard: Cuba. Less than 100 miles south of Florida, Cuba imports nearly 80% of its food annually, from countries like Vietnam and New Zealand, including about 400,000 tons of rice. But being closer to Cuba geographically, the U.S. has the comparative advantage here and could provide cheaper, better-quality goods in hours instead of weeks.But the       Trump       administration may be taking a step in the opposite direction. For the past several months, the White House has been reviewing its trade policy with Cuba, and a major announcement is expected Friday. Early reports foretell a rollback of       Obama      -era policies that relaxed U.S. restrictions on the island nation. While the move may appease Cold War-era hawks and the minority of Cuban-Americans who still support the embargo, the American business community, agriculture in particular, needs access to Cuba\u2019s market.There is a better way forward that satisfies both parties without repealing the embargo or changing its structure: allow agricultural goods to be sold on credit through private financing. Currently the U.S. trades agricultural goods with Cuba, but there are restrictions that limit trade to cash-only transactions. Considering that nearly all international trade relies on credit, this policy puts American farmers on the sidelines while competitors like Brazil and China enjoy Cuba\u2019s $2.4 billion market.Two bills under consideration right now, the Cuba Agricultural Exports Act in the House and the Agricultural Export Expansion Act in the Senate, would remove the credit restriction and allow private financing of agricultural exports. President Trump\u2019s secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, expressed his support for trade on credit with Cuba during his Senate confirmation hearing in March. Producers from Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Texas and other states would be the first to benefit directly from this change.If there ever was a time for this bill to move, it is now. Agriculture is a crucial part of rural states\u2019 economies. The most important thing that can be done now for American agriculture is to open new markets for U.S. products.Following       Fidel Castro\u2019s       death in November, President-elect Trump said, \u201cOur administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.\u201d He also has promised time and again to bring back American jobs and \u201cmake America great again.\u201dAllowing agricultural trade on credit would be a good compromise: Those who support the Cuba embargo should be able to get on board. The Trump administration would accomplish a bilateral trade deal that supplies the Cuban people with high-quality food. And all of this can be done while supporting rural American jobs\u2014an undeniable victory for the Trump White House.Messrs.

But the plan hit a snag. They needed to obtain a \u201ccertificate of need\u201d from Georgia\u2019s Department of Community Health. Three large hospitals in the area\u2014which provide similar services at far higher cost\u2014blocked their application. Dr. Ribot and Dr. Barfield are now suing the state for restraint of trade.Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia have certificate-of-need laws governing the construction of new medical facilities. These laws give favorable treatment to major medical centers and other existing hospitals by limiting competition. Result: higher prices for patients.In the 1960s, when the certificate-of-need concept appeared, health-care delivery was different than it is today. Indigent patients were often treated in charity and teaching hospitals, which relied on paying patients to keep them viable. That changed in 1964. Thanks to Medicare and Medicaid, hospitals got paid for taking care of the poor.Health costs were escalating, but policy makers and economists misdiagnosed the cause, pinning the blame for price inflation on excess capacity. In New York, the hospital industry petitioned the state for protection. Without a certificate-of-need law, they claimed, competitors would lure away established hospitals\u2019 paying patients, leaving them to act only as a safety net for the destitute. The result, they said, would be financial ruin. Other states soon followed suit.So did Congress. The National Health Planning and Resource Development Act of 1974 gave states with certificate-of-need programs additional federal health-care dollars. By 1982 every state except Louisiana was on board. Certificate-of-need laws eventually expanded to cover not only hospitals but a wide range of facilities, including imaging centers and outpatient surgery centers.It didn\u2019t take long for Washington to realize that certificate-of-need laws weren\u2019t bringing prices down. The federal program was abolished in 1986, and 14 states subsequently scrapped their certificate-of-need programs. But hospital associations across the country work hard to maintain the market advantage that certificate-of-need laws provide, spending millions of dollars to lobby state legislators to block reform.Their claims don\u2019t add up. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University has shown that Virginia, which has a certificate-of-need law, has 131 fewer hospital beds per 100,000 people than those without such laws. Certificate-of-need states also have 30% fewer rural hospitals and 13% fewer rural ambulatory surgery centers.Big hospital associations in certificate-of-need states falsely claim that limiting competition improves access to care. In fact, according to Mercatus the quality of care in these states is worse. In particular, deaths from treatable complications following surgery, as well as mortality from heart failure, pneumonia and heart attacks are higher in certificate-of-need states. Certificate-of-need programs also fail to constrain hospital costs, which are higher in states with such laws on the books.Finally, the claim that hospitals will be financially ruined by their obligations to charity without the protections afforded by certificate-of-need laws is unsupportable. There is no difference in the provision of charity care between states with and without such programs.Certificate-of-need laws are a remnant of a failed theory of government health-care planning. Their only purpose today is to restrict competition and protect the big hospitals\u2019 local monopolies. The federal government, which played a central role in creating this problem, could help solve it by making Medicaid block grants contingent on repeal of certificate-of-need laws.So long as these harmful laws continue to prevent health-care providers like Dr. Ribot and Dr. Barfield from expanding the services they offer, health-care costs will continue to rise. Ultimately, it is patients who pay the price.Dr. Scherz is an Atlanta urologist and the founder and secretary of the Docs 4 Patient Care Foundation.Appeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-regulation-that-protects-big-hospital-monopolies-1497396023", "news_title": "A Regulation That Protects Big-Hospital Monopolies", "keywords": "big government,certificate of need,free market,health care,monopoly,Georgia's Department of Community Health,anti-competition issues,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,medical treatments,procedures,commentaries,opinions,life sciences"}, {"content": "Uncle Sam is getting pushed around by the rest of the world, and we aren\u2019t going to take it anymore. That is the gist of President       Trump\u2019s       \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine. But let\u2019s cut No.\u00a045 some slack. He is not the first to chop away at the made-in-the-USA global order designed by       Harry S. Truman       70 years ago. Pride of place must go to No. 44,       Barack Obama.What, that exemplar of internationalist virtue? True, President Obama did not trumpet \u201cAmerica First.\u201d His standard shibboleth was \u201cIt\u2019s time for a little nation-building at home,\u201d echoing       George McGovern\u2019s       \u201cCome home, America!\u201d from 1972. Let\u2019s lay down the burden and mend crumbling bridges and failing schools, Mr. Obama suggested. Cut to Mr. Trump, who wants to invest $1 trillion in the domestic infrastructure.Come home or To hell with you\u2014either way, the message reads: The world\u2019s housekeeper will now look out for No. 1. So Mr. Trump keeps bullying the allies on defense spending, demanding zillions in back pay for the security the U.S. has always delivered at a discount. Now listen to Mr. Obama. In a 2016 interview with the Atlantic, he rumbled: \u201cfree riders aggravate me.\u201dMr. Trump hasn\u2019t brought the boys home, but Mr. Obama did. He drew down the European force to about 50,000 from 75,000. During the 1980s, it numbered 350,000. That was supposed to be accompanied by the fabled \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia, but it didn\u2019t materialize. Instead Mr. Obama presided over a global retraction, most grievously in Iraq. Then, refusing to enforce his \u201cred line\u201d in Syria, Mr. Obama invited Russia in and effectively welcomed Iran, too. Turning away from old allies, he chased the will-o\u2019-the-wisp of Iranian friendship. In Mr. Obama\u2019s view, paraphrased by the Atlantic\u2019s       Jeffrey Goldberg,        \u201cthe Middle East is no longer terribly important to American interests.\u201d Meanwhile, Tehran has expanded to the Mediterranean.The Obama agenda was self-containment, a first in the history of great powers. So who would mind the global store, as the U.S. had done since 1945? Under Mr. Obama, \u201cYes, we can\u201d segued into \u201cOthers will.\u201d Moscow, Tehran and Beijing did, but not as retainers of Aloof America. Rising powers have never seen a vacuum they did not like.Set aside Mr. Trump\u2019s in-your-face tweets and savor the kinship between Donald the Crude and Barack the Cool. Each in his own way\u2014softly or brutally\u2014has signaled: America, previously the \u201cindispensable nation,\u201d is vacating its penthouse at the top of the global hierarchy. No great power has ever done so voluntarily; all America\u2019s predecessors were sent packing by more-muscular competitors.Yes, but doesn\u2019t Mr. Trump want to \u201cmake America great again\u201d? First, this is a mendacious slogan. By any measure, America was not a limping giant on Jan. 20 but the greatest power on earth, given its economic primacy, military clout, diplomatic centrality and, not to forget, cultural sway. The world dresses, watches, listens and dances American. Some has-been!Second, what makes a nation \u201cgreat\u201d? Mr. Trump thinks it is unbridled national egotism, flanked by the extended middle finger, as when he withdrew from the nonbinding Paris climate accord. Promptly, China began to posture as the guardian of global goodness. Another great victory was pushing aside the leader of tiny Montenegro at the NATO summit\u2019s photo-op last month.The short take on Trumpist diplomacy: A schoolyard bully is never elected class president. The other kids may fear him, but they won\u2019t follow him. Leadership means taking care of others while going to the top. It comes from authority grounded in consent, not humiliation of the weak.Still, America\u2019s slide into abdication began in 2009, not in 2017. What made America great after World War II? Sheer clout, at first. So why did the Pax Americana endure while Europe and Japan rose from the ruins and China grew into the world\u2019s second-biggest economy? Because of the genius of pre-Obama, pre-Trump diplomacy: Achieve your own ends not by going mano-a-mano, but by serving the interests of others in the process, like safeguarding security and the liberal trading order.\u201cToo expensive!\u201d trumpets No. 45. Let\u2019s consult No. 33, President Truman: \u201cWhich is better for the country,\u201d he asked with a view to Europe, \u201cto spend 20 or 30 billion dollars to keep the peace, or to do as we did in 1920 and then have to spend 100 billion dollars for four years to fight a war?\u201dIn World War II, U.S. defense outlays peaked at 41% of gross domestic product. Today, the cost of empire has come down to 3.6%\u2014a steal. So the Europeans spend only 1.5% on average? Global powers always pay more for defense; that\u2019s part of what makes them great. The U.S. is not doing the European Union a favor by adding its own weight to an Atlantic order that doubles as the world\u2019s largest trade and investment relationship. The insurance premium is worth it, especially given       Vladimir Putin\u2019s       blatant strategic ambitions.Do good for yourself by doing good for others\u2014that has been the secret of America\u2019s realpolitik and exalted position. While Mr. Obama wielded hammer and chisel against the nation\u2019s perch, Mr. Trump is waving a chain saw. As friends retract, rivals rejoice: What a windfall!

But its leadership turmoil shows the perils of moving from Silicon Valley darling to durable success, especially if it wants to tap public markets for capital anywhere close to its $68 billion valuation.Uber said Tuesday that CEO       Travis Kalanick       will take an indefinite leave from the company he built, a day after chief business officer       Emil Michael       stepped down. The moves followed a unanimous vote by Uber\u2019s board\u2014which consists of private investors\u2014to adopt reforms to its \u201cworkplace culture.\u201d The San Francisco-based startup enlisted former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder\u2019s       law firm Covington & Burling after several women complained that Uber executives ignored sexual-harassment allegations.Workplace culture often flows from the top, and the internal analysis seeks to correct lapses in executive judgment. In 2014 Mr. Michael floated a plan to dig up details about the private lives of journalists critical of the company. Earlier this year Mr. Kalanick was caught on camera berating a driver.Yet Uber would never have achieved what it has if not for Mr. Kalanick\u2019s hard-charging attitude. The company has had to break through regulatory barriers backed by the taxi lobby in city after city, and it didn\u2019t do that by bowing at the first sign of resistance. Uber\u2019s innovation has greatly improved the lives of millions of urban travelers, and that breakthough has in turn invited competitors like Lyft, Via and Gett. There\u2019s no guarantee that Uber will emerge as the             Facebook                   of this pack.But Uber\u2019s hardball tactics also present business risks. Last year the California DMV pulled the registration on Uber\u2019s self-driving cars because the company didn\u2019t obtain a $150 permit to test its vehicles. Twenty other car manufacturers had obtained permits, but Uber didn\u2019t see the need. It finally conceded to apply for a permit in March. The Justice Department is also investigating Uber\u2019s use of \u201cgreyball\u201d software to evade regulators in jurisdictions where it wasn\u2019t authorized to operate.Uber is the dominant ride-hailing app in most U.S. cities because private investors bankrolled its rapid expansion with recruitment bonuses for drivers. A high concentration of drivers in cities reduces rider wait times while heavy customer traffic deters drivers\u2014in effect free agents\u2014from defecting to other apps.Millennials are fickle customers, and a drop in ridership could divert drivers to competing apps. This would make it harder for Uber to raise capital to sustain its huge losses ($2.8 billion last year) as it expands. Investors who may have tolerated Uber\u2019s earlier blunders because of its growth potential will draw a line when management failures impair the company\u2019s performance and profitability.Consider the lawsuit by Google\u2019s self-driving startup Waymo that accuses former employee       Anthony Levandowski       of lifting trade secrets before joining Uber. Last month federal Judge       William Alsup       referred the case to prosecutors after declaring that the evidence that Mr. Levandowski pilfered Waymo\u2019s technology was highly incriminatory. Uber has denied colluding with Mr. Levandowski. But even if Uber isn\u2019t found complicit in the alleged piracy, the judge could bar it from using any cribbed code or technology. This would be a major setback in Silicon Valley\u2019s autonomous car race.All of this explains why investors are shaking up Uber\u2019s management, but that also carries risks.       Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s       collaboration with       Mark Zuckerberg       worked for Facebook, but       John Scully       clashed with       Steve Jobs       when he arrived at Apple from Pepsi. Jobs left Apple but returned to revive it with a new burst of innovation. One certainty: Uber won\u2019t survive the ride-sharing shakeout if the lawyers at Covington & Burling are in charge.One question for capitalism is whether Uber\u2019s shakeup would have occurred sooner if it had already braved public equity markets. Two decades ago startups went public much earlier in their business cycle. But Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory demands have made going public far more costly, and even successful tech startups tend to delay listing shares on exchanges. Public markets are sensitive to losses and bad publicity, so they can be as useful for disciplining managers as they are for rewarding investors.The only story the business press likes better than a glorious startup is an inglorious failure, so Mr. Kalanick is now getting a rough ride. But he\u2019s built an innovative business that fulfills a public need, and Uber\u2019s investors had better hope his replacement is as good a manager as Mr. Kalanick has been an entrepreneur.Appeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-growing-pains-1497395888", "news_title": "Uber\u2019s Growing Pains", "keywords": "Uber Technologies,Travis Kalanick,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,editorials,retail,wholesale,etailing,legal services,business,consumer services,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "Jonathan Downey,        founder of enterprise drone services provider Airware, is stepping aside as chief executive later this month.Airware Chief Operating Officer       Yvonne Wassenaar       will take over as CEO on June 26.

With an estimated 500 fighters controlling part of the town, the siege continues to take a heavy toll on civilians. But there is some good news from the past week: U.S. troops and planes are on the scene offering \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d to the Philippine armed forces.This is an embarrassment for President       Rodrigo Duterte,        who called on U.S. forces to leave Mindanao last September and proclaimed that his country would move into China\u2019s orbit. Now he says he didn\u2019t request U.S. help in Marawi. That leaves Filipinos to wonder who is calling the shots in their fight against terrorism.Mr. Duterte spent his first year as President promoting extrajudicial killings of drug pushers and users, a campaign that led to more than 8,000 deaths. Meanwhile, Islamist fighters converged on the southern island of Mindanao from as far away as Chechnya. Indonesia\u2019s National Counter-Terrorism Agency reports that 40 terrorists from the Islamic State-affiliated Jamaah Ansharut Daulah are fighting in Marawi.Islamic State has made no secret of its plan to make Mindanao a new caliphate. But Mr. Duterte boasted that he would pacify or wipe out the local separatist groups that have pledged allegiance to Islamic State. He set two deadlines for retaking Marawi, including the country\u2019s Independence Day on Monday. Mr. Duterte was absent from the celebrations due to illness, according to his office.The Philippine military has a history of losing fights with Abu Sayyaf, one of the groups holding Marawi. The discovery in the city of safe houses with large amounts of cash shows that the group has significant resources. In the past Abu Sayyaf bought arms from government soldiers and bribed them to slip out of encirclements.The Marawi fighting shows the military\u2019s familiar limitations. Ten Philippine soldiers were killed by friendly air-force fire on May 31, and on Friday 13 Philippine marines were killed in street fighting.The U.S. is helping with battlefield surveillance, coordination and training. Even limited nonkinetic assistance will shore up morale among government troops and prevent more friendly fire losses, but more is needed. In the decade after 9/11, a larger and more active U.S. force in Mindanao turned the tide against lawless groups like Abu Sayyaf.Defeating the terrorists quickly is important because a lengthy siege would allow Islamist groups to recruit fighters and dispatch them to start more uprisings in Mindanao. As northern Iraq shows, once Islamic State is entrenched it can destabilize the wider region. Mr. Duterte\u2019s tacit acceptance of U.S. help is a step forward, but the Philippines\u2019 struggle to retake Marawi and prevent similar occupations requires that he swallow his pride and ask for an international force in Mindanao.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-caliphate-grows-in-the-philippines-1497395591", "news_title": "A Caliphate Grows in the Philippines", "keywords": " abu sayyaf, counterterrorism, islamic state, jihad, marawi, mindanao,philippines, rodrigo duterte, terrorism,Abu Sayyaf,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism,editorials"}, {"content": "University of Virginia student       Otto Warmbier       visited North Korea over New Year\u2019s in 2015 as a tourist, and on Tuesday the 22-year-old returned home to the U.S.\u2014in a coma.Mr. Warmbier       traveled to North Korea for a five-day tourist trip, despite State Department warnings and the North\u2019s long record of taking Americans hostage.

The firing of       Mark Fields       at Ford last month was, at bottom, about Ford\u2019s failure to lift its stock by mouthing autonomous-driving hype. Or listen to GM\u2019s       Mary Barra.       You would think she eats, drinks and sleeps driverless cars and the \u201cmobility revolution\u201d rather than the products that bring in 100% of GM\u2019s revenue.Guess what? The same is true of Uber. Its embattled co-founder,       Travis Kalanick,        over-egged the pudding last year by claiming his company would be doomed unless it raced to the front in developing and demonstrating self-driving cars. This made no sense. As long as Uber maintains its lead as the world\u2019s preferred, trusted dispatcher of rides, its basic business model should be able to survive a transition to autonomous vehicles just fine.The ride-sharing company\u2019s real problem is its giddy $70 billion private-market valuation, which no amount of commissions earned on driver pickups would seem likely to justify. Uber would like at some point to go public, and at a tech-wonder valuation, thus its aggressive and flamboyant effort starting last year to attach itself to the self-driving car meme by buying Otto, the startup created by Google renegade       Anthony Levandowski.If Uber blundered into its legal war with Google by trying to help itself to autonomous-vehicle hype, Google blundered into the fight for a different reason. This reason has nothing to do with the driverless future and everything to do with the limits of Google\u2019s signature effort to maintain a freewheeling, entrepreneurial, tech-incubator feel inside a large organization.Google brought aboard Ms. Porat in the first place and turned itself into the Alphabet holding company to impose discipline on its free-spending \u201cmoonshots.\u201d It played down its \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d motto in favor of a more traditional corporate code of conduct.Mr. Levandowski himself was a fruit of Google\u2019s eccentric policy of letting employees pursue personal projects on company time and with company resources. A leader of Google\u2019s autonomous-vehicle efforts, Mr. Levandowski, as the Journal detailed last month, previously tested the limits by secretly setting up an outside company to sell his inventions back to Google.Where another employer might have found this an intolerable case of employee self-dealing, Google rewarded Mr. Levandowski by buying his company for $20 million.Mr. Levandowski could hardly have gotten any message except to keep testing the limits of chutzpah. This he allegedly did by spiriting a large amount of Google data into another startup, Otto. When he left Google and eventually sold Otto to Uber for $680 million, this was apparently more employee initiative than Google could stomach.Back in the real world, driver-assistance technology has been creeping into cars for decades and likely will continue to do so, with collision avoidance the next feature to become standard over the next several years. The driverless car won\u2019t arrive with a bang overnight.For instance, the Lidar sensors at the heart of the Google-Uber litigation will have to become a cheap commodity before autonomous driving is widespread. That alone means however the case plays out, you should expect neither company to walk away with meaningful advantage in the driverless vehicle sweepstakes.Appeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-uber-and-google-fight-1497395494", "news_title": "Why Uber and Google Fight", "keywords": "autonomous driving,company culture,ford,gm,google,self driving car,uber,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,commentaries,opinions,retail,wholesale,etailing,internet search engines,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "\u2018The Millennials Are Moving Left.\u201d That\u2019s the headline of an important article in the New Republic by       John Judis,        who observes the trend in many Western democracies\u2014the U.S., the U.K., France, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain, among others.This was certainly the story in the British elections last week, which were catastrophic for       Theresa May\u2019s       Conservatives. Not only did Labour candidates win 63% of voters age 18 to 34, but turnout among this cohort rose more than 20 percentage points from the previous general election, two years ago.These young voters, Mr. Judis contends, are primarily motivated by underlying economic trends. There is no shortage of evidence in favor of this hypothesis, which points to the fundamental problems of slow growth and increasingly unequal distribution that so many Western democracies now face.In a speech last December,       Mark Carney,        the governor of the Bank of England, said that the U.K. was mired in its \u201cfirst lost decade since the 1860s.\u201d Workers\u2019 earnings after adjusting for inflation, he said, \u201chave grown at the slowest rate since the mid-19th century.\u201d A Bank of England analysis shows that in the mid-1980s the 10-year moving average of real annual wage growth reached nearly 4%. As recently as 2007, it stood at about 3%. Now it has plunged below zero, meaning workers lost purchasing power for most of the past decade.This would be bad enough if the pain were shared throughout the population, but of course it isn\u2019t. Real incomes for U.K. residents 60 and over grew 11% between 2007 and 2014, while those 30 and under suffered a 7% loss. Projections suggest these trends are unlikely to improve soon. There are good reasons why young British voters flocked to the Labour Party, whose manifesto promised free college tuition and increased social benefits.In much of Europe, young people face even greater economic challenges, including unemployment rates far higher than for older workers\u201425% in France, 38% in Italy, nearly 45% in Spain, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In the U.S., the share of young Americans earning more than their parents did by age 30 has plunged from 9 in 10 for those born in the 1940s to barely half for those born in the 1980s. The young have been hit especially hard, moreover, by the workforce shift from long-term full-time employees to contractors and part-timers. As they reach their late 20s and early 30s and begin thinking about marriage and homeownership, the charms of frequent job changes and unpredictable schedules begin to pale.These economic trends are tilting the axis of political debate. In recent decades, left-wing parties and movements have been dominated by postmaterial concerns such as the environment, identity politics and opposition to wars. But last year Sen.       Bernie Sanders,        who focused almost exclusively on economic issues, rallied young adults to his side and mounted a surprisingly strong primary challenge to       Hillary Clinton,        the anointed candidate for the Democratic nomination. Younger voters express more skepticism about capitalism than did their parents, and they appear more open to government-driven responses to economic problems.As a consequence, the center-left parties of the 1990s are being driven further left, and the ones that have not moved are losing ground to left-wing alternatives. With the exception of Germany, the broad center of democratic politics is being hollowed out. In the U.K., the Liberal Democrats ran as the sole champions of the 48% of voters who cast ballots last year to remain in the European Union. They made little impression on the electorate and gained back only a handful of the nearly 50 seats they had lost in 2015.Against this backdrop, the continuing political revolution in France assumes wider significance. In May, by a margin of 2 to 1, French voters chose as their next president       Emmanuel Macron,        an avowed centrist who ran as an independent, a 39-year-old former banker and appointed government minister with no previous experience in elected office. This past weekend, the electorate put Mr. Macron\u2019s newly created political party within hailing distance of an outright parliamentary majority. If next weekend\u2019s second round of legislative voting confirms the first, he will have a free hand to enact his proposals.Previous governments have tried and failed to reform France\u2019s rigid labor laws, whose protections for incumbent workers have made employers reluctant to hire new ones. If Mr. Macron can push through changes, and if a revitalized French economy can generate jobs and opportunity for younger workers and entrepreneurs, he could turn out to be the avant-garde for a new generation of centrists who seek a sustainable balance between state and market, and between social security and economic dynamism.

In the coming weeks, the Congressional Budget Office is expected to release a report that estimates modernization as currently proposed would cost $1.2 trillion over 30 years, or about $40 billion a year. Congress and the       Trump       administration shouldn\u2019t be intimidated by the ostensibly big number.The plan analyzed by the CBO would replace the nuclear delivery systems of bombers, missiles and submarines with new ones that incorporate the latest safety and survival features. These changes would enable some systems to perform well into the 2080s. It\u2019s ambitious, but this program isn\u2019t the budget buster nuclear disarmament supporters describe.Under the plan, spending on the nuclear arsenal would peak in the late 2020s at about 6.5% of the Defense Department budget, up from 3.2% today. Recall that military spending consumes only about 15% of the federal budget.But determining whether modernization is affordable involves more than cost considerations. The Pentagon simultaneously has to consider its priorities and the costs of weapons systems when determining the best way to protect U.S. interests. According to the Defense Department, the two highest priorities of U.S. strategy are \u201cthe survival of the nation\u201d and \u201cthe prevention of a catastrophic attack against U.S. territory.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s Quadrennial Defense Review lists \u201ca secure and effective nuclear deterrent\u201d at the top of a list describing how to achieve such priorities.Given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal helps to deter the only existential threat to the U.S., major nuclear war, its value can\u2019t be measured by traditional dollar metrics alone. Budgets are about trade-offs and priorities. As the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.       Paul Selva,        testified earlier this year, \u201cWe are emphasizing the nuclear mission over other modernization programs when faced with that choice.\u201dCritics will cry that every dollar spent on nuclear weapons, which have not been set off in anger since World War II, is a dollar taken from those who are fighting wars right now. But as then-Defense Secretary       Ash Carter      explained in a speech last year, U.S. nuclear forces are the \u201cbedrock\u201d of American security and the \u201chighest priority mission\u201d of the Defense Department. They enable current war fighters to achieve their missions.Even those in the military who could stand to miss out on spending increases because of nuclear modernization efforts, like U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen.       Mark A. Milley,        support modernization: \u201cIt\u2019s not even an Army system and it needs to be overhauled and brought back up to the level of readiness.\u201dThe federal government can afford to spend less than 1% of its multitrillion-dollar budget on nuclear modernization. And with Russia, China and North Korea all upgrading their nuclear weapons capabilities, just about the only thing the U.S. can\u2019t afford is to end its modernization efforts before they begin.Mr. Costlow, a doctoral student at George Mason University, is a policy analyst at the National Institute for Public Policy.Appeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 19:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-the-u-s-afford-modern-nukes-1497395359", "news_title": "Can the U.S. Afford Modern Nukes?", "keywords": "army,defense spending,nuclear weapons,pentagon,trump budget,white house,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,nuclear weapons programs,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,defense department,executive branch,weapons programs,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "State and local governments owe at least a trillion dollars to public employee pensions. So it is welcome news that some politicians are noticing, and this week Pennsylvania took a step toward sanity in worker benefits.On Monday Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic Governor       Tom Wolf       signed a bill that would enroll new state employees in \u201chybrid\u201d retirement plans that feature defined-contributions from employees, much like 401(k)s offered by private businesses. The government would put up a smaller defined benefit. Employees could also choose a plan with only the 401(k), though it isn\u2019t clear how many would. Teachers and other current workers would have the option to switch into the new plans. The legislation passed the Republican legislature by wide margins.Pennsylvania\u2019s pension system is among the most broke in the country, with up to $70 billion in liabilities by some estimates. The state like so many others tries to conceal the damage with dubious assumptions\u2014predicting 7% returns that never materialize while chasing yield in risky instruments. Pennsylvania ran a pension surplus as recently as the early 2000s, but that was blown up by expanding benefits and reducing payments.The legislature has for a decade considered reforms, including borrowing money and dumping it into the stock market, as if that\u2019s never ended poorly. Meantime, the burden increased:       Nathan Benefield       at the Commonwealth Foundation notes that Pennsylvania school districts spent $2.3 billion on pensions in 2014-15, a 252% increase since 2008-09. School district revenues increased $3.9 billion from 2009 to 2015, but nearly half of the increase went to pensions. Many districts are strapped for cash as a result.Thus the plan to enroll new employees in hybrid plans, effective 2019. This would eliminate the taxpayer risk for new hires. Another benefit is portability: A teacher who would like to work five years but not three decades can bring savings with her when she leaves. Perhaps some younger workers who doubt they\u2019ll ever see the promised pension will elect to join the hybrid plans.Note also that the bill enjoys bipartisan support in a state with often dysfunctional politics, and Gov. Wolf deserves credit for signing the measure after vetoing a hybrid pension bill in 2015. Government unions didn\u2019t fight the legislation in a heretofore unseen display of restraint, and perhaps they think this will stave off more invasive changes for current workers or retirees. It\u2019s also instructive that former Republican Governor       Tom Corbett       couldn\u2019t pass his similar plan in 2013.The new plans are still much more generous than private alternatives: A career employee could retire with benefits of up to 95% of his final earnings, which the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s       Andrew Biggs       says is much higher than the 70% replacement rate most financial advisers say is sufficient.The law also can\u2019t erase government liabilities, and pension woes won\u2019t be fixed until governments are honest about what they owe and how to pay for it.

Uber\u2019s board of directors unanimously adopted Mr. Holder\u2019s recommendations, such as limiting company spending on alcohol.A freewheeling culture of marathon late-night work sessions and frat-boy behavior often goes hand-in-hand with a startup\u2019s fast-paced growth, experts say. But it can become detrimental as a company matures\u2014in Uber\u2019s case, to a $68 billion valuation and 12,000 employees. \u201cWhat worked for 200 people doesn\u2019t work for a couple thousand and can spin out of control,\u201d said Ranjay Gulati, an organizational growth expert and professor at Harvard Business School.Many startups stumble as they transition to a corporate culture, contributing to Silicon Valley folklore. Zenefits, the health-insurance brokerage startup, instituted a no-alcohol policy last year amid reports that employees were having sex in the office stairwells.In 2011, two years before             Twitter Inc.\u2019s       public offering, an impromptu party replete with marijuana broke out at its offices when the rapper       Snoop Dogg       and his entourage visited while top executives were away.The report from the law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, recommended that Uber prohibit alcohol consumption during \u201ccore work hours,\u201d limit budgets for alcohol during after-work events and come up with work retreats that don\u2019t require drinking. It also addressed \u201cprohibiting consumption of non-prescription controlled substances.\u201dThe report did not include details of what episodes led to the recommendations. Other suggestions include serving the catered dinner earlier to indicate the work day is ending so people with families can go home.The report also recommended that the company prohibit office romances between employees in a reporting relationship.The landmines that erupted at Uber were not surprising, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor and the director for the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThere\u2019s a pattern to these kinds of blind spots\u2014young men found these companies at really young ages and you end up with a lot of frat-boy behavior.\u201dThe demanding hours\u2014and the behavior that ensues\u2014is often a sign of an ambitious startup, some experts say.Antonio Garcia Martinez, who has worked at             Facebook Inc.       and Twitter and is author of \u201cChaos Monkeys,\u201d which chronicles the Silicon Valley startup culture, says \u201cThe reality is that 20-something ambitious males without a lot of life priorities outside of the companies that they\u2019re working for build 90% of tech startups in Silicon Valley.

The White House hasn\u2019t confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s plans.Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said during a hearing on Tuesday that he knew Mr. Trump would announce the changes Friday, and asked Mr. Tillerson to explain them further.\u201cThe general approach is to allow as much of this continued commercial and engagement activity to go on as possible because we do see the sunny side...we see the benefits of that to the Cuban people,\u201d said Mr. Tillerson, who appeared before the committee as a witness. \u201cBut on the other hand, we think we have achieved very little in terms of changing the behavior in the regime in Cuba, its treatment of people, and it has little incentive today to change that.\u201dHe added: \u201cIn fact, our concern is they may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of all of this, which just again promotes the continuance of that regime.\u201dThe people familiar with the deliberations said Trump administration officials are considering steps to tighten enforcement of travel restrictions that had been loosened during the Obama administration. The administration also is considering elimination of regulations that allowed individuals to plan their own cultural exchanges.Mr. Tillerson said Tuesday that interagency deliberations are still ongoing. Cuban officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Under changes approved previously, people electing to travel on \u201cgeneral licenses\u201d have had to self-certify the reasons for their travel and keep receipts for several years, but generally haven\u2019t been asked for specific details when returning to the U.S. That could change under the new policy.\u201cTourism is the fattest target, the one where the Trump administration could cause the most pain,\u201d said a congressional official.The Trump administration also is looking at tightening what transactions are allowed with Cuba\u2019s military, which controls much of the transportation and hotel infrastructure used by the tourism industry on the island.\u201cAs we\u2019re developing these business relationships and as we\u2019re enjoying the benefits of the economic and development side, are we inadvertently or directly providing financial support to the regime? Our view is we are,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told lawmakers.One potential target is the Grupo de Administraci\u00f3n Empresarial S.A., better known as GAESA, a conglomerate owned by Cuba\u2019s armed forces, and run by President Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s former son-in-law, Gen. Luis Alberto Rodriguez. GAESA owns a wide portfolio of more than 50 companies, many in the tourism industry, which for a long time has been one of Cuba\u2019s few cash-producing industries, analysts say.Through the Gaviota hotel chain, GAESA has nearly 29,000 hotel rooms, including the majority of Cuba\u2019s four- and five-star hotels, including the recently inaugurated Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski, which also houses top boutiques. Gaviota also has signed an agreement with Sheraton\u2019s Starwood chain to administer the Four Points Hotel in Havana.Aside from controlling the best hotels in Cuba, GAESA owns many retail stores in Cuba. It owns gasoline stations, car rental companies, banks and credit card companies. It controls the port of Havana, the focus of a multibillion-dollar tourism development plan that calls for the construction of marinas, hotels, ferry and cruise line terminals. GAESA recently acquired Habanaguanex , which under the city\u2019s historian had been responsible for redeveloping parts of the colonial hub of Havana into a hot tourism destination.Mr. Trump vowed during his presidential campaign last year to roll back the normalization process begun by Mr. Obama.The Trump administration has worked with Sen.       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla) and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R., Fla.) on making changes to the policy announced by Mr. Obama in 2014. Since that time, the U.S. and Cuba have reopened embassies in both capitals and a flurry of U.S. businesses have begun to develop deals on the island.But, the planned policy shift faces opposition from many Republicans, especially those in agriculture states, who see the opening as an opportunity to broaden business ties.Mr. Corker, in the hearing, told Mr. Tillerson he understood that American businesses are eager to operate in Cuba, but cited continuing shortcomings in free expression and other civil liberties.\u201cI do hope we end up with a policy that, over time, will cause the Cuban people themselves to be able to reach their aspirations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a country that has incredible potential.\u201dHuman rights advocates pushed back on the Trump administration\u2019s reasoning for considering rolling back some of the Obama administration\u2019s Cuba policy changes.\u201cThe previous administration was right to reject a policy that hurt ordinary Cubans and did nothing to advance human rights,\u201d said Daniel Wilkinson, managing director for the Americas at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe fact that Obama\u2019s approach hasn\u2019t led to political reform in Cuba after just a few years isn\u2019t reason to return to a policy that proved a costly failure over many decades.\u201dWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 18:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/administration-planning-rollback-of-u-s-cuba-normalization-efforts-1497382636", "news_title": "Trump Plans Rollback of Obama Cuba Policy", "keywords": "trump cuba,trump does opposite of obama,trump rolls back cuba policy,Barack Obama,Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,hotels,restaurants,lodgings,hotels (except casino),motels,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"}, {"content": "U.S. regulators delayed changes to nutrition labels on packaged food and drinks, the latest Obama-era food policy initiative to be postponed by the       Trump       administration.The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said the delay will give food makers more time to comply with the new labels, which highlight information on calorie content and added sugars.

The dinner brought Mrs. May face to face with a politically emboldened defender of the EU just days after losing her parliamentary majority in elections.Mrs. May\u2019s bruising setback has blurred the U.K.\u2019s strategy for Brexit negotiations that are due to start in less than a week. With weakened support, she could struggle to deliver her campaign promise of hard-nosed negotiations to get a clean break with the EU.\u201cThe door obviously remains open so long as the Brexit talks aren\u2019t concluded,\u201d Mr. Macron said.Mr. Macron said he respects the British vote to exit and said once the negotiations start it would be harder to make a U-turn.Mrs. May said she would stick to the timetable for beginning the Brexit talks. The U.K. government will strive to keep a \u201cdeep and special partnership\u201d with the EU, especially on matters of trade, she said.The meeting was the first test of Mrs. May\u2019s stature on the European stage after her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in a U.K. election she called with the aim of strengthening her mandate to negotiate Brexit.The stumble at the polls was widely blamed on a botched campaign by Mrs. May and a successful showing by       Jeremy Corbyn,        the veteran left-wing leader of the main opposition Labour Party. Mr. Corbyn\u2019s pledges to nationalize railways and pay for college tuition struck a chord with voters weary of years of government belt-tightening, especially the young. Conservatives\u2019 plans to overhaul elder care fell flat.The rebuke from voters has cast doubt on Mrs. May\u2019s ability to stay in office or govern effectively. Earlier Tuesday, she met with lawmakers from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to forge a loose alliance, giving her government the extra votes it needs to retain power.A big question mark now hangs over the U.K.\u2019s Brexit strategy. Mrs. May had advocated a clean break with the bloc, but some in her party are pushing for a softer approach that puts economic security first.\u201cThere is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom. It is a unity of purpose, having voted to leave the EU, that the government gets on with that,\u201d Mrs. May said.Mr. Macron is a tough interlocutor for Mrs. May on European matters. The 39-year-old won France\u2019s presidential election in May by campaigning as an outspoken defender of a stronger Europe. His rival in the second-round runoff, National Front leader       Marine Le Pen,        trumpeted the U.K. vote to leave the EU as a success story and called for France to do the same.\u201cMy wish is that we don\u2019t use up energy talking about modalities of Brexit, but that in the eurozone and the EU we can continue talking about necessary projects to go further,\u201d Mr. Macron said.The French leader notched up a second victory over Ms. Le Pen on Sunday as his party won the first round of the legislative election by a large margin, setting it up to win as many as 455 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, according to polling firms. The National Front is expected to win five seats at most, the same polls show.In his presidential campaign, Mr. Macron made pledges that are anathema to Mrs. May. He wants to strengthen the eurozone\u2014to which the U.K. doesn\u2019t belong\u2014with a dedicated parliament, a finance minister and a budget. Mr. Macron also said he would increase cooperation with Germany to create a European defense headquarters.The two leaders on Tuesday also discussed security and how to deepen cooperation on antiterrorism in Europe as well as between their two countries. After the dinner, Mrs. May and Mr. Macron attended a soccer match between England and France to pay homage to the victims of recent terror attacks in Manchester and London.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Door Still Open to U.K., Macron Tells Prime Minister.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 18:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/emmanuel-macron-urges-quick-start-to-brexit-talks-in-meeting-with-theresa-may-1497380559", "news_title": "Emmanuel Macron Tells Theresa May EU\u2019s \u2018Door Remains Open\u2019 to U.K. ", "keywords": "brexit, u.k.-eu relations ,Theresa May,Emmanuel Macron,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Attorney General       Jeff Sessions      testified for two and a half hours in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. The hearing contained some heated moments but not as many fresh disclosures as last week\u2019s testimony by former FBI chief       James Comey,        who was fired based in part on the recommendation of Mr. Sessions. Here are some of the most significant takeaways from the hearing:1. No CollusionMr. Sessions forcefully denied any collusion with Russia, calling the allegation an \u201cappalling and detestable lie.\u201d2. Backed Some Comey StatementsMr. Sessions confirmed some details of Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony last week, including the former FBI director\u2019s account that the attorney general had \u201clingered\u201d when President       Donald Trump       asked his top aides to leave him alone with Mr. Comey. Mr. Sessions also confirmed that Mr. Comey had expressed concern to him about being left alone with the president in the future. But Mr. Sessions disputed Mr. Comey\u2019s account that he had essentially shrugged in response, saying he had instead affirmed the Justice Department\u2019s longstanding policies on interactions between a president and his FBI director.3. Not Divulging Trump ConversationsAs expected, Mr. Sessions was much more reluctant than Mr. Comey to divulge details of his conversations with Mr. Trump. The attorney general cited Mr. Trump\u2019s executive privilege\u2014which the president hasn\u2019t invoked. Only the president can invoke executive privilege, but Mr. Sessions said he wouldn\u2019t answer questions in the event that Mr. Trump chose to invoke it in the future.4. No Recollection of a Mayflower MeetingAfter it emerged earlier this year that Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t disclose two meetings with Russian officials, questions have been raised about whether there was a third such meeting at the Mayflower Hotel last spring, an event both Mr. Sessions and the Russian ambassador attended. Mr. Sessions said he didn\u2019t have a private meeting with the ambassador, and didn\u2019t recall having an encounter with him.5. Explaining His RecusalMr. Sessions said that even before his public announcement of his recusal from the Russia probe, he wasn\u2019t briefed on details of the Russia investigation and didn\u2019t access any information about it. He also said he recused himself because of a Justice Department regulation that requires that officials not participate in investigations of a campaign if they served as a campaign adviser. Mr. Sessions\u2019 public recusal announcement came a day after the media reported that he hadn\u2019t disclosed previous meetings with Russian officials.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 18:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/5-things-we-learned-from-the-sessions-hearing-1497392929", "news_title": "5 Things We Learned From the Sessions Hearing ", "keywords": "sessions denies collusion,sessions russia,sessions testimony,FBI,Intelligence Committee,Mayflower Hotel,James Comey,Donald Trump,Jeff Sessions,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "RATHER IRONICALLY, relaxing takes work. Even a do-nothing vacation of cozying up to your Kindle on an uneventful island requires figuring out what to wear for your days in the sun. One garment, however, can help curtail the indecision.Your guide to mastering the lazy summerConsider the caftan. \u201cCaftans can be worn on the beach or poolside and then later, perhaps over that same bikini, while you\u2019re having a cocktail at a restaurant,\u201d said Winnie Beattie, owner of Manhattan resort-wear boutique Warm, which offers a variety of loose, wanderlusty styles.The flowy garments were popularized during the dolce vita 1960s (think: bohemian socialite Talitha Getty on a Marrakesh rooftop), and though they weathered a bleak period in the 1970s as the go-to garment of the dolce-less Mrs. Roper in the sitcom \u201cThree\u2019s Company,\u201d they\u2019re enjoying a renewed vogue.Last year, Carla Sersale, of the family-run Hotel Le Sireneuse in Positano, Italy, began to offer her line of block-printed cotton caftans, called Le Sireneuse Positano, at retailers beyond the hotel\u2019s shop, such as Bergdorf Goodman. A caftan \u201ccan dress you from morning to night,\u201d she said, noting that guests tend to waft from the pool to the terrace restaurant and oyster bar wearing similarly breezy styles. \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy garment.\u201dThe process of transitioning from deck chair to dinner, Ms. Sersale and Ms. Beattie agreed, is relatively hassle-free. Just swap flip-flops for strappy heels and throw on some jewelry, whether a pair of dangly earrings, a few layered necklaces or a chunky cuff. The right accoutrements can range from a simple array to the haute bohemian extremes captured in a photo of socialite and style icon Deeda Blair\u2014a caftan inspiration for gallerist Sarah Gavlak. In the photo, Ms. Blair is wearing a scarf-print number \u201cwith this incredible long scorpion necklace, and great big sunglasses, and has her gorgeous poodle next to her while she\u2019s sipping a cocktail,\u201d said Ms. Gavlak. As someone who splits her time between Los Angeles and Palm Springs, Ms. Gavlak prefers to wear caftans by the pool, but said she\u2019d go beyond the sun deck: \u201cI would definitely wear one as a hostess outfit. It\u2019s casual, but you\u2019re in a gown, in a way.\u201dBefore accessorizing, however, it\u2019s important to choose the right one. Caftans can easily go awry: swallowing a small frame, bulking up a larger one, or reading more tent than Talitha. \u201cSome women feel better if they have a bit of ankle showing,\u201d said Warm\u2019s Ms. Beattie. Petite women, she added, might consider a sleeveless caftan or one with a lower neckline. Ms. Sersale recommended a style with side-slits to show off a bit of leg. \u201cIt breaks up the shape and makes it more graceful,\u201d she said.Chic prints or stripes are enough to make an impact; heavy beading can overdo it for day. \u201cI think embellished caftans are fabulous, but sometimes they\u2019re overpowering,\u201d said Vogue editor-turned-designer Pippa Holt, who enlists Mexican artisans to hand-weave her new cotton caftan collection. Find the caftan that best suits you, and you\u2019ve cracked the vacation-dressing code\u2014with a healthy side of glamour. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream statement,\u201d said Ms. Sersale. \u201cYou feel empowered to be Sophia Loren.\u201dAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition as 'Be Covered for Everything.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 18:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/consider-the-caftan-glamorous-vacation-dressing-made-easy-1497448800", "news_title": "Consider the Caftan: Vacation-Dressing Made Easy", "keywords": "caftan,fashion,summer clothing,womens fashion,political,general news,living,lifestyle,travel"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Leaders of a Senate committee said Tuesday that the       Trump       administration\u2019s 2018 budget proposal, which includes large spending cuts at the State Department, won\u2019t make it through Congress and pressed Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       to explain the administration\u2019s priorities.Senators also asked Mr. Tillerson about the administration\u2019s policies toward North Korea and Russia in his first appearance on Capitol Hill as chief U.S. diplomat.Mr. Tillerson appeared in front of lawmakers just after announcing that an American college student,       Otto Warmbier,        was released from prison in Pyongyang.Mr. Tillerson announced the news to senators but declined to comment on what led to the North Korean regime\u2019s decision to release the student or on his medical condition. Mr. Warmbier\u2019s relatives said he had been in a coma for months before his release, the Washington Post reported.The U.S. chief diplomat said the administration of President       Donald Trump       has to make \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d as it looked to cut the State Department budget by about one-third, and that the U.S. would focus its efforts on missions that deliver \u201cthe greatest value and opportunity\u201d for Americans.He argued that the people working at the State Department\u2014rather than budget priorities\u2014would make the State Department effective.\u201cI think you know that the budget that\u2019s been presented is not going to be the budget we\u2019re going to deal with,\u201d said Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cCongress has a tremendous respect for the diplomatic efforts that are under way, the aid that we provide in emergency situations.\u201dIn a later session, Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.), chairman of the Senate panel that oversees State Department funding, said the budget request is \u201cradical and reckless when it comes to soft power\u201d and said it didn\u2019t reflect the threats the U.S. faces.Asked by Sen.       Chris Murphy       (D., Conn.) whether the cuts to the State Department\u2019s budget were a deliberate strategy to pull back from world affairs, Mr. Tillerson said he didn\u2019t see it that way.\u201cI take a completely counter view to the way you\u2019ve interpreted it,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.Explaining the administration\u2019s view, he said: \u201cAmerica has been leading for a very long time and American people have been reaching in their pockets and paying for this leadership for a very long time...but you, our allies, must do your part.\u201dMr. Tillerson will also face two House committees on Wednesday. \u200bAt a separate hearing on Tuesday, Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       said he stood by his statements predating the Trump administration in which he said cuts in diplomatic support would require increases in military spending\u2014a way of saying U.S. outreach was as important as military force.\u201cI think America has two fundamental powers, the power of inspiration and the power of intimidation, and they have to work together and the State Department represents inspiration overseas,\u201d he said in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee.The Trump proposal would cut spending at the State Department and the related U.S. Agency for International Development by 32%.Senators also asked Mr. Tillerson if he supported Russia sanctions legislation, which senators reached a deal on late Monday night.Mr. Tillerson said the Trump administration wanted flexibility \u201cto turn that heat up\u201d depending on how bilateral efforts were going.\u201cWe have some channels that are open where we\u2019re starting to talk,\u201d he said, pointing to efforts related to Syria and Ukraine, and said he wouldn\u2019t want to close them off.Sen.       Jeanne Shaheen       (D., N.H.), in the afternoon hearing, asked Mr. Tillerson about ongoing talks with Russia to possibly return recreational compounds owned by Russia, which the U.S. seized in retaliation for Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u201cThis is part of how we take some of the irritants out of the relationship,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said, saying the U.S. also is raising its own concerns with Russia as part of this channel, including harassment of U.S. diplomats.Lawmakers in the afternoon session also said they were concerned about cuts to embassy security, which Mr. Tillerson said could be explained in part by how the U.S. is committing to certain projects, and that the U.S. has increased funds for diplomatic security, the law-enforcement arm of the State Department that protects diplomats and embassies.Sens.       Cory Gardner       (R., Colo.) and       Bob Menendez       (D., N.J.) asked Mr. Tillerson about a report released Monday about possible illicit trading networks benefiting North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.\u200bMr. Tillerson said he stressed the necessity of cracking down on North Korea\u2019s trade in every bilateral meeting he has, and said that North Korea\u2019s intricate financial networks are \u201cdifficult, but not impossible to address.\u201dHe said Russia and China are key players in this effort, and that the U.S. would raise North Korea sanctions in a high-level meeting with the Chinese next week.\u2014Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Senators Press Tillerson on Proposed Cuts.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 18:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rex-tillerson-in-first-hill-appearance-as-secretary-facing-series-of-tough-questions-1497355824", "news_title": "Senators Say Trump\u2019s Planned State Department Cuts Won\u2019t Pass", "keywords": "donald trump,foreign policy,middle east,middle east conflict,rex tillerson,russia,sanctions,secretary of state,soft power,state department,Rex Tillerson,Donald Trump,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,upper house"}, {"content": "The Trump administration is calling for a 14% reduction in federal prison jobs, including 1,850 fewer correctional officers, while projecting a 2% increase in prisoners under more aggressive prosecutions of illegal immigrants and drug offenders.More than 80% of those 6,132 prison jobs are currently vacant; the rest of the positions would be eliminated through attrition over fiscal year 2018, according to the spending plan for the Justice Department. The federal prison population had been declining over the past four years.The Justice Department is seeking $10 million to cover the costs of food, health care, transportation and programs for additional inmates, but that request wouldn\u2019t cover new correctional officers responsible for security, according to a Justice Department spokesman. Another $80 million in the budget would allow the federal government to open a maximum-security prison in a facility previously run by the state of Illinois.The anticipated increase in the federal-prison population is the result of more aggressive charging guidelines implemented by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who says the new policies will restore the rule of law and help thwart an uptick in violent crime. His efforts contrast with a growing movement across the country, including in Republican-led states such as Louisiana and Oklahoma, to reduce the number of people behind bars.Civil-rights groups, and the union that represents prison employees, say the growth in the number of inmates coupled with a reduction in correctional officers could lead to dangerous conditions at some of the 144 federal facilities.\u201cIt\u2019s a scary situation,\u201d said \u00a0Eric Young, president of the American Federation of Government Employees\u2019 Council of Prison Locals. \u201cPeople need to understand the situation politicians put us in when they play with our funding.\u201dWyn Hornbuckle, \u00a0a spokesman for the Justice Department, said the agency is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that all (Bureau of Prison) facilities are safe, secure and humane, whether they are publicly or privately operated.\u201dEarlier this year, Mr. Sessions rescinded the Obama administration\u2019s decision to phase out contracts with for-profit prison companies. The Obama administration\u2019s move came after the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general concluded for-profit facilities were more dangerous than government-run prisons, a finding disputed by private prison companies.About 19% of federal inmates are in private prisons or re-entry centers. Industry experts say private prisons are well-positioned to boost their market share because they have more beds available than government-run facilities, which are currently running 14% above official capacity.Mr. Hornbuckle said the renewed openness to private prisons would give the government \u201cflexibility to manage the federal inmate population based upon capacity needs, consistent with the need to ensure safety, security, and effective reentry programming.\u201dBut activist groups voiced concern about coupling overcapacity with a cut in prison guards.\u201cThis is reckless and dangerous,\u201d said Kevin Ring, a former Republican lobbyist who now serves as president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which advocates reducing incarceration. \u201cOvercrowded and understaffed prisons jeopardize the physical safety of guards and prisoners.\u201dFour U.S. correctional officers have been murdered in the line of duty over the past 20 years, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons. In the most recent instance, an inmate serving a life sentence at a federal penitentiary in northeastern Pennsylvania was convicted last week in the 2013 fatal stabbing of correctional officer Eric Williams.His murder led to a 2016 law, sponsored by the state\u2019s senators, Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Bob Casey, that requires medium- and high-security prisons to issue nonlethal pepper spray to guards for self-defense.Asked about the proposed reduction in correctional officers, a spokesman for Mr. Toomey said, \u201cHe believes that Congress should pass a budget that ensures we have enough correctional officers to keep every federal officer safe.\u201dMr. Williams was supervising a housing unit of 125 inmates alone when he was attacked. Mr. Young, the union leader, said correctional officers routinely supervise 130 inmates.In addition to lobbying for more correctional officers, the union is pushing for legislation that would make the murder of a law enforcement officer an \u201caggravating factor\u201d in federal death penalty decisions.\u00a0 The Thin Blue Line Act passed the House last month, and Mr. Toomey has introduced similar legislation in the Senate.The inmate who killed Mr. Williams is facing the death penalty. But in another case, in which two inmates already serving life sentences murdered correctional officer Jose Rivera at a federal prison in California, they took plea deals that allowed them to avoid the death penalty.An alert sent out earlier this month to union members said, \u201cThe Thin Blue Line Act would give their families a fair shot at the justice they deserve, and send a message to every criminal that the murder of a first responder will not go unpunished.\u201dWrite to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 17:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-seeks-cuts-in-federal-prison-jobs-1497390682", "news_title": "Trump Seeks Cuts in Federal Prison Jobs", "keywords": "prison populations,prisons,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,murder,manslaughter,politics,international relations,domestic politics,prisoners,government bodies,executive branch,justice department"}, {"content": "Commercial real estate owners paid off maturing loans at a slower rate in May as they found it harder to refinance their buildings, according to Morningstar Credit Ratings LLC.There were 790 loans that had been repackaged into commercial mortgage backed securities that came due in May, with a total unpaid balance of $9.4 billion. Of those, landlords repaid 64.9% in the six months leading up to their maturity dates. That compares with payoff rates of 71.5% in April and the low-to-mid 80% range last year, Morningstar said.Meanwhile, the number of owners who have failed to repay their loans on time or are delinquent on monthly payments has been rising. Over the past 12 months, the percentage of delinquent commercial mortgage securities loans at maturity averaged 17.8%. That was up from 10% in the June 2015 to April 2016 period, the rating agency said.Loan repayment performance has been weakening partly because in 2007 there was a record volume of 10-year commercial property loans converted into mortgage securities. The real-estate industry for several years has been bracing itself for the so-called wall of maturities that was going to hit this year as a result.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of the riskier nature of the loans originated 10 years ago,\u201d said       Steve Jellinek,        a Morningstar vice president. \u201cToday, with more conservative lending standards, they can\u2019t get refinancing.\u201dThe wall of maturity hasn\u2019t hit as hard as many had feared earlier this year partly because debt funds and a wide range of other nontraditional lenders became more active in commercial real estate. But some of those lenders now \u201care taking a step back\u201d and making refinancing harder for property owners holding riskier loans, Mr. Jellinek said.Owners of some retail properties are having a particularly difficult time obtaining refinancing because online retail has eroded their rents and occupancy rates.

The evidence is strangely scant. We hear from Brutus that he was ambitious. He valued theatrical display as a political tool. And while boasting of being as constant as the Northern Star, he inconsistently gave into whim and superstition.Julius CaesarThe Public Theater, Delacorte Theater, Central Park  Free, 212-539-8500, closes June 18.Be that as it may, fearsome tyrant he is taken to be. But in this production, the real tyrant is not Caesar, but its director,       Oskar Eustis.       He more clearly comes across as ambitious, inconsistent, with little regard for limits, manipulating his audience by playing to popular taste. Perhaps, given such directorial tyranny, I might follow the example of the play\u2019s conspirators, justly take dagger in hand, and add a bloody gouge to his self-inflicted wounds.If that idea seems rather tasteless, is it any more so than       Gregg Henry,        as Caesar, impersonating not a Roman tyrant but President       Donald Trump      ? Or       Tina Benko,        as Caesar\u2019s wife, Calpurnia, appearing as a slinky model with a Slavic accent meant to suggest       Melania Trump       (though Ms. Benko sounds more like a Transylvanian Israeli)?Maybe every director is entitled to some political posturing, particularly with Shakespeare who, like       Bach,        can take a lot of interpretive abuse before he becomes something else. But Mr. Eustis\u2019s territorial claims are imperial. In the program notes, he boasts: \u201cI can say without embarrassment that I decided to open our summer season with Julius Caesar as of November 9, 2016.\u201d In other words, he saw Trump as Caesar the day after Election Day, he thinks that point of view is self-evident, and he still sees the analogy.Let\u2019s say he\u2019s correct. So when Caesar emerges from a bathtub in this production, stark naked and displaying himself for conspirators and audience alike, no doubt we are meant to think of Trumpian narcissism. What then are we to think of when this erstwhile president is lying in a puddle of blood in the Roman Senate?Ay, there\u2019s the rub. It is not surprising that Delta Air Lines and Bank of America announced they were pulling out of sponsorship of the production.But, given Mr. Eustis\u2019s political perspective, such corporate opposition must be like the coronet Caesar covets. It is an honor, which increases because he finds it so wrong-headed. He has said the play is really a \u201cwarning parable\u201d about the dangers of fighting for democracy using undemocratic means. Brutus and Cassius come to no good. The play opposes assassination; it does not glorify it.That, at least, is Mr. Eustis\u2019s claim. But Shakespeare doesn\u2019t really argue that point. Neither does Mr. Eustis\u2019s staging, really; he makes it clear who the bad guys are: Caesar\u2019s men, wearing Big Brother-like Eye insignias on their flak jackets. The good guys are the conspirators and protesters, who are also responsible for mounting the spontaneous-seeming public memorial we see on arriving, looking like those that arose after the 9/11 attacks, this one supposedly mounted in memory of Pompey, just killed by (terrorist) Caesar.Audience members even go on stage to scrawl comments on protest posters proclaiming \u201cResist\u201d\u2014which, at the play\u2019s beginning, are quickly pasted over by Caesar\u2019s fascistic police. Lest we miss the point, Cassius appears at Brutus\u2019 door wearing a pussy hat.The play grossly overstates Caesar\u2019s tyranny in order to justify the assassination. And then how does Mr. Eustis demonstrate the \u201cwarning parable\u201d? He doesn\u2019t. Near the play\u2019s end, Caesarian riot police shoot into a presumably democratic, unarmed crowd of protesters. Ideology trumps all. The production even indulges in \u201cintersectionality\u201d\u2014a form of 21st-century conceptual imperialism in which every imagined victim is said to share similar political oppressors. Thus,       Marc Antony       is cast as a woman (      Elizabeth Marvel      ), leading to pronoun changes throughout and inspiring a dollop of sympathetic ambiguity (though we give this gender-indulgence up when she ultimately displays bad-guy brutishness). As for the poet Cinna, who is set upon in the street by a maddened populace, here, to suit the director\u2019s pre-packaged prejudices, he is a Muslim pummeled to death by Caesar\u2019s police.Thus is self-righteous directorial tyranny exercised, leading to any number of incompatibilities. But what about Shakespeare? He was interested in something far more subtle in 1599, when this play was first performed. Tyranny is not his subject, which is why we see so little of it. He was exploring\u2014as he was in other plays\u2014the evolving tensions between populism and patrician heritage, between the nascent idea of a populace and the fading idea of republican nobility. The public is reckless and fickle. But it is also an authority to which government is beginning to appeal, not just for approval but for legitimacy. Cassius\u2014played by       John Douglas Thompson,        who thankfully dominates this production with his clarity and vitality\u2014understands this better than Brutus (      Corey Stoll      ), who reasons with old-school ineffectuality, calling on honorable notions of behavior and virtue. There are reasons why, throughout the play, characters wonder about the time or the hour: The world is in an uneasy state of transition.Such themes don\u2019t fit easily with Mr. Eustis\u2019s grade-school notions. But they are far more intriguing than the tyrannical vision he crudely enforces in their place.\u2014Mr. Rothstein is the Journal\u2019s Critic at Large.Appeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as '\u2018Caesar\u2019: A Tyrant in the Director\u2019s Chair CAESAR.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 17:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/julius-caesar-review-a-tyrant-in-the-directors-chair-1497390407", "news_title": "\u2018Julius Caesar\u2019 Review: A Tyrant in the Director\u2019s Chair", "keywords": "arts in review, elizabeth marvel, gregg henry, oskar eustis,public theater, shakespeare in the park julius caesar, theater, trump,Donald Trump,political,general news,national,public security,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,theater,reviews"}, {"content": "Pacific Investment Management Co.

Ms. Shanahan is head of human resources, while Mr. Strelow serves as chief administrative officer.The moves are the biggest management changes Pimco Chief Executive       Emmanuel Roman       has made since he joined the firm last fall. Mr. Roman is trying to move the firm past a 2014 split with co-founder       Bill Gross       that led to an exodus of client money, sagging morale and a distracting legal battle.Pimco reversed an extended period of outflows in the second half of last year, and ran its streak to three straight quarters of net inflows in early 2017. In March, Pimco settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit from Mr. Gross for $81 million.Mr. Jacobs\u2019s departure will end a 19-year career with Pimco. The 46-year-old executive managed many of the firm\u2019s internal functions, and often served as a counselor to employees grappling with Pimco\u2019s culture and post-Gross malaise, current and former executives said. As the firm\u2019s outlook brightened in recent months, Mr. Jacobs said he determined it was time to step away.\u201cThe firm is absolutely back on track and you\u2019ve seen that in the numbers so far,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. \u201cI\u2019m really going to miss my Pimco colleagues, but the firm is in a great place.\u201dMr. Jacobs joined Pimco in 1998 and was head of its Munich office and human resources before becoming president.When former CEO Mohamed El-Erian left the firm in early 2014, Mr. Jacobs offered to interview for the role, people familiar with the matter said. He did so, one of these people said, at the behest of other top Pimco figures who were concerned because only one senior executive.       Douglas Hodge,        had sought the post.Mr. Hodge was named CEO, but Pimco appointed Mr. Jacobs its president, and put him on equal footing with Mr. Hodge in new organizational chart.Last year, Pimco executives and money managers began to weigh whether the firm needed outside executives to help navigate some of the sweeping changes under way in the asset-management industry. Mr. Jacobs was among those advocating for an external search, and led that process along with investment chief       Daniel Ivascyn,        the people said.He plans to join Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Financial Markets and Policy in January as fellow.

Ricardo Rossell\u00f3\u00a0said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.Voters opted for U.S. statehood by a 97% margin\u00a0in Sunday\u2019s vote, though turnout was just 23% as opponents of the governor urged their constituents to snub the vote. The last time Puerto Rico called a plebiscite on its political status, in 2012, 78% of voters turned out.The results aren\u2019t binding on Congress, which must approve any change in Puerto Rico\u2019s political status.The vote also took place without approval from the Justice Department, which had earlier raised objections to the governor\u2019s proposed ballot language. He said he would attempt to convince members of Congress that the 3.4 million island residents had nonetheless supplied a mandate in favor of becoming the 51st state.\u201cThe rules that have always applied are, those who go to the ballot box determine the outcome,\u201d Gov. Rossell\u00f3\u00a0said.U.S. lawmakers, who have historically been skeptical of accepting Puerto Rico as a state, are especially loathe to do so now with the territory grappling with a financial crisis that is stifling its economy and elevating rates of poverty and joblessness, said Amilcar Antonio Barreto, a professor at Northeastern University.Congress has historically favored keeping the territorial status quo \u201cbecause it\u2019s the constitutional arrangement that gives them maximum flexibility over Puerto Rican affairs,\u201d he said.Lawmakers last year passed a rescue package to install a federal financial oversight board with a mandate to get Puerto Rico\u2019s yawning budget gaps under control and tackle its $73 billion mountain of debt.While many U.S. municipalities can restructure their obligations under chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, U.S. states don\u2019t have a similar restructuring option to deal with a potential default on their general obligations. The Puerto Rico rescue law, however, gave the oversight board authority to adjust debts obligations in ways the states can\u2019t.Mr. Rossell\u00f3\u00a0said that making Puerto Rico the 51st state would lead to dramatic growth \u201cas the natural reaction of a stronger economy impacting a smaller one,\u201d removing the need for those restructuring powers.\u201cThis economic growth would allow us to be able to service our debt adequately even without the tools provided in Promesa,\u201d he said,\u00a0referring to the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, which established a process for restructuring debt.\u00a0\u201cOur debt is simply a symptom of a much greater problem which is our economy.\u201dA national television advertisement released by a pro-statehood group on Tuesday echoed those themes, saying that statehood \u201cbenefits all Americans, ends corporate tax breaks and enables Puerto Rico to compete, prosper and pay its fair share on equal footing.\u201dThe oversight board last month placed Puerto Rico under what amounts to the largest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy.\u00a0Its delay in approving a $9 billion restructuring deal covering the island power utility has rankled Republicans in Congress\u00a0who viewed the agreement as a road map toward consensual settlements of Puerto Rico\u2019s other debts.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 17:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-rico-governor-pitches-statehood-as-debt-solution-1497389155", "news_title": "Puerto Rico Governor Pitches Statehood as Debt Solution ", "keywords": "bankruptcynews,chapter 11,puerto rico,puerto rico bankruptcy,puerto rico debt,puerto rico restructuring,puerto rico state,puerto rico vote,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Years ago an acquaintance spent several hair-raising months as a bodyguard for Angus Young, who plays guitar for a rowdy musical troupe called AC/DC.

There are no rules.\u201dA sensible general rule is to run away from the bar instead of fighting, though it\u2019s clear this rule is problematic if you have contracted to protect one of the patrons.In contemporary Washington, it seems that residents increasingly favor political combat without any rules at all. This column isn\u2019t so much addressing formal written rules, but the courtesies and customs that help make a democracy go.Many Democrats seem to have decided that the Trump presidency is uniquely undeserving of respect. On Saturday Salon.com enthusiastically described one legislator losing her composure:Mr. Trump has previously inspired profane responses from other Democratic officials and of course from demonstrators wearing hats named for genitalia who staged a protest in Washington on his first full day in office. CNN noted in April that \u201cprofane clips have become routine in Democratic National Committee Chairman       Tom Perez\u2019s       speeches.\u201dNot profane but unusual was Monday\u2019s spectacle of a Senate minority leader crafting a homemade video parody of the President\u2019s cabinet meeting. And of course back in Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s hometown of New York City, the President\u2019s adversaries have been expressing their views through a different medium. According to the Washington Post:It appeared that the President was being insulted again this week amid a series of tweets claiming that the Golden State Warriors, fresh off their latest NBA championship, had decided to skip the traditional White House visit. This turned out to be fake news, according to the Charlotte Observer, which quotes the team saying they have not decided what to do in the event they are invited.Mr. Trump for his part certainly didn\u2019t stick to the normal rules of political decorum when he campaigned for the office, so one could argue that he is partly responsible. Some might even say that Mr. Trump over the years has been a lot like the music of AC/DC: high-energy with coarse lyrics.Perhaps not as coarse but more potentially destructive to the republic has been the disrespect former FBI Director       James Comey       has shown for those on both sides of the aisle. Though never appointed to the bench, he assigned himself the task of rendering judgments on other public officials.And Mr. Comey has something in common with all of Mr. Trump\u2019s other critics\u2014he is not the duly elected President of the United States. Perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s critics will reflect on this fact and consider that, even if they don\u2019t respect him, they ought to respect the judgment of the people who chose him.***Bottom Stories of the DayStill Leading from Behind  \u201cU.S. leads the way in obesity; third of the world overweight: report,\u201d New Orleans Times-Picayune, June 12Maximum Clinton Donors: Where Are They Now?  \u201cSpecial counsel team members donated to Dems, FEC records show,\u201d CNN, June 13Maybe He Could Be Persuaded to Move to Washington  \u201cMoving to Texas?

But the issue escalated\u00a0on Monday\u00a0when a friend of the president and Chief Executive of Newsmax Media, Chris Ruddy, gave a television interview in which he said Mr. Trump is considering firing Mr. Mueller.Both White House aides and a senior Justice Department official\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0played down the notion that Mr. Mueller is on shaky ground or could even be dismissed so readily. The White House noted that Mr. Ruddy hasn\u2019t spoken to the president about Mr. Mueller\u2019s role.One White House official said that Mr. Mueller\u2019s dismissal \u201cis not something that is being discussed internally,\u201d adding Mr. Ruddy appeared to be \u201cspeculating.\u201dAsked if he believed Mr. Trump was poised to dismiss Mr. Mueller,       Newt Gingrich,        a former Republican House speaker who is in contact with the president and says he spoke to him\u00a0Monday\u00a0night, said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201dMr. Ruddy, in an interview Tuesday, stood by his remarks.

Under Justice Department rules, he could only do so for cause. On Tuesday, Mr. Rosenstein testified on Capitol Hill that he wouldn\u2019t follow any White House order to fire Mr. Mueller unless there was a legal and appropriate reason. If he chose, Mr. Trump could then fire Mr. Rosenstein, but there are only a few other senior Trump administration officials currently serving within the department and it is unclear if they would follow such orders either.Mr. Rosenstein added that he was \u201cconfident\u201d that Mr. Mueller will have \u201csufficient independence\u201d to conduct his probe. Asked about jettisoning Mr. Mueller, some Republicans warned the move would be a mistake.Since his appointment by the Justice Department last month,\u00a0Mr. Mueller has been quickly getting to work, hiring seasoned prosecutors and evaluating the investigative work that has taken place to date, according to people familiar with his operations.House Speaker       Paul Ryan       told reporters\u00a0Tuesday:\u00a0\u201cI think the best advice is to let Robert Mueller do his job.\u201dHe added: \u201cI think the best vindication for the president is to let this investigation to go on independently and thoroughly.

S\u00e9rgio Cabral       was sentenced to 14 years in prison Tuesday for corruption and money laundering, becoming one of the most high-profile Brazilian politicians yet convicted in the sprawling Car Wash probe.Judge       Sergio Moro       found Mr. Cabral guilty of receiving around 2.7 million Brazilian reais ($816,450) in bribes and laundering some of the proceeds. The money had been skimmed off an overpriced construction contract for a refinery built by state-owned oil company         Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA,       or Petrobras, on the outskirts of Rio.Mr. Cabral\u2019s attorney said he plans to appeal but declined to specify on what grounds.Once considered a likely presidential candidate, Mr. Cabral rode the commodity boom to political stardom during his 2007-14 term, as Rio experienced a fleeting renaissance that culminated in its winning bid for the 2016 Olympics.With state coffers flush with cash from rising oil prices, Mr. Cabral attacked the city\u2019s notorious crime problem by implementing a community policing program in favelas, or slums, long controlled by drug gangs. He propped up employment by drastically expanding the state\u2019s payroll and spent billions of dollars on infrastructure projects, such as a new Metro line, whose costs, prosecutors say, have been inflated by corruption.As a result, Rio state is now in the throes of an epic fiscal crisis, unable to pay the salaries or pensions. After falling in 2012 to the lowest level in decades, violence has come roaring back, with more than 5,000 murders last year and 920 killings by police officers, in a state home to some 16.6 million people.\u201cThe failed situation of Rio de Janeiro state cannot be ignored, as the suffering of the population and civil servants, which despite being the result of many factors, also has its origins in the systematic graft by the ex-governor and his associates,\u201d Judge Moro wrote in his ruling.Tuesday\u2019s case is only the first to be ruled upon against Mr. Cabral, the son of a well-known music critic who rose from modest origins in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s working-class north side.In addition to Car Wash, Mr. Cabral is the target of parallel investigations into graft from Rio\u2019s state health-care system, infrastructure projects and public works ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics.Altogether, prosecutors allege the ex-governor diverted more than $100 million from public coffers, stashing the proceeds in offshore bank accounts and laundering much of the money by purchasing luxury goods such as diamonds.In March, the Car Wash task force in Rio de Janeiro repatriated 250 million reais from foreign bank accounts allegedly controlled by Mr. Cabral\u2019s \u201ccriminal organization,\u201d prosecutors said. The money was handed over to the state government, which used it to pay the overdue salaries of 147,342 employees.\u201cThat represents just part of the money that has been apprehended, with still more believed to be hidden,\u201d prosecutor       Leonardo Cardoso de Freitas       said at the time. \u201cThese numbers give an idea of how big the cost of corruption is in Brazil.\u201dWrite to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 17:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-judge-sentences-ex-rio-governor-to-14-years-in-corruption-case-1497380194", "news_title": "Brazil Judge Sentences Ex-Rio Governor to 14 Years in Corruption Case", "keywords": " brazil corruption, brazil politics,car wash, corruption, money laundering,Petrobras,PETR4.BR,PBR,S\u00e9rgio Cabral,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,money laundering,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Oil prices ended higher Tuesday ahead of data on U.S. oil stockpiles due to be released Wednesday.U.S. crude futures rose 38 cents, or 0.82%, to $46.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The country is looking to cut its shipments to key markets, including the U.S., where any increase in inventories can prompt a major selloff.The state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. has been raising prices for U.S. customers and expects exports to the U.S. to fall to a nearly three-decade low in July.

Anyone in the military, law enforcement, auditing, law or medicine at some point has to confront a supervisor and tell him he is wrong. When Mr. Trump said that Gen.       Michael Flynn       is \u201ca good guy\u201d and hoped Mr. Comey could \u201clet this one go,\u201d he should have smiled and said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go there. We will work Flynn\u2019s case as quickly as we can.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump asked for loyalty, Mr. Comey could have said he would keep the president in the loop. When Attorney General Loretta Lynch told Mr. Comey to say that the       Hillary Clinton       investigation was to be described as a \u201cmatter,\u201d Mr. Comey should have said that he would not do it. Instead he caved.Mr. Comey should have understood that his superior is a political novice, and instead of stabbing him in the back by leaking a memo, should have guided him into understanding the complex relationship between the president and FBI. The FBI is not independent and the president can fire the FBI director, but to do so risks precious political capital and invites a special counsel, which has happened.James Comey failed as a subordinate in supporting his boss\u2019s boss. He deserved to be fired.O.S. MartinRichardson, TexasJames Comey disclosed that President Trump was not a target of the Russia probe. Far from obstructing Mr. Comey\u2019s investigation, Mr. Trump encouraged him to ferret out any campaign staff who interacted inappropriately with Russians. It was Loretta Lynch who gave Mr. Comey an inappropriate order\u2014to follow Democrat talking points in referring to the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton, not as investigation, but nebulously as a \u201cmatter.\u201d One wonders what she spoke about with a potential target of the investigation when she met secretly with       Bill Clinton       on the tarmac.Not since the Army-McCarthy hearings has a single media appearance done so much to dispel mass hysteria about Russians hiding under our beds.Richard A. CraneChicagoI had the opportunity to watch James Comey testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I saw a man who was honest, straightforward and just. Despite all that has occurred in the past few months, he kept his cool and stuck to the facts, giving the committee all the information that he could give.I am very proud to have had Mr. Comey serve as our FBI director. He is a true American patriot.Nameer BhattiBlue Bell, Pa.I believe President Trump was surprised by James Comey\u2019s refusal to pledge loyalty. Isn\u2019t that what Mr. Comey displayed toward Loretta Lynch? The FBI conducted a sham investigation of Hillary Clinton and her associates\u2019 abuse of classified information. No grand jury was convened by the Justice Department. Mrs. Clinton wasn\u2019t interviewed until very late in the game, and then not under oath and the interview wasn\u2019t recorded. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Chief of Staff       Cheryl Mills       was given immunity for the contents of her laptop and allowed to serve as her former boss\u2019s lawyer though she had handled emails that were the point of the \u201cmatter.\u201dMr. Trump could have reasonably expected the same courtesy as Mr. Comey had shown to President Obama, Loretta Lynch and Hillary Clinton.Francis G. KnipeTorrance, Calif.It is not clear to me how anyone can justify the head of the FBI leaking information. The actions of a company\u2019s chief drive the actions of the organization. Mr. Comey\u2019s actions effectively say to all of the FBI that it is OK to leak.Jim IkelerCincinnatiIf Mr. Comey\u2019s backdoor approach to triggering the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the president or his advisers is honorable behavior in the swamp, do most of Washington\u2019s many deep-state leakers of information (sometimes classified) deserve to be reclassified as heroes?Twenty-five-year-old federal contractor Reality Winner, described by friends and family as a passionate person, decided recently that the public deserved to know more about Russian military intelligence cyberattacks.

Courts haven\u2019t recognized a right to affordable bail, and any concerns regarding whether bail is \u201cexcessive\u201d if the arrested person cannot raise the funds should be dismissed. The touchstone in determining whether bail is excessive under the Eighth Amendment isn\u2019t what the arrested person can pay but rather the amount relative to an amount reasonably calculated to assure his or her appearance.The surety bail arrangement is effective in ensuring that an arrested person will appear at various proceedings. The agent often obtains collateral or indemnity from friends and family members to guarantee that if the arrested person fails to appear and the bond is forfeited, the agent and surety will have indemnity for the loss. This provides powerful financial incentive to see that the arrested person appears in court or is recovered promptly in the event of a default. The agent also monitors the arrested person to avoid a default and attempts to recover an arrested person who failed to appear. These systemic incentives are lacking in the case of a personal recognizance or an unsecured bond.

Elizabeth Warren       said Tuesday that Senate Democrats are willing to pursue targeted changes for regulations affecting community banks and credit unions as Congress moves to review postcrisis financial regulations.But the Massachusetts Democrat, Congress\u2019s leading critic of Wall Street, said she would stand fast against changing laws to roll back consumer protection or to help big banks.Ms. Warren\u2019s remarks at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CFO Network Annual Meeting came a day after the Trump administration unveiled a road map for easing regulatory requirements for all types of financial institutions.\u201cThere are places where we should do targeted changes in laws and regulations to make sure community banks don\u2019t have to endure regulations\u2026for problems like disrupting the entire U.S. economy when they really don\u2019t pose that kind of threat,\u201d Ms. Warren said.While House Republicans and the Trump administration have unveiled plans to unwind various postcrisis financial regulations, many of them require legislative actions that are only possible with the support of at least some Senate Democrats.

But only a handful of CEOs opted or were forced to take a break for nonmedical reasons.At least one company leader took a leave of absence because he was incarcerated, and then later returned.             Fog Cutter Capital Group Inc.,        FCCG -5.88%       owner of the Fatburger fast-food chain, announced a leave of absence for CEO Andrew Wiederhorn after he pleaded guilty to pension-law and income-tax felonies at a prior employer in June 2004.When Mr. Wiederhorn, the company\u2019s co-founder, began serving his 18-month sentence in August 2004, he kept his board seat. The company also changed his title to chief strategic officer. His leave lasted until October 2005, company regulatory filings stated.Mr. Kalanick wrote in an email to Uber\u2019s 12,000 employees on Tuesday that he would shift his responsibilities to his direct reports while he is away, stepping in only for major strategic decisions. The leave is necessary, the 40-year-old co-founder of the ride-hailing company said, \u201cto become the leader that this company needs.\u201d Mr. Kalanick is also grieving his mother, who died last month in a boating accident that also left his father seriously injured.Jeffrey Cohn,        managing director for global CEO succession planning at executive-recruitment firm DHR International, predicts Mr. Kalanick won\u2019t return, even though Mr. Kalanick and his allies have voting control of the company.\u201cIt takes years to become a good leader,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cohn said, adding that the CEO and fellow directors \u201cwill come to appreciate this fact during Travis\u2019s leave of absence.\u2019\u2019If Mr. Kalanick does return, his CEO role will be different, said Scott Eblin, an author and executive coach to senior executives at Fortune 500 companies. Mr. Kalanick announced his leave as Uber released some of the results of an investigation into its workplace culture by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder\u2019s       law firm.The recommendations, which include shifting some of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s responsibilities to other managers and holding senior executives more accountable for metrics such as addressing employee complaints and improving diversity, criticized Uber\u2019s work culture for reinforcing bad behavior.\u201cThe company needs to grow up, and that\u2019s what the recommendations are really about,\u201d Mr. Eblin said. \u201cKalanick will have to be the chief cultural officer as well as the chief executive officer.\u201dAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Few CEOs Ever Take a Leave for Nonmedical Reasons.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 16:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-rare-is-uber-chiefs-leave-extremely-1497387271", "news_title": "How Rare Is Uber Chief\u2019s Leave?

Morgan Chase                   & Co. Chief Executive       James Dimon\u2019s       shareholder letter earlier this year.\u201cThe road ahead remains long given the sluggish pace of personnel shifts, but these recommendations should be viewed as an undeniably positive policy signal for banks\u201d said       Isaac Boltansky,        an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading LLC, in a note to clients.Craig Phillips,        the counselor to the U.S. Treasury secretary who played a central role in drafting the report, presented the recommendations to a conference hosted by two bank trade groups Tuesday.\u201cThis is not a plan to help banks,\u201d but rather ideas meant to boost economic growth, he said. \u201cThere is a lot to do with regulatory overlap, fragmentation and duplication. This is one of the biggest issues,\u201d he added.Mr. Phillips told the assembled crowd to expect additional reports on other topics including unwinding failed firms, designating companies systemically important, nonbank financial services and markets oversight.Liberal lawmakers and advocacy groups said the recommendations would undermine protections against fraud and excessive risk-taking. Sen.       Sherrod Brown       of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said that of roughly 300 entities that the Treasury Department said it consulted for the report, 244 came from the banking industry. The report says officials met with the banks of all sizes as well as consumer groups and others.\u201cToo many hardworking Americans still haven\u2019t fully recovered from the financial crisis, and Washington should be focused on protecting them by holding Wall Street accountable, not doing its bidding,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a news release Monday.Senate Banking Committee Chairman       Mike Crapo       (R., Idaho) in a statement Tuesday welcomed \u201creasonable and meaningful recommendations to the existing, and all too often, one-size-fits-all regulatory landscape.\u201dMr. Crapo appeared at the banking conference and said he believed some of the report\u2019s recommendations requiring congressional approval could win bipartisan support, especially those affecting small and medium-size banks.Mr. Crapo also said he was open to a new idea raised in the Treasury\u2019s report: granting more power to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The council was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and empowered to watch over the stability of the financial system.The council includes the most powerful U.S. economic officials: the Treasury secretary, the chair of the Federal Reserve, and other top regulators.Republicans for years have talked about hamstringing or abolishing the council. The Treasury report said Congress should grant it the power to assign a \u201clead regulator\u201d to make decisions about policy matters involving multiple federal agencies.Mr. Mnuchin has already used his position as chair of the council to push regulators to begin a review of the Volcker rule, a Dodd-Frank provision banning banks from certain types of trading, according to people familiar with the matter. That rule is enforced by five regulatory agencies, all of which have seats on the council.\u201cI don\u2019t like to generally consolidate even more power in such a powerful entity,\u201d Mr. Crapo said. \u201cHowever, we are running into situations where the law gives up to five agencies the authority to administer one statute and they can\u2019t even get a consistent rule.\u201dTreasury\u2019s suggestion \u201cmight be the right way to approach it,\u201d he said.\u2014Andrew Ackerman and Rachel Witkowski contributed to this article.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Bank Plan Heralds End Of Crisis Era.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 16:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-report-raises-expectations-era-of-increased-oversight-is-over-1497386822", "news_title": "Trump Administration\u2019s Bank Plan Heralds End of Crisis Era", "keywords": "banking,congress,financial regulation,finreg,increased,oversight,regulators,too big to fail,J.P.

BA 1.27%       said it is removing a layer of executives from its defense business this year in response to government criticism that slow decision making has hurt its chances of winning big contracts from the Pentagon.The world\u2019s second-largest defense contractor by revenues is chasing a big win to maintain its production lines and engineering workforce, having suffered sobering losses such as its failed pursuit in 2015 to build the new Air Force B-21 bomber.Leanne Caret,        president of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in an interview that the restructuring announced\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0wasn\u2019t driven by a particular contract loss, but the company recognized it couldn\u2019t afford to stand still as rivals including             Lockheed Martin Corp.        LMT 1.35%      ,             Northrop Grumman Corp.       and             Raytheon Co.        RTN 0.61%       returned to growth on the back of winning big long-term contracts.Boeing\u2019s defense revenues have fallen over the past three years, but it\u2019s been more profitable than its commercial jetliner business and expansion is central to efforts to boost company margins to the midteens from around 10% at present.The company has already cut jobs and moved the defense unit\u2019s headquarters close to the Pentagon from its longtime home in St. Louis, Mo. She said feedback from the Defense Department indicated the need for Boeing to become more agile.It\u2019s cutting the number of management layers to six or less, with more program leaders reporting direct to the president of the division, and it will cut or downgrade around 50 executive positions.\u201cThere was the culmination of not winning,\u201d Ms. Caret said, with frustration at the absence of a big new program that could sustain the business for years or even decades.For instance, Boeing and partner Lockheed Martin were ultimately undercut on price by Northrop in the B-21 contest. It\u2019s a program expected to cost $80 billion which could sustain the winner for more than a decade.Like its rivals, Boeing has found the Pentagon\u2019s selection process for big new contracts has become more fickle. Proposal documents can run to thousands of pages, and competing offerings often have only tiny differences in their technical merits.\u201cThen it\u2019s a price competition,\u201d said Ms. Caret, with a premium placed on companies that can quickly respond to any changes required by the Pentagon.The defense unit will be restructured around four smaller entities covering military aircraft, rotorcraft, autonomous systems and space and missile systems.Ms. Caret said she expected the changes to make Boeing more competitive in three big ongoing contests for fleets of new Air Force training and surveillance jets, as well as replacing land-based nuclear missiles. \u201cThis is affecting the executive ranks, not the engineers and technicians on the floor,\u201d she said.The restructuring is also directed at longer-term opportunities such as revamping military helicopters and developing new unmanned undersea vehicles for the Navy.While there\u2019s concern about Boeing\u2019s ability to win new weapons\u2019 platforms, the existing business has outperformed management expectations over the past year, potentially preserving two combat jet lines that had been earmarked for potential closure by the end of the decade.Sales still dipped 3% in 2016 to $29.5 billion last year, some 31% of group revenue, though the backlog of new business climbed to $63 billion at the end of the first quarter, more than a third of it from overseas customers.

It became iconic as autonomous-car development heated up and a symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s assault on the automotive industry.The move confirms that Alphabet\u2019s driverless-car unit Waymo\u00a0has come to terms with the high regulatory and societal hurdles of selling vehicles without traditional controls.

In March, Hexagon Chief Executive\u00a0      Ola Roll\u00e9n      \u00a0was indicted on insider-trading charges\u00a0related to an outside investment. The company said it continues to support Mr.\u00a0Roll\u00e9n, who denies wrongdoing, and he remains CEO. Meanwhile, Melker Sch\u00f6rling, whose company is Hexagon\u2019s largest shareholder, recently stepped down as chairman of Hexagon due to health issues. As of May 31, Melker Sch\u00f6rling AB\u00a0owned more than 25% of Hexagon\u2019s stock and nearly half its voting rights.Should there be a sale, it would be substantial: Stockholm-based Hexagon had \u20ac3.15 billion ($3.5 billion) in revenue last year and sports a market value of about 130 billion Swedish kronor ($15 billion).The company develops information-technology tools used by industrial companies to boost productivity and quality.\u00a0Its technology has been used to guide construction of New York City\u2019s One World Trade Center and to improve vehicle assembly at             Volkswagen AG      , according to\u00a0Hexagon\u2019s website.Big industrial companies on both sides of the Atlantic have been trying to position themselves as more technology-oriented and digitize their operations. That could make Hexagon attractive to a number of large industrial concerns.Industrial technology has been a hot area for mergers and acquisitions of late. Earlier this year, Germany\u2019s             Siemens AG       bought industrial-software provider Mentor Graphics Corp. for more than $4 billion. Last year,             Honeywell International Inc.       bought supply-chain and warehouse-automation company Intelligrated Inc. for $1.5 billion. Honeywell\u2019s new CEO       Darius Adamczyk       has said he wants the company to focus more on software.Hexagon wouldn\u2019t come cheap. It trades at a high-teens multiple of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and may not agree to a sale if a big enough bid doesn\u2019t materialize.The company has about 17,000 employees in 50 countries. Half of its sales come from its so-called geospatial enterprise solutions business, which makes sensors and software for infrastructure and construction projects and caters to mining, agriculture and public-safety customers. The other half is derived from Hexagon\u2019s industrial enterprise solutions business, which helps clients with measurement and quality inspection and makes software used to design, construct and operate industrial plants and offshore facilities.Mr. Roll\u00e9n has served as president and CEO of Hexagon since 2000, and during his tenure the company\u2019s value has soared.

They could announce Wednesday, after a two-day policy meeting, that they have adopted the plan and give new details of how it would work.But the Fed\u2019s plans are only partly priced into Treasury and mortgage-bond markets, according to most of the respondents to a survey of 107 market participants by MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC. The group polled included 21 of the 53 firms the Fed reaches in its surveys of bond brokers and asset managers.About 50% said the plans weren\u2019t at all priced into stocks, and 42% said they weren\u2019t at all priced into credit markets.\u201cHardly anyone in our survey said it\u2019s fully priced into any market,\u201d said Laura Rosner, senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives in New York and a former senior economist at BNP Paribas SA, a French bank.That sets up the risk of an adverse market reaction if the Fed doesn\u2019t successfully communicate its policy plans before it begins the process.These implications stem from the firm\u2019s first quarterly survey of market participants since it was formed this year by       Julia Coronado,        a former chief U.S. economist at BNP. The poll was designed to mimic the New York Fed surveys of bond brokers and investors ahead of Fed policy meetings, while capturing a broader range of noneconomist views, Ms. Rosner said.The survey was conducted June 2-8. MacroPolicy Perspectives plans to conduct similar polls quarterly, ahead of Fed meetings that are scheduled to be followed by press conferences.Some 54% of respondents said they believe the Fed will announce in September when it plans to start reducing its holdings, while 31% said the announcement likely would come in December.Just 6% expected the Fed to make changes this week to its current policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds into new bonds.In a Wall Street Journal survey in May, most economists predicted the Fed would start unwinding the portfolio before year-end. Some 40% said the Fed would take action on the balance sheet in December, and another 18% said the Fed would move sooner than December.The central bank has taken pains to clarify it will shrink its $4.5 trillion holdings, or balance sheet, very gradually, to avoid prompting investors to dump bonds en masse.Under the plan being considered, the Fed would set caps on the amount of bonds it allowed to mature per month, and raise them each quarter. The Fed hasn\u2019t said what those limits would be.The\u00a0survey found little consensus about the likely levels of the caps when they are fully phased in. Nearly a third of respondents, 30.5%, weren\u2019t sure what the final Treasury caps would be. Of those who had an opinion, the median response was $30 billon.The Fed hasn\u2019t said how big the portfolio is likely to be by the end of the process. Most survey respondents expected a $2 trillion to $2.9 trillion Fed balance sheet when the Fed is finished. But a large subset of noneconomists said they thought it could end up at $1 trillion to $1.9 trillion.On borrowing costs, nearly all, 97%, of the survey respondents expected the Fed to lift its benchmark federal-funds rate Wednesday.The economists generally expected more rate increases through next year than the noneconomists.The economists predicted the Fed would raise rates three times this year, in quarter-percentage-point increments, and three times next year, in line with Fed officials\u2019 March projections. Noneconomists\u2019 median forecast was for three such moves this year, but just 1\u00bd next year.The Fed has convinced investors it will raise rates this week, \u201cbut now they need to work really hard to push up the probability of more hikes after the June meeting,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief economist at             Deutsche Bank AG      . While the Fed has penciled in three rate increases for 2017 and three next year, \u201cthe market just doesn\u2019t believe\u201d it, he said.Write to Katy Burne at katy.burne@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 16:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/survey-shows-fed-balance-sheet-reduction-not-priced-into-markets-1497384063", "news_title": "Survey Shows Fed Balance-Sheet Reduction Not Priced Into Markets", "keywords": "Federal Reserve,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,surveys,polls,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "OAKLAND, Calif.\u2014Steve Kerr ran into Stephen Curry hours after the Golden State Warriors won the NBA championship on Monday night. His shirt was soaked in champagne. His shorts were stained with cigar ash. Kerr was impressed.\u201cYou already got a stogie?\u201d he said.There was nobody on the Warriors, not even Kevin Durant, who deserved that stogie more than Curry. It has somehow become overlooked, but this championship team primed to become a dynasty wouldn\u2019t exist if it weren\u2019t for Curry. He\u2019s still the player who makes the Warriors make sense.Curry was on the Warriors before the owners bought the team, before the executives built the team and before Kerr coached the team. He was on the Warriors before anyone in the locker room on Monday night played for that team. He was on the Warriors before Klay Thompson, before Draymond Green and long before Durant. They were only there because he was there first.But something unusual happened to Curry this season. The league\u2019s reigning most valuable player became undervalued.There were times this season, especially in the playoffs and even in the Finals, when he made people remember that nothing in sports is more exciting than Curry seizing control of a game. It\u2019s the thrill of watching a genius at work. But he wasn\u2019t as magical this year as he was last year, and there were other players, even on his own team, who commanded more attention on a nightly basis. And yet this year\u2019s Warriors were better than last year\u2019s Warriors for a simple reason. Curry\u2019s lack of ego allowed them to be.\u201cWhen the lead singer in the band is the most humble, how can the guitarist act like he\u2019s better than anybody else?\u201d said Bob Myers, the team\u2019s president of basketball operations. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes us tick in a lot of ways.\u201dGolden State\u2019s delegation that pitched Durant last summer, after their 73-win season was spoiled in the Finals by the Cleveland Cavaliers, included owners, executives, coaches and the four other players in the small-ball lineup that all but won Game 5 on Monday night. Nobody in that room, though, was as important as Curry.The obvious question when they arrived was if the players\u2014and one player in particular\u2014really wanted Durant on their team. It seemed like adding truffles to foie gras. What they had was rich enough already. They didn\u2019t need him. So why did they want him?It\u2019s hard now to remember the heights that Curry had reached then. He was the league\u2019s unanimous most valuable player. There wasn\u2019t a single voter who believed anyone else in the NBA had a better season. There wasn\u2019t even a talking head on television who argued otherwise. That\u2019s how obvious it was. Curry inspired consensus among people who are paid to be contrarian.What he did will go down as one of the greatest individual seasons for one of the greatest teams of all time. And not long afterward he flew across the country to make sure it would never happen again. The meeting between Durant and the Warriors may have changed the next several years of the NBA, but the most remarkable thing about the meeting is that it happened in the first place.Curry wanted Durant as his teammate, he explained in a text message, because he wanted to win championships. Curry got what he wanted. Then he got what he really wanted.\u201cThe pursuit of Kevin says it all,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about winning, and it\u2019s all about team. Unfortunately, that stands out in today\u2019s era. But it does. In an era when your individual success is something put above your team\u2019s, I don\u2019t think he subscribes to that.\u201dCurry\u2019s willingness to make room for Durant wasn\u2019t the only reason the Warriors could sign him. It also helped that Curry was a bargain himself. His contract was a four-year deal worth $44 million\u2014less than eight players in the NBA Finals\u2014while his next contract will almost certainly be a five-year deal worth more than $200 million.But it was his discount that let the Warriors keep Green and Thompson and sign Durant last summer. They could afford four stars because one of them wasn\u2019t paid like a star. Curry was still paid like a Plumlee brother.Durant moving to the Bay Area meant things were going to be different for Curry. There were the big things, like Curry\u2019s scoring average (30.1 to 25.3 points per game) and his MVP votes (all 131 last season to likely 0 this season), but also the small things behind the scenes.Curry usually shoots on a specific hoop after Golden State practices. Durant migrated there after several months. Before long they were competing with each other and making each other better. By the Finals, Curry and Durant\u2019s shooting contests were a sight to behold.Their play on the court followed the same progression. First they learned to share a basket. Then they began pushing each other and playing better together. By the Finals, Curry and Durant were a sight to behold.Durant, the MVP of the Finals, averaged 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game. Curry averaged 26.8 points, 9.4 assists and 8 rebounds per game. They each shot better with the other on the court. But it was in the clinching Game 5 when they were both at their best playing off each other in pick-and-rolls, because it turns out that pick-and-rolls with Curry and Durant are hard for human beings to defend.That\u2019s why the single biggest strategic adjustment after Golden State\u2019s only playoff loss was unleashing Curry to be more aggressive. In the first four Finals games, Curry averaged 294 dribbles, according to the NBA\u2019s tracking data. In Game 5, he dribbled 495 times. He also had 10 assists and even five secondary assists. The Warriors\u2019 most reliable plays started with the ball in Curry\u2019s hands. He had to be selfish to be selfless.Durant understood by then why Golden State executives say the team\u2019s culture was shaped by Curry. He\u2019d become familiar with his quiet confidence. He appreciated what Curry had surrendered for Durant to be there. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a facade,\u201d he said. \u201cHe really is like that.\u201dWhile the playoffs revealed why the Warriors wanted Durant, they also showed how much they still needed Curry. Golden State was 19.1 points per 100 possessions better than opponents with Curry and 3.2 points worse than opponents without Curry. With him, they were the Warriors. Without him, they\u2019re the New York Knicks.That\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t a surprise the way Durant chose to celebrate his first championship. He congratulated LeBron James. He hugged his mom. And then he went searching for Stephen Curry.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 15:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nba-dynasty-built-around-stephen-curry-1497383716", "news_title": "The NBA Dynasty Built Around Stephen Curry", "keywords": "basketball,curry,golden state warriors,kevin durant,nba,nba finals,steph curry,stephen curry,Golden State Warriors,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "A corporate dispute over a price-discount program for diabetes patients taking             Eli Lilly        LLY 0.63%       & Co.\u2019s insulin has resulted in an industry middleman\u2019s exit from the deal\u2014the latest sign of discord among players in a prescription-drug supply chain facing criticism for high prices.Blink Health LLC, a provider of consumer price discounts for prescription drugs, said it has terminated its relationship with             Express Scripts        ESRX -0.96%       Holding Co., a pharmacy-benefit manager that helped arrange the new price break for Lilly\u2019s insulin.Blink Health continues to offer the discount program at participating pharmacies in partnership with Lilly, Blink Health Chief Executive       Geoffrey Chaiken       said in an interview Tuesday. He said he couldn\u2019t discuss specific reasons for the termination of the agreement with Express Scripts, which was recent.\u201cWe\u2019ve built a business model where we are the agents of the patient and we have a responsibility to those patients to get them the lowest prices possible, and we only want to work with folks that are aligned with those values,\u201d Mr. Chaiken said.An Express Scripts spokesman said the company disagreed with Mr. Chaiken\u2019s assertion and that Express Script\u2019s \u201centire business and mission are predicated upon lowering the price of medicine.\u201dThe Express Scripts spokesman said Blink Health \u201casked to terminate their agreement with us after they failed to live up to the contractual agreements they had struck with us. We agreed to allow the agreement to be terminated.\u201d Express Scripts, which administers prescription coverage on behalf of employers and insurers, arranged with Lilly to extend the discounts through Blink until the end of this year, \u201cunless Blink elects to terminate the Lilly discounts sooner,\u201d the Express Scripts spokesman said.An Eli Lilly spokesman said the company\u2019s insulin remains available at the same discounts through Blink Health and declined to comment on the Blink-Express Scripts dispute.Lilly, Express Scripts and Blink Health touted the insulin discount program as a partnership when it was announced in December. The program was designed for uninsured patients and others paying for insulin largely out-of-pocket, such as those with high deductible health-insurance plans. The program offers discounts of up to 40% off the list prices of the insulins Humalog, Humulin and Basaglar. Patients receive the discounts through Blink Health\u2019s mobile and web applications and take them to participating pharmacies to get their insulin.Express Scripts said in December it negotiated the insulin discounts on behalf of Blink Health.Earlier this year, in a move independent of the insulin deal,             Walgreens Boots Alliance                   pharmacies dropped out of Blink Health\u2019s network. Blink Health still has more than 57,000 participating pharmacies where patients can get the Blink discounts on Lilly\u2019s insulin and other drugs, Mr. Chaiken said.As criticism of drug prices mounts, industry players have become increasingly willing to point fingers at each other over who is most to blame. Drug companies and others have accused pharmacy-benefit managers such as Express Scripts of not passing along to consumers the discounts they negotiate with drugmakers. PBMs say they help reduce drug costs, and blame manufacturers for raising list prices.Last year, health insurer             Anthem Inc.sued Express Scripts for about $15 billion in damages, alleging that the PBM violated their contract through excessive drug charges and failures in its operations. Express Scripts has denied the allegations; the suit is pending.Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 15:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blink-health-terminates-pact-with-express-scripts-for-lilly-insulin-price-discounts-1497383561", "news_title": "Blink Health Terminates Pact With Express Scripts for Lilly Insulin Price Discounts ", "keywords": "basaglar,blink health,eli lilly insulin,express scripts holding,humalog,humulin,insulin discount,insulin pricing,Express Scripts Holding,ESRX,Eli Lilly ,LLY,Blink Health,corporate,industrial news,supply chain,political,general news,consumer deals,diabetes,health,medical conditions,personal finance,consumer spending,budgeting,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences,healthcare support services,pharmacy benefit management"}, {"content": "As office tenants go, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ranks high on the list.That is the takeaway from the expected sale in the coming months of a Salt Lake City office building that is 100% occupied by an FBI field office.

That\u2019s compared with 200 per 100,000 in large urban counties and 178 per 100,000 in suburban areas.\u201cMost people associate higher incarceration rates with big cities because that\u2019s been the narrative for a long time,\u201d said Ram Subramanian of the Vera Institute. \u201cThe big takeaway from this report is that even though some of these rural jails are small, when you multiply those numbers by 2,000 counties, you have a lot of people sitting around in jail.\u201dResearchers defined a county as urban if it is one of the core counties in a metropolitan area with a population of one million or more. Suburban counties are the other counties in that metropolitan area. Rural counties are outside of metropolitan areas and have populations of less than 50,000 people. That is the largest category of counties, with more than 1,900 in the U.S., and rural counties host the greatest number of jails.The report\u2019s findings come as more states, led by both Democrats and Republicans lawmakers, are trying to curb costly prison populations by reducing sentences and increasing opportunities for parole and probation. The Trump administration, however, is moving in the opposite direction, pushing more aggressive charging policies that are expected to fuel a 2% increase in the prison population.Another reason for the rise in rural jail populations is that more jails, particularly in the South and West, are renting out beds and even expanding to accommodate the overflow of overcrowded facilities run by federal, state and other local governments.The number of people in jail who aren\u2019t under that jail\u2019s jurisdiction has grown 888% in rural areas between 1973 and 2013, according to the report. Rates in urban areas increased 134% while rates in suburbs rose 409%.In Louisiana, roughly half of the prison population is held in local lockups run by sheriffs, who receive $24.39 a day for each inmate. The state turned to sheriffs\u2019 facilities because it couldn't housing the swelling population in its own prisons.Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, said the report shows the need for more investment in rural jails. Most of the association\u2019s 3,000-plus members serve in rural and suburban areas.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise that rural jails have been underfunded and under-resourced for years,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lag of capital investment across the country.\u201dThe report\u2019s authors also say that many rural counties, because of limited tax revenue, struggle to keep up with the demands of the criminal-justice system, leaving people to linger in jail. There are fewer judges to process cases and fewer opportunities for pretrial services or alternatives to incarceration, they say. Some rural counties only hold court hearings weekdays until 5 p.m., while in Manhattan, arraignment courts are open until 1 a.m. every day.Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 15:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-growth-of-jail-populations-rural-areas-outpace-big-cities-1497383232", "news_title": "In Growth of Jail Populations, Rural Areas Outpace Big Cities", "keywords": " growing prison populations, incarceration rates, jail populations, jail research,rural areas,John D. and Catherine T.

Yields fall as bond prices rise.The 10-year yield fell for the first time in five sessions and traded near this year\u2019s low of 2.147% set on June 6.The price swing came as the Federal Reserve started its two-day monetary policy meeting. Policy makers are scheduled to release an interest-rate statement Wednesday afternoon, followed by a press conference from Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen.Investors expect the central bank to raise short-term interest rates a fourth time since the 2008 financial crisis. The key question is whether the Fed may raise rates one more time later this year as projected in March or stand pat, which would impact investors\u2019 wagers on Treasury bonds and other markets.The $12 billion sale of 30-year Treasury bonds drew the highest demand since March. The sales of three-year and 10-year notes on Monday also attracted solid buying interest home and abroad.The results surprised some bond traders and investors who had thought that demand could soften due to a jammed auction schedule and a looming expected rate increase from the Fed.Some money managers say the auctions underscore again U.S. government bonds\u2019 attractiveness in a low yield world, which many investors have cited as one factor that reduces the risk of a sharp rise.\u201cWith global bond yields so low, it keeps U.S. bond yields from rising too quickly,\u2019\u2019 said Brett Wander, chief investment officer of fixed income at Charles Schwab Investment Management. \u201cThis factor continues to remain in place.\u201dU.S. bonds are a bargain in the developed world. The 10-year German bund yielded only 0.265% Tuesday, the 10-year government bond in Japan yielded 0.069% and the 10-year U.K. gilt yielded 1.033%, according to Tradeweb.A massive pool of negative-yielding government bonds in Japan and Europe driven by unconventional bond-buying monetary stimulus highlights global investors\u2019 struggle to get income and drives money flowing into Treasurys.The amount of global negative-yielding sovereign debt outstanding rose substantially to $9.5 trillion as of May 31, from $8.6 trillion on March 1, according to a report from Fitch Ratings Tuesday.Traders say Treasury auction results also reflect a view in the bond market that after a possible rate increase this month, the Fed could hold off raising rates further during the second half of this year.Recent reports showing slowing inflation pressure have bolstered speculation that the Fed would be slow in raising rates. The Fed likely starts the process of unwinding its balance sheet later this year, and some investors see this as a substitute for rate increases.Some analysts warn that bond yields could rise if the Fed disappoints those who are looking for a more cautious tone from the central bank.\u201cThe bond market is underestimating the Fed\u2019s desire to raise rates,\u2019\u2019 said       Scott Clemons,        chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. He still expects the Fed to raise rates one more time later this year after a move in June.The 10-year Treasury yield had risen to 2.227% earlier Tuesday after the producer-price index for final demand excluding food and energy grew 0.3% in May from the prior month. Economists had expected a 0.1% gain. From a year earlier, those core prices were up 2.1%, the strong gain since May 2012.The data was a departure from recent releases showing slowing inflation.The consumer-price index due Wednesday morning will be highly scrutinized by investors.

Kennedy International Airport over unpaid bills.Alitalia, which is working to find a buyer, sought chapter 15 protection, the section of the bankruptcy code that deals with international insolvencies, at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.Large foreign companies, particularly those with U.S. operations or dollar-denominated debt, often file for bankruptcy in the U.S. to aid sale or restructuring processes in their home countries. Like chapter 11, chapter 15 immediately halts lawsuits and blocks creditors from seizing assets.The carrier recently launched an insolvency process in Italy for the second time in a decade after employees rejected a restructuring plan put forward by its major shareholders.\u00a0Court papers filed\u00a0Monday\u00a0show Italy\u2019s government has agreed to provide about \u20ac600 million ($673 million) in emergency financing to keep the airline operating while it works to find a buyer.Alitalia has struggled to pay its bills and has lost billions of dollars over decades, amassing more than $3 billion in debt.According to Alitalia\u2019s court papers, one of       JFK\u2019s       terminal operators threatened to suspend the airline\u2019s lease as soon as Tuesday unless it was paid, which could have significantly disrupted the airline\u2019s business by cutting off daily flights to and from New York. Alitalia\u2019s U.S. operations account for about 30% of its total revenue, and about half of that is generated from flights to and from JFK.Alitalia also says it faced being cut off by internet and telephone service providers, which would have shut down its U.S. call center and other office activities.On Monday, Judge       Sean Lane,        who will oversee the airline\u2019s U.S. bankruptcy proceeding, issued a 10-day temporary restraining order to reinforce the court\u2019s ability to prevent any creditor from taking actions that could damage Alitalia\u2019s business before he holds a hearing on the matter\u00a0on June 26.Italy\u2019s government put the airline up for sale after months of fruitless talks with labor unions and the carrier\u2019s shareholders, including its biggest, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways.Three years ago, Etihad\u00a0unsuccessfully\u00a0poured in cash to refresh the carrier, retraining cabin crew and replacing fading interiors with Italian-designed leather seats.\u00a0But\u00a0Etihad, which owns 49% of the airline, has refused to put more cash into Alitalia without significant concessions from workers.Many of Europe\u2019s biggest airlines have ruled out making a bid, and non-European buyers are limited to minority stakes. That makes liquidation, a breakup or a major restructuring real possibilities.Alitalia has racked up years of losses amid competition from a swarm of budget airlines in Europe. Ireland\u2019s\u00a0        Ryanair Holdings              \u00a0PLC is now the biggest airline in Italy by passenger numbers.Court papers show Alitalia, which dates to 1947,\u00a0currently operates 123 aircraft, with about 4,200 flights a week to 94 destinations.

The visible police presence will last \u201cminimally\u201d through the upcoming weekend.\u201cWe are responsible for public safety in the city of Baltimore and we are going to keep working our hearts out until we get to a safer better place,\u201d Mr. Davis said. The stepped up patrols are meant \u201cto assure this city that its police department understands their frustration.\u201dAs of Tuesday morning, the city had recorded 158 homicides this year, up from 124 during the same period last year. At that pace, the city is on track to hit a record homicide rate in 2017.Homicides and shootings soared in 2015 after the death of       Freddie Gray       and a prosecutor\u2019s decision to charge six police officers in connection with his death. Mr. Gray died of injuries he sustained in police custody after he was arrested for allegedly possessing an illegal knife. Riots erupted on the day of his funeral. None of the officers were convicted.In April, a federal judge approved a legally binding overhaul of the Baltimore Police Department to address concerns about racially biased practices. The consent decree requires the Baltimore Police Department to enact new policies and training programs to ensure stops, searches and arrests are constitutional, and to use techniques to try to resolve incidents without force.Mr. Davis detailed separate shootings around the city on Monday night and Tuesday morning including one incident that left two people dead and two injured, in what he called an eruption of violence.\u201cIt is guns, gangs and drugs,\u201d said Mr. Davis.Baltimore has a long-running heroin problem that fentanyl, the much more potent synthetic opioid, has amplified. State data released last week showed 694 people in the city died from drug overdoses last year, compared with 393 a year prior. Deaths linked to fentanyl more than tripled to reach 419 in 2016.The commissioner said one factor contributing to the recent violence was the capture of 45 kilograms of fentanyl and heroin earlier this month.

And fans of this boundary-pushing gathering say that\u2019s half the fun. But for any such venture to succeed, the balance between welcome exposure to new frontiers and noble (sometimes ignoble) failures must be weighted toward the former. Even a spectacularly bad musical adventure can be forgiven when enough other things tilt the enterprise toward the positive.This year\u2019s Ojai festival\u2014the 71st, which, as ever, took place at the intimate, outdoor Libbey Bowl, and ran June 8 through 11\u2014had a tough time achieving that golden mean. There were a few outstanding performances, a number of moderately engaging ones, and too many experiences that tried a listener\u2019s patience. Responsibility for those choices lies with the festival\u2019s artistic director,       Thomas W. Morris       (13 years on the job), and with       Vijay Iyer,        the jazz pianist, composer and academic, this year\u2019s music director (the holder changes annually).Appointing a noted jazz performer to the latter position is a bold move for a festival primarily associated with classical music, albeit mostly of the modern sort. But Mr. Morris has previously filled the gig with other unconventional choices\u2014the choreographer Mark Morris (2013) and the stage director       Peter Sellars       (2016)\u2014and jazz is not unheard of at Ojai, though it has been scarce in recent decades.Yet by elevating jazz to a position of primacy while re-engaging several artists prominently featured at the festival last year and the year before, Ojai\u2019s decision-makers created an atmosphere in which much of the programming seemed either out of place or regurgitated. Mr. Iyer was a welcome new face who brought ethnic diversity as well as ample talent to Ojai. But seeing a former music director, the percussionist       Steven Schick       (2015), on stage more frequently than his successor undercut the message. To be fair, Mr. Iyer\u2019s music was abundantly represented, though not always well received, throughout the long weekend.The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was furthered by the return (for the third year in a row) of members of the versatile and virtuosic International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE), serving as the house band in all but name.       Claire Chase,        an ICE flutist as well as a flamboyant soloist, was among them, but her presence became unwelcome following a self-indulgent recital on Friday afternoon. Ms. Chase is immensely talented technically, but her showboating stage manner (silver metallic shorts over black leggings, awkward dance-like effects) and overreliance on a limited number of performance gimmicks didn\u2019t wear well. (Enough already with the amplified lip smacks!)An even more complicated situation arose with the return of the preternaturally gifted percussionist Tyshawn Sorey. It\u2019s hard to imagine a drummer of greater imagination and skill than Mr. Sorey. Even when surrounded by fellow virtuosos, he stands out. He was the clear favorite among the members of Mr. Iyer\u2019s all-star jazz sextet, which closed the festival on Sunday, and he elevated several earlier programs. Yet Mr. Sorey also composes, and his pieces dominated two afternoon bills. They were long, unvaried and pretentious.One of the most cherished performers on last year\u2019s roster, the great Indian singer Aruna Sairam, was back as well. She is a hypnotic vocalist and a charming, modest presence, but even with master tabla player       Zakir Hussain       (in his Ojai debut) by her side, one couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of \u201cbeen there, done that.\u201dYet one of the festival\u2019s two most compelling programs took something familiar\u2014very familiar\u2014and made us hear it anew through refashioning and recontextualization. Saturday night\u2019s double-bill paired       Stravinsky\u2019s       \u201cRite of Spring\u201d (in a reduced arrangement for 12 ICE players conducted by Mr. Schick with his trademark cool precision) with Mr. Iyer\u2019s \u201cRadhe Radhe: Rites of Holi\u201d (performed by a similar complement of ICE members in sync with       Prashant Bhargava\u2019s       joyous film of the Hindu spring festival).The other program that really resonated, also led by Mr. Schick, lacked such feral excitement but offered instead a thoughtful exploration of music closer to home.       George Lewis\u2019s       sui generis chamber opera \u201cAfterword\u201d (2015) chronicles the founding of the Chicago-based Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, of which Mr. Lewis is a proud member. Eschewing the genre\u2019s typically bold gestures and outsize emotions, this opera tells a complicated story of self-empowerment with laudable directness and simplicity, its three-member cast characterful and affecting.First-time performers at the festival were largely relegated to less prominent berths. On Thursday night,       Jennifer Koh       gave the premiere of Mr. Iyer\u2019s \u201cTrouble,\u201d a violin concerto in six parts, with Mr. Schick leading ICE and the Oberlin Contemporary Music Ensemble. Her performance remains in the memory for its energy and dazzle, even as Mr. Iyer\u2019s score doesn\u2019t. On Friday night, she followed Mr. Lewis\u2019s opera with a solo recital of Bach,       Luciano Berio,       Missy Mazzoli       and Esa-Pekka Salonen. Her technically flawless accounts flattered the newer works, less so Bach\u2019s D-minor Partita.A similar fate befell the Brentano Quartet, whose rendition of       Mozart\u2019s       String Quartet in E-flat major (K. 428) was dull on a Saturday-afternoon program that included lively readings of Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g\u2019s \u201cMoments Musicaux\u201d (2005) and Mr. Iyer\u2019s endearing \u201cMozart Effects\u201d (2011). But the group\u2019s late-night appearance on Friday with excerpts from Bach\u2019s \u201cArt of the Fugue\u201d rightly kept a large crowd spellbound.Next year, Ojai returns to a format more in keeping with its traditions, as the rising Moldovan-born violinist       Patricia Kopatchinskaja,        an Ojai novice, assumes the music directorship. To keep his festival fresh, Mr. Morris should make certain that other new faces join her.Mr. Mermelstein writes for the Journal on classical music and film.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 15:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasures-and-pitfalls-amid-musical-adventures-1497382915", "news_title": "Treasures and Pitfalls Amid Musical Adventures", "keywords": "arts in review, classical, jazz, ojai music festival,vijay iyer,political,general news,arts,entertainment,festivals,music"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The top House Republican tax legislator floated a five-year phase-in to his controversial \u201cborder adjustment\u201d idea\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0in a bid to blunt mounting opposition to the concept.The phase-in offered by Rep.       Kevin Brady       (R., Texas) is a response to critics who worry about the disruption that border adjustment could cause for companies, supply chains and consumers. It is a sign that Mr. Brady continues to press ahead with border adjustment and refine details of that plan rather than drop the proposal as some Republicans are urging.\u201cThis reflects really the input we\u2019ve gotten, the feedback we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Mr. Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said at the annual meeting of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CFO Network. \u201cA very gradual five-year phase in really resolves the major challenges.\u201dMr. Brady and House Speaker       Paul Ryan       are trying to advance their tax-policy vision in the face of unified Democratic resistance to tax cuts and steadily growing Republican concerns. They are aware of the objections and are talking to GOP senators and the White House. But until someone else presents an alternative, Messrs. Brady and Ryan see their plan as viable, and they are fleshing it out.Mr. Brady also said his plan would include targeted rules for the financial services, insurance, communications and digital-services industries.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to determine where\u2026the border begins in the cloud,\u201d he said.Mr. Brady\u2019s proposal for a 20% top corporate-tax rate includes border adjustment, which\u00a0exempts exports from U.S. taxation but\u00a0denies companies the ability to deduct import costs.Under the phase-in suggested by Mr. Brady, only 20% of import costs would be nondeductible in the first year of the new tax system, stepping up steadily each year until it reaches 100% in the fifth year. The tax exemption for exports would phase in on a parallel schedule. Mr. Brady said he was sensitive to long-term contracts and agreements denominated in dollars and wanted to give companies time to adjust.The phase-in likely isn\u2019t enough to soften or halt the opposition to border adjustment.\u201cChairman Brady\u2019s proposed five-year transition does nothing to change the harmful impact on consumers, it only delays the political consequences for lawmakers,\u201d said Joshua Baca, a spokesman for Americans for Affordable Products, a coalition of border-adjustment opponents. \u201cIt is past time for Chairman Brady to read the writing on the wall and sideline the Border Adjustment Tax so that our tax code can be reformed; otherwise, his actions serve no other purpose than to severely undercut a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201dOpponents warn that taxing imports would drive up consumer prices and they doubt that currencies would adjust to offset the tax changes as quickly and smoothly as some economists project.If the currency did adjust quickly, with the dollar rising as much as 25%, importers would get a windfall benefit in the early years from cheaper foreign products and then lose that edge as the border adjustment takes effect.Border adjustments aren\u2019t new. They are a core feature of value-added taxes around the world. But no country has tried the border-adjusted corporate tax that Republicans are proposing, and the plan, if it ever became law, could trigger retaliation from other countries and a challenge at the World Trade Organization.The issue has fractured the U.S. corporate world into competing coalitions with companies such as             Eli Lilly                   & Co. and             Oracle Corp.       backing border adjustment and firms like             Macy\u2019s Inc.       and             Best Buy Co.       opposing it.The American Made Coalition, which backs border adjustment, said Tuesday that it wanted Congress and the administration to keep working toward what it called a level playing field.\u201cIt is unfortunate that some groups remain committed to sinking tax reform at every turn rather than work on ways to fix a broken system that hurts American workers,\u201d said John Gentzel, a coalition spokesman. \u201cWe applaud Chairman Brady for his steadfast commitment to comprehensive tax reform.\u201dThe idea has steadily lost support since Mr. Brady first pitched it in June 2016. It now seems nearly impossible for border adjustment to pass the Senate, and there\u2019s even opposition from several Republicans on Mr. Brady\u2019s committee.The disagreement over border adjustment is one of several major obstacles standing in the way of Republicans\u2019 goal of rewriting the tax code this year. They still express public confidence despite a lack of unity on this item and other major proposals to offset the budgetary effect of tax rate cuts.But Mr. Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) have clung to border adjustment for several reasons. First, it would generate up to $1 trillion over a decade to offset rate cuts, though the phased-in approach would lower that number. According to the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning group, the phase-in would lower the revenue from border adjustment to $1.027 trillion from $1.244 trillion.And second, border adjustment plays an important role in the way the U.S. taxes foreign income. Republicans and large corporations generally want what\u2019s known as a territorial system, in which the U.S. would stop taxing its companies\u2019 foreign income.But that has to be paired with some rule to prevent companies from shifting their U.S. profits to low-tax jurisdiction. Otherwise, much of the corporate tax base could flee.In the Ryan-Brady plan, border adjustment serves that function. That is because taxes are based not on where profits are earned, which is a definition that companies have learned to manipulate.

While the decision is only immediately applicable to Winn-Dixie, Ms. Vu said, it sends a signal to other companies that \u201cthere\u2019s a very real possibility a judge could find this way.\u201dWinn-Dixie\u2019s vice president of corporate and consumer affairs,       Anna Kelly,        said the company is disappointed with the ruling and plans to appeal. \u201cWhile we are sensitive to the needs of the visually impaired and are currently improving our website, the legal position regarding website standards are unclear and we believe improvement can be achieved through customer dialogue, rather than through the courts,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. The chain has nearly 500 stores in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.Juan Carlos Gil,        a legally blind Florida resident, sued Winn-Dixie last year, claiming he couldn\u2019t access store coupons or fill prescriptions on the chain\u2019s website because it didn\u2019t comport with screen-reader technology that rapidly reads the text of websites aloud. Mr. Gil, who is also wheelchair-bound because of cerebral palsy, has sued several dozen businesses over website and physical accessibility issues.U.S. District Judge       Robert Scola      ruled Tuesday that Winn-Dixie violated the ADA because its website \u201chas denied Gil the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations that Winn-Dixie offers to its sighted customers.\u201d The judge said the website falls under the ADA because it is closely integrated with the physical locations and a gateway to the stores. He ordered Winn-Dixie to pay Mr. Gil\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and to agree on a plan to upgrade the website.The ruling is \u201cgoing to send a message clear and wide in this country that the ADA doesn\u2019t stop at the storefront,\u201d said       Scott Dinin,        a Florida lawyer who represents Mr. Gil.The lawsuit is believed to be the first website accessibility case to go to trial. Judge Scola heard testimony last week from an outside expert hired by the plaintiff who said he could make the grocery chain\u2019s website accessible for $37,000. A Winn-Dixie representative said in trial they\u2019ve set aside $250,000 to make the site more accessible.Either dollar figure, Judge Scola wrote, pales in comparison to the $2 million Winn-Dixie spent to launch its website and $7 million spent in the past year on website upgrades for a new rewards program.Anastasia Protopapadakis,        a Florida lawyer with GrayRobinson PA who represents companies in ADA suits, said the website accessibility cases \u201care still being filed in rapid order\u201d and that while the initial rounds focused on sight-impaired plaintiffs, the latest lawsuits are now brought by hearing-impaired individuals taking issue with video streaming and other functions.At least 350 website-related disability-access lawsuits had been filed in federal court from 2015 through January of this year, according to       Seyfarth Shaw.Write to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 15:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/judges-ruling-aids-push-to-make-consumer-websites-accessible-to-blind-1497382218", "news_title": "Judge Backs Making Consumer Websites Accessible to Blind ", "keywords": " ada, americans with disabilities act , blind, deaf,disabled,Winn-Dixie Stores,Seyfarth,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,food retailing,supermarkets,grocery stores,specialty stores,legal services,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "A St. Louis man pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to cyberstalking and making hoax bomb threats\u00a0Tuesday, admitting he had menaced Jewish centers nationwide.Juan Thompson,        32 years old, made at least 12 fake threats to Jewish organizations and community centers, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said.\u00a0 Mr. Thompson formerly worked for the Intercept, an online news publication, which has said it fired him after discovering he fabricated sources and quotes.\u201cThompson\u2019s threats not only inflicted emotional distress on his victim, but also harmed Jewish communities around the country,\u201d       Joon Kim,        the acting Manhattan U.S. attorney, said in a written statement.Mr. Thompson faces up to five years in prison on each count, prosecutors said.Attorneys for Mr. Thompson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.In July, Mr. Thompson began harassing an ex-girlfriend by making threats in her name, prosecutors said.

The decision draws a sharp distinction between the new Xbox and rival PlayStation 4 machines from             Sony Corp.At a launch event Sunday, Microsoft said the Xbox One X, known as \u201cProject Scorpio\u201d while in development, will support 4K high-definition gaming and backward compatibility. The machine will launch Nov. 7 and cost $499--$100 more than Sony\u2019s high-end PlayStation 4 Pro, which made its debut last fall.Virtual reality never came up. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Xbox marketing chief Mike Nichols said VR is more popular and better-suited for personal computers than consoles. \u201cThe opportunity on PC is larger, because the install base is larger and we think the customer experience will be better on PC,\u201d he said.The VR omission was jarring considering Microsoft\u2019s E3 presentation last year left viewers with the impression Project Scorpio would hook up to a high-end headset, with many speculating on compatibility with             Facebook Inc.\u2019s       Oculus Rift. Mr. Nichols blamed that on poor messaging around the console\u2019s power.Microsoft said it is focusing on supporting mixed reality, which blends the digital and real world, through products such as its own HoloLens.Still, the decision could prove a wise hedge as VR has been slow to take off, at least with console and PC gamers. Sony earlier this month said it has sold about one million units of its PlayStation VR since October, while research firms estimate Facebook\u2019s Oculus and             HTC Corp.\u2019s       Vive lag behind in sales despite being on the market since spring 2016.\u201cMicrosoft apparently doesn\u2019t believe the benefits of building their own VR platform justify the cost,\u201d said       Colin Sebastian,        an analyst at R.W. Baird. \u201cThey may lose some users on the margin, but we do not believe a lack of VR in the near-term will meaningfully impact sales.\u201dOne major criticism of VR games is that many play as short demos rather than full experiences. A dearth of hit apps may be a deterrent for Microsoft, MKM Partners analyst       Eric Handler       said. \u201cThere is not enough content for in home VR at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cVR won\u2019t be relevant for several years. Why bother at this point?\u201dThe high price tag for the Xbox One X, however, is a concern for some analysts, especially given the             Nintendo Co.launched its Switch at $299 and the foothold the PlayStation 4 Pro already has.

Those results were for 2015 models, while 2014 models had \u201csignificantly increased\u201d emissions on the road compared with the lab, the report said.The 74-page report, expected to be released in coming weeks, tested five model-year 2014 and 2015 vehicles and found significant emissions discrepancies between on-road performance and lab tests, despite Fiat Chrysler\u2019s attempts last year to address the excess pollution in part through a recall of 2014 models. The report stopped short of concluding whether the Italian-U.S. auto maker used illegal software meant to dupe regulators.The findings add to mounting pressure on Fiat Chrysler, which the U.S. Justice Department in May accused of using illegal defeat-device software on nearly 104,000 2014-2016 Ram pickup trucks and Jeep Grand Cherokees with diesel engines to cheat emissions tests. The models used software to pass government emissions tests and then turned down or shut off controls to let the vehicles emit illegally high levels of pollution, according to a Justice Department civil lawsuit filed against the auto maker. Fiat Chrysler has denied using defeat devices.Fiat Chrysler disputed the university findings, pointing to factors in on-road testing that allegedly skewed the results. The auto maker pointed to the university researchers conducting on-road tests that departed from U.S. environmental regulators\u2019 test procedures by being done at 50% higher average speeds, with 600 to 700 pounds more payload and under dissimilar road conditions.U.S. regulatory tests are limited to the lab, and Fiat Chrysler contends on-road testing results are problematic absent agreed-upon standards.\u201cEach of the above may increase emissions readings, therefore rendering invalid a comparison of on-road and off-road test results,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding that the factors make comparisons misleading. The auto maker also took issue with researchers procuring parts from a salvage yard for aspects of its testing.Fiat Chrysler attempted to discuss the findings in detail with university researchers to no avail, the company said.\u201cWe stand by the research and the results,\u201d a university spokesman said. \u201cThere is no question in our mind of the integrity of the report and the results we reported.\u201dFiat Chrysler in its statement claimed the research \u201cappears to have been commissioned by a plaintiffs\u2019 law firm for the purposes of litigation.\u201d According to people familiar with the matter, former Wall Street investment banking executives are among the backers of the research through an outside firm.The Justice Department lawsuit\u2019s formal accusation that Fiat Chrysler used illegal software went further than a violation notice the Environmental Protection Agency delivered to the auto maker earlier this year. The EPA in January said the auto maker failed to disclose auxiliary emission-control devices, rendering them unlawful. Adding defeat-device violations could push penalties against Fiat Chrysler above $8 billion, far higher than the $4.6 billion the EPA previously estimated.It isn\u2019t clear whether the government will pursue penalties that high. Volkswagen, though agreeing to billions of dollars in legal settlements, ultimately paid less than the maximum fines to address regulators\u2019 accusations.Fiat Chrysler, which has offered a fix it believes will address regulators\u2019 concerns, has denied using defeat devices and expressed disappointment in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to sue. Responding to the suit in May, Fiat Chrysler said it would \u201cdefend itself vigorously, particularly against any claims that the company engaged in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests.\u201dFiat Chrysler previously recalled 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Ram pickups with diesel engines to replace the select catalytic converter in an effort to address \u201cwashcoat degradation\u201d that could lead to excess emissions. West Virginia University researchers found the Jeeps\u2019 emissions improved after the recall, though they were still elevated. The emissions performance of the Ram trucks didn\u2019t significantly change after the recall, the researchers found.The recall \u201cdefinitely didn\u2019t fix the problem,\u201d said       Dan Carder,        director of West Virginia University\u2019s Center for Alternative Fuels Engines and Emissions, adding the discrepancies researchers observed were similar to those when he tested Volkswagen vehicles later discovered to be equipped with illegal emissions-cheating software.Mr. Carder and other university researchers didn\u2019t evaluate whether the Fiat Chrysler vehicles also contained defeat-device software. Still, \u201cwhen you see differences, it\u2019s suggesting there are control strategies that are making emissions controls perform differently in the test [lab] than in the field,\u201d he said.Volkswagen pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to financial penalties earlier this year to settle a Justice Department probe, admitting it had conspired for nearly a decade to rig nearly 600,000 vehicles with defeat devices that circumvented government test procedures and deceived U.S. officials.Combined with civil settlements among consumers, regulators, dealers and state attorneys general, Volkswagen\u2019s environmental transgressions could cost it more than $25 billion in the U.S. alone depending on how many vehicles the auto maker repurchases. Volkswagen still faces scrutiny from German investigators.Mr. Carder and other West Virginia researchers found elevated emissions levels in diesel-powered Volkswagen vehicles in 2014, then shared their findings with U.S. and California environmental regulators. That eventually led to Volkswagen admitting to regulators it had used defeat devices, precipitating an unprecedented crisis at the auto maker.With the Fiat Chrysler research, Mr. Carder and others tested emissions levels during a variety of real-world driving conditions, including on highways and uphill trips at higher elevations. Those emissions levels were compared with those when vehicles were placed on a chassis dynamometer to simulate tests performed for government certification.Write to Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Emissions Study Hits Chrysler Diesels.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 14:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/west-virginia-university-researchers-find-fiat-chrysler-diesel-emissions-discrepancies-1497373409", "news_title": "West Virginia University Researchers Find Fiat Chrysler Diesel-Emissions Discrepancies ", "keywords": "chrysler,emissions,fiat,ram,report,software,west virginia,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,FCA.MI,FCAU,West Virginia University,Volkswagen,VOW.XE,Dan Carder,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,standards,standardization,corporate,industrial news,regulatory breach,cars,political,general news,education,living,lifestyle,university,college,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"}, {"content": "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s        BRK.B 0.52%       auto dealerships and recreational-vehicle manufacturer have violated Texas regulations and should lose their licenses, the enforcement division of the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles determined.Texas law prohibits auto dealerships and vehicle manufacturers from sharing ownership.

In a draft law, the European Commission also said that large, or \u201csystemic,\u201d clearinghouses operating outside the EU would be subject to tougher oversight including on-site inspections and access to financial accounts.While Tuesday\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t the nuclear option the U.K. had feared\u2014an automatic relocation of clearinghouses that clear lots of euro-denominated contracts\u2014it is a bold signal that the EU is prepared to play tough as Brexit negotiations begin.The proposed new supervisory powers give the EU more leverage to push clearing business into the bloc. It is the latest skirmish in an increasingly heated battle over thousands of jobs in the U.K.\u2019s financial center, across banking, insurance and asset management.\u201cAs we face the departure of the largest EU financial center, we need to make certain adjustments to our rules,\u201d said EU financial-services chief       Valdis Dombrovskis.A clearinghouse sits between the buyers and sellers of instruments such as commodities and derivatives, pledging to complete the deal even if one side reneges. This business deep inside the financial plumbing is one of London\u2019s crown jewels, attracting trillions of dollars of derivatives trades. The U.K.\u2019s know-how in clearing and settling those trades has in turn acted as a magnet for capital and expertise.In 2016 the U.K. cleared $1.18 trillion of interest-rate derivatives every day, making it the second-largest clearing location in the world after the U.S., according to the Bank for International Settlements.Now that position, built up over the last 50 years, is under threat.Britain currently clears more euro-denominated interest-rate derivatives than other EU countries combined\u2014about three-quarters of the EU total.European authorities fear that after Brexit, the U.K. won\u2019t be answerable to EU courts or regulators, a problem if a major London clearinghouse topples over. The biggest clearer of euro-denominated credit-default swaps, LCH. Clearnet Group Ltd., for instance, is based in London and wouldn\u2019t fall under EU supervision after Brexit.Under the proposed law, EU supervisors would tighten oversight and then decide whether to encourage big euro clearers to move into the trading bloc. If they don\u2019t comply, European banks that clear with them will get hit with an extra capital charge. This would choke off a chunk of their business.EU officials said Tuesday\u2019s proposal won\u2019t affect its current deal with the U.S., which took nearly four years to reach and allows U.S. entities like CME Group Inc. and             Intercontinental Exchange Inc.       to do business with European banks.The Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority will define what a \u201csystemic\u201d clearinghouse is, based on volumes and other criteria. The proposal would give clearinghouses 12 to 18 months to prepare to move their business.The ECB has previously sought to limit the clearing of euro contracts outside of the eurozone, but it was rebuffed by the European Court of Justice in 2015. The ECB didn\u2019t appeal the decision in what was largely seen as a political compromise with the Bank of England.Clearinghouses in London have argued that forcing them to move activities into the EU would push up the cost of clearing and potentially cause financial instability.\u201cIn taking steps to shift power away from U.K. clearing houses, the EU could damage itself unnecessarily,\u201d said Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, which promotes London as a financial center.The industry boomed when political leaders pushed clearing of over-the-counter derivatives onto clearinghouses in the wake of the financial turmoil triggered by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.The clearing battle comes as the U.K.\u2019s Brexit negotiations spin into disarray after last week\u2019s inconclusive general election in Britain. Talks between the two sides may not start next Monday as originally planned, Britain\u2019s Brexit minister said.That has raised the possibility that Britain might change course and maintain closer ties with the EU, analysts say. But amid the political uncertainty, bank executives are sticking with plans to shift activities out of the U.K, according to people familiar with the matter.Banks including             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. and Goldman Sachs are among those hunting for office space in Europe to ensure they can keep serving clients there after Brexit.

The application of the new rule should be \u201charmonized\u201d with bank regulators\u2019 supervisory efforts, Treasury said in a report outlining some potential efforts by the Trump administration to roll back financial regulations.The move essentially sides with criticism from some banks that the new loan-loss approach would be costly and burdensome for them, could deter them from making new loans, and would cut into their profits and capital levels. In April, the chief financial officers of 18 regional banks wrote to Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       asking him to intervene\u00a0in the implementation of\u00a0the new rule. The American Bankers Association also criticized the rule in a separate letter to Mr. Mnuchin, though the ABA didn\u2019t specifically ask Treasury to take any action.Some investor advocates fear the banks are trying to water down the rule, and that Treasury\u2019s move could inject political influence into the process. Treasury and banking regulators typically have no role in setting accounting rules, a process headed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board under the oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201cWhat the banks really want is to pick whatever number they would choose, regardless of whether or not it reflects reality,\u201d said       Lynn Turner,        a former SEC chief accountant.Treasury in its report didn\u2019t recommend that the loan-loss rule be revised or delayed. Wesley Bricker, the SEC\u2019s current chief accountant, had expressed concerns in May that banks\u2019 efforts to fight the rule could undermine the FASB\u2019s independence, but he said Tuesday that he was not concerned by the Treasury\u2019s recommendation, because it has to do only with how banks deal with the rule\u2019s impact.\u201cThere seems to be an assumption that the FASB rule will go into effect,\u201d Mr. Bricker said. \u201cI\u2019m OK with the concept of bank regulators looking at regulatory capital.\u201d\u200bHal Schroeder,        an FASB member, said that \u201cwe look forward to working with banking regulators and other stakeholders\u201d as they consider the impact of the new loan-loss rule.The rule, which FASB issued in June 2016, would require banks to immediately book all losses they project their loans will ever suffer, as soon as the loans are issued. Currently, banks don\u2019t book loan losses until they have evidence the losses will actually occur, but many observers believe that approach led banks to wait too long to record their losses after the 2008 financial crisis, blindsiding investors. Rule-makers and investor advocates say the new approach is needed to give investors more information about banks\u2019 true health on a more timely basis.Banks are simply looking for some clarity on how they should move to the new method, said Bob Davis, an ABA executive vice president. \u201cWe see this as part of our debate about the practical implementation of a complex rule.\u201dThe rule is expected to require some banks to set aside more in reserves for loan losses, thus lowering their core common-equity capital. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d said       James Kendrick,        first vice president for accounting and capital policy at the Independent Community Bankers of America, which has also criticized the new rule.Write to Michael Rapoport at Michael.Rapoport@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 14:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-backs-banks-in-debate-on-accounting-rule-1497376811", "news_title": "Treasury Backs Banks in Debate on Accounting Rule ", "keywords": "loan losses,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Sprint Corp.        S -0.47%       is giving away unlimited wireless service for a year to customers who switch to the No. 4 U.S. carrier, an aggressive move in an already fierce industry price war.The promotion, which includes unlimited data, texting and calling, is targeted at             Verizon Communications Inc.       customers, but anyone who brings an eligible device from other carriers can sign up, Sprint said. Eligible devices are listed on Sprint\u2019s website.Customers who sign up for the free service must own their smartphone and will be asked to start paying Sprint\u2019s regular rates after a year, though customers are allowed to switch or cancel service. Customers can switch up to five lines. Sprint currently charges $60 a month for unlimited service on one device.The offer, coming in the final two weeks of the company\u2019s first fiscal quarter, could be a sign Sprint has been losing customers and is looking to boost its subscriber numbers, telecom analyst       Craig Moffett       of MoffettNathanson said in a research note.\u201cWhat are we to assume about Sprint\u2019s motivation in pulling the trigger on a promotion that will perhaps bring in some new subscribers before the end of the quarter\u2026but (by definition) won\u2019t bring in any money?\u201d he said.Sprint spokesman       Dave Tovar       said the promotion was a \u201csmall, limited test\u201d and had nothing to do with subscriber numbers. It isn\u2019t likely to have a material effect on quarterly results, he added.Instead, Mr. Tovar said Sprint is testing out a new strategy for signing up customers. Rather than spending heavily on advertising and other customer acquisition costs, such as devices, this offer is only going to be advertised online, and customers must sign up using Sprint\u2019s website, not in stores.Mr. Tovar said that by spending so much less on customer acquisition, the economics are roughly the same when giving away a year of service.\u201cIf we just do the things the others do, we\u2019re going to be the No. 4 player,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we do big, bold things like this and try to redefine wireless then we know that gets people\u2019s attention.\u201dIn February, Verizon started selling unlimited data plans for the first time in years. The company said consumers were frustrated by having to track their data usage and rival unlimited offers were enticing too many customers to switch.Verizon\u2019s new unlimited plan, a similar move by AT&T Inc. and aggressive discounting by Sprint and             T-Mobile US Inc.       have pushed down wireless bills for many users. The consumer-price index for wireless service fell 13% in April versus last year, the largest drop in the history of the category.Customers who switch to Sprint are still required to pay $2.99 for a Sprint SIM card (the chip that goes inside the phone to connect it to the network) and $10 for its shipping and handling. Customers must also pay monthly taxes and fees on each phone line. If customers don\u2019t use autopay for those monthly fees, they have to pay $5 extra.Write to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 14:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sprints-latest-salvo-in-wireless-price-war-free-unlimited-service-1497378705", "news_title": "Sprint\u2019s Latest Salvo in Wireless Price War: Free, Unlimited Service ", "keywords": " at&t, carrier, cell phones, data,phone carriers,phone service,sprint,t-mobile,unlimited data plans , unlimited service, verizon, wireless service, wiresless,Sprint,S,new products,services,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,customer relationship management,telecommunication services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Being part of             Samsung Electronics Co.             Ltd. allows Harman International Industries Inc. to think bigger, the company\u2019s finance chief       Sandy Rowland       said Tuesday during The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CFO Network Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C.\u201cThings that were impossible are now possible,\u201d Ms. Rowland said. \u201cWe can tap into Samsung\u2019s balance sheet and no longer have to go to the public markets,\u201d she added.The $8.5 billion-takeover of the Stamford, Conn., auto-parts supplier was announced last November and closed in March.A revolving credit facility Harman had has been replaced by a loan by Samsung, Ms. Rowland said. Around $600 million of outstanding Harman debt remains to be serviced, she said.Under Samsung\u2019s roof, Harman no longer has to deal with investors directly, as all Harman shares were transferred into Samsung shares. \u201cWe don\u2019t have quarterly earnings calls anymore, we don\u2019t have shares anymore,\u201d Ms. Rowland said. The firm no longer files 10 K- and 10 Q-forms and its results are part of Samsung\u2019s public filings, Ms. Rowland said.The finance chief spent the past months moving Harman\u2019s accounts from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which are also used by the firm\u2019s parent Samsung. \u201cThere were some changes, but for the most part our accounts remained very similar,\u201d Ms. Rowland said. \u201cThe most important thing was to get the auditors comfortable with the reporting changes, \u201d she added.Ms. Rowland has now two so-called ambassadors in her finance team that function as a \u201cbridge\u201d to South Korea where Samsung is headquartered. \u201cThey can interpret what exactly Samsung wants, \u201d Ms. Rowland said. She said she has started learning Korean\u2014a step not mandated by the new owners of Harman\u2014but admitted it was \u201cearly days\u201d. \u201cI am trying to get to know the top ten words in Korean,\u201d Ms. Rowland said.Harman continues to operate as a stand-alone unit of Samsung and has a board consisting of both Harman- and Samsung representatives, Ms. Rowland said. \u201cSamsung has 300,000 employees. We have 30,000\u2014we don\u2019t want to get overwhelmed,\u201d Ms. Rowland said. The board meets four times a year and alternates between New York City and Seoul.The two firms are currently looking for business synergies, less so cost synergies, Ms. Rowland said. \u201cWe are currently not looking at cost synergies,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Samsung, entering the automotive sector is a brand new market.\u201d The goal going forward is to identify \u201cthe biggest revenue opportunities\u201d while \u201cnot disrupting the business.\u201dHarman and Samsung have around 60 people working on back office integration.The company is optimistic about potential changes to the U.S. tax code. \u201cThere is a window now to get it through,\u201d Ms. Rowland said. A more favorable tax system with a lower corporate tax rate could make Harman look at new U.S. investments, Ms. Rowland said, without providing more details. The fact that the so-called border-adjusted tax appears to be no longer a priority for the Trump administration was \u201cpositive for us\u201d, Ms. Rowland said.Harman operates sites outside the U.S., in countries like Mexico. A border-adjusted tax would have resulted in tax duties on imports while exempting exports. While Harman has increased its engineering headcount to around 1,000 in the U.S., it has not been growing its manufacturing headcount in recent years, Ms. Rowland said. She didn\u2019t provide a figure on how many employees the firm currently has in manufacturing. Finance chiefs including herself are currently watching the announcements coming out of the White House on \u201ca daily base\u201d, Ms. Rowland said.The corruption scandal that Samsung is embroiled in South Korea as well as the recall of the flagship Galaxy Note 7 last fall didn\u2019t have a direct impact on Harman, Ms. Rowland said.Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 14:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-takeover-allows-harman-international-to-think-bigger-cfo-says-1497378274", "news_title": "Samsung Takeover Allows Harman International to Think Bigger, CFO Says ", "keywords": "auto parts,mergers,Harman International Industries ,HAR,Samsung Electronics,005930.SE,Sandy Rowland,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,computers,consumer electronics,audio,video equipment,consumer goods,durable household products,home electronics,appliances,technology"}, {"content": "On her new album, \u201cFake Sugar\u201d (Virgin), singer       Beth Ditto       turns in a potentially star-making performance. Star-making, that is, in terms of the rock-and-pop music mainstream: Elsewhere, Ms. Ditto is already a star. If she can cross over depends on whether the marketplace will consider as commercially viable an atypical super-talent.\u201cFake Sugar\u201d is Ms. Ditto\u2019s full-length solo debut, though she\u2019s no newcomer. Since 1999, she served as the dynamic vocalist and, especially live, an outrageously charismatic and uninhibited centerpiece of the now- defunct Gossip, which blended punk and dance music. On her own, the 36-year-old, born       Mary Beth Patterson       in Searcy, Ark., issued an EP in 2011 and sang on records with Blondie, Netsky and Simian Mobile Disco. Beyond music, the proudly gay Ms. Ditto modeled for       Marc Jacobs,        conspired with       Jean Paul Gaultier       on a fashion line for plus-size woman, and posed nude on magazine covers as a seeming rebuke to fashion\u2019s preference for the skeletal.With her new album, out on Friday, she delivers her best music yet. Some elements of Gossip\u2019s signature sound remain here\u2014particularly the plucky guitars that prickle relentlessly throughout many arrangements\u2014but almost always producer       Jennifer Decilveo,        with whom Ms. Ditto wrote 10 of the album\u2019s 12 songs, cleaves a path for the singer to command and dominate the performances\u2019 centers. The backing band featuring drummer       Sam Kauffman-Skloff       and a battery of bassists, including Ms. Decilveo, provides the energy that propels the singer.A pop album that doesn\u2019t pander to a teen audience, \u201cFake Sugar\u201d refuses to conceal its influences\u2014Blondie,       Madonna,       Cyndi Lauper       and other new-wave artists\u2014even if the environment is thoroughly contemporary, though now and then the sound of \u201980s synthesizer peeks through. The music sands away the punk edge of Ms. Ditto\u2019s music, though not her natural defiance. Here, Ms. Ditto doesn\u2019t so much burst into the songs as slink in, singing slyly until the music requires her to let go. On \u201cWe Could Run,\u201d she enters above a pulsing bass only to let her voice soar at the chorus as the band builds in intensity. She barks her gritty entry to \u201cOo La La\u201d as if challenging the thunderous accompaniment. Repeatedly she comes across as malleable steel that can harden when required.\u201cFake Sugar\u201d is a sweet source of catchy pop, especially the infectious title track on which Ms. Ditto sings seductively above airy layers of guitars and darting percussion. There\u2019s a hint of country in her inflection that she emphasizes as she sings \u201cSwing your partner, do-si-do / You\u2019re looking good in that sugar coat.\u201d Then the bittersweet twist: \u201c\u2019Til it\u2019s goodbye bye bye / oh my my my.\u201d Similarly, on the surprisingly gentle closing track, she adds country brassiness to her delivery atop a fingerpicked electric guitar. Overdubbing her voice to form a soul-pop choir, an army of Beth Dittos ride the herky-jerky groove provided by the rhythm section on \u201cSavoir Faire.\u201d On \u201cIn and Out,\u201d her array of voices and coy but determined determined lead recall the sound of \u201960s girl groups.Will the new album deliver Ms. Ditto the audience she deserves? If she looked like most contemporary pop idols, the answer would very likely be yes. It\u2019s a fabulous album and has a delightful flow from start to end\u2014though the track \u201cFake Sugar\u201d is so appealing that listeners will be tempted to put it on repeat to savor it again and again. Bias is the only drawback here: The pop market embraces the gay and the outrageous\u2014check and check in Ms. Ditto\u2019s case\u2014but is less welcoming to plus-size women. If the rock-and-pop mainstream can\u2019t embrace Ms. Ditto and \u201cFake Sugar,\u201d it\u2019s not primarily concerned with musical talent.Not that Ms. Ditto is fretting. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anybody thinks of me,\u201d she sings in \u201cOh My God.\u201d In \u201cOo La La,\u201d she reminds us that she comes from a long line of tough women. \u201cHard worker like my mother,\u201d she sings, adding, \u201cFirecracker\u2014I get that from my mother\u2019s mother.\u201d That native toughness, along with talents that are perfectly marshaled here, suggests she will persist regardless of what the marketplace decides. If it chooses to marginalize Ms. Ditto and \u201cFake Sugar,\u201d it will be our loss.Mr. Fusilli is the Journal\u2019s rock and pop music critic.

CAKE 1.18%       has broken a seven-year winning streak, becoming the latest restaurant to succumb to pressures roiling the restaurant industry.The chain that is known for its vast menu and large portions said Tuesday it expects second-quarter same-store sales to decline by about 1%, after previously projecting an increase of 1% to 2% for the period. The Cheesecake Factory had posted 29 consecutive quarters of same-store sales increases.Shares in The Cheesecake Factory slid more than 9% in Tuesday trading to $52.97.Incoming Chief Financial Officer       Matthew Clark       told investors Tuesday the company has seen heightened volatility in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. that is \u201cindicative of uncertainty among consumers.\u201dAnalysts say the pressures that have been hurting the restaurant industry and the casual dining sector in particular, including consumers\u2019 desire for healthier food and smaller portions, are finally catching up with The Cheesecake Factory.Darren Tristano,        chief insights officer at restaurant consulting firm Technomic Inc., added: \u201cThere are just too many restaurants\u2026There\u2019s a lot more competition from independents, which are giving chains like Cheesecake a run for the money.\u201dEating out has also become a lot more expensive. Restaurants have been raising menu prices in recent years to help offset rising labor costs as cities and states across the country have increased the minimum wage for hourly workers.The Cheesecake Factory\u2019s average check has increased by more than 10.5% in the last four years to $21, outpacing the broader industry\u2019s 8.6% growth in average check during the same period.In a recent survey involving more than 500 households,       Gordon Haskett       Research Advisors found that despite optimism about the economy, the majority of respondents said they would rather pay down debt or add to their savings than make discretionary purchases.The Cheesecake Factory, with 193 restaurants, has long been able to charge a premium for its food because of its service and since it makes all 250 of its menu items from scratch, including 70 different sauces, dressings and marinades.But many gastropubs and other rivals have sprung up offering freshly made food, often in smaller portions and at lower price points.At the same time, grocery prices have fallen, making it much cheaper to eat at home. High prices and a widening span of food choices\u2014from prepared meals at convenience stores to subscription meal kits\u2014have caused overall restaurant traffic to stagnate. The casual dining sector, which includes restaurants such as The Cheesecake Factory, has suffered the most. Traffic was down 4% in the first quarter, according to NPD Group Inc.The only bright spots in the industry, according to NPD, are coming from breakfast sales, which grew 1% in the first quarter; visits made on a deal or discount, which grew 2%; and delivery purchases, which grew 2%--all of which are intended to offer affordability and convenience.The Cheesecake Factory recently introduced some items priced under $15 and said it is talking about creating a fast-casual restaurant.

It excludes investors\u2019 residences and luxury goods.The number of millionaire households increased nearly 8% to 17.9 million globally in 2016 from 16.6 million in 2015. The U.S. has the most millionaire households--more than 7 million--and China is second, with more than 2.1 million, BCG says.An increasing share of wealth is being held by millionaire households, with 45% of global wealth in their hands in 2016, up from 44% in 2015, BCG says. The consulting group predicts that they will hold 51% of wealth by 2021.But managers of that wealth face a host of challenges. Once lightly regulated and highly profitable, wealth managers are grappling with investors sobered by the financial crisis who demand lower fees and commissions in a low-yield environment, BCG says. In addition, competition is intensifying as new entrants join the industry, including regional banks, online brokers and non-financial players such as financial-technology companies, BCG says.\u201cIt\u2019s still a brilliant business to be in despite all of these challenges,\u201d says Anna Zakrzewski, a Zurich-based partner at BCG and a co-author of the report. BCG polled more than 125 wealth-management institutions and found that assets under management globally increased by 6.8% in 2016. Nearly 70% of that growth was driven by market performance, and 30% was driven by net new assets, it says.BCG predicts that global private wealth will grow to $223.1 trillion in 2021. In North America, Japan and Eastern Europe, that growth will be driven primarily by the performance of existing assets, but in the Asia-Pacific region, it will be primarily fueled by new savings, the consultant says. In Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, wealth expansion should stem from existing assets and high household savings equally, it says.Even with the growth in wealth, global private wealth managers\u2019 top-line margins have declined steeply over the past 10 years with the return on assets declining across regions and types of players, BCG says. Margins are being pressured by a host of factors, including a push by regulators for greater transparency and investor protection; the rise of passive investments, such as exchange-traded funds; and a competitive landscape in which banks, financial-technology companies and asset managers offer lower-price investment options for the affluent, the consultant says.Global private wealth managers\u2019 costs relative to assets under management have declined, BCG says, but there\u2019s still \u201csignificant potential\u201d for these firms to streamline their approach. Some have made cost reductions, such as divestments of unprofitable or high-risk business areas or certain client segments, that have been long needed, BCG says. They\u2019ve also weeded out unprofitable clients, increased the link between pay and performance and streamlined their product portfolio, among other things.Cost-cutting is generally beneficial, but it\u2019s problematic when it comes at the expense of investing in a viable future business models, BCG says. A number wealth-management players have paid the price of underinvestment in recent years, \u201cmaking the sector one of the least innovative areas of banking and the slowest to adapt to the changing environments,\u201d the consulting firm says.Digital initiatives have largely centered on providing customers with basic portfolio functionalities and the ability to execute standard trading and payment transactions, says Brent Beardsley, a senior partner at BCG, the leader of the firm\u2019s global wealth- and asset-management segments and a co-author of the report.\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is to design and implement fully rethought, reworked and advanced client journeys that seamlessly combined digital, relationship management and expert channels to transform the entire client experience from the end,\u201d he says.With increasing transparency brought about by regulations and technology, clients will increasingly be able to navigate toward the best option for their wealth level, investment preference and circumstances, BCG says.\u201cIt is no longer possible for wealth managers to focus on all segments in all locations, juggling multiple business models,\u201d it says. \u201cThey must identify the areas in which they want to operate and truly excel; in other words, they must \u2018carve out or get out.\u2019 \u201dWrite to Daisy Maxey at daisy.maxey@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-wealth-managers-vie-for-slice-of-166-5-trillion-in-private-assets-profit-pressure-emerges-1497376663", "news_title": "As Wealth Managers Vie for Slice of $166.5 Trillion in Private Assets, Profit Pressure Emerges", "keywords": "plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,competitive intelligence,political,general news,personal finance,personal investments,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "Global coal production saw its largest decrease on record in 2016, as China and the U.S. dug up less of the commodity and burned less of it for electricity,             BP        BP 0.57%       PLC said in the U.K. oil and gas giant\u2019s annual energy review.Coal made up only 28% of the world\u2019s energy production last year, its lowest level since 2004 and a reflection of what BP said was \u201cmarked shift toward lower-carbon fuels as renewable energy continues to grow strongly.\u201d BP, as a major producer of natural gas, stands to gain from less production of an energy source such as coal.Global coal production fell 6.2%, the most ever recorded, said BP\u2019s Statistical Review of World Energy, a closely watched compendium of information about global energy trends. U.S. output declined 19% and Chinese production fell almost 8%.President       Donald Trump       has made reviving the American coal industry a key tenet of his administration. He said he would pull the U.S. out of a global pact to limit carbon emissions because it would hurt industries like coal production, and his administration has moved to peel away regulations seen as harmful to the sector.BP said coal production was declining along with demand for the commodity as the U.S., Europe and China all consume more natural gas and renewable energy sources.

The 2016 figure represented just under 3% of all British citizens living in Germany.While the Federal Statistical Office, which published the data, doesn\u2019t record applicants\u2019 motivations, it said \u201ca connection to Brexit appears obvious.\u201dBrexit-driven naturalizations could surge even higher this year, immigration officials say, since the already lengthy process of obtaining German nationality has become longer due to the flood of requests.Other EU countries have also registered sharp rises in citizenship applications by Britons, though from a lower level. The Swedish Migration Agency said 1,600 Britons applied for Swedish citizenship last year, more than three times the level of 2015. So far this year, there have been 960 applications, already double the 2015 figure.The Danish Immigration Ministry said it had received 489 applications in 2016 and 130 for January and February of this year alone, compared with just 77 for the whole of 2015.And Ireland received 571 applications in 2016\u2014almost eight times the 2015 level\u2014and nearly 300 this year so far, according to the Department of Justice.\u201cWe never thought it was necessary [to apply for German citizenship], because we felt European,\u201d said       Stephan Hale,        a British businessman in Berlin. But after the June 2016 referendum on Brexit, he added, \u201call of a sudden this risk is appearing and you say \u2018damn it, I still want to be part of this nice union.\u2019\u201dA few weeks later, he and his family lodged their request and took their citizenship tests\u2014a German-language exam and a test of their knowledge of the country and its laws. He obtained German citizenship together with his British wife and three children last month.The status of British expatriates scattered across the EU\u2014and that of other EU citizens living in Britain\u2014is one key issue to be negotiated in the two-year divorce process between the U.K. and the bloc, but many are taking no chances. A citizen of any member state is allowed to travel, live and work anywhere in the bloc.Typically in Germany, applicants for citizenship must have lived in the country for a minimum of eight years, speak the language, be able to support themselves financially, and have no criminal convictions, among other requirements.For decades, German law didn\u2019t recognize multiple citizenships, forcing applicants to relinquish their former nationality upon becoming German. But reforms have watered down this requirement over the years and citizens from other EU countries can now retain their original passports, lowering the hurdle for many would-be applicants.Some conservative allies of Chancellor       Angela Merkel       have called for a scrapping of these reforms and have sought a renewed ban on dual citizenship in most cases.\u2018We wanted to make sure that our children have the same opportunities as their friends in Germany.\u2019Germany, with its humming economy, low unemployment, generous welfare policies and stable politics, has experienced a surge in immigration in recent years.

DEAN: Let\u2019s start with the scary stuff because that\u2019s the most fun. The title of this panel refers to \u201cthe singularity,\u201d or the idea that artificial intelligence will become so powerful that robots will take over. Andrew, I know you\u2019re skeptical of that. What should we be worried about with AI and where are the biggest opportunities?MR. NG: Worrying about evil AI robots today is a lot like worrying about overpopulation on the planet Mars. You know, some day we might get to Mars and we might actually overpopulate it and we\u2019ll need to worry about it then. But today, we haven\u2019t even landed on Mars yet, so I don\u2019t know how to productively work on that problem.Having gotten the scary stuff out of the way, I think AI is the new electricity. Whatever industry you work in, AI will probably transform it, just as 100 years ago the rise of electricity transformed industry after industry\u2014everything from transportation and communications to manufacturing to health care.So I hope that whatever industry you\u2019re in, you\u2019ll figure out how to leverage AI, because I think it will create new winners and losers in almost every category.MR. DEAN: Tong, do you share that basic optimism?MR. ZHANG: Yes. Nowadays, AI can solve a lot of specialized problems, in some cases even better than humans. But there is no single solution for AI to solve all problems simultaneously.It takes a lot of human effort to deliver a specialized AI system for medicine, for example. And that doesn\u2019t translate to other problems as easily as some people might think. That isn\u2019t singularity. That\u2019s far from it.MR. DEAN: Part of the hype around AI is that every company in the technology industry and even some that aren\u2019t are saying, \u201cOh, we\u2019re doing great stuff with AI.\u201d It can be hard to tell how much of that is real and how much of that is baloney. Where do you think there is more malarkey than actual substance in the AI talk?MR. NG: Here is one pattern that might be useful for spotting when AI might affect your industry or some other industry you care about. First, the industry is digitized, meaning activity is moved to computers. That creates data, which gives AI an opportunity to come in and eat the data and automate decisions or do things more intelligently.The single most lucrative application of AI today might be online advertising, or deciding what ad to show people. Because the online advertising realm has always been a digital realm, there is tons of data, and as a result the AI for that is very sophisticated today. The fintech industry is another area where a lot has moved to the digital realm. Health care is a bit further behind. So is construction. But you see this pattern where first comes digitization, which creates data, and then comes the AI.MR. DEAN: Let\u2019s be predictive. My nine-year-old twins are in the phase now of coming to me and saying what they want to be when they grow up. What jobs should I tell them probably won\u2019t exist once they are adults? Radiology is one you\u2019ve mentioned before. What else is in the target zone?MR. NG: If any of you have friends or children in medical school\u2014AI is getting much better at reading radiology images, frankly. So if any of your friends are going through medical school and graduating with a degree in radiology, I think they might have a perfectly fine five-year career as a radiologist. Maybe 10 years.Again, the broader pattern is that in any task in which a lot of people are doing relatively routine, repetitive work, that creates a very strong incentive for AI teams to come and automate that task.There is one other rule of thumb, which is that almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI.Take a security guard looking at a video feed and saying, \u201cAre there people in this? Are they doing something suspicious?\u201d That task is actually a lot of one-second judgment thoughts strung together, so I think a lot of it can be automated.I do think we\u2019re entering an era in which lifelong learning is no longer optional. The old model of education, where you go to college for four years and coast through the next 40 makes no sense in today\u2019s rapidly changing world.In IT, half the stuff we invent today will be obsolete in five years. The sands are constantly shifting. You have to keep learning. This is becoming much more pervasive elsewhere in our economy, too.So tell your children: \u201cLearn to be lifelong learners.\u201dMR. DEAN: It seems like the U.S. and China are the two places where the most is happening with AI in terms of development and deployment of the technology. You both have worked in both places. What are the strengths and weaknesses in each?MR. NG: The U.S. is very good at inventing basic technologies, a lot of the latest AI innovation.I think the China ecosystem is very strong at taking things to market\u2014it moves shockingly fast. In the U.S., when you launch a new product, it feels like you always have to fight market segment by market segment for users. And there are so many market segments.China is a relatively homogenous society, so once you find that beautiful product market fit, you can scale really quickly.The flip side of that, of course, is that if your competitors find product market fit, you can also lose share more rapidly than in the U.S.MR. ZHANG: I think the U.S. has more innovations nowadays than China.But Chinese companies, as well as universities, are trying to do more innovative research in terms of both quantity and quality. So I think it\u2019s happening, but the U.S. on this particular aspect is definitely leading.Write to  reports@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-optimistic-promise-of-artificial-intelligence-1497374822", "news_title": "The Optimistic Promise of Artificial Intelligence", "keywords": "andrew ng, d.live,journal reports, singularity, stanford university, tech conference, technology conference, tencent, tong zhang, wall street journal conference, wsj.d, wsj conference, wsjd,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,Stanford University,HK:0700,Andrew Ng,Tong Zhang,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,robotics,sciences,humanities,artificial intelligence technologies,internet search engines,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "China\u2019s outbound tourism industry is growing rapidly.

Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.MS. KIM: You did a major acquisition last year, the $1.7 billion deal to buy travel search site Skyscanner. When you look at acquisitions, what do you look for?MS. SUN: First, it needs to be closely related to our core business, which is travel. The second thing is, normally when we look at the target, it needs to be the No. 1 or No. 2 industry leader in that vertical. The third criteria is the valuation needs to be reasonable.MS. KIM: You have also been acquisitive in the U.S. How is your strategy in the U.S. different from Europe?MS. SUN: In the United States, we saw a very strong trend for customers to move from the rest of the world to the United States. The visa restrictions in the United States were finally lifted up. Chinese citizens were able to get 10-year visas. Second, lots of young kids are very curious and want to study in the United States. And third, the U.S. has lots of travel resources, and it\u2019s relatively very safe.So when we saw the trend to move customers from the rest of the world to the United States, then we needed to make sure our customers were provided the best service, best products.So our three investments in the United States will be able to block the best hotels, the best transportation for our customers.MS. KIM: Has your business been impacted at all by the political climate in the U.S.?MS. SUN: So far, not significantly, because travel is not political. When we send a customer to the rest of the world, I always encourage our team to tell our customer, \u201cYou represent China. You are the best diplomats of China. Please bring the best of the culture of China to the rest of the world. And when you come back, bring the best of the world back to China.\u201d Travel encourages international cultural exchange and therefore promotes peace. So far, so good.MS. KIM: Ctrip.com has pretty much consolidated China\u2019s online travel market. Do you see further room for consolidation in the global market?MS. SUN: We are the No. 1 player in the China market. There is lots of room for us to further penetrate into the second-tier and third-tier cities. In the global space, though, Ctrip is an infant. I think the golden years are yet to come. So we are very excited about the future opportunities.MS. KIM: You have a 10% stake in             MakeMyTrip        MMYT 4.29%       in India. India\u2019s a very competitive market, but also very different from China. What are the biggest challenges there and why did you decide to invest?MS. SUN: India will overtake China as the most populous country in the world. Although the GDP per capita is quite low, it has potential to grow the affluent portion of its people. And these people will be able to travel.The India market is very similar to China in the sense that it\u2019s very localized. Only local people know how to deal with the government, how to develop that market. We believe MakeMyTrip is a very good player in that market.MS. KIM: Let\u2019s talk about regulatory challenges. What are the headwinds that you see coming from the government?MS. SUN: The government is very supportive of travel, because we are nonpolitical. We bring people together. So our government supports us. And enterprises also like us because to conduct business meetings, they need a good supplier to make good arrangements for their travel.And the citizens like Ctrip because after they buy a house, buy a car, they want to travel. So as long as we deliver a high level of service, provide the most comprehensive products and offer the best price, I think we will be able to serve the government, enterprise and individuals very well.Write to  reports@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-tourism-giant-ctrip-looks-to-go-global-1497374760", "news_title": "Chinese Tourism Giant Ctrip Looks to Go Global ", "keywords": " ctrip, d.live,jane jie sun,journal reports, tech conference, technology conference, travel, wall street journal conference, wsj.d, wsj conference, wsjd,wsjdlive,Skyscanner,Ctrip.com International,CTRP,Priceline Group,PCLN,MakeMyTrip,MMYT,Jane Jie Sun,corporate,industrial news,interviews with corporate executives,interviews,building construction,residential building construction,travel agencies,construction,real estate,internet,online,leisure,arts,hospitality,technology,tourism"}, {"content": "A Republican congressman who helped shepherd the party\u2019s health-care overhaul bill through the House last month predicted Tuesday that a final bill will pass the Senate and land on the president\u2019s desk before August.House Energy and Commerce Chairman       Greg Walden\u2019s       estimate, described at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CFO Network meeting in Washington, suggests he is optimistic that Senate leaders will be able to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline for passing their health legislation.The House and Senate remain far apart on health issues, including rolling back the Medicaid expansion and curtailing protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. The two chambers may have to agree on a compromise bill for the president to sign.Mr. Walden\u2019s optimism does not eclipse the difficulty of the task, he said.\u201cI got a lot of public counsel from my friends in the Senate for the several months we were working on this,\u201d he said. But once the House passed its legislation in early May and the Senate began drafting its own bill in earnest, \u201cit\u2019s been radio silence.\u201dMr. Walden, who has long voiced his support for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions, also appeared to distance himself from a provision in the House bill that would allow some insurers to charge patients with costly medical conditions higher premiums.\u201cIn an auto insurance market, you can for the most part control your behavior,\u201d the Oregon congressman said. \u201cWith health care, you can wake up one morning, and your doctor says, \u2018You\u2019ve got breast cancer,\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019ve got this problem or that problem.\u2019\u201dThe Senate is likely to leave the 2010 Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for patients with pre-existing conditions untouched in their bill, according to Senate GOP aides.Mr. Walden also rejected a proposal, briefly entertained by both House and Senate lawmakers, to cap a tax exemption on employer-sponsored health insurance. Such a measure would raise considerable revenue that lawmakers would like to put toward insurance tax credits or other spending in the bill, but it is opposed by powerful outside groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\u201cI think it\u2019s a nonstarter in the business community,\u201d he said.As for Medicaid, the House bill would cut it by $834 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s latest estimate. Asked about the Senate\u2019s handling of the Medicaid issue, Mr. Walden demurred. Senators from states that have expanded Medicaid under the ACA are under pressure from their home-state governors to extend the period over which the program\u2019s expansion would be wound down. They favor keeping more money in the program, an idea that House conservatives are likely to oppose.Write to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-congressman-sees-health-care-bill-on-presidents-desk-by-august-1497374788", "news_title": "GOP Congressman Sees Health-Care Bill on President\u2019s Desk by August ", "keywords": "cfo network,health care bill, health care legislation,medicaid,Greg Walden,corporate funding,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "Few battles in the tech world have been as bruising as the global ride-sharing wars.

ANDERS: You recently bought Kudo, a company in Indonesia that helps consumers who don\u2019t have internet connections, or even bank accounts, buy things by connecting them with local agents. What does that have to do with ride-hailing?MR. TAN: Think about the digital divide in Asia\u2014630 million people and a lot of them still don\u2019t have a bank account. They don\u2019t have smartphone penetration growing very fast. Kudo has about 400,000 agents across Southeast Asia. They are community guys and they come up to [others in the community] and they say, \u201cHey, if you want access to any of the e-commerce sites, I can get you access. Do you want to sign up as a Grab driver?\u201d They have been signing up thousands of drivers on a daily basis.MR. ANDERS: So Doug, nuTonomy is looking to make the case that not only do we not need to own cars, we actually don\u2019t need drivers. How do you convince ride-hailing companies that this is where they should be investing?MR. PARKER: There has been a big step change in experience from the taxicab drive of the 1990s in New York City to the taxicab or Uber, Grab or Lyft drive of today. Autonomous [driving] is the next big step change. Your experience today is about 10 times better than the old taxicab ride, but there are things you probably don\u2019t like about it. Maybe I would like to sit in the front. I\u2019d like to look out a front window, control the radio myself, control the temperature.Autonomous is also going to be a safer ride. Something like 1.4 million people die every year in auto accidents. That\u2019s equivalent to 10 747s crashing every day. You would never let United get away with something like that, or             Boeing.       So once you have big companies taking on this role of driving the cars, we are going to end up with a safer, more comfortable, more efficient ride.MR. ANDERS: You\u2019ve worked with Grab on a test in Singapore. And you just announced you\u2019re going to collaborate with Lyft on a similar test in Boston, with real-world riders. What are you learning from these tests?MR. PARKER: When you start putting people [in self-driving cars] who aren\u2019t roboticists or scientists, what they tell you is amazing. They have a lot of fear when they first get in, when the car starts driving itself. But after five minutes, they\u2019re playing with their phones. So there is this very fast adoption curve. But when the car goes to make a turn at a busy traffic light for the first time, it is a little scary.It\u2019s kind of like people who are scared of flying. They aren\u2019t scared of the engineering, or that the plane won\u2019t fly. It\u2019s that they have no control. It\u2019s the same thing with autonomous cars. We have to get used to the fact that the car is going to make the right choice. Every time.MR. ANDERS: How long will it be before I hail a car, and it picks me up without a driver in it?MR. PARKER: We will still have a safety driver in the car for a number of years. There is a long process to convince regulators that this is safe. We have to find the right way to prove, through on-road tests, that this is entirely safe to take the driver out. Part of that is we\u2019re going to have remote safety officers who will monitor the cars and take over if there is a problem.MR. ANDERS: NuTonomy is working with different ride-hailing partners and auto makers. Many of these companies are locked in some pretty bitter blood feuds. How do you stay neutral?MR. PARKER: Right now, we\u2019re trying to work with the good guys\u2014the Grabs and the Lyfts of the world that really want to drive a better experience for people. But also, at this point, Grab and Lyft aren\u2019t competing with each other. We actually have three partnerships with ride-hailing companies. We haven\u2019t announced the third one yet.MR. ANDERS: You haven\u2019t announced the third one yet? Here we are. Let\u2019s have it.MR. PARKER: I know. It\u2019s a great forum. But\u2026MR. ANDERS: Anthony, let\u2019s talk about competition. Uber gave up the fight with Didi [Chuxing Technology Co.] in China, and I know Didi is one of your investors. How are you going to avoid one of these really protracted, and wildly expensive, battles in Southeast Asia?MR. TAN: It is very different in Southeast Asia. For one thing, Grab embraces the taxi world. In Singapore, Grab combines all the taxis, all the cars, with one touch of a button. And because we work so closely with the Singapore government, they have allowed us to be the first company with the ability to price dynamically for taxis, which is essentially a public utility vehicle. So with just Grab, you now get taxis that can have dynamic pricing at peak hours, and be cheaper than the meter during off-peak hours.MR. ANDERS: If Didi wanted to acquire Grab outright, would you be open to it?MR. TAN: Right now, we work hand in hand. They aren\u2019t types who say, \u201cI want to be the boss, and that\u2019s it.\u201d They are much more like, \u201cWe\u2019re brothers in this. How do we make sure that we win this local style, respecting the local nuances.\u201dThey realize that Southeast Asia is a fragmented market. The countries are similar in many ways but still so different in terms of language, religion, etc. The ability to embrace that fragmentation but also see the common patterns is what Didi likes about us.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'The Ride-Sharing Boom.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-the-ride-sharing-industry-in-asia-is-headed-1497374761", "news_title": "Where the Ride-Sharing Industry in Asia Is Headed", "keywords": "anthony tan, d.live, doug parker, grab,journal reports, nutonomy, ride sharing, tech conference, technology conference,vc analysis, wall street journal conference, wsj.d live, wsj conference, wsjd, wsjdlive,GrabTaxi Holdings,nuTonomy,Uber Technologies,Anthony Tan,Doug Parker,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,retail,wholesale,etailing,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,computing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "In Asia, many smartphone users use messaging apps to watch videos, make calls, hail rides and play games. And U.S. giants WhatsApp and Snapchat are getting more competition from challengers from Asia. To get a glimpse of what the future may hold for messaging apps, Wall Street Journal senior editor Yun-Hee Kim spoke with       Kavin Bharti Mittal,        founder and chief executive of India\u2019s Hike Messenger, and       Ji-Hoon Rim,        CEO of South Korea\u2019s         Kakao Corp.Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.MS. KIM: What is the next-generation messaging app going to look like?MR. RIM: Artificial intelligence. I personally think that the next messenger is going be the virtual personal assistant.MR. MITTAL: Yeah, absolutely. I\u2019m a big believer that we\u2019re at a stage in the evolution of technology where humans are still forced to adapt to the way technology works. And I think AI\u2019s going to change that.It\u2019s going to spin it backward, where technology can finally adapt itself to how human beings live their lives.We\u2019re only using AI in small amounts of the application today in Hike.Based on the time of the day, based on your location, based on the weather, we can change the recommendation of stickers [images people can send to other users] that you see in your palette. It\u2019s a very small example of what\u2019s possible with big data and AI inside messaging apps going forward.MS. KIM: How does Kakao plan to use artificial intelligence in its KakaoTalk messaging platform?MR. RIM: It\u2019s going to be natural-language processing and understanding. In the mobile service right now, we\u2019re already connected to the biggest franchise deliveries like Pizza Hut, Burger King. All those things you can actually order on mobile right now, and get delivered.If that\u2019s connected with AI and a conversational [user interface], rather than typing or touching the phone, you can just say, \u201cPlease order the same pizza that I did last week.\u201d Or \u201cI want to go to Hong Kong Disneyland. Please call me a taxi.\u201dI\u2019m pretty confident that we could show how the future is going to be. Because Korea is relatively small. We can showcase how it really works.MS. KIM: There are many other messaging apps globally that are offering quite similar services. The market is quite competitive. In terms of users, both Hike and Kakao trail WhatsApp, which has more than a billion monthly active users. So how do you take on a giant like that? Do you have ambitions to even attempt to compete with WhatsApp?MR. MITTAL: In any realm of industry, you try to sort of compete as little as possible. You go around the competition.We focus on the youth. In India, about half a billion people are under the age of 24.So we focus on our user base and deliver what is important to them. In India, given that you have so much diversity, it allows for people like us to exist, because we can solve very local problems at scale.MS. KIM: But in India, WhatsApp actually has double the amount of users as Hike. What are they doing right? And what do you guys need to do to catch up?MR. MITTAL: We don\u2019t look at Hike as catching up at all. We\u2019ve made it very clear that for us to win, WhatsApp doesn\u2019t have to lose.As a matter of fact, people use WhatsApp and Hike very, very differently together on their phones.Hike is used with seven, eight, 10 close friends. Whereas WhatsApp is used with your parents, your driver, your colleagues, your plumber.The more pervasive             Facebook                   and WhatsApp are, the more the need for Hike. Because in a market like India, there is a very large divide between the older, conservative population and the younger youth who are much more liberal. As a result of which, people need a space to be themselves. And Hike is that application.MS. KIM: Kakao hasn\u2019t really gained much traction overseas. What went wrong?MR. RIM: I don\u2019t want to say it was wrong. Actually, it was a path that we chose. We realized that it\u2019s going to be very tough for us to compete as a messenger globally, because they were big companies.We chose a path where we\u2019ll do platform business in Korea, since we\u2019re a dominant player, and we\u2019ll do content business globally. Content here means offering music, gaming, entertainment and comics.MS. KIM: Do you have plans to take Hike outside of India?MR. MITTAL: Not yet. We feel that the market is very big. There is enough and more for us to work on in India.Do we foresee ourselves going outside the country? Well, we\u2019d hope so.There are many countries out there like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Africa as well, that have a very similar characteristic to India. Where data\u2019s tricky, where smartphones are cheap.Maybe in the next 12 to 18 months, we\u2019ll consider one of these markets.MS. KIM: You\u2019ve raised more than $250 million from investors. What are you using the funding toward? Is it improving your features or expanding perhaps outside of your home market?MR. MITTAL: Definitely improving the product. We\u2019re big believers that as consumers get used to technology, consumer needs grow. So you can\u2019t stay stagnant in the technology space. You have to keep evolving and improving your product 24/7.We\u2019ve been working on a lot of stuff that we\u2019ve launched in the last six months. Hike, by the end of 2017, will look very different.Because we have the funding, and more important, we have a lot of access to people like         Tencent               [a Chinese company that created the messaging app             WeChat        TCEHY 3.69%       and backs Hike].There are a lot of insights we\u2019ve got around what WeChat\u2019s doing with the platform, or what they\u2019re doing with messaging, what they\u2019re doing with photos, what they\u2019re doing with videos, what they\u2019re doing with calling, payments and a bunch of other stuff. We\u2019ve definitely used that to improve our own set of tactics and strategy in India.MS. KIM: In light of the terrorist attacks in Europe and the U.S., there has been a lot of debate about whether messaging companies like yourselves should give away data of their users to government agencies. I wanted to hear your thoughts on that issue.MR. MITTAL: One thing that we do well with Hike is we actually don\u2019t store any messages. We just don\u2019t do it. We don\u2019t plan to change that over time. But I think it\u2019s not wrong for the governments to ask for data if the situation is right.I can only speak for India. The internet is so new in India that the government\u2019s also trying to figure out what the rules are in the online world. What does it mean to have security and privacy online in the virtual world?Because now people spend four hours of their day on average on the internet. In a country like India, one day you\u2019ll have a billion people accessing the internet through their smartphones. So time will tell.MR. RIM: Privacy of data is very important. And Kakao puts in every effort to keep it up.Write to  reports@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-tomorrows-messaging-apps-will-look-like-1497374701", "news_title": "What Tomorrow\u2019s Messaging Apps Will Look Like", "keywords": " d.live, hike messenger, ji-hoon rim,journal reports, kakao,kavin bharti mittal, messaging, tech conference, technology conference, wall street journal conference, wsj.d live, wsj conference, wsjd, wsjdlive,Kakao,035720.KQ,KR:035720,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,Hike Messenger,WhatsApp,HK:0700,Snapchat,Kavin Bharti Mittal,Ji-Hoon Rim,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,interviews with corporate executives,interviews,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,telecommunication services,communications software,computing,instant messaging programs,internet,online,mobile applications software,technology"}, {"content": "Baidu Inc.        BIDU 0.74%       is a company in transition, driven by       Qi Lu,        who joined the Chinese tech giant as its president earlier this year. Baidu, which rose to prominence as a search engine, has stumbled in recent years as it tried to expand into additional online services, and its profits have fallen.Mr. Lu\u2019s plans to turn Baidu around include a big investment in artificial intelligence for the development of new technologies for search and other businesses\u2014including driverless cars, a technology where Google, the acknowledged leader, has a big head start. Mr. Lu announced in April that Baidu will open its self-driving car technologies to others, on a platform called Project Apollo, to help develop autonomous vehicles.At last week\u2019s D.Live conference in Hong Kong, Mr. Lu discussed his vision for Baidu with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s China technology columnist, Li Yuan. Edited excerpts of their conversation follow.MS. YUAN: Baidu has had a pretty tough year. How are you going to move the company forward?MR. LU: The focus is always on driving innovation that leads to a better user experience and better overall economics [for the company]. On the user experience side, our focus is multifold.One is adding more and more and better and better content as part of search\u2019s scope. For example, video, particularly the emerging short form of video. It can be an extremely powerful new medium, to transfer information, to communicate.And the second is to make the user interactions richer and better. Because the inspiration for a user to search never came out of the blue. The reason you\u2019re searching for something is because you have a purpose in mind, you want to accomplish something. You want to listen to a song. You want to ask a question. You want to study.We want to bring the user a lot closer to the [subject]. So that, for example, if you want to listen to a song, you can play the song. You can watch a movie, watch video clips\u2014interacting with the services directly.MS. YUAN: But the problem now is that people increasingly rely on social media for information. And people don\u2019t search as much as before. How are you going to tackle that?MR. LU: I do not agree with your premise. Social media is a great product. However, having said that, each social-media product is a proprietary, closed information ecosystem. That\u2019s number one.Number two, the digital universe is expanding at such a vast pace, it will outstrip any social media, any proprietary closed world. And users, our interests, our needs are long-term. This is why search succeeded\u2014it never ends. If you blend these two, there\u2019s people always seeking more information.The key is the search experience needs to be better. What search brings the user, the interaction needs to be richer. We want to enable every human being to easily discover access to anything they care about.MS. YUAN: Baidu and Google, who\u2019s going to have a driverless car on the street first?MR. LU: First of all, let me describe what I think is the state of the driverless-car industry. There\u2019s a bunch of companies in that space. And I believe Baidu is among the tier-one companies. And I believe Google is substantially ahead against everybody else. They started earlier and I have huge respect for Google as a company. They did a great job developing that technology.Second, the technological foundation of a driverless car has lots and lots of components. It\u2019s a high-barrier business, because the depths of technology you need to develop is enormous.Start with perception. Because to be able to perceive the road, the driving environment, as of today, you need to use Lidar, radar, cameras, a combination of sensors, fuse them together. And then you need to do mission-critical predictions about cars. Which cars are maneuvering and at what speed? How to prime our vehicles to maneuver in those environments? It\u2019s called planning control, and there\u2019s many different aspects of it.If we\u2019re to take a perspective three years from now, five years from now, what\u2019s the determining factors\u2014who will be ahead in five years? The deciding factor is the speed of iteration [or developing software].It\u2019s about writing software that learns. Data and algorithm and iteration is the game. The speed of iteration is everything.I announced Project Apollo April 19. This is the key: Apollo is an open platform. It\u2019s open software, open services and open capability. We are going to open up our code. We\u2019re going to open up our capabilities for critical [proprietary technology]\u2014very high-barrier [technology], very hard for any company to develop, it needs time to accumulate. That\u2019s number one.Number two, by design, the Apollo is an ecosystem, with OEMs [original-equipment manufacturers], with tier-one suppliers, with any service providers. Because the name of the game is for people to participate and collaborate. Imagine, the ecosystem on any given day would drive more roads, see more situations. The ecosystem algorithm can turn around at a much faster pace than any single closed company. If you take that perspective, I would make a case that in three years or in five years, the ecosystem\u2014not Baidu as a company\u2014the ecosystem of Apollo will be ahead of any single closed endeavors by one company.MS. YUAN: Can you tell us who are going to be the OEMs who will be under Apollo and who are the startups, and why they want to be on this? Because I\u2019ve talked to many industry people and they just don\u2019t believe that the big OEMs want to be on an open-source platform; first-tier startups want to be on this platform.MR. LU: We will announce in the first week of July the number of partners that will participate. The feedback has been genuinely positive. Because this is genuinely win-win. Baidu\u2019s going to make money in areas we\u2019re good at\u2014algorithms, data\u2014we\u2019re not getting into their space. We\u2019re not a disrupter. We want to empower the OEMs. They will have access to technology. They can innovate at a faster pace. They can have better products to the market.Write to  reports@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/baidus-turnaround-strategy-1497374702", "news_title": "Baidu\u2019s Turnaround Strategy", "keywords": "autonomous car, baidu, d.live,driverless car, internet,journal reports,qi lu, tech conference, technology conference, wall street journal conference, wsj.d live, wsj conference, wsjd, wsjdlive,Baidu,BIDU,Google,GOOGL,Qi Lu,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,interviews,internet search engines,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "What does the future hold for the internet giants of today\u2014and the companies that will rise to prominence down the road?The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editor in chief,       Gerard Baker,        spoke with       Yuri Milner,        the founder of technology-investment firm DST Global and co-creator of prizes to honor scientific achievements and reinvigorate the search for life in space. Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.MR. MILNER: It\u2019s not a secret that the internet as an investment class did very well in the last 10 years. I just wanted to reflect on some of the reasons why and make predictions on how well this asset class will do in the next 10 years.There is common knowledge about why this specific asset class is so powerful. There is no need for physical infrastructure. All the heavy lifting has been already done: low operating costs, global distribution networks, viral capabilities to distribute products and a very fast product-development cycle.I wanted to focus on two more reasons.Internet companies spend dramatically more on R&D per dollar of revenue. The second reason is that internet companies have been extremely successful in attracting and retaining talent. All of those reasons lead to value creation. But we asked, what\u2019s going to happen in the next 10 years?And you only need to make some relatively conservative assumptions to come up with a significant number. What percentage of consumption is happening online, the number is only 6% globally. We believe that in the next seven to eight years, this number will more than double. That means that there will be an additional $4 trillion created in that space.MR. BAKER: What could change that trajectory?MR. MILNER: It looks like that\u2019s how innovation is taking place in the 21st century. The internet is enabling innovation. In the last maybe 20 years new companies were more successful in capturing this opportunity. And these companies over time became big companies.MR. BAKER: These companies are enormously dominant. Their scale is extraordinary. Apple approaching a trillion dollars of market cap. Google.             Facebook.       How concerned should we be about the domination in all kinds of things?MR. MILNER: The key question we all collectively need to ask is, what is best for consumers? What is best for all of us? Let\u2019s also not forget that these companies became big in a mostly organic way. There was not a significant amount of M&A happening.MR. BAKER: You\u2019re comfortable right now that the concentration that we\u2019re seeing is not fundamentally either anticompetitive or harmful to the consumer?MR. MILNER: Obviously, there has to be a balance. Governments are looking for ways to find this balance. What I would like to focus on and what I do focus on is what value these companies can bring to all of us in the future.As I mentioned, the sector really dominates in R&D spend. If we focus on the biggest projects that require many billions of dollars in funding\u2014like, for example, virtual reality or artificial intelligence\u2014those projects require an enormous amount of capital. They require computation. They require server capacity. And I think we all have an intrinsic interest in those projects getting funded. So what I\u2019m saying is that in order for all of us to reap the benefits of AI, for example, as soon as possible we need a certain amount of concentration of capital so that those projects get funded.MR. BAKER: Can China go on, in political terms and from an investment perspective, to continue to develop its own separate internet companies? And Facebook and everybody else will just have to deal with the rest of the world?MR. MILNER: The interesting byproduct of these massive companies that have been created is that the employees and the founders of those companies, obviously they reap the benefits of the success. And the byproduct of this is the creation of a very vibrant angel community.From the angel community follows a VC community. And then a VC community is followed by growth stage, late stage and then public stage [companies]. In order to create a Silicon Valley-type phenomenon, an angel community is critical. And an angel community is really very dependent on those massive success stories. So that\u2019s how the cycle gets going.MR. BAKER: Our opening poll question was about finding intelligent life. Some people would be happy if we found more intelligent life on Earth first rather than finding intelligent life in the rest of the universe. You\u2019ve got a very strong interest in this. You\u2019ve put up money for a prize. Why is this something you regard as so important?MR. MILNER: We should be looking beyond the horizon. I truly believe that we collectively as a civilization should allocate a small fraction of our resources to try to solve existential questions. \u201cAre we alone in the universe?\u201d is one of those existential questions.Write to  reports@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-defense-of-the-internet-giants-1497374640", "news_title": "In Defense of the Internet Giants", "keywords": " d.live, dst global,journal reports, tech conference, tech investment, technology conference, tech startups, wall street journal conference, wsj.d live, wsj conference, wsjd, wsjdlive,yuri milner,Yuri Milner,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,interviews,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "Venture capitalists are often among the first to recognize big trends in technology, and, if they\u2019re lucky, to back the companies best positioned to profit from those trends.Wall Street Journal reporter Rolfe Winkler sat down with two successful VCs familiar with China\u2019s tech market,       Connie Chan,        a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, and       David Su,        founding managing partner of Matrix Partners China, to find out where tech\u2014and the money\u2014are headed next. Edited excerpts follow.MR. WINKLER: Where is venture capital flowing right now, in China and the U.S.?MR. SU: Software services is a space we\u2019ve been investing in over the last four years. Human capital is getting increasingly expensive in China. In the last four years we probably invested in about 30 companies in early to early growth stage. We\u2019re seeing tremendous growth in that space.We\u2019re also looking at security. We\u2019re looking at enterprise-security, internet-security companies.MS. CHAN: A couple of years ago my partner,       Marc Andreessen,        wrote an essay saying \u201csoftware is eating the world.\u201d We think that same message holds true today. If you look now at all these traditional industries that were not software-led, they are doing whatever they can to build software teams, engineering teams. Look at the auto industry, for example.We\u2019re seeing so much disruption happening. We\u2019re looking at a lot of areas where traditional industries are getting massively disrupted by software.MR. WINKLER: Why doesn\u2019t Andreessen invest in China?MS. CHAN: We have a strong operating-partner focus where we introduce networks of investors, engineers, product designers, marketing folks to all of our portfolio companies. And a large part of our network is centered in Silicon Valley. So our biggest value-add is most likely to a company that has its headquarters in and is based in the U.S. Most likely Silicon Valley. We have made investments outside of the country. But that\u2019s definitely not the norm.However, we do spend a lot of time thinking about China. I come to China, I come to Hong Kong quite frequently because I think there\u2019s so much to learn. There are so many portfolio companies trying to figure out their China strategy.MR. WINKLER: You\u2019re trying to find investment dollars for your portfolio companies?MS. CHAN: It runs the gamut. I help companies meet with Chinese investors. I introduce them to Chinese media, I get them to the right person. I teach them about their Chinese counterparts, and that\u2019s probably the biggest value-add. Because a lot of consumer companies\u2014enterprise, too\u2014some of them aren\u2019t ready to think about entering the China market yet. However, there is so much to learn from just studying the similar type industry, a similar type company in China. And so this is something I regularly do.MR. WINKLER: We\u2019ve heard many times that China is full of technology copycats. That has reversed a little bit. Give us examples where you\u2019ve had a portfolio company learn something product-wise, rolled something out because they saw it here first.MS. CHAN: Earlier this year we made an investment in LimeBike [a bike-sharing company based in San Mateo, Calif.]. After talking to lots of my Chinese investor friends who had invested in Ofo and Mobike, the two leaders in bike sharing in China, I learned about the unit economics of this model, and I saw some very strong product market fit. In many ways, LimeBike is kind of a China copycat in the sense that they\u2019re taking that Mobike, Ofo model and bringing it to the states.MR. WINKLER: David, you are an original investor in Ofo. I think you did the series A at about a $30 million valuation? And now they\u2019re at $2 billion, in what, 12 months?MR. SU: It was just operating in several universities in Beijing. They were doing maybe 30,000 to 40,000 rides a day. As of last week we are doing, like, 20 million daily average rides. They have maybe seven million bikes in a hundred cities. So Ofo and Mobike now dominate the bike space. The growth has been phenomenal.MR. WINKLER: Are these companies profitable?MR. SU: Not yet. Ofo is going through this neck-to-neck competition with Mobike. Both are getting subsidies and waiving periods of usage. But eventually, when things settle down, I think the numbers will work.MR. WINKLER: Payments is so strategic for some of these companies,MR. SU: Yes. I think the next few years you will see lots and lots of innovation in payment on mobile that\u2019s going to drive a lot of consumption, change in behavior. I think all this is driving a lot of changes in consumers. And there\u2019s very minimal friction to using these services.MS. CHAN: The way Chinese app companies think and the designers think is they want to grow deep, not just wide. Meaning, they want to control all aspects of your day from morning to night. It might just start with your transportation\u2014but it can branch beyond that.MR. WINKLER: Why do they want to control all that?MS. CHAN: Because you get more of the users\u2019 time. You can send them to different services, different apps, you control distribution, you can do different kinds of advertising. You get more data around that consumer. So anything that\u2019s a daily-use, high-frequency app is very valuable. And I think China, with the super app design model, recognizes that biking is one of those companies.MR. WINKLER: What companies starting today will be the next Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent?MR. SU: We were looking at software services and security. You know, this is a space we\u2019re very interested in. No. 2: all this micropayments. If you walk today in Shanghai and Beijing you are starting to see pop-up KTV [karaoke TV] booths with two or three seats. You scan your phone, you open the door, you go in and you can sing two songs, take pictures with your friends, capture the image and send it to whatever account you have. It\u2019s instant gratification. And that\u2019s all powered by mobile, powered by payment. Areas like that we are very interested in, where young consumers will be very interested.MR. WINKLER: I want to ask about liquidity for investors. Is it a problem for venture capitalists and for their investors that some of your successful investments aren\u2019t going public, they aren\u2019t selling themselves, they aren\u2019t giving you cash to return to your limited partners?MR. SU: I think in that aspect we have done pretty well over the years. I think even with Didi Chuxing [the Chinese ride-sharing giant], which is now a $50 billion company, the last two rounds we have managed to liquidate some of the ownership to the new investors, the hedge funds and the big private-equity players who are interested to buy some stake.MR. WINKLER: How much did you sell?MR. SU: A small portion of it. But enough to make our investors happy. And we\u2019re a very early investor in Momo, which is arguably the No. 2 social-network company in China. They just reported results a few days ago. They have maybe 80 million monthly active users. They are pioneering the live streaming digital space. They are doing, like, $1 billion revenue with $300 million net profit this year. So the company\u2019s $8 billion. We have managed to return money to our limited partners.MR. WINKLER: You have a reputation for being one of the top VC firms. I think you\u2019re still waiting for your Snapchat, right? Benchmark just got Snapchat out the door, Sequoia did WhatsApp. Huge cash return. What\u2019s going to be your first liquid unicorn?MS. CHAN: We\u2019ve had a lot of really good exits already. They\u2019re not necessarily always in the consumer space, but we\u2019ve had some in the consumer space as well.MR. WINKLER: But something that large, that really justifies your reputation as one of the top five firms.MS. CHAN: Okta had a great public offering this year. And we\u2019re very early stage investors in a lot of the big brands, like in Airbnb, or Pinterest, Okta, Instacart, so forth.MR. WINKLER: You\u2019re early stage in Airbnb?MS. CHAN: Early stage, yes.MR. WINKLER: I thought you were at the $1 billion valuation there.MS. CHAN: We\u2019re a series B investor.MR. WINKLER: At the $1 billion valuation? Or\u2014MS. CHAN: We\u2019re the series B investor.MR. WINKLER: OK. It\u2019s probably about 30 times your money so far, so that\u2019s still pretty good.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-vc-money-is-going-in-china-1497374580", "news_title": "Where VC Money Is Going in China", "keywords": " andreessen horowitz, chinese startups,connie chan, d.live, david su, investing in asia, investing in china, investing in technology,journal reports, matrix partners, tech conference, technology conference, technology startups, tech startups,vc analysis, wall street journal conference, wsj conference, wsjd,wsjdlive,Andreessen Horowitz,Matrix Partners China,Connie Chan,David Su,corporate,industrial news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,business,consumer services,financial services,investing,securities,venture capital"}, {"content": "Richard Liu       is the chairman and chief executive of             JD.com Inc.,        JD 0.54%       China\u2019s second-largest online retailer after             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.        BABA -0.39%He sat down with Li Yuan, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s China technology columnist, to discuss e-commerce in China and how his company plans to expand internationally. Edited excerpts follow.MS. YUAN: Where is the Chinese e-commerce logistics market headed and how much success do you predict you will have?MR. LIU: During the past 12 years, the success we\u2019ve had with customers shows our success in logistics. The record speaks for itself. But now we have to diversify.Five years ago, everybody was overwhelmed by the rocketing increase in the number of e-commerce orders. But now, courier companies either have to control costs or diversify. So we are trying to make our logistics unit independent and diversify to make sure our logistics business isn\u2019t solely dependent on e-commerce, but is also taking orders from traditional industries, small and big businesses, because that\u2019s the only way to survive.MS. YUAN: You want to make inroads in the U.S. Are you going to recruit new brands to sell or just export what you already have?MR. LIU: With respect to the U.S., we want to do three things. First, we want to attract good American brands to sell on our platform. Second, we are hiring employees in our U.S. R&D centers to help us provide insight and research into new technologies, and our employee numbers there will increase threefold. Lastly, we are focusing on expanding our global efforts.In the past, China\u2019s e-commerce business model was to concentrate on small sellers and small suppliers. Chinese firms tried to dangle cheaper prices to win overseas orders, but we believe that things have gotten to a point where this has become quite unsustainable. If we keep selling cheap stuff, then people will only patronize us a few times and then leave us. And so we are going to move up the market. And the first step is we\u2019re going to introduce marquee Chinese brands into the U.S.MS. YUAN: You recently said you were developing heavy-duty drones to deploy in Shaanxi province. You also are building up smart warehouses. How do you plan to use technology to position yourself for the future?MR. LIU: We have four million products on offer now in our warehouses. Today, about half of our inventory management, from procurement to after-sales refunds, is now being placed under the control of smart technology. We plan to make use of artificial intelligence and robots to create a system that doesn\u2019t require human workers. This is going to cut our costs and improve our efficiency.MS. YUAN: If you are going to resort to a lot of automation, what does that mean for your staff?MR. LIU: Some will retire and some will change jobs. I\u2019m not saying that we can do away with all blue-collar workers. For example, right now maybe we need 10,000 customers to break even. But in the future we may only need 1,000 customers to break even or to make a profit due to automation.In the future, if workers stay, there will still be jobs in JD.com for them. We aim to eventually have more than one million drones to carry out our various operations. But we would need a huge team of staff to work in a control center for these drones and also maintenance staff to keep them up. So in the future many of our delivery guys will be sitting in offices, away from the smog, controlling drone delivery.AUDIENCE MEMBER: What is your strategy for entering overseas markets?MR. LIU: We have two channels. The first is to transplant our [Chinese business model] to markets with similar characteristics to China, usually developing markets such as Indonesia. This year, we plan to make inroads in a few other markets like Indonesia.The other channel is the European and the U.S. market. We believe it\u2019s only a matter of time before many Chinese brands such as Huawei Technologies and others become world-renowned. So we are going to concentrate on high-end Chinese products and try to introduce them to developed overseas markets.MS. YUAN: You already are locked in a fierce battle with peers in China. Won\u2019t you be stretched too thin if you open up a second battlefront in a place like Indonesia?MR. LIU: In 2004, when we started, we only had 12,000 yuan ($1,760). Alibaba already was huge. We had no business competing with them. But [now], we can fight them on equal footing. An entrepreneur\u2019s most important contribution to society is a willingness to take risks and explore new markets. Now, if we can make it in China, we can make it in many, many other places in the world.Write to  reports@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Richard Liu spoke about JD.com Inc.\u2019s record of success with customers during the past 12 years. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the past decade. Also, Mr. Liu discussed cheaper prices in relation to Chinese companies in general. Because of an error in translation, an earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that he referred to JD.com specifically. His discussion of the market outlook focused on the outlook of the logistics segment within the e-commerce sector. The article incorrectly suggested his comments applied to the entire e-commerce sector. Separately, JD.com had 12,000 yuan ($1,760) of business when it started out.

DOWELL: Why are banks still so bad at technological innovation?MR. LARSEN: There\u2019s an enormous amount of opportunity to overhaul banking and financial services generally. So why hasn\u2019t it happened yet?I can tell you, it isn\u2019t an easy transition. First, clients are quite sticky in their preferences and their behavior, so while it may make sense to us to move everybody on to mobile instantly, there are plenty of people who are quite happy and comfortable with the way they\u2019re doing business. Second, most of these banks have layers and layers of technology. Simply wiping the floor and starting over is an option, but it\u2019s a very challenging, risky and costly option. And third, regulators put brakes on institutions everywhere. Cloud computing is a really good example. There are very few regulators in the world who [truly understand] cloud computing and have clear guidelines about what is and isn\u2019t acceptable.MR. DOWELL: How would you assess fintech\u2019s prospects?MR. LARSEN: This technology transformation is going to happen. But it\u2019s going to happen at different paces in different markets and in different areas of the business. Think of the functions that take place within financial-services institutions as being sort of decomposed or atomized, and then re-solved in a new way using technology.And some of those things can scale to be business models. I think we\u2019ve seen that clearly in mobile payments.MR. DOWELL: Ping An also has a position in Chinese lender Lufax. Do you want to talk a little about what Ping An\u2019s interest is in fintech?MR. LARSEN: In the last decade or so, Ping An has made a massive investment in technology. It has 20,000 technology developers and scale platforms that run on blockchain. We\u2019re doing advanced research into voice recognition and facial recognition for all kinds of different applications.Alongside that, [founder, chairman and CEO]       Peter Ma       has been able to incubate and create new platforms repeatedly. Lufax is a good example. We\u2019re talking about a $19 billion company as of its last valuation round. GoodDoctor.com is another one\u2014140 million registered users, consulting physicians via chat and image.There are probably a dozen similar potential platforms that are at various stages of incubation within the group. And then there is a huge amount of effort around artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular.Our vision is that our business will be a data business.MR. DOWELL: What types of investments is the $1 billion Global Voyager Fund seeking?MR. LARSEN: Our focus will be mostly strategic and our sweet spot is investments in the $10 million to $30 million range. That will naturally lead to bigger opportunities for companies that are in their rapid scaling phase. [We want to invest in] people we can learn from. We can access their capabilities through joint-venture agreements, distribution deals, technology deals, licensing.

CNC 0.25%       said it would expand its offerings in the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces, entering three new states and bucking a trend of insurers retreating amid uncertainty about the future of the exchanges.Centene, a Medicaid-focused insurer that has been able to eke out profits in the marketplaces while many competitors have lost money, said it would begin selling exchange plans in Kansas, Missouri and Nevada next year. It will increase the area where it sells marketplace plans in six more states: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas and Washington.Centene also said it would stop offering marketplace plans in Massachusetts next year, because of continued low enrollment. Overall, the company is aiming to offer plans in 15 exchange states next year, up from 13 currently, a spokeswoman said.Centene Chief Executive Officer       Michael F. Neidorff       said in an interview that it was too soon to say if his company would enter counties that are projected to have no exchange insurer next year, but \u201cwhere there\u2019s a need, we\u2019re going to try to fill that need.\u201dAbout 45 counties in Ohio, Washington and Missouri have appeared likely to be without any products available through their insurance marketplaces in 2018.In Ohio, where             Anthem Inc.       said it planned to pull out of the marketplace in 2018, a spokesman for the state insurance regulator said that the regulator\u2019s previous announcement that 18 counties appeared set to lack exchange plans already factored in the impact of Centene\u2019s filing.A spokeswoman for the insurance regulator in Washington state said that Centene\u2019s 2018 exchange filing didn\u2019t include the two counties in the state that are currently projected to be without marketplace insurers. She said the regulator is \u201cstill working with insurers to see if any are willing to go into the bare counties, Klickitat and Grays Harbor.\u201d Right now, Premera Blue Cross sells exchange plans in those two counties, but it said it doesn\u2019t intend to do so next year.In a statement, the Missouri insurance regulator said it did \u201cnot have any final details relating to the areas of Missouri in which Centene plans to be active\u201d but the department will \u201ccontinue working with all parties and doing everything it can to ensure\u201d that Missouri residents have insurance choices. The state has appeared poised to have no exchange insurers in 25 western counties next year in the wake of an announced exit by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas CityIn Kansas, a spokesman for the state regulator said Centene appeared to be going into two counties where Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City was leaving, which seems to leave the state set so far to have two exchange insurers in every county.Mr. Neidorff said that Centene\u2019s expansion reflects that \u201cwe do very well in the exchanges; it\u2019s been a good business segment for us.\u201d Despite the lack of clarity around the future of the ACA, as Republicans in Congress work to pass a health-care bill, Mr. Neidorff said Centene is making its calls based on the information it has now, rather than the possible changes to come.\u201cWe think we have the agility to deal with the various regulatory environments,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tend to make decisions around the facts that are known at that point in time.\u201dHe also said that in the end, policy makers \u201cwill want the vulnerable population to have health care.\u201dIt isn\u2019t the first time that Centene has made a bold bet while other insurers were retreating from the ACA business. This year, the company agreed to offer plans in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County after all its competitors pulled out, assuring that enrollees in Phoenix had an exchange option.The company\u2019s ACA plan enrollment grew sharply this year, to 1.2 million people as of the end of March, from 537,000 at the end of 2016.A number of other large insurers, particularly publicly traded ones, pulled back sharply from the marketplace business this year and/or have announced plans to do so next year, including             UnitedHealth Group Inc.,Aetna Inc.       and             Humana Inc.Insurers announcing exchange retreats for next year have cited continued financial losses in some cases, but they have also said that the lingering uncertainty around the future of the ACA poses challenges as they try to make plans for 2018. In particular, the Trump administration has threatened to stop federal payments that help reduce costs for low-income ACA enrollees, funds that insurers have said are vital for steadying the exchanges.The Republican House has passed a bill that would rewrite large portions of the ACA, and Senate Republicans are working on legislation as well.Centene, which operates off a low-cost platform and health-care provider network, using approaches it has honed in the Medicaid market, has been able to find positive margins on exchange business. Centene has repeatedly said it sees potential in it, partly because the exchange population it attracts is similar to its Medicaid enrollees.However, not all Medicaid insurers have had similar results\u2014            Molina Healthcare Inc.       has said it is considering pulling back from its exchange business next year amid uncertainty about the federal cost-sharing payments and in the wake of a surprise loss last year that resulted from an ACA program designed to smooth insurers\u2019 risks.Another region at risk of having no exchange plans next year, around Knoxville, Tenn., was able to avoid a coverage gap when BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee agreed to re-enter the area for 2018.\u2014Anna Wilde MathewsWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'As Others Retreat, Insurer Adds States.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/centene-to-expand-affordable-care-act-marketplaces-1497366722", "news_title": "Centene to Expand Affordable Care Act Marketplace Offerings", "keywords": "affordable care act,centene,government sponsored health insurance,health insurance,health insurance exchanges,health insurance marketplaces,insurance,obamacare,trump,trumpcare,Centene,CNC,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,welfare,social services,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "Western tech companies have had a turbulent relationship with China\u2014particularly over issues concerning the protection of intellectual property. How does one of the biggest players handle it? The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Anders spoke with             Microsoft Corp.\u2019s        MSFT 0.76%       chairman and chief executive for greater China,       Alain Crozier.       Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.MR. ANDERS: Microsoft has been doing business in China for something like 25 years, How would you say it\u2019s going?MR. CROZIER: It\u2019s going very well. In the past 10 days, as an example, we\u2019ve done two very large announcements. First, we did the first world-wide launch of any product out of China with the new Surface Pro. That\u2019s a big sign that the Chinese market is very important for Microsoft. Most, if not all, products are launched out of the U.S. Already, this is our second-largest market for Surface. If everything goes well, China is going to be the first market for Microsoft from a hardware standpoint.The second one is also very important. We have now a Windows 10 government edition available for the Chinese government but also for the state-owned enterprises.With another big piece of Microsoft\u2019s business, a cloud business, a joint venture that we started some time ago here in China, is experiencing very nice and very solid growth.MR. ANDERS: I know this process involved some amount of sharing some proprietary code with your Chinese partners. Western companies have long been cautious when it comes to sharing technology in China. Was this something that you considered to be a risk?MR. CROZIER: When you are a software developer and you put a lot of effort and research and development into code, it is clear that when you develop a solution or product, you want to keep the code for yourself.And the reality is at some point you have to also decide what is best for customers, what is best for government and what is best also for Microsoft. And I think we\u2019ve decided that now was a time to open up as a software company to initiatives like this one. Is there a risk? I\u2019ll tell you that in 10 years.It\u2019s a decision that I know a lot of people don\u2019t really want to take. But I think a lot of things are changing in China, from an IP standpoint. I think there are also more reforms that really help companies like Microsoft make decisions like this one.MR. ANDERS: With Windows 10, while Microsoft has said this software is as robust as the software anywhere else, this still puts some doubt in someone\u2019s mind that perhaps you weakened something like security to break into the Chinese market.MR. CROZIER: Windows 10 is the most secure operating system Microsoft has ever built. When you look at how Windows 10 is used by all types of governments, including some very conservative governments, Windows 10 is by far the best operating system.We have also been very transparent. If you are a government and you want to see exactly what\u2019s going on with Windows 10, our doors are totally open.MR. ANDERS: I want to ask you more broadly about the experience of a Western company, especially a Western technology company, doing business in China in 2017.  Obviously, Microsoft has a couple of decades of experience here. You\u2019ve worked in a lot of places yourself. To be blunt, how level or not is the playing field today, for Western firms, especially technology firms?MR. CROZIER: The field is a great field. But the thing is, every company\u2019s built on some values. You have some strict values. You also have some strict principles. And we live in a world today where sometimes maybe some of those principles will evolve because the times are different and because the customers are different and because the competition may be different.You have a lot of forces that at some point will maybe have you change your mind a little bit on how you want to do things.A lot of players come and only have one play, which is an IP play. And it is, \u201cI protect my IP, and I\u2019m going after piracy.\u201d And, \u201cI\u2019m fighting that on my own.\u201d As a software company, you have to change that. You have to, first of all, work with local partners, extensively.So you have to potentially change the way you think. You have to change your business model one way or another and say, \u201cHey, you know what? I want to really do something in this country. I find a partner. I work with this partner. I share maybe more than I used to share.\u201dMR. ANDERS: We were talking about what it takes to be successful in China. And you were saying it takes a very different type of person, really, a different kind of mind-set than it does to work in Silicon Valley or Europe. Can you elaborate on that a bit?MR. CROZIER: You have to be long-term focused when you come to this market. That\u2019s the first thing.The second thing is, the people you hire to be in this market, they have to be long-term focused.And for that, you need maturity. You need to be careful. When the wind is coming here or it\u2019s coming there or it\u2019s snowing or it\u2019s too cold, people start to say, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t like this weather. I don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t like that.\u201dSo, you need to have people who have a certain maturity at saying, \u201cYeah, you know, this isn\u2019t going to be easy. But I need to stay put. And I need to make sure that when I come to China, I love the place.\u201dBecause I\u2019ve seen too many people coming and saying, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been sent by my company to come here.\u201d And then a year later they say, \u201cOh, this place, I don\u2019t like.\u201dWhy? Because it\u2019s very difficult. Because it\u2019s complex. Yeah, sure. But you know what? If you do well, if you have a long-term mind-set and if your company is committed to doing business in China, you\u2019ll experience a fantastic life, I can tell you that.Write to  reports@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-microsoft-handles-the-chinese-market-1497374400", "news_title": "How Microsoft Handles the Chinese Market", "keywords": "alain crozier, d.live, innovation in china,journal reports, microsoft, tech conference, technology conference, technology in china, wall street journal conference, wsj.d, wsj conference, wsjd,Microsoft,MSFT,Alain Crozier,corporate,industrial news,interviews with corporate executives,interviews,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,computing,technology"}, {"content": "Consumer spending is booming in Southeast Asia, thanks in part to the growing adoption of smartphones and other technologies that make it easier to shop for goods and services and to pay for them.Indonesia, with the world\u2019s fourth-largest population, is a market where local tech companies and regional giants alike are focused on tapping the potential of e-commerce.Nadiem Makarim, founder and chief executive of Go-Jek Indonesia, which started with motorcycle-hailing service and has expanded into other online services, and William Tanuwijaya, co-founder and CEO of Indonesian online marketplace Tokopedia, discussed the opportunities and challenges in their home market with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s technology editor, Jason Dean.Following are edited excerpts of their conversation.MR.

TANUWIJAYA: The beauty of Indonesia is that you can really predict the future, by learning what happened in the past from the U.S. market, China market, Japan market, India market.It\u2019s very similar with China in 2008.Indonesia\u2019s GDP per capita last year is the same as China\u2019s in 2008. We also have 3G, 4G now in Indonesia. So we can see the boom that will happen if in the next five years we can follow that pattern.MR. DEAN: Nadiem, you started out with ride sharing for motorcycles and you\u2019ve expanded into food delivery, package delivery, on-demand beauty and cleaning services, and payments. What\u2019s driving your expansion into so many different areas?MR. MAKARIM: First and foremost, as William said, the opportunity in Indonesia is really massive.I think that the risk is actually in not diversifying. We are big students of China, India and other regions. And it\u2019s very obvious that it is difficult to defend a single vertical. The dynamics of competition always dictate that someone with a lower price will always come in, et cetera.But what is defensible, from what we\u2019ve seen in China\u2019s case, is a platform. A platform is basically a mind-set, it\u2019s a thinking of your business that follows the consumer\u2019s need as opposed to what you think the business is.So that is the primary philosophy of Go-Jek, to go where the consumer goes and to be ruthlessly obsessive about customer needs and the problems they face.So for us, diversification is a matter of not only survival, but thriving and being able to defend ourselves as an overall platform.MR. DEAN: How do you decide then what to move into and what not to?MR. MAKARIM: We target all of the highest-frequency middle-class transactions that a person does in their daily life and move it to your smartphone.So let\u2019s look at how a person lives in Indonesia in the middle class. Your highest-frequency transactions are transportation, food, sending stuff around, buying [cellphone] air time, and then paying for stuff at a store. And then of course you\u2019ve got utilities, bills. And so our goal is to cover that gamut of transactions so that you will not be required to transact outside of your smartphone.And that\u2019s why Go-Pay is now one of the biggest focuses of Go-Jek, because it\u2019s the glue that ties the platform all together. In a country where you\u2019ve got 70% of the population that is unbanked and the remaining 30% is severely underbanked, it\u2019s practically an open market for this kind of innovation.What we call the four unicorns within our business are transportation, logistics, food and payments. Those are our four kind of core pillars.MR. DEAN: Indonesia\u2019s total population is about 260 million. How much of that is really addressable for both of you? Not everybody, right? You mentioned the middle class you\u2019re targeting. What is the size of the middle class within that total number?MR. MAKARIM: The middle class is kind of the fattest chunk. You\u2019ve still got this middle-lower to lower class that\u2019s quite big as well. In our business, we are necessity products in many ways, both William\u2019s company and my own.Everyone needs food. Everyone needs to get around. Everyone needs stuff. So the addressable market really is not so much the income level, it\u2019s how many people have an Android. IOS as well, but IOS is in the higher end of the spectrum.MR. DEAN: So what is that now? What is the penetration of mobile phones or smartphones?MR. MAKARIM: I believe right now smartphone penetration is at around 70, 80 million.MR. TANUWIJAYA: Google last year announced that Indonesia already has 100 million internet users. But from that 100 million internet users, only perhaps 40 million have a bank account, 3% have a credit card.We see this gap between people that are already online but they cannot transact online. And we see this opportunity to innovate.So, for example, the past two years we\u2019re building cash collection points at stores in Indonesia. People can buy online and pay in cash through their nearby store.MR. DEAN: What about the idea of going beyond Indonesia? Do you think about that now at all?MR. MAKARIM: We think about it all the time. We have two principles. One is you cannot win Southeast Asia without winning Indonesia. We have to be comfortable across all our verticals before expanding. The second principle is we do not believe in just expanding for the sake of expanding. We believe in partnerships with locally founded companies.MR. TANUWIJAYA: We are sort of the same school. In the past eight years, Tokopedia is only focused on the Indonesian market. And we think that it\u2019s big enough. Our vision is to really democratize commerce technology. That done, and then we\u2019ll consider to expand in other markets.Write to  reports@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-technology-battle-raging-in-indonesia-1497374402", "news_title": "The Technology Battle Raging in Indonesia", "keywords": " consumers in southeast asia, d.live, go-jek indonesia,journal reports,nadiem makarim, southeast asia, southeast asian consumers, tech conference, technology conference, tokopedia, wall street journal conference, william tanuwijaya, wsj.d, wsj conference, wsjd,corporate,industrial news"}, {"content": "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told a congressional panel on Tuesday that he wouldn\u2019t follow an order to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller if he deemed it illegal.Mr. Rosenstein said that under Justice Department regulations he could only dismiss Mr. Mueller if there was a finding of \u201cgood cause,\u201d and added that he was \u201cconfident\u201d that Mr. Mueller will have \u201csufficient independence\u201d to conduct his probe.

The array of brilliantly colored fruit syrups on offer rivals the observatory\u2019s 360-degree views of the city and the snow-capped Alborz mountains beyond. Known as sharbat, this category of vivid fruit essence, served over ice and topped with chilled water, was created to cool the body in desert heat and takes the edge off a sultry afternoon anywhere.Your guide to mastering the lazy summerExotic as it sounds, sharbat is basically simple syrup, made by dissolving sugar in boiling water, brightened with an infusion of fruit, herbs or flowers. The syrup will keep for a couple of weeks in a jar in the refrigerator, ready to pour over a glass of ice and top off with still or sparkling water, or to mix up in a pitcher for entertaining.Like \u201csherbet,\u201d \u201csorbet\u201d and \u201csyrup,\u201d \u201csharbat\u201d derives from the Arabic word for drink, sharab. As sharbat moved west with Crusaders and other early European travelers returning from the Middle East, it gradually evolved into a smooth, icy treat eaten with a spoon. Sharbat made with rose water\u2014golab in Farsi\u2014flowered into the julep in the New World, where Kentuckians mixed it up into a combination of bourbon and mint.Mint also features in the mother of all sharbats, called sekanjabin, rendered deliciously tart with a splash of vinegar. Think of it as the original Gatorade, an exhilarating combination of sweet, sour and salt that helps replace lost electrolytes. For a striking summer spritzer, serve ice-cold sekanjabin garnished with fresh mint, cucumber and strips of bright-pink watermelon.Sharbat is all about balance and subtlety, and to that end, whole cardamom pods and fresh turmeric root, included in two of the recipes here, yield a round, mellow flavor without any trace of bitterness. Fresh sour cherries make another delicious sharbat, and if you miss their fleeting season, unsweetened dried cherries make an excellent substitute. Whatever the recipe, you can always whisk in a spoonful of honey for added sweetness.Other ingredients to experiment with include saffron, dried orange blossoms and bittersweet dried limes. An elegant mocktail in itself, sharbat also mixes well with bourbon, rum, gin or vodka, and makes a heady match with sparkling wine.Serves: 8Use a food processor to pur\u00e9e 6 cups coarsely chopped, seeded cantaloupe (from 1 ripe, 3-lb cantaloupe).

J.P. Morgan Chase        JPM 0.14%       & Co. Chief       James Dimon,        for example, has described his bank\u2019s balance sheet as a \u201cfortress\u201d that could absorb crisis-style losses not just for itself, but many other banks as well.If the Treasury\u2019s changes were adopted, they could allow banks to return more capital to shareholders, which in turn would boost returns on equity and possibly further bolster stock-market valuations. The downside, say critics, is that this could weaken banks\u2019 loss-absorbing buffers and threaten confidence in the financial system.Here are some areas where banks stand to gain from the Treasury proposals:Leverage Ratio\u2014Current rules say the biggest banks must hold capital equal to at least 5% of their total leverage exposure, a broad-brush measure of their total assets and exposures. Treasury is proposing that banks be allowed to exclude some holdings from that measure, namely cash deposited at central banks, U.S. Treasury debt, and some of the money held at clearinghouses related to derivatives.That small change would give a big boost to leverage ratios. J.P. Morgan\u2019s could possibly increase by more than 1 percentage point or more. The higher that ratio goes, the more likely the bank is able to return more capital to shareholders.Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that such rules changes could leave the four biggest U.S. banks with nearly $90 billion in excess common equity.There is another potential benefit. The House recently passed the so-called Choice Act, which would allow banks to opt out of stringent regulation if they maintained a leverage ratio of at least 10%.While that legislation isn\u2019t expected to be taken up by the Senate, the Treasury proposals support the 10% choice. Changing the calculation of leverage exposure it would make it easier for banks to get to that level.The big six banks would need to raise nearly $400 billion, combined, to get to that level, based on March 31 figures and Wall Street Journal calculations. At J.P. Morgan alone, the shortfall to 10%, which currently would be about $105 billion, would fall to about $60 billion or less.Operational Risk\u2014Bankers say that among the most onerous requirements they face is one that forces them to effectively hold capital against possible \u201coperational\u201d losses. These are losses that could come not from things like market moves or loan defaults, but from the banks\u2019 own actions. Those could include fines or big legal settlements.Such costs soared after the financial crisis, amid a series of billion-dollar settlements over mortgage practices, faulty money-laundering monitoring and currency-market manipulation. Those have created so-called operational risk assets that are equal in some cases to about 30% of bank assets weighted for risk, which are key to determining other capital measures.Treasury says that a \u201cmore transparent, rules-based approach should be used in the calculation of operational risk capital.\u201d This means capital required for such risks would be more in line with recent actions and could be reduced if banks take measures to reduce that risk.Analysts estimate the big banks have more than $200 billion in capital tied up due to operational risk. Changes wouldn\u2019t eliminate the need for all of this capital, but would likely allow banks to return a big slug of it over time.G-SIB Surcharge\u2014The largest \u201cglobal systemically important banks,\u201d known as G-SIBs, are required by U.S. regulators to hold an additional capital buffer, or surcharge, on top of their other requirements. This is to reflect their complexity and the disastrous spillover effects their failure would have on the global financial system.This charge varies, but will average 2.8 percentage points across the biggest banks when it is fully phased-in, according to analysts at Nomura Instinet.The Treasury proposes that this standard be \u201crecalibrated,\u201d in part to reflect the fact that these banks don\u2019t rely as much on short-term funding, such as repurchase agreements, or \u201crepos,\u201d to fund themselves, reducing their risk of sudden insolvency.Again, that could free up capital that could be returned to shareholders.TLAC\u2014Big banks subject to annual stress tests have to prove that they hold enough capital and debt to cover major losses, a measure known as \u201ctotal loss-absorbing capacity.\u201dThe idea is that in a failure or stressed situation, some debt, along with equity, could be used to absorb losses. As part of this, banks have had to hold more long-term debt than they may otherwise have done.That pushes up banks\u2019 overall interest costs, which reduces net interest income. This weighs on profits and dampens returns.Treasury is proposing that regulators revisit rules on this regarding the mandatory minimum debt ratio included in calculating this requirement.Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 13:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-banks-win-big-under-the-mnuchin-plan-1497373208", "news_title": "Where Banks Win Big Under the Mnuchin Plan ", "keywords": "bank capital requirements,banking,bank regulation,big bank,dodd-frank,financial regulation,finreg,J.P.

A deal with the DUP risks complicating the fragile peace in Northern Ireland, where the British and Irish governments act as impartial mediators between the main Protestant and Catholic parties.Mrs. May will likely have to agree to concessions in exchange for the DUP\u2019s support in no-confidence and budget votes essential to keeping a minority government in power. Typically under such agreements, support in other votes would be on a case-by-case basis.John Major, a former Conservative British prime minister who helped pave the way for the 1998 Good Friday agreement that put an end to three decades of violent confrontation, said he is worried about the implications for peace.\u201cA fundamental part of that peace process is that the U.K. government needs to be impartial,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was always the intention. The danger is that, however much it tries, it will not be seen to be impartial if it is locked into a deal with one of the parties.\u201dMr. Major said that while he doesn\u2019t believe there is any immediate threat of a return to violence, the peace process is \u201cfragile,\u201d and there is a risk that creating a sense of grievance in either group will spark a return to violence.The deal with Northern Irish lawmakers will likely have significant implications for Brexit, raising the prospect that Mrs. May will be pressured by lawmakers to pursue a closer relationship with the European Union than she had set out before the election.The Democratic Unionists, which won 10 seats in last week\u2019s election, is a socially conservative party that supports Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union but wants to keep a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border with the Republic of Ireland after the U.K. leaves the EU.This aim may be incompatible with Mrs. May pre-election stance in Brexit negotiations, in which she said the U.K. wouldn\u2019t agree to staying in the EU\u2019s customs union or single market, or to the bloc\u2019s principle of guaranteeing free movement of people from EU countries.Aside from Brexit, the DUP, a pro-British party that has strong support from working-class voters in Northern Ireland, may also push for less severe cuts in public services.Data released Tuesday showed consumer prices in the U.K. in May rising at the fastest annual rate for almost four years, intensifying a squeeze on households. Consumer prices have risen since last year\u2019s Brexit vote caused a sharp fall in the pound, while wage growth hasn\u2019t kept pace.Northern Ireland has been without a government since February after Sinn F\u00e9in, the mainly-Catholic nationalist party that wants the province to leave the U.K. and join the Republic of Ireland, withdrew from a power-sharing agreement with the DUP. Talks over a new agreement resumed Monday after the election.Gerry Adams,        leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, said an agreement between the DUP and the Conservatives wouldn\u2019t alter his basic lack of trust in the British government.\u201cThe English government have never been honest with us, ever, have never been referees, have never been neutral,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cThey\u2019re obliged to be so in the wording of the Good Friday and other agreements, but unless an Irish government is keeping them to that responsibility, they will behave as they have behaved as long as I have lived.\u201dThe agreement includes a pledge that London should exercise \u201crigorous impartiality.\u201d Irish Prime Minister       Enda Kenny       and some British officials involved in negotiating the agreement have questioned whether such impartiality is possible when one of the parties to the constitutional dispute is part of that government.Unionist supporters of the agreement say the \u201cimpartiality\u201d clause is intended to rule out any discrimination against individuals based on their view of the constitutional question and not to rule out any coalition or other agreement between political parties.David Trimble,        who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as one of the leading unionist politicians who paved the way for the agreement and the peace that followed, said he didn\u2019t believe a Conservative-DUP deal would upend the peace process.\u201cThe clause is essentially dealing with treating people equally,\u201d Mr. Trimble told the British Broadcasting Corp. \u201cI think there\u2019s a fair amount of scaremongering going on.

Of those, almost 30% have changed CFOs more than once. The moves coincided with a historic collapse in crude-oil prices and a series of bankruptcies that decimated the sector.During that same period, 35% of the 1,000 largest U.S. companies changed CFOs at least once, according to Korn/Ferry International.Crude-oil prices tumbled from more than $100 a barrel in June 2014 to a 12-year low of US$26.21 in February 2016, erasing more than three-quarters of their value.

He succeeded former finance chief       Jeremy Thigpen,        whose priority during the downturn was cost-cutting, Mr. Singletary said.The Houston-based company purchased a business unit from             Trican Well Service Ltd.      , a Canadian oilfield-services company last June for $53.5 million Canadian dollars (US$40 million). National Oilwell signed a joint venture with Saudi Aramco in May and will own a 70% stake in the new venture.Mr. Bayardo \u201chas been an important part of that strategy and execution on that strategy,\u201d said Mr. Singletary.Marathon Oil hired       Dane Whitehead       as its finance chief in March, shortly before the company announced two large deals. The Houston-based oil and natural-gas exploration and production company reached an agreement to sell its Canadian subsidiary for $2.5 billion in March. It also acquired land in the oil-rich Permian Basin for US$700 million.Mr. Whitehead previously worked at             EP Energy Corp.      , a company that, according to Dealogic, completed 10 deals during his tenure. That dealmaking experience makes him a good fit for Marathon, which seems to be ramping up its M&A activity, said       Muhammed Ghulam,        an analyst at Raymond James.Marathon declined to comment.Tough market conditions forced many companies to write down the value of their oil and gas properties, turning up the pressure on executives, said       Deborah Byers,        partner and U.S. energy leader at Ernst & Young LLP.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of churn in management teams in general, just because there\u2019s a lot of stress in the industry,\u201d she said.Three finance chiefs have resigned from Gulf Island since 2012. The Houston-based builder of offshore oil and gas platforms named       David Schorlemer       CFO in January. He succeeded       Jeffrey Favret       who stepped down late last year after taking the reins from       Roy Breerwood III       in 2013. Mr. Breerwood succeeded       Robin Seibert       who left the company in 2012.The pressure to cut costs and lay off staff in the oil and gas sector took a toll on finance chiefs in the industry, said       William Chiles,        a company director for Gulf Island.Mr. Chiles said Mr. Schorlemer has different strengths than the previous finance chief, who had an accounting background. \u201cOur current CFO has better financial-engineering skills, more M&A and capital-market skills that we need today,\u201d he said.Despite the bloodletting among finance chiefs during the oil downturn, those who stuck it out in the industry are likely to be in demand for years, said       Rob Thummel,        portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors. Many of these executives navigated the cratering oil prices while negotiating lower borrowing rates and soothing concerned shareholders, he said.\u201cThat experience, as painful as it was for their pocketbook and their stock options, was valuable for their career development,\u201d Mr. Thummel said. \u201cSomeone getting through the tough times is what you want in a CFO.\u201dWrite to Tatyana Shumsky at tatyana.shumsky@wsj.comCorrections & AmplificationsThe last name of Loren Singletary, vice president of investor and industry relations for National Oilwell Varco, was given incorrectly given as Singleton in an earlier version of this article.

At times there could be a good shutdown, and times there may not be a good shutdown.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not our primary objective to have a shutdown,\u201d he added.Congress reached an agreement in April to fund the government through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year, but will have to pass new spending bills for fiscal year 2018 or reach another agreement to keep the government operating beyond that point.Mr. Mnuchin emphasized that the administration would never allow critical government functions to be shut downThe government faces another significant challenge in September, when it may run out of cash to pay its bills unless lawmakers lift the federal borrowing limit. Government debt hit that limit in mid-March, and Treasury has been using cash-conservation measures since then to keep meeting its obligations, including payments on government debt, Social Security and veterans benefits.Mr. Mnuchin urged lawmakers to lift the debt ceiling before they leave for a five-week recess July 28.

The Spanish rule, which began under       King Philip II,        followed by nearly 50 years of American rule have \u201cmuddled our identity as a people and a nation,\u201d he said.To push the ball along, Mr. Alejano has filed a bill in Congress to finance a search for possible alternatives, much as Indonesia and other former European colonies renamed themselves after securing independence.\u2018If we want to be truly independent, then we should throw away the bonds of colonialism by establishing our own national identity.\u2019Mr. Alejano\u2014a former marine captain who recently failed in a bid to impeach President       Rodrigo Duterte       for his war on drugs\u2014didn\u2019t suggest any new names himself. But there are some ideas out there.Andres Bonifacio,        one of the leaders of the Philippines\u2019s 19th-century revolt against Spanish rule, favored the term Katagalugan, which can be loosely translated as Nation of the Tagalogs, or those who settle by the river.Late dictator       Ferdinand Marcos       supported changing the name to Maharlika, originally a reference to an ancient warrior caste and a close relation to the term \u201cmerdeka,\u201d or freedom, in Indonesian and Malaysian languages.Some people in the present-day Philippines, notably those living in the Muslim-majority areas in the south of the country, don\u2019t consider themselves to be Filipino at all. They consider it as a term for those who submitted to King Philip II and the Roman Catholic Church. A rebellion has long simmered in the southern parts of the country after these areas were annexed by the Republic of the Philippines following independence from the U.S. in 1946.It is unclear how much traction Mr. Alejano\u2019s proposal will gain.The earlier push to rename the country was tainted in part by the dictator Marcos\u2019s support for it. Some Filipinos also say they feel that the current name also reflects the Christian faith practiced by a large majority of its inhabitants.\u201cThe origin of the name is from Philip, one of the 12 apostles of Christ,\u201d said one commentator,       Edgar Villanueva.       \u201cWe should be proud of that name as we are the only country named after a disciple of Jesus Christ.\u201dStill, there is a glimmer of a precedent.

Verizon\u2019s go90 mobile video app, will also become more integrated with Oath\u2019s content properties. And entirely new mobile content brands are set to launch before the end of the year, created by Oath\u2019s internal Factory unit.Mr. Armstrong, who is now Oath\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cThe entire company is centering around brand building for mobile and building our content brands.\u201dMr. Armstrong declined to comment on Ms. Mayer\u2019s \u201cdecision process\u201d behind her move, beyond referencing that the pair had planned its organizational structure together as they worked to integrate one public company inside another.\u2018The entire company is centering around brand building for mobile and building our content brands.\u2019Ms. Mayer was widely expected to be leaving, despite saying last year that she planned to stick around. Her name was absent from the leadership team Mr. Armstrong listed in a memo to staff, which was reported by Recode in April.\u201cGiven the inherent changes to my role, I\u2019ll be leaving the company,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in a note to employees, which she posted on Tumblr. \u201cLooking back on my time at Yahoo, we have confronted seemingly insurmountable business challenges, along with many surprise twists and turns.\u201dMr. Armstrong confirmed reports that the company plans to lay off around 15% of staff, or 2,100 of the roughly 14,000 people in its combined workforce. The job cuts will mainly affect those in back office functions, where there are duplicate roles and teams.Mr. Armstrong now has a job to maintain morale among the remaining team, but he said his staff are \u201cexcited about the differentiated strategy.\u201dThe acquisition was first announced in July last year, but was hampered after Yahoo then announced two separate hacking attacks that took place in 2013 and 2014, which led to 1.5 billion user accounts being compromised. After the disclosure of the data breaches, Verizon and Yahoo agreed to shave $350 million from the original offer price. The final price tag was a marked drop for one of the early web pioneers, which once had a market capitalization of more than $125 billion during the peak of the dot-com boom.Mr. Armstrong had previously publicly stated that he wanted Oath to reach 2 billion consumers, up from around 1 billion currently, by 2020. He also previously aimed for Oath to boost revenue to more than $10 billion. Mr. Armstrong has now added a small \u201ccaveat\u201d to that time frame as the deal took longer to close than expected.Ahead of the acquisition closing, Verizon was predicted to generate $1.5 billion in net global digital ad revenue in 2017, according to research firm eMarketer. Yahoo was estimated to generate $3.2 billion in net digital ad revenue world-wide this year. Google and Facebook dominate the online ad market, with eMarketer estimating they will generate $73.8 billion and $36.3 billion in digital ad revenue world-wide this year respectively.Oath\u2019s brands are best known in the U.S., thanks to Yahoo and AOL\u2019s portal businesses that provided many consumers with their first access to internet services such as email.Oath\u2019s global growth plan will be centered on a limited number of key markets to extend its audience outside the U.S., including western Europe, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore. Mr. Armstrong said he also wouldn\u2019t rule out acquisitions to help Oath achieve its targets.Some social-media scorn was poured over Oath\u2019s corporate branding when it unexpectedly leaked through a Business Insider article in April. Mr. Armstrong quickly responded with a tweet, confirming the new name. He said that tweet earned Oath \u201c3.5 billion media impressions\u201d globally, which would have cost $100 million in ad placements. The company conducted a study afterward and found 70% of people were positive about the brand, 15% were neutral and 15% were negative.Mr. Armstrong said: \u201cThe other positive thing to note on this is we didn\u2019t do this the normal way; we didn\u2019t hire consultancies [or a] branding naming agency; we basically built the entire brand ourselves internally.\u201dBuilding media and tech brands is something Mr. Armstrong has form in. From co-founding a magazine in his early 20s called \u201cBeginnings in Boston,\u201d aimed at young people starting out in their careers, he moved into sales roles at a variety of early internet companies in the 1990s. He eventually joined Google, helping grow key ad products, including AdSense and DoubleClick. Mr. Armstrong became CEO of AOL in 2009.Ross Levinsohn, Yahoo\u2019s former interim CEO who was in the running to lead the company permanently but was replaced by Ms. Mayer in 2012, said Mr. Armstrong is well-positioned to lead Oath:\u201cHe understands the businesses as well as anyone, is a dynamic leader and [is] well respected,\u201d Mr. Levinsohn said. \u201cHe has a well-heeled parent\u2026if they allow him freedom, flexibility and provide more capital to acquire other businesses, then his goals are possible.\u201dWrite to Lara O\u2019Reilly at lara.o'reilly@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 11:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-launches-new-ad-and-content-unit-as-yahoo-deal-completes-1497362908", "news_title": "Verizon Launches New Ad and Content Unit as Yahoo Deal Closes", "keywords": "aol,huffpost,marissa mayer,oath,techcrunch,tim armstrong,tumblr,us tech company,verizon,yahoo,yahoo finance,AOL,Verizon Communications,VZ,Yahoo,YHOO,Tim Armstrong,Marissa Mayer,plans,strategy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,new products,services,marketing,markets,advertising,management,management moves,labor,personnel,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,lay-offs,redundancies,senior level management,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,digital marketing,internet service providers,internet search engines,public relations,business,consumer services,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia\u2014        Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google unit has agreed the amount of tax arrears Indonesia says the technology company hasn\u2019t paid since 2009, a government official said Tuesday.\u201cYes, they will pay the taxes as far back as 2009,\u201d said Tax Director General Ken Dwijugiasteadi.Google didn\u2019t immediately respond when asked to confirm his statement.Mr. Dwijugiasteadi declined to specify the amount, which the government last year estimated at around 5.5 trillion rupiah ($415 million).

Stephen Poloz       on Tuesday said the interest-rate cuts it delivered in 2015 to fend off the fallout from plunging oil prices \u201chave done their work,\u201d reinforcing a \u201chawkish\u201d message the central bank delivered a day earlier that pushed the Canadian dollar upward.Mr. Poloz said the Canadian economy is gathering momentum, with an array of sectors expanding. Business investment also is firming following a prolonged weak spell fueled by the commodity-price slump, with capital spending expected to build as companies operate at near full capacity.\u201cIt\u2019s a much more diverse recovery,\u201d Mr. Poloz said in an interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where the central bank is holding a board of directors meeting. \u201cWhat that suggests to us is that the interest-rate cuts that we put in place in 2015 have largely done their work, so that\u2019s very reassuring and we are encouraged by data.\u201dThe Canadian dollar strengthened further against the U.S. dollar following Mr. Poloz\u2019s comments shortly after 8:30 a.m. EDT. The U.S. dollar recently trading around C$1.3243, versus C$1.3283 before the interview started.On Monday, the central bank\u2019s second-highest-ranking official,       Carolyn Wilkins,        rattled markets with an unexpected hawkish turn in a speech, in which she said the central bank would have to assess whether ultralow interest rates\u2014at 0.50% since July 2015\u2014are still required given Canadian economic activity is broadening across industries and regions.The comments this week from the two most senior Bank of Canada officials appear to have ignited volatility in the Canadian financial market. The loonie, or the nickname given to the Canadian currency, has gained about two cents against the U.S. dollar within the last day, while the yield on the two-year Canadian government bond moved to 0.906%, the highest mark since December 2014. Yields move inversely to the price of bonds.Further, the overnight-index swap market is now pricing in a 64% probability of a rate increase in October, up from 25% at the end of last week, according to TD Securities.Financial-market volatility reflects the about-face this year in the Bank of Canada\u2019s outlook. In January, Mr. Poloz said further monetary-policy easing remained a possibility given the uncertainty posed by U.S. President       Donald Trump       on trade policy. Three-quarters of Canadian exports head to the U.S. market.Mr. Poloz and other Bank of Canada officials continued to encourage caution even as a string of robust economic data emerged, signaling Canada\u2019s economy had moved into a higher gear after a slump fueled by lower commodity prices. It wasn\u2019t until its May 24 policy decision that the BOC embraced a slightly more upbeat tone on economic conditions.Nick Exarhos, an economist at CIBC World Markets, said the central bank\u2019s message this week wasn\u2019t a surprise, given the strengthening employment data and first-quarter annualized growth of 3.7% that was tops among Group of Seven economies. It was the timing, ahead of a policy decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve due Wednesday, that caught market watchers off guard, he said. He said traders widely expected the Bank of Canada to stay the course in messaging this week and let a rise in the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate keep upward pressure on the Canadian currency in check, thereby helping exports.Mr. Exarhos said uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy and less-than-stellar performance from exports likely rules out an imminent rate increase on July 12, when the Bank of Canada issues its next rate decision. But labor-market gains and commentary in recent weeks from Bank of Canada officials \u201care commensurate with the 50 basis points of tightening for the first half of 2018\u2014or slightly earlier.\u201d\u2014David George-Cosh in Toronto contributed to this article.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 11:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bocs-poloz-confident-2015-rate-cuts-have-done-their-work-1497362356", "news_title": "BOC\u2019s Poloz Confident 2015 Rate Cuts Have \u2018Done Their Work\u2019", "keywords": "boc,poloz,poloz cbc,poloz interview,Bank of Canada,Canadian Broadcasting,Stephen Poloz,Carolyn Wilkins,plans,strategy,capital expenditure,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,central banking,broadcasting,credit,financial services,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "AT SAVE KHAKI UNITED, a New York menswear store that sells its own line of casual, cotton basics, the most popular shorts go by the name \u201cEasy.\u201d Yet, easy to spot on the street, they are not.

The shorts\u2019 straight-cut legs are slightly fuller than the norm, though not sloppy. These are shorts in which to truly\u2014yet still rakishly\u2014kick back. Go fishing. Fall asleep during the day with a book on your face. Eat apricot-glazed chicken wings to excess and simply retie. You can have it all.Labels like Gucci, Ami and             Brunello Cucinelli                   have also discovered that by widening the leg and adding a tie-it-as-you-like-it waist, they can transform stodgy Bermuda shorts into something much freer. (Though none christened theirs with a winky title like \u201cEasy.\u201d)When Save Khaki introduced the shorts three years ago, it was ahead of the comfort curve. Back then, the reigning style of summer shorts could have passed for Lance Armstrong\u2019s competition gear. In J. Crew catalogs and GQ spreads, men found taut, abbreviated shorts that girdled their midsections and gave the world a high-resolution glimpse of their gluteus maximus. \u201cPeople were wearing things tight, even shorts,\u201d said Todd Barket, the owner of Unionmade, a mini-chain of West Coast menswear stores. Over time, those sealed-like-a-sausage shorts became overcooked. \u201cPeople were so attached to skinny, it got pedestrian-looking,\u201d said Mr. Barket, who felt compelled to offer relief this season by stocking elastic- and drawstring-waisted shorts from labels like Barena and Older Brother.The look \u201ccomes from an athletic leisure background,\u201d said Dominic Sondag, designer of New York menswear brand S.K. Manor Hill, whose twill drawstring pull-ons were inspired by a pair of vintage military training shorts. Another antecedent: roomy mesh basketball shorts. To balance sporty connotations, Mr. Sondag crucially decided to upgrade the fabric, making his in a refined cotton twill. The result? Shorts more appropriate for a cocktail bar than a bench press.Though stealthily stylish, these shorts are likely too relaxed to pair with an oxford shirt. For a bit of polish, try a fitted, but not tight, pique polo shirt. Unionmade\u2019s Mr. Barket also recommended looser tees and open-collared camp shirts to keep the overall silhouette relaxed.

SHLD -3.66%       on Tuesday said it is cutting 400 jobs at its corporate offices as part of its restructuring plan.The struggling retailer said the bulk of job cuts will be at its Hoffman Estates, Ill., headquarters, adding that it worked to leave open positions unfilled and reduce contract workers before cutting full-time jobs.The planned job cuts are in addition to the $1.25 billion restructuring plan the company unveiled earlier this year. Sears Holdings said that so far, actions such as paying down debt, cutting expenses and reducing the size of its pension plan have created $1 billion in annualized cost savings.The owner of Kmart and Sears stores raised doubts in March that it could generate enough money to cover its obligations over the next 12 months. The company said the disclosure was triggered by an accounting rule that recently took effect and didn\u2019t reflect management\u2019s expectations for the business\u2019s near-term health.Separate on Tuesday,             Sears Canada Inc.,        SCC -22.50%       which was partially spun off from Sears Holdings, for the first time cast doubt on its own ability to continue operating after struggling to cobble together necessary financing.The Canadian retailer, which has been operating at a loss since 2014, said it had expected to borrow up to $175 million against its real estate, but negotiations with lenders revealed it could only raise up to $109 million. Without an additional cash infusion, the company warned it might not generate enough money from operations to meet its obligations coming due within the next year.Financial adviser BMO Capital Markets and lawyers at Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP will advise Sears Canada on its options, which the company said could include a financial restructuring or a sale.Sears Holdings has been selling large chunks of its real estate and brands to stay alive, but the lack of lenders willing to provide liquidity is a sign that shedding assets to fund losses has its limits.At the end of April, Sears Holdings had $70 million left to borrow on its credit line. The company used $1 billion of the $1.5 billion of the revolving credit facility, but total borrowings under the loan are restricted based on certain financial measures, as well as its inventory and receivables balances.The company said it pushed back payments on $400 million in debt due soon and paid down about $418 million of debt. It also announced       Stephan Zoll,        president of its online unit, is leaving his position.Sears Holdings Chief Executive       Edward Lampert       owns about 45% of Sears Canada, in part through his hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc.

Hot-dog seller             Nathan\u2019s Famous        NATH -0.38%       has talked about the damage done to its flagship Coney Island location in 2012 in the exact same language three years in a row.Do investors still care?Nathan\u2019s isn\u2019t taking any chances, nor do other companies. There is, says Harvard Business School economist Lauren Cohen, an incredible amount of inertia in the language companies use in quarterly and annual regulatory filings, known as 10-Qs and 10-Ks respectively. That is partly because corporate lawyers push back against alterations, worried they might expose a company to legal risks.When the language in filings does change, investors should sit up and notice. Not that they do.Mr. Cohen and economists Christopher Malloy and Quoc Nguyen downloaded all the 10-K and 10-Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1994 through 2014 and used textual-analysis software to create a similarity score showing how the language in corporate filings differed one period to the next.They then looked at stock performance following filings. The finding: Shares of companies that had significant changes did much worse than those of companies that didn\u2019t. This was particularly true when it came to changes in the risk factors section of 10-Ks.Indeed, a strategy of buying shares of companies with no significant risk-factor changes and betting against companies with major changes would have returned more than 22 percentage points more than the overall market annually.The similarity score for data-storage company NetApp, for example, fell sharply when it released its 10-K in June 2011. The company\u2019s shares had more than quadrupled from their financial-crisis low, but that run ended. Over the next year, its stock fell 41% while the S&P 500 rose 4%.Tracking risk-factor changes is something even investors without programming chops can do for themselves. Professionals can use services such as FactSet, which has a function called blackline to highlight differences in filings. Individual investors can accomplish as much by pasting text from two 10-Ks into separate Microsoft Word documents and using the compare function, or by using text comparison sites such as textdiff.com.In the 10-K it released in March 2014, copper and fiber-optic wire maker             General Cable                   added a paragraph to its risk factors stating it was reviewing commission payments to its subsidiary in Angola. That September, it announced it was investigating possible bribe payments in Angola, Thailand and India, and its stock fell sharply.The stock underperformance of companies that make big changes to their risk factors suggest that, as a group, they aren\u2019t merely updating their filings to reflect risks that investors have already learned about, but providing information about emerging ones.What is really striking, however, is that the stock market reaction to these risk-factor changes occur gradually. Companies are providing investors with material information, and investors aren\u2019t noticing it.Some of that probably has to do with the form in which the information is getting provided. Annual reports are big, and getting bigger. University of Notre Dame economist Bill McDonald finds that the average 10-K filed last year weighed in at over 26,000 words, nearly three times as many as 20 year ago. That is the equivalent to the text on around 10 full pages in The Wall Street Journal, but about 100 times dullerNot that investors are trying. Mr. McDonald and colleague Tim Loughran found that the average 10-K gets downloaded from the SEC fewer than 30 times, total, on the day and day after it is filed.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Tips Hide in Plain Sight.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 11:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hidden-in-plain-sight-a-powerful-way-to-beat-the-market-1497367597", "news_title": "Hidden in Plain Sight: A Powerful Way to Beat the Market", "keywords": "annual report investment strategy,fbi investigation,hedge funds,hot stocks,investment strategies,personal investments,Nathan's Famous,NATH,NetApp,NTAP,General Cable,BGC,Bill McDonald,Christopher Malloy,Lauren Cohen,Quoc Nguyen,Tim Loughran,commodity,financial market news,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "Two Georgia state prison guards were overpowered and killed by two inmates on a prison-transport bus early Tuesday, according to the Putnam County Sheriff\u2019s office, who had a manhunt on for the escaped prisoners.Two inmates managed to disarm the officers and then one of the prisoners shot and killed both guards around 5:45 a.m. ET on a bus that was traveling on rural Georgia Highway 16 between Eatonton and Sparta in Putnam County, Sheriff Howard Sills said in a news release.Authorities said that after the shooting, the inmates carjacked a green 2004 Honda Civic and fled west toward Eatonton.The escapees were armed with the officers\u2019 .40-caliber Glock pistols, according to the sheriff.The bus had been carrying a total of 29 inmates and was traveling between Baldwin State Prison and another facility, said Teresa Slade, a spokeswoman for the sheriff\u2019s office.Authorities identified the escaped inmates as Ricky Dubose and Donnie Russell Rowe, both who were serving sentences at Baldwin State Prison for armed robbery and other offenses.The shooting is one of a number of recent incidents of violence against corrections officers and between inmates that has raised concerns about staffing and other issues at prisons nationally.Write to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 11:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/authorities-say-two-georgia-inmates-kill-two-prison-guards-1497365913", "news_title": "Two Georgia Guards Killed as Prisoners Break Free From Transit Bus", "keywords": "donnie russell rowe,georgia,inmate escape,manhunt,prison,prison break,ricky dubose,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,murder,manslaughter,transport"}, {"content": "The notion that suitors need to ask the bride\u2019s father\u2019s permission to marry went out with the buggy whip\u2014or did it?Many couples are planning on marrying regardless of the answer, but they\u2019re retooling old scripts to fit the modern marriage\u2014slipping the request into casual conversations and asking Mom as well as Dad. As a result, popping the question before the question can get awkward.Shawn Cox       and       Alyssa Knowles       had bought a house and a business together before Mr. Cox asked Alyssa\u2019s father, Mike, for permission to marry her. To make time for a private conversation, he invited Mr. Knowles to their Charlotte, N.C., house to help install a porch swing.Mr. Knowles says he was surprised to be asked for his permission. \u201cI didn\u2019t think people did that nowadays,\u201d says Mr. Knowles, of Greenville, S.C. \u201cSome people would look on it as an archaic and outdated tradition, but I thought it was nice,\u201d partly because it motivates suitors to get to know the bride\u2019s family well, he says. He and Mr. Cox had just finished installing the swing and sat down to relax when Mr. Cox popped the question.Did you or your partner pop the question to mom or dad before you proposed? Share your proposal story with Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.comBefore Mr. Knowles could answer, the swing fell from the porch ceiling and crashed to the floor, pinning Mr. Cox\u2019s legs. \u201cMike didn\u2019t skip a beat,\u201d Mr. Cox says. \u201cHe picked me up, said, \u2018Yes, you can marry my daughter,\u2019 and, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to             Lowe\u2019s                   and we\u2019re going to fix this.\u2019 \u201d The couple were married in 2012 and own and run three Clothes Mentor name-brand clothing-resale stores.Ms. Cox (nee Knowles) says that while asking for her father\u2019s permission was a formality, she wanted Mr. Cox to do so. \u201cI was only 24 years old at the time. Being 24 and making a huge decision like that, I would have been nervous\u201d without her family\u2019s blessing, she says.Some 77% of suitors ask parents\u2019 permission to wed their daughters, according to a 2015 internet poll of 12,000 brides and 1,200 grooms by The Knot, an online marketplace for wedding products and services. Some gay and lesbian couples are embracing the tradition too, with more than 40% asking parents\u2019 OK, according to another survey by The Knot.Parents don\u2019t always say yes.       Kellie Gould,        editor in chief of The Knot, says she has heard anecdotal reports of fathers rejecting boyfriends\u2019 requests. One father told a 19-year-old teen he and his daughter, also 19, were both too young to marry.Mark Spinelli       tried to slip the conversation with his future father-in-law into a holiday gathering at his girlfriend\u2019s Pompton Plains, N.J., home in 2014. He\u2019d decided to propose to       Jessica Krol       before the new year, and the get-together was his last chance to ask her father Steve for permission to marry her. When Ms. Krol stepped out of the room for a few minutes, Mr. Spinelli rushed past startled relatives seated nearby and whispered his question into Mr. Krol\u2019s ear. \u201cIt was the most awkward situation,\u201d says Mr. Spinelli, a commercial real-estate broker.Parents don\u2019t always follow the script either. Mr. Krol says he welcomed the news and told Mark, \u201cFine,\u201d then, \u201cI started breaking his chops,\u201d quizzing him playfully on his worthiness, including his spelling ability, finances and knowledge of current events. Ms. Krol soon returned to the room and they had to finish the conversation later. Looking back, Mr. Spinelli says he wishes he\u2019d invited Mr. Krol to lunch or coffee instead. The Hoboken, N.J., couple have been happily married for almost a year.Couples are often already living together and some have bought rings and booked wedding venues before they ask parents\u2019 approval. Not surprisingly, some parents respond, \u201cWhy are you even asking?\u201d says       Stephanie Coontz,        research director for the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group of researchers, scientists and therapists who study the American family.The custom of asking the bride\u2019s father is obsolete, now that wives share breadwinning in most households and marriages are more egalitarian. The tradition survives in part because couples hope their families will take an interest in their marriage and help them hold it together in an era of widespread divorce, says Ms. Coontz, author of \u201cMarriage, A History.\u201dSome couples update the tradition in a thoughtful way.       Giovanni Furio       included Deb Drapac, the mother of his girlfriend Annette, along with her father       Steve Drapac,        in the meeting he requested to discuss marriage. Ms. Drapac says she appreciated being included.Rather than promising financial support, he pledged emotional support for Annette, by attending to \u201cher ideas, her emotions and who she is,\u201d says Mr. Furio, a Columbus, Ohio, civil engineer. And he asked for Deb and Steve Drapac\u2019s blessing, rather than their permission.He\u2019d barely gotten started when Mr. Drapac says he choked up, and the conversation dissolved in hugs, kisses and congratulations.The tradition serves another, distinctly modern purpose: It allows suitors to draw in-laws into planning the elaborate wedding rituals that follow.       Dan Oliver,        an accountant at a New York hedge fund, invited Jennifer Friedman\u2019s mother and stepfather, Linda and       Leon Kurzweil,        to dinner at the Four Seasons to ask their permission to marry her. Both were delighted, and Ms. Kurzweil burst into tears of happiness.Mr. Oliver quickly enlisted her help planning a surprise engagement party for Ms. Friedman two months later at a rooftop lounge in Manhattan. A hostess recorded Mr. Oliver\u2019s proposal on bended knee, and 30 relatives and friends emerged from hiding to celebrate the engagement. The couple were married in June.Q: I loved the column on making better small talk.

That means tough choices are looming for the insurer\u2019s chief executive,       Joseph R. Swedish.One of those difficult decisions was revealed last week, when Anthem said it will withdraw from the Ohio insurance marketplace in 2018. Anthem\u2019s departure leaves 18 Ohio counties poised to have no plans available through the marketplace next year.Anthem is a huge player in the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, and the Trump administration has threatened to stop federal payments that reduce costs for low-income people who get coverage in those exchanges. Insurers say the cost-sharing payments provide vital support.The Ohio decision, Anthem said, was a reaction to a volatile market and uncertainty around key issues including the federal payments. Now, Mr. Swedish is weighing what to do in the 13 other states where Anthem offers marketplace plans. He says he wants to be sure consumers have access to affordable health care, and he\u2019s concerned about issues including the severity of cuts to Medicaid in final legislation.Mr. Swedish, 65 years old, is also locked in high-stakes litigation. Anthem and             Cigna Corp.are suing one another over their soured merger deal, which was terminated in May after courts blocked it on antitrust grounds. Anthem is also suing             Express Scripts Holding Co.      , alleging it violated their contract. Express has said it believes the suit is without merit.The former hospital executive, who became Anthem\u2019s CEO in 2013, sat down with The Wall Street Journal late last month to talk about the state of health care.Edited excerpts:The Wall Street Journal: Where are you in the decision-making process with regard to the exchanges?Mr. Swedish: It\u2019s a question of wanting to stay in, delving into the math that will dictate the decision that we\u2019re responsible for making on behalf of the stability of our company, as well as the performance that we can give our customers. The last thing I want to do is give them a substandard product, substandard price, and if we can\u2019t meet that test, then there\u2019s some very serious doubt we can remain in some markets.WSJ: What options are on the table regarding the exchanges?Mr. Swedish: There are still decisions yet to be made regarding [federal cost-sharing payments] and the continuation of the [ACA tax on health insurers], which is now under a moratorium. The challenge for us is pricing relative to the decisions that may be made, which could translate to as much as a 25% premium increase. How can the markets we support tolerate that level of premium escalation? That\u2019s a judgment call we\u2019re gonna have to make.WSJ: Are the marketplaces in a death spiral?Mr. Swedish: It\u2019s an unfortunate characterization. There are markets that are significantly unsustainable. There are others that we have performed, call it reasonably well, under the circumstances.WSJ: Should CEOs have a voice in big public debates like the one over the ACA?Mr. Swedish: Absolutely. We\u2019re leaders of companies that represent millions of Americans, in our case over 40 million members. We believe we are their voice. And we should speak on their behalf.WSJ: Do you worry about becoming the subject of a presidential tweet?Mr. Swedish: Not really. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re worried about the tweets, because I know we are considered valued contributors to the debate.WSJ: The House has passed a health bill and the Senate is working on one. What concerns you in that legislation?Mr. Swedish: Change to correct the ACA will be disruptive. Question is, can organizations like ours help the American public make the leap from what they\u2019ve known to what may be passed? That is a tall order. For instance, the creation of high-risk pools [special coverage options for people with health conditions]\u2014will the right rules of engagement, the right funding levels occur in order to make them sustainable? That\u2019s a serious concern to us. Number two, is Medicaid funding. How then will the poor and vulnerable be treated as a result of choices that\u2019ll be made?We\u2019re extremely concerned about our membership being supported in terms of access and affordability as well as the ability to get to high-quality health care.WSJ: With the Cigna deal off the table, what kinds of deals interest you?Mr. Swedish: Being a growth-minded company, obviously we are looking to acquire\u2014grow by mergers and acquisitions. We\u2019ve made it very clear that we are very committed to the Medicare program. We have tremendous potential in the Medicaid arena. We certainly are looking for continued growth in servicing [employer and consumer health plans].WSJ: Insurers don\u2019t have a great reputation with customers. What are you doing to improve that?Mr. Swedish: We\u2019re retraining our entire workforce to be better aligned with needs of the customer, given the contemporary demands that come upon us. I\u2019m a great believer that, if you don\u2019t measure it, you can\u2019t manage it. So, we\u2019ve established net promoter scoring so that we are quarterly assessing how well we perform related to what the consumer experience is with us. [Net promoter score is a measurement of satisfaction and loyalty based on the willingness of customers to recommend a business to others.] We\u2019ve seen remarkable improvement in the score.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Anthem Boss Faces Tough Choices How I Work Anthem Boss Faces Tough Choices.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 11:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthems-boss-faces-tough-choices-in-health-care-debate-1497358801", "news_title": "Anthem\u2019s Boss Faces Tough Choices in Health-Care Debate", "keywords": "aca,affordable care act,health exchanges,Anthem,ANTM,Cigna,CI,Express Scripts Holding,ESRX,Joseph R.

Poland and Hungary refused to take any asylum seekers, while the Czech Republic took 12 last year. It recently announced it would quit the program.Legal proceedings against member states can end up in EU\u2019s top court and bring financial penalties unless the countries reverse course.The British vote last year to leave the EU has brought vows of unity from other counties, but the dispute exposes cracks that the bloc has sought to paper over in the last year.The commission\u2019s decision comes on top of existing disputes with Hungary and Poland over what critics say are efforts to erode democratic rights in the two countries. EU officials have acknowledged the U.K. might use such divisions to drive a wedge in the bloc and seek a better deal.Austria said earlier this year it would drop out of the program, but EU commission officials say the Austrian government promised to take 50 minors from Italy. The move kept Austria off the sanctions list.None of the three countries have indicated they would change their minds. Czech Prime Minister       Bohuslav Sobotka       tweeted after the commission\u2019s announcement that \u201cquotas are not working, they incentivize further illegal migration and have lowered citizens\u2019 confidence in the EU.\u201dEuropean Commission chief       Jean-Claude Juncker       has warned that refusing to admit refugees, might result in Central and Eastern European states receiving less financial support. \u201cThose who want to benefit from solidarity, such as in the form of EU cohesion funds, must be prepared to show solidarity,\u201d Mr. Juncker said in Prague last week.His threat echoed demands made by countries that are net payers into the EU budget, such as the Netherlands and Austria, which have already threatened to pay less money for poorer EU states that refuse to take refugees.Discussions on the EU budget for the years after Brexit, due to start next year, are likely to pit net payers against net beneficiaries, especially given the gap created by the departure of the U.K., the EU\u2019s second-largest contributor.Polish Foreign Minister       Witold Waszczykowski       said that the threat of funding cuts amounted to \u201cblackmail\u201d and questioned the legality of such a move. \u201cWe will keep on defending our principles,\u201d he said.On Monday, interior ministers of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic met\u00a0 in Warsaw and said the issue of relocation should be handled by EU national leaders, not the commission, and that decisions should be taken by unanimity, not majority voting.\u201cThe announcement to punish [our] countries is groundless,\u201d Polish interior minister       Mariusz B\u0142aszczak       said after the meeting. \u201cSecurity policy is a national, not a European\u201d responsibility.Write to Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 11:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-raises-stakes-over-refusal-to-take-asylum-seekers-1497366799", "news_title": "EU Raises Stakes Over Refusal to Take Asylum Seekers ", "keywords": "eu policy,eu politics,migration,migration crisis,refugee,refugee crisis,European Commission,European Union,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Thomas Ramey       quit praying a few years ago when he was 16 years old because it didn\u2019t seem to matter.The 18-year-old, who was baptized and confirmed as a Methodist, doesn\u2019t believe in an afterlife, but still believes in a God. He goes to church regularly because he likes playing in the youth band, volunteering and listening to people who have different opinions. \u201cI doubt everything,\u201d says Thomas, who plans to study engineering.That is true of many teens, who grew up praying, going to houses of worship, and studying religious texts. As 6-year-olds, they were convinced there was a God and heaven and that everything in the Bible was true, for example. Now they aren\u2019t so sure.The teen brain grows rapidly, and with it the ability to think more abstractly and critically. In early adolescence, teens begin to establish their own ideals and recognize hypocrisy in people and institutions around them. They deal with heartbreak and social cliques, see suffering in the world and wonder if there is a God who cares. They are trying to figure out their place and how and if something like religion belongs.Exploring such questions is the most important work a teen can do, says       Lisa Miller,        a clinical psychologist and author of \u201cThe Spiritual Child.\u201d Research shows that adolescents with a strong personal spirituality are found to be 60% less likely to be severely depressed as teenagers, she says.Andrew Zirschky,        academic director of the Center for Youth Ministry Training in Brentwood, Tenn., says some children start doubting faith in middle school, when many of them begin preparing for confirmation and bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs.\u201cRight when kids are having the most doubts, we ask them to affirm their faith,\u201d says Dr. Zirschky. Many plow ahead despite misgivings because they feel pressured to do so, he says, and because churches do a poor job of allowing faith and doubt to coexist. He asks sixth-graders to draw the image of God they had in first grade. It is often a white bearded figure sitting in the cloud. When he asks them to draw the image now, they draw hearts, and use words like \u201cloving\u201d or \u201cAll-knowing.\u201d\u201cAt some point, you have to doubt your previous understanding of who God is and replace it with a better one,\u201d he tells them.More Turning Points columns by Clare AnsberryWhile teens doubt, they aren\u2019t ready to give up on the idea of God and the importance of religion. A significant majority\u201484% of 13- to 17-year-olds believe in God, according to a National Study of Youth and Religion, a longitudinal survey of more than 3,000 teens conducted in 2002 and led by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and University of Notre Dame. Three years later, belief among the same teens, then 16- to 21-years-old, slipped to 78%.Teens often see God as a cosmic therapist, solving problems and generally making people happier, but distant, says sociologist       Patricia Snell Herzog,        who worked on the study. A large majority believe religion is important, but many become less actively involved as they age through adolescence. \u201cReligion is just there in the background,\u201d says Dr. Herzog. \u201cWe describe it as the furniture of their life.\u201dThomas Ramey was born and raised in Decatur Ala., part of the U.S. known as the Bible Belt. He went to Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church three times a week, twice on Sunday and every Wednesday. His mother, Lisa, taught Sunday school.When he was 8 years old, and able to read, he received his first Bible, which he and his mother read together. \u201cHe always asked lots of questions,\u201d says Mrs. Ramey. At 11, after weeks of studying, he was confirmed, and was a Chaplain aid for his Boy Scout troop, leading prayers before meals and at campouts. At that time, he says he believed in God and what the Bible said.His views started changing in his midteens. His youth group had cliques. He was in the social outcasts group, he says, and he encountered some hostility from certain church leadership against some of his friends who were gay.\u201cWhen you see people behave in wrongful, hurtful, hypocritical ways, it\u2019s kind of hard to believe that God cares,\u201d he says.Philip Galyon,        the current youth minister, says teens in high school identify fallacies and hypocrisies. \u201cThey push back,\u201d he says, and ask, \u201cWhy do people who say they are Christian treat other people poorly?\u201d He remembers struggling when he was age 17 and his parents divorced. His father was a minister. \u201cI thought why should I still believe this?\u201d He wondered what good their faith did.Thomas hit another hard stretch when he was about age 16 and three people close to him died, including a friend of the family who had dementia.

At             Tesla Inc.\u2019s       Bay Area factory, a Total executive tweeted a photo of a gleaming, red Model S\u2014an electric car that burns no oil products at all.The trip was meant to \u201copen their minds,\u201d said Total Chairman and Chief Executive       Patrick Pouyann\u00e9.Total, like its peers             Exxon Mobil Corp.       and             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC, was built to service the world\u2019s massive demand for crude oil. Betting that demand will peak in the next few decades, Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 wants to turn his company into one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of electricity, or what he often calls \u201cthe energy of the 21st century.\u201dMore than any other oil major, Total sees electricity as a hedge against oil\u2019s eventual decline and is assembling a new business around it. Last summer, it paid $1 billion for a French maker of industrial batteries. It bought a small utility that supplies gas and renewable power to households in Belgium and owns a majority stake in             SunPower Corp.      , a California company that makes high-efficiency solar panels for governments, businesses and households.If all goes to plan, a large piece of Total\u2019s business will one day be selling electricity to homeowners and businesses, some generated by natural gas it has extracted and some from solar panels and battery packs. By 2035, Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 said, 20% of Total\u2019s energy output will be low-carbon energy such as electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar. The company recently created a \u201cgas, renewables and power\u201d reporting segment, which in 2016 earned about 5% of Total\u2019s $9.42 billion net operating income.For decades, Total and other large oil companies have employed a model pioneered by       John D. Rockefeller       over a century ago. They find crude, pump it out of the ground, refine it into different fuels and chemicals, then sell these products to motorists, airlines and manufacturers. As oil prices rise and fall, different parts of this value chain make money.Today, a prolonged downturn in oil prices has dented revenues and profits at the world\u2019s large producers. Oil demand is expected to come under further pressure as auto makers improve fuel efficiency, electric vehicles become more popular and many countries push ahead with commitments to burn fewer carbon-intensive fuels.Producing and selling electricity is a very different business. While oil is a commodity that can be extracted in one locale and stored, shipped and sold to other parts of the world, electricity must be produced and consumed simultaneously. Power grids tend to be regional, so electricity generated in Europe can\u2019t be sold to Latin America.Most electricity is generated from coal or natural gas, and increasingly from wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. Burning oil currently generates just 4.3% of global electricity, a share that has halved in the past two decades and is expected to shrink to 2.5% by 2025, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based group that monitors energy trends.Total is already a large producer of natural gas, a cleaner-burning fuel that is expected to overtake coal by 2040 as a source of electricity because of its flexibility and lower emissions, according to the IEA. While rivals including Exxon and Shell are also bulking up on natural gas production, Total wants to go further and enter the power business.Predicting and betting on shifts in energy consumption is a notoriously tricky business. U.K. energy giant             BP                   PLC invested heavily in solar power in 2000, only to shut that business in 2011 after struggling to make money. Shell in 2008 pulled out of a large offshore wind power project near the mouth of London\u2019s Thames River after costs mounted.\u201cOil companies like to talk about themselves as energy companies, but they are not energy companies. They are commodity companies,\u201d said       Bob\u00a0Lukefahr,        who helped develop BP\u2019s renewable strategy in the 2000s.Capital budgets are beholden to commodity prices and new oil ventures are costly, which make it difficult for companies to make large investments into new types of power, said Mr. Lukefahr.At the same time, companies should be ready for the changes brought by technology, said       Adam Sieminski,        who stepped down as the head of the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department, in January. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the best buggy-whip manufacturer in the world,\u201d he said.Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 said Total remains \u201cfirst an oil-and-gas company,\u201d and that remains a lucrative business. The company\u2019s net income last year, $6.2 billion, was second only to the much-larger Exxon among its Western oil peers. At the same time, he said some investors feel Total needs a diversification plan if governments and the public increasingly demand cleaner energy.\u201cThey have some questions about what will be the impact of climate change on our company. We are trying to bring them some answers,\u201d he said.Some of the challenges are apparent in Mr. Pouyann\u00e9\u2019s own household. He said he tried and failed to persuade his wife that they should buy an electric car. He still drives a Renault with a conventional engine.Most industry forecasters expect oil to remain a major source of energy fueling global economies. The IEA says consumer demand for oil will keep growing for another two decades unless governments take sharper action to curb emissions.But electricity consumption is expected to grow faster than oil\u20142% a year through 2040, compared with oil\u2019s 0.5% growth, according to the IEA.Underlying this shift is a global push to use fuels with lower carbon emissions. Over 140 countries have ratified an 2015 agreement struck in Paris to reduce emissions as a way to tackle climate change. Their methods generally include shifting away from oil and coal and toward energy sources like gas, renewables and even nuclear, which all generate electricity. The U.S. has since said it plans to pull out of the accord.Producing clean energy was much more expensive in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when oil companies conducted highly public experiments with alternative energy sources. Production costs for solar panels and other renewable energy projects have since plummeted.\u201cSometimes you can be wrong if you are 15 years\u201d too soon, said Mr. Pouyann\u00e9.Shell last year led a consortium that won a bid to build a wind farm off the coast of Holland that could power a million homes at prices lower than competing coal and gas projects. Norwegian oil-and-gas company             Statoil AS      A recently announced plans to increase its spending on renewables from 5% today to at least 15% by 2030, with an emphasis on offshore wind.Mr. Pouyann\u00e9, 53 years old, accelerated Total\u2019s expansion into electricity after two events rattled the company. In October 2014, Total\u2019s then-CEO,       Christophe de Margerie,        was killed in an airplane crash in Russia. Mr. Pouyann\u00e9, who was running Total\u2019s refining and chemicals business, was quickly promoted to the top job.At the same time, a glut of oil was overwhelming demand, causing oil prices to collapse from a high of $107.26 a barrel to $53.27 by the end of the year. Total recorded a $5.7 billion loss in the final quarter of 2014, its worst quarterly result in decades, and the first quarter with Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 at the helm.\u201cI became CEO at the worst possible moment,\u201d he said.He took over a nearly century-old company with fossil fuel operations in 130 countries. Like its fellow Western oil companies, Total had large exploration, refining and chemical divisions. Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 began cutting costs including the company\u2019s capital budget. Total returned to profitability in 2015 even as oil prices fell further. Oil currently trades around $46 a barrel.Mr. de Margerie, his predecessor, was outspoken about the challenges facing the oil business. At an industry conference in London in 2007, the former CEO surprised the crowd by declaring that oil-production growth forecasts were too optimistic because of depleting conventional reservoirs.That outlook prompted Total to begin exploring alternative sources of energy. It paid $1.37 billion for a 60% stake in SunPower in 2011, and scooped up smaller stakes in early-stage clean-energy startups.Total\u2019s stake in SunPower has since lost more than half its market value amid a sharp decline in prices of solar panels. SunPower has posted losses for the past two years.Unlike oil and gas, where output can be turned up or down in response to demand, solar energy is produced only when the sun is shining. Its value to consumers and power companies is limited unless the energy can be stored. That thinking drove Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 in 2016 to purchase Saft Groupe SA, a French battery makerSaft supplied high-end batteries for satellites, airplanes and smart meters. While much of the battery industry focused on bringing down prices, Saft specialized in long-life and durability. When the European Space Agency sends a robotic rover to Mars in 2020, the exploration vehicle will use Saft batteries.Saft Chairman and CEO Ghislain Lescuyer said Saft is looking for ways to work with SunPower. While he declined to discuss details, such a partnership could produce a solar panel-and-battery combination that could compete with Tesla\u2014which recently acquired SolarCity Corp.\u2014and other companies exploring similar energy products.Tom Werner,        SunPower\u2019s Chairman and CEO, said the company benefits from Total\u2019s focus on long-term strategy and size, even though it can be at odds with the speed and nimbleness required of a solar company. \u201cThere is no model to emulate,\u201d he said.Last June, Total acquired another piece of the puzzle it is trying to assemble when it paid about $200 million for Lampiris NV, a gas and renewable power retailer in Belgium. After operating for a little over a decade in the Belgian residential energy market, the company won more than one million customers.Now that Total controls companies that generate, store and sell electricity, Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 is trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together.\u201cTo be clear, these are investments,\u201d he said of Total\u2019s foray into electricity. \u201cWe have to be patient.\u201dWrite to Russell Gold at russell.gold@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Oil Giant Sees a Future in Volts.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 11:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-total-a-global-oil-giant-imagines-the-futureits-electric-1497366285", "news_title": "Total Eclipse: Oil Giant Sees Its Future in Electricity", "keywords": "climate change,oil majors and renewables,paris accord,peak oil,peak oil demand,renewable energy,total and electricity,Total,TOT,FP.FR,Royal Dutch Shell,RDSB.LN,RDSA.LN,Tesla,TSLA,Patrick Pouyann\u00e9,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,crude oil markets,motor fuel markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,natural gas exploration,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive,natural gas,oil exploration,integrated oil,gas"}, {"content": "Randy Fruchter says the exchange has happened a few times.

Instead, Mr. Fruchter bought a $100 cordless jigsaw, filed down the blade and covered the point with a hard-rubber stopper. He uses the device daily to work on painful hips and stiff upper backs.\u201cIn five minutes I can get about 30 minutes of work done,\u201d Mr. Fruchter says.The popularity of massage is rising along with the price of electric gadgets for it. So some do-it-yourself-ers are raiding garages and             Home Depot                   and turning power tools into turbocharged robo-masseurs.Bill De Longis,        head strength coach at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., uses a jigsaw\u2014with a lacrosse ball pierced and epoxied to its business end\u2014for limbering the limbs of the school\u2019s varsity athletes.

The idea spread on social media, and now power tools can be found everywhere from chiropractors\u2019 offices to tie-dyed campouts.Nova Han, artistic director for the Electric Forest music festival in Rothbury, Mich., equipped a 1940s Quonset hut-style space on the event\u2019s grounds with massage tables. Last summer, staff members dressed like Rosie the Riveter and worked rotating shifts for 12 hours a day, giving short car-buffer massages to concertgoers.\u201cWhen they come out of it, they\u2019re almost in this really blissful state,\u201d says Ms. Han, adding that the massages will return for this year\u2019s festival, which starts June 22.Tod Whitfield, a retired Toronto police detective, was so intrigued by his CrossFit gym\u2019s car-buffer massager that he experimented on his body\u2019s sore spots with a half-dozen tools in his home machine shop. The most effective, he reports, is a pneumatic-powered sander whose scratchy surface he replaced with a lamb's wool bonnet.\u201cThe pad spins in a circular motion, but the shaft also spins on its own axis, which gives you this dual action,\u201d says Mr. Whitfield, who has used the sander on an aching shoulder and hip. \u201cIt gives this nice sort of vibration.\u201dA spokesman for Clarence, N.Y.,-based Dynabrade, maker of Mr. Whitfield\u2019s sander, was surprised to hear of someone massaging himself with company products, some of which are used in industrial finishing for tractors and motorcycles.\u201cSome of our orbital sanders, they\u2019re around 12,000 rpm,\u201d Dynabrade\u2019s       Ron Veiders       says. \u201cIt could cause abrasions or whatnot, or even contusions.

Lighting is a strong contender, judging by the surprising popularity among investors in its peers.This isn\u2019t a new idea: Rumors of a disposal have resurfaced periodically for years. Most recently, The Wall Street Journal reported in April that the industrial conglomerate was interviewing investment banks to sell its small but iconic consumer-lighting unit\u2014            GE        GE 0.19%       co-founder       Thomas Edison       is credited with inventing the first viable incandescent lightbulb\u2014for around $500 million. The company confirmed it was \u201cbeginning conversations with prospective buyers\u201d at an employee event last week.Since then, the stock-market value of European lighting specialists         Osram               and             Philips Lighting                   has soared. GE needs to seize the moment.Osram and Philips Lighting are themselves spinoffs: Osram emerged from the shadow of German conglomerateSiemens                   in 2013, while Philips Lighting was born last year of the namesake Dutch group. The moves were in large part reactions to the lighting industry\u2019s digital challenge. In what a             Goldman Sachs                   report last year called \u201cone of the fastest technology shifts in human history,\u201d light-emitting diodes are now taking over from incandescent, halogen and other lighting devices, helped by sharply declining prices and environmental regulations.One problem with LED bulbs, from a manufacturer\u2019s perspective, is that they can last 10 times as long as halogen bulbs. With a much slower replacement market, sales are likely to start declining in 2020, calculates brokerage Citi. The other problem is the aggressive expansion of Chinese manufacturers, which explains why LED prices have fallen so sharply in recent years. The combined market share of the big four developed-market lighting companies\u2014for decades Philips, GE, Osram and             Panasonic                   split the market in a very lucrative oligopoly\u2014fell from 21% in 2010 to 19% in 2015, according to Deutsche Bank.Seemingly energized by independence, Osram has responded by going high tech. Its key focus is car lights, the capacity of which to act as sensors in self-driving systems partly explains a lofty stock-market valuation of 20 times earnings. Osram sold its consumer business, including both conventional and LED bulbs, to a Chinese lighting company and two co-investors last year.Philips chose the opposite path, spinning out its structurally challenged consumer business as Philips Lighting while selling the higher-growth automotive division, Lumileds. The latter got a punchy offer from China, but this was blocked by a U.S. national security panel, forcing it to fall back on a cut-price sale to private-equity firm Apollo.With little automotive business, GE Lighting looks more like Philips Lighting than Osram. But this is no bad thing. Philips Lighting\u2019s stock has soared by two-thirds since the IPO as investors have bought into its high cash flows and generous dividends; floated at eight times earnings, it now trades on 13. GE needs to exploit investors\u2019 newfound appetite for profitable decline while it can.Write to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 10:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/heres-a-bright-idea-for-ges-new-boss-1497365892", "news_title": "Here\u2019s a Bright Idea for GE\u2019s New Boss   ", "keywords": " ceo john flannery,general electric, lightbulbs,GE,Lumileds,Panasonic,6752.TO,Siemens,SIE.XE,Philips Lighting,LIGHT.AE,NL:LIGHT,GE Lighting,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Osram Licht,XE:OSR,John Flannery,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,management,management moves,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,computers,consumer electronics,semiconductors,electric lighting equipment,medical equipment,supplies,diversified holding companies,health care,life sciences,business,consumer services,consumer goods,durable household products,home electronics,appliances,industrial electronics,industrial goods,led technology,technology"}, {"content": "Robert Horler, U.S. chief executive of ad agency group             Dentsu        4324 0.19%       Aegis Network, is stepping down after 2\u00bd years in the job.Nigel Morris,        the group\u2019s chief executive of the Americas, will also assume the role of interim CEO for the U.S. The company said it would announce a long-term succession plan shortly.The company didn\u2019t comment on Mr. Horler\u2019s next move beyond saying that he\u2019s leaving to \u201cpursue new opportunities.\u201d\u201cWith the U.S. business in the hands of great people and strong talent, we are well set up for future, and after 17 years, this felt like the right time to step back and do something different,\u201d said Mr. Horler in a statement. \u201cIt has been an incredible journey and I\u2019m thankful for the opportunity, and look forward to new challenges.\u201dUnder Mr. Horler, the U.S. group acquired a number of firms, including Cardinal Path, Accordant, gyro, C2C Outdoor and Gravity Media.While Dentsu Aegis U.S. has expanded, the group, like other domestic agency networks, is grappling with a challenging ad market.

They were a superteam. They were villains. They were Supervillains.Steve Kerr wasn\u2019t insulted. He was inspired. The Warriors\u2019 coach thought it had comedic potential. So when Golden State\u2019s players came to training camp, Kerr made sure there were presents in their lockers: their very own \u201cSupervillains\u201d shirts.His players got the joke. Then they got in on the joke. The Warriors soon posed for an informal team photo at Stephen Curry\u2019s home underneath letter-shaped balloons that spelled out \u201cSupervillains.\u201d There was even a customized Snapchat filter. They had turned the putdown into a punchline.The Warriors have accomplished one of the greatest runs in NBA history over the last three seasons. They have won more games in that time than any team ever, and now they have two championships after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 of the Finals on Monday for a 16-1 postseason record.There is a serious case to be made for the Warriors becoming a dynasty. And it\u2019s partly because they believed in not taking themselves seriously.\u201cWe\u2019re always in search of something funny,\u201d said Golden State assistant coach Bruce Fraser.The Warriors were loose because they won, but they also won because they were loose.Sports teams packed with highly paid professional athletes and their egos can be notoriously difficult to manage. It may seem obvious that adding Kevin Durant to a team already loaded with superstars last offseason would bring the championship back to Golden State. It could just as easily have created dissonance.But in Kerr, the Warriors have a coach who, before Game 4 of the Finals, greeted his team with a locker room message reading: \u201cI want you to go out there and play with great joy. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d It\u2019s a notion that has quietly spread throughout professional sports in recent years. Many teams are miserable to be around. The Warriors are the opposite. They believe that work can be fun.After watching from afar as Golden State demoralized other teams last season, JaVale McGee had certain expectations when he signed with the Warriors this season.\u201cI thought before I got here it was going to be all seriousness,\u201d McGee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for McGee to pull off his first prank. Like most of his teammates, McGee was the butt of a common Draymond Green joke: posting pictures of the Warriors napping on social media. Unlike most of his teammates, McGee decided to strike back. He went on the website Shutterfly. He uploaded a photo of Green sleeping with his mouth open. He printed that photo on blankets and distributed them to the team.Then Green printed McGee\u2019s face on toilet paper. That made them even. \u201cUntil we\u2019re uneven again,\u201d McGee said then.Their humor, like their offense, was egalitarian. Zaza Pachulia decided that Zaza Pachulia outscoring Klay Thompson in a playoff game was a historic occasion worthy of commemoration. He framed a copy of a fake San Francisco Chronicle front page with the headline: \u201cHELL FREEZES OVER: Pachulia outscores Thompson.\u201dThe bar was high to get a gag approved. The Warriors aren\u2019t merely the NBA champions. They\u2019re also the only NBA team with comedic standards.\u201cIf it\u2019s a maybe, it\u2019s a no,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cThere are a lot of ideas that come along that don\u2019t make the cut.\u201dThe Warriors used comedy all season to keep rolling and even to deflate the few bad moments. After the only losing streak of the season, for example, the song they blasted at practice was Bobby McFerrin\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy.\u201d\u201cThe humor comes from what happens within our daily lives,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a writer\u2019s room. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got guys in the back working on humor instead of analytics.\u201dThe Warriors\u2019 embrace of comedy is surprisingly crucial to their success. It\u2019s the foundation of their office culture in a workplace where the office is everywhere: the locker room, film room, weight room, team plane, team hotel, team bus and, of course, the basketball court.One way to think about professional basketball players is as co-workers who spend all their time together. They might have hated each other if the Warriors didn\u2019t have a way of diffusing such tension: laughing at it. Scholars have found that employees in funnier business environments are better at their jobs and happier when they\u2019re in the office.Jessica Mesmer-Magnus, a University of North Carolina at Wilmington management professor, was the co-author of a study published by the Journal of Managerial Psychology that showed humor positively correlates with work performance. \u201cOne conclusion derived from these findings,\u201d the paper says, \u201cmight be that organizations should attempt to cultivate humor within the workplace.\u201dA similar conclusion could be derived from this NBA season\u2014and the two seasons before that, and maybe the next two seasons, too. Every other team might want to be more like the Warriors.But even the Warriors needed reminders sometimes to be more like the Warriors. Golden State\u2019s players came to practice Sunday once again hearing what the entire basketball world had to say about them. The Cavs had won Game 4, and the Warriors were feeling pressure to close the series before they lost control of the series.Kerr arrived wearing the \u201cSupervillains\u201d shirt he\u2019d brought on the first day of the season.

I was crazy about my guy, but I was getting only empty romantic words and promises from him.The more I listened to the song, the more I realized Joni was giving me love advice. I physically shook.

Their goal is to draw down historically high amounts of oil in storage, which represent a global oil supply that has kept prices between $45 and $55 a barrel for much of the year.Crude prices fell after report and were trading roughly flat for the day on Tuesday afternoon in London trading. Brent crude was up 0.04% at $48.31 and WTI was down 0.17% at $46.On Tuesday, OPEC said its efforts to \u201crebalance\u201d the market were having success but at a slower pace than expected back in December when it clinched its deal to cut output. The group blamed U.S. producers, whose output rose on the back of a price increase caused by OPEC\u2019s production deal.OPEC said Tuesday that oil inventories in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2014a group of industrialized, oil-consuming nations\u2014remained higher than the cartel wants. OECD stocks were still over 3 billion barrels, 251 million barrels above OPEC\u2019s target.OPEC said it was producing about 100,000 barrels of oil more than there was demand for every day, another factor weighing on oil prices.Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister       Khalid al-Falih       said Sunday that the drawdown in crude oil inventories will accelerate in the next three to four months, and OPEC doesn\u2019t need to adjust its production-cut deal.The increased output from Libya and Nigeria wasn\u2019t a surprise because those countries were exempted from any obligation to cut as they try to come back from sabotage and violent disruptions to their supplies.But Iraq agreed last December, and again in May, to some of the largest production cuts undertaken by the cartel. Instead its output increased over 44,000 barrels a day to over 4.4 million barrels a day. Iraq didn\u2019t supply its own production figures to OPEC, and the country\u2019s oil officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s biggest producer and the world\u2019s biggest exporter, raised its production slightly to 9.94 million barrels a day in May from 9.938 million barrels a day a month earlier, according to OPEC, citing sources such as shippers, analysts and industry executives.The Saudi kingdom itself told OPEC its production fell by 66,200 barrels a day last month to 9.880 million barrels a day.As for non-OPEC producers, OPEC said their output is expected to grow by 840,000 barrels a day this year, a downward revision of 110,000 barrels a day.Lower output from Russia, as well as Brunei, the Sudans and Kazakhstan following the global supply-cut deal is expected to offset higher growth in Canada and the U.K.U.S. oil supply growth for 2017 was also cut by 30,000 barrels a day because of lower output than expected in the first quarter of this year.Write to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 10:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-oil-production-rose-in-may-1497351203", "news_title": "OPEC Oil Production Rose in May ", "keywords": "oil inventories,opec,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product stockpile,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "Income-investing specialist Tortoise is exploring a potential sale of a majority stake in the firm, Chief Executive       Kevin Birzer       said Tuesday.The Leawood, Kan.-based company, with about $20 billion in assets, runs mutual funds, closed-end funds and master limited partnerships.

Campbell announced his resignation as chief executive of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York institution is undergoing a major shift in its administrative ranks.Daniel H. Weiss, the interim chief, has been named Mr. Campbell\u2019s permanent replacement in the top role, the museum\u2019s board of trustees announced Tuesday morning. He will have a somewhat different set of responsibilities, however.Mr. Weiss, who is 60 years, old also will keep the title of president, a position he has held at the Met since 2015. In the Manhattan museum\u2019s structure, that means he has oversight of the institution\u2019s finances, administration and day-to-day operations.By contrast, Mr. Campbell held the dual title of director, which denotes oversight of the museum\u2019s art collections and exhibitions.In effect, under the new structure, the Met is putting the executive in charge of finances and operations at the fore of the organization, with the executive in charge of art reporting to that person. Previously, it was the other way around.The Met, in a news release, said the decision followed a \u201ccomprehensive review of the Museum\u2019s organizational structure, roles, and leadership titles.\u201d The museum said its board would begin a search for a new director because that slot hasn\u2019t been filled since the announcement of Mr. Campbell\u2019s departure, which takes effect later this month.The Met\u2019s moves shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise given the financial difficulties the museum recently has faced. The institution is looking at a $15 million deficit for the 2017 fiscal year in its nearly $400 million annual budget, and has taken to cutting staff and trimming other expenses.The museum also is considering charging out-of-town visitors for admission; currently, the museum allows all patrons to pay a suggested contribution.Met officials and Mr. Weiss played down the administrative-structure change, noting that Mr. Weiss has an extensive academic background in art, particularly from the medieval and Byzantine eras.\u201cI think it\u2019s not about money versus art,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.If anything, Mr. Weiss said the organizational shift speaks to the need to let museum leaders focus on specific tasks. In particular, he noted that the director would be able to concentrate on the museum\u2019s art program without assuming responsibilities for the institution as a whole.The new structure \u201cis actually liberating,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.Museum-industry insiders and observers said the Met\u2019s situation isn\u2019t unique. Other institutions have made similar decisions about chains of command and weighing the importance of financial versus artistic roles.\u201cThis kind of back and forth has been going on for a long time,\u201d said Angela Mack, executive director and chief curator at the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, S.C.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 10:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/metropolitan-museum-of-art-to-modify-its-administrative-ranks-1497362667", "news_title": "Metropolitan Museum of Art Shakes Up Its Leadership", "keywords": "art,metropolitan museum of art,money versus art,museum finances,new york met,Thomas P.

No other advertisers have come out publicly against the planned episode, which is unusual considering: 1) the social-media-outrage machine is spinning into overdrive and 2) the current climate of zero tolerance from marketers once that machine revs into gear.Facebook is building a feature that will allow users to subscribe to news publications directly from the mobile app, The Wall Street Journal reports. Lots of publishers rely heavily on Facebook to drive traffic to their websites, but they have also grown increasingly frustrated at the social network\u2019s dominance of the digital ad market, which affects their ability to make money from their content. An interesting nugget from the story: Facebook initially planned to offer a subscription option in its Instant Articles product, but it scrapped the idea before launch because it slowed down load times. Since then, some publishers have found Instant Articles isn\u2019t as lucrative as they thought it\u2019d be, and they\u2019re experimenting with similar distribution services from the likes of Apple (which allows publishers to sell subscriptions) and Google (which appears to punish paywall publishers, like The Wall Street Journal, in its search results). It looks as if the new tool could be a peace offering\u2014Facebook is running a test to squeeze more ads into Instant Articles, too\u2014to get disillusioned publishers fully back on board.Burger King\u2019s new CEO, Daniel Schwartz, spoke about his efforts to turn around the business through cutting costs, reducing the menu and opening new restaurants.

It didn\u2019t say how many had been released and said it wouldn\u2019t comment further, citing the pending court case.Foreign casinos aren\u2019t allowed to advertise gambling directly in China, but they can entice gamblers by promoting their destinations more broadly.As part of the court filing, the names of all 18 defendants were released for the first time. Three Australians and one Malaysian were known to be in custody, according to previous reports from their respective governments.The other employees are local employees of Crown, according to interviews with family members and people close to the case. They include people in administrative, sales or marketing roles, some of whom were responsible for selling tour packages to visit Crown properties, these people said.Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said authorities are continuing to provide consular assistance to the detained Australians, though it didn\u2019t answer any specific questions about their cases.Mr. O\u2019Connor oversaw Crown\u2019s international VIP operations, a job that included attracting foreign high-rollers to its properties. Mr. O\u2019Connor is detained and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.The charges come as the gambling industry continues to assess the fallout from the arrests.

Newly anointed       John Flannery       will take the top job when Mr. Immelt retires as CEO this summer, but financial chief       Jeffrey Bornstein,        who was also in the running for the top job, plans to stay on board.\u201cHaving Jeff as the vice chairman is key,\u201d Mr. Immelt said in an interview, sitting at a table with Mr. Flannery in GE\u2019s Boston headquarters. \u201cThese guys have worked together for 20 years.\u201dThe duo first worked together in the 1990s at GE Capital in roles such as commercial lending and bank loans. At the time, GE Capital was one of the country\u2019s largest banks, financing everything from home mortgages to power plants. When it became a drag during the financial crisis, Mr. Flannery was abroad and Mr. Bornstein worked to wind it down.After the crisis, Mr. Flannery was leading the deal making team at GE while Mr. Bornstein was CFO. The duo pushed to sell \u201csacred cows\u201d such as GE Appliances and continued to shrink GE Capital by spinning off the credit card business into             Synchrony Financial.\u201cWe look at the world through a pretty similar lens,\u201d Mr. Flannery, 55, said of Mr. Bornstein, 51.That lens is focused on how the company spends its money, Mr. Flannery said Monday. He has spent recent years turning around the company\u2019s health-care division, while Mr. Bornstein has worked with Mr. Immelt on cutting costs at the parent company.\u201cEvery dollar is an incremental choice of investment,\u201d Mr. Flannery said. \u201cYou can invest in plant and equipment, you can add sales people, you can develop new products, you can do research, you can buy companies, you can sell companies and you can buy back stock.\u201d\u201cFocus on the cost, and margin and cash, and then where do you focus the company,\u201d he said.Mr. Flannery said he would work with Mr. Bornstein on a review of the company\u2019s vast operations, which span from diesel locomotive engines to infant resuscitation systems used in hospitals. He will produce recommendations for the portfolio by the fall.While Mr. Flannery transmits a sense of urgency for the review this summer, certain things won\u2019t be considered. The company\u2019s dividend, which had to be cut during the financial crisis for the first time since the Great Depression, is \u201csafe\u201d and reducing it won\u2019t be considered, he said.Also the company won\u2019t be increasing the scope of its financial services business even if regulations ease, a question that produced a guffaw out of Mr. Immelt. GE Capital had shrunk to about $10 billion of revenue last year, down from more than $58 billion in 2001 when Mr. Immelt took over.All those ideas generally make Wall Street analysts and investors happy after GE reported a steep shortfall in cash flow during the first quarter. The stock rallied 3.5% Monday following the Flannery promotion announcement, but is still down about 8% for the year and has lagged behind the broader market. On Tuesday, GE shares retreated 1.7%.Activist shareholder Trian Fund Management LP worked with GE to set new goals in March for cost cuts and industrial operating profit, tying executive bonus amounts to their success in hitting the targets. Mr. Flannery shares the investor\u2019s view that a company the size of GE, which more than $100 billion in annual spending, should be able to find $1 billion in annual savings, he has told people.\u201cInvestors still view GE capital deployment as subpar,\u201d             Credit Suisse                   analyst       Julian Mitchell       said, noting that shareholders will want to see details from the new CEO on how and why cash flow will improve.\u201cIf Mr. Bornstein were to have left, this would likely have raised concerns among investors that a major earnings/cash-flow guide reset may be imminent,\u201d he said.Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'GE Leaders Rise Up From Finance.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 09:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-ge-shakeup-the-return-of-ge-capital-1497360306", "news_title": "In GE Shakeup, the Return of GE Capital ", "keywords": "ceo,ceos,chief executive,executive change,ge,ge capital,general electric,jeff immelt,jeffrey bornstein,john flannery,management move,GE Capital,GE,John Flannery,Jeffrey Bornstein,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,credit types,services,sales financing,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Jerry Gray,        73, a retired floor-installation business owner and insurance man from Belgrade, Mont., on his 1952 Buick Roadmaster Riviera, as told to A.J. Baime.For me, the Buick\u2019s story begins with a plane crash. In 1998, I started building a kit airplane, and when I finished in 2002, I flew it to Florida and safely back. But a month later, I crashed while trying to land. My wife Suzy was watching, and she was not happy. The airplane was totaled, and my wife said to me, \u201cYou like old cars. Why don\u2019t you keep yourself on the ground?\u201dI found the Buick on             eBay,       bought it for $1,500, and drove down to Nebraska to pick it up in a U-Haul, in 2008. The Roadmaster was the top-of-the-line Buick in its day, a true luxury postwar car. But this one had been sitting in a field since about 1965.In my shop, I disassembled the car and rebuilt it with all new parts\u2014new suspension, four-wheel-disc brakes, fuel injection, rack-and-pinion steering, power everything, and a big 455 Buick engine. I sandblasted the body and my wife and I chose two-tone paint\u2014metallic copper on top, desert rose below.

(She was nearing the height of her fame when this Buick rolled off the assembly line.)The build took me four years and cost about the same as a new Corvette Grand Sport would. The goal was to make a cruiser that my wife would want to spend time in, and it worked, because she loves the car as much as I do. We will motor all day long at 75 mph, and we get up to 26 mpg on the highway, as much as many new cars today. Everywhere we go, we have to add an hour to our travel time, because when we stop, strangers cannot get enough of this car.This is an exciting time of year for Suzy and I. Every summer, we get in the Buick and head either east or west, putting 10,000 miles on the car.

But the new proposal would limit his ability to act without congressional approval. Sanctions imposed by Congress and written into law have traditionally been stronger and harder to repeal than ones imposed by presidential administrations using executive orders.The key outlines of the deal were described in broad terms in a press release issued late Monday, with more details expected this week. The proposed legislation would also allow the U.S. to impose broad new sanctions on economic sectors in Russia including mining, metals, shipping and railways. The proposed bill also grants new assistance to help shore up democratic institutions across the West, which have been targeted by a series of cyberattacks, propaganda and misinformation campaigns.The bill comes after weeks of controversy in the nation\u2019s capital over charges of Russian interference in the 2016 election. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that the Russian government conducted an influence campaign to support Mr. Trump over his Democratic rival       Hillary Clinton,        using hacked emails and propaganda to influence U.S. domestic politics.The Russian government has denied any involvement in the hacks, though Russian President       Vladimir Putin       recently suggested that Russian \u201cpatriotic\u201d hackers may have been behind the cyberintrusions that affected Western elections.\u201cThese additional sanctions will also send a powerful and bipartisan statement to Russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader in the Senate.Senators also cited Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea as well as Russia\u2019s ongoing military operations in Syria as a reason for additional sanctions.The U.S. instituted sanctions against Russia during the crisis over the Crimean peninsula in 2014, mostly aimed at crippling Russia\u2019s energy sector. Former President       Barack Obama       shortly before leaving office also levied additional sanctions in retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.The new sanctions package drawn up by the Senate this week will be attached as an amendment to a broader Iran sanctions bill that has bipartisan support. It is unclear whether the U.S. House of Representatives will include Russian sanctions in their version of the Iran bill.The Russian sanctions would need to be passed by both houses of Congress to become law.

Its initial public offering was launched on Monday evening with a range of \u20ac3.90 to \u20ac4.90 per share and it will be listed in London and Dublin on June 23.That range is equivalent to a multiple of tangible book value for the end of 2017 of 0.82 to 1.03 times, and a price to earnings ratio of 10.6 to 13.3 times. On the first measure, even at the top of the range, AIB is cheaper than similar, retail-focused European banks like             Lloyds Banking Group                   in the U.K., or         ABN               and ING in the Netherlands. But on the earnings multiple it will be at a premium to both Lloyds and ABN, which both trade on multiples of less than 10-times, according to Berenberg analysts.There is good potential value here: The key question for investors is how to balance AIB\u2019s current capital surplus against the costs of cutting its bad assets. One of the bank\u2019s main promises is that it will have capital to spend on share buybacks as well as growing its normal dividends over the next three to five years.Even on a conservative basis, the prognosis is good. AIB wants to cut its total bad assets as a share of customer loans to a level in line with the European average of 5%, from the current 22%. That means shedding almost \u20ac11 billion of assets. Conservatively, this could lead to extra loss provisions of about \u20ac1.1 billion over three to five years, which matches the value of excess capital AIB holds today.But over the next three years it should retain about \u20ac1.8 billion profits even if it steadily lifts its normal dividend to pay out 50% of earnings by the third year. All of those profits should be excess capital, especially if Irish customers continue to repay existing loans faster than AIB can make new ones for now.Ireland\u2019s economy is forecast to grow at twice the rate of the wider eurozone for the next three years. So long as AIB continues to be as good at working out its bad assets as it has been in the recent past, the bank should give investors a healthy return.Write to Paul J.

Higher short-term dollar rates have a way of kindling outflows from China.Investors spent much of the past eight weeks fretting over rising money- and bond-market rates in China, but the fixed-income selloff\u2014largely engineered by the central bank\u2014has actually helped policy makers kill two birds with one stone.Regulators under intense pressure to show progress on the \u201cdeleveraging\u201d campaign championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping can point to lower bond-market leverage as evidence of success. And by squeezing hot air out of the bond market ahead of Wednesday\u2019s probable rate increase, the central bank has lowered the chances of another disorderly bond-market selloff like the one in December after the Fed\u2019s rate rise that month. The dollar and U.S. rates have both been weakening recently, but an unexpected hawkish tone from the Fed on Wednesday on the pace of future increases or plans to shrink its balance sheet could upset that dynamic.Other recent regulatory moves have also been aimed, at least partly, at protecting the fixed-income market ahead of the Fed meeting. The recent slow pace of IPO approvals\u2014just 4 were approved in the week ended June 2 against a weekly average of around 7 to 10 earlier this spring\u2014frees up liquidity that would otherwise head into stocks.The yuan\u2019s unexpected sharp 1% move higher against the dollar in late May, likewise facilitated by the central bank, also sends a clear signal that betting against China\u2019s currency will be a risky strategy regardless of what tone the Fed adopts.China is heading into a peak season for cash demand ahead of midyear tax and regulatory deadlines, and Chinese investors are notoriously skilled at finding ways around capital controls: Another round of stomach-churning money-market volatility this summer can\u2019t be ruled out.But for now, China\u2019s bulwark against Fed-induced debt-market troubles looks sturdy.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'China on Guard for Fed Rate Increase.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 08:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tightens-ship-in-case-of-fed-rate-storm-1497355493", "news_title": "China Tightens Ship in Case of Fed Rate Storm", "keywords": "china bond market,china bonds,china fixed income, china market, china money market,chinese yuan, fed,federal reseve,interest rates,rate hike,Federal Reserve, Xi Jinping,monetary policy,economic news,debt,bond markets,money,currency markets,money markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Warehouse startup\u00a0ShipBob\u00a0raised $17.5 million in a funding round led by Bain Capital Ventures, which will allow the company to open e-commerce distribution centers\u00a0in more\u00a0cities, the company said\u00a0Tuesday.ShipBob\u00a0operates warehouses near city centers, which it says allows it to offer affordable same-day and next-day shipping to online retailers.

It required Santander to pay just \u20ac1 for the bank\u2019s equity.Such a symbolic sum isn\u2019t unique for the acquisition of a distressed bank.In 2012,             Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA      --which was invited but decided against bidding for Banco Popular--acquired troubled Spanish lender Unnim for \u20ac1 after the government nationalized it. When rogue trader        Nick Leeson       took down Barings Bank in 1995, Dutch Bank ING stepped in to buy its liabilities for \u00a31.So who gets that notional amount of \u20ac1 that Santander is paying?Theory suggests it would be holders of Banco Popular\u2019s Tier 2 subordinated bonds.In fact, it was the Spanish regulator that ended up with it,\u00a0getting an electronic bank transfer of the money from Santander. As overseer of the auction, the regulator has first rights to any proceeds to help cover its costs. Not surprisingly, they quickly exceeded \u20ac1.The process started last week after the European Central Bank decided that Banco Popular risked failure under the excessive burden of \u20ac37 billion in foreclosures and other nonperforming assets. Once that happened, Europe\u2019s Single Resolution Board, the group charged with protecting taxpayers from bailing out failing banks, stepped in and mandated the Spanish regulator, or FROB, to oversee an overnight of auction of Banco Popular.As in most cases when a company faces a possible default, holders of the senior debt have the greatest chance of recouping their investment. Equity holders, meanwhile,\u00a0are most likely to end up\u00a0empty-handed.\u00a0That scenario played out in the case of Banco Popular. The bank\u2019s senior debtholders didn\u2019t suffer any losses, while investors with lower ranked securities virtually were all wiped out.Santander offered zero to holders of Banco Popular\u2019s common shares, which the day before the auction had a total value of \u20ac1.33 billion. It offered nothing to holders of the contingent convertible bonds, a hybrid debt security with equity characteristics. That, in theory at least, left holders of Banco Popular\u2019s more senior-ranked Tier 2 subordinated bonds to share the \u20ac1 after conversion of the securities into equity if the regulator didn\u2019t have first dips.That said, even if the bondholders could lay claim to the one euro, the effort of dividing it up might make little sense.Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 07:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-a-bank-sells-for-one-euro-who-gets-the-euro-1497352940", "news_title": "When a Bank Sells for One Euro, Who Gets the Euro?

Morgan Chase & Co. Chief       James Dimon\u2019s       vocal suggestions over the past several months had much overlap with the\u00a0147-page report released by the Treasury Department\u00a0on Monday\u00a0evening.Mr. Dimon, the head of the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets, doesn\u2019t have the power to change these rules. But he does sit on President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0business council of roughly a dozen top executives and knows some of Mr. Trump\u2019s high-level finance advisers.Here are some of the similarities and areas of overlaps between Mr. Dimon\u2019s annual shareholder letter released in April and the\u00a0new report overseen by\u00a0Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin.Capital planning via stress tests:Dimon: \u201cWhile we firmly believe banks should have a proper assessment of their qualitative abilities, this should not be part of a once-year stress test.\u201dTreasury: The \u201cprocess should be adjusted to a two-year cycle, which will not compromise quality in that stress-testing results are forecast over a nine-quarter cycle.\"Living wills forcing banks to plan for their own demise:Dimon: \u201cWhile they have some positive elements, they have become unnecessarily complex and costly, and they need to be simplified.\u201dTreasury: \u201cThe agencies should be held accountable to develop specific, clear, and accountable guidance for living-will submissions.\u201dSupplementary leverage ratio:Dimon:\u00a0Rules around the so-called supplementary leverage ratio, \u201cneed to be modified.\u201d These rules, which limit the amount of borrowed money a bank can use in relation to its overall assets, often penalize \u201cfairly risk-free activity\u201d and should instead promote lending and liquid capital markets.Treasury: \u201cConsideration of adjustments to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) and enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (eSLR) is important to address unfavorable impacts these requirements may have on market liquidity and low-risk assets.\u201dOperational risk capital:Dimon: Operational risk capital should be \u201csignificantly modified, if not eliminated\u201d since it isn\u2019t always calculated fairly or in coordination with other capital rules.Treasury: \u201cAlso, a more transparent, rules-based approach should be used in the calculation of operational risk capital.\u201dMortgage market reforms:Dimon: Though some reforms to the mortgage market since the housing meltdown have been helpful, the market has been \u201cunusually slow to recover.\u201d\u00a0The regulatory changes resulted in \u201ca complex, highly risky and unpredictable operating environment that exposes lenders and servicers to disproportionate legal liability and materially increases operational risks and costs.\u201d That includes \u201can inhibition of the return of private capital to the housing industry.\u201dTreasury: \u201cBeyond small business lending, the growth of mortgage loans on bank balance sheets has also been slow (even after considering the effects of the liquidation of legacy mortgage portfolios).

Some have called for more stringent accountability measures to see if the state\u2019s job-incentive programs are working.Mayoral ControlMayor       Bill de Blasio\u2019s       authority to run the city\u2019s school system without the state\u2019s approval is up for renewal. Mayoral control is expected to be renewed, but his Democratic allies may give concessions to conservative charter-school supporters in exchange.New York City SubwaysWith outrage over the worsening state of the subways reaching a fever-pitch, public-transit advocates are urging the governor and state Legislature to come up with more funding and legislative fixes, but there are no specific bills on the table.Senate MakeupDemocrats in the Senate have grown increasingly agitated that some of their own are providing Republicans with a majority due to a bipartisan legislative alliance, even though Democrats have a one-person numerical advantage. They may try to confront\u00a0colleagues about the\u00a0issue on the floor before the end of the session.Write to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/other-outstanding-issues-facing-new-york-lawmakers-1497351601", "news_title": "Other Outstanding Issues Facing New York Lawmakers ", "keywords": "new york legislature,new york state bills,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "A much-loved tax advantage in the commercial real-estate industry is on the chopping block even as chances dim for the passage of a broad federal tax overhaul this year.Why? If a sweeping bill doesn\u2019t get traction in Congress, there is still a decent chance a narrower tax rate cut will get passed, according to lobbyists and Capitol Hill officials working on tax legislation.To finance such a rate cut, some in Congress have in their sights what\u2019s known as the 1031 exchange provision, which enables sellers of real estate and other assets to defer capital-gains taxes by reinvesting the proceeds in \u201clike-kind\u201d properties.Say an investor sells an apartment building for a $10 million profit. If he or she reinvests the proceeds in a strip mall or another commercial property, the investor doesn\u2019t have to pay taxes on that capital gain at that time.The 1031 exchange could effectively have ended as part of the tax-overhaul plan proposed last year by House Republicans, which gained traction after       Donald Trump       was elected President. But that plan\u2014named \u201cBetter Way\u201d\u2014would have included other provisions that would have made it more palatable for the real-estate industry.Now real estate lobbyists say the Better Way plan is getting bogged down and it is looking like the real-estate industry might have to take the medicine without the spoon of sugar to help it go down even though they would benefit from the lower rates.As the Better Way plan \u201chas lost a bit of luster of late, the odds have increased that like-kind exchanges are eliminated with no offsetting provision,\u201d said Green Street Advisors in a recent report.The benefit is vulnerable because many Democrats and some Republicans consider the provision a loophole with limited broader economic benefit that could be sacrificed to pay for lower tax rates. \u201cIt\u2019s really become just a way to defer tax liability,\u201d said       Mark Mazur,        who was the Obama administration\u2019s top Treasury tax official and is now director of the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.But real estate executives say getting rid of 1031 exchanges would be devastating for the economy as well as their industry. Like-kind exchanges are used in 10% to 20% of commercial real-estate transactions, according to Green Street.They also have sparked the creation of a cottage industry of firms that pool 1031 exchange investments for smaller investors. If the provision is eliminated, \u201cit would cause a lot of transactions not to occur,\u201d said       Jeffrey DeBoer,        chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable.The economic impact would ripple throughout the economy because investors who acquire real estate through 1031 exchanges are more likely to invest in those properties than those that pay cash. In such trades, they typically don\u2019t have to reach into their pockets, Mr. DeBoer explained.\u201cTherefore you have capital you can now put into the newly acquired property,\u201d he said.The House Ways and Means Committee hasn\u2019t yet released a bill and there is disagreement among Republicans about where they are heading. Lawmakers have had \u201cgood discussions\u201d on like-kind exchanges but haven\u2019t \u201ccome to closure\u201d yet with a decision, said Rep. Pat Tiberi (R., Ohio), a senior committee member, in an interview last week.The 1031 provision of federal tax law applies to a wide range of assets\u2014including cars, planes and patent rights. Real estate accounts for 36% of the exchanges, according to Ernst & Young LLP. In 2014, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that repealing like-kind exchanges would raise $40.6 billion in additional tax revenue over one decade.Adopted in 1921, the 1031 provision originally was used primarily in the real-estate world by neighboring farmers who would exchange one parcel of land for another for such purposes as straightening out property lines, according to       Louis Rogers,        chief executive of Capital Square 1031 LLC, a Richmond, Va.-based firm that sponsors over $100 million worth of 1031 exchange deals annually. Over the decades, the use of the provision broadened widely thanks to \u201cextremely supportive\u201d rulings by the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service, he said.Exchange firms such as Capital Square 1031, Inland Private Capital Corp. and Passco Cos. purchase billions of dollars worth of real estate annually. Capital Square\u2019s deals include a Tampa, Fla., apartment complex and a medical office building in Birmingham, Ala.Proposals to eliminate or change 1031 have come up before in Washington, D.C. But the current threat is the most serious, especially if Republicans get behind it, real-estate industry executives said.\u201cRepublicans have control of Congress and the White House,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cThey should be able to run the table and cram this down our throats.\u201dMost observers believe the Better Way plan could have ended the 1031 benefit, even though it didn\u2019t specifically address it. Still, if that had happened, Better Way would have lessened the impact partly by allowing buyers of real estate to treat the entire cost\u2014excluding land\u2014as a business expense that could be used to reduce income instead of depreciating those costs over time. This would be good for real estate owners but not enough to offset the pain of losing 1031 exchanges, industry executives say.A slimmed-down tax rate cut could be even more of a nightmare for the industry, if it wiped out the 1031 provision without the change in business expenses, officials said. The changes being considered \u201ccould be extremely detrimental or just quite harmful,\u201d Mr. DeBoer said.Write to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 14, 2017, print edition as 'Commercial Real Estate Faces Loss of Tax Break.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/1031-exchange-a-cherished-real-estate-tax-break-faces-extinction-1497351605", "news_title": "1031 Exchange, a Cherished Real Estate Tax Break, Faces Extinction ", "keywords": "1031 exchange,better way,property report,real estate tax,real estate tax break,tax overhaul,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,economic news,property taxes,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "Mall tenants are asking for more concessions from landlords facing pressure to fill their properties.Retailers, food and beverage operators and department store chains looking to renew their leases have been asking for more allowances from mall owners for renovations, lower rents or more flexible terms, said landlords, brokers and real estate lawyers.Tenants are taking advantage of a grim outlook for mall landlords. Store closure announcements have accelerated this year, with             Credit Suisse                   expecting more than 8,600 in 2017, up from 2,056 in 2016. There has been a spike in the number of bankruptcy filings by retailers, and even healthy ones are looking to shrink their store numbers and boost their e-commerce presence.That, in turn, is weighing on retail property owners, especially those operating lower-tier malls or strip centers that might find it tougher to retain tenants or find new ones.Express Inc.,        EXPR 1.29%       a Columbus, Ohio-based apparel retailer, said 50% of its leases are coming up for renewal in the next three years and it will focus on lowering occupancy costs to reflect traffic declines.\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to create more flexibility than we have today with our leases. And if we can\u2019t get the rents we need, we will close stores. And we will be very disciplined with our negotiations with the landlords,\u201d said Express Inc.\u2019s chief operating officer       Matthew C. Moellering       during a recent earnings call.Restaurants in particular appear to be wielding more influence. Restaurants typically ask for more tenant allowances than, say, apparel retailers, to pay for the higher upfront investments for their kitchens, air conditioning, plumbing and ventilation equipment. Now they are cranking up their demands even further.\u201cFood operators are negotiating very aggressive deals and they are getting away with it,\u201d said Cynthia Murphy, senior vice president at real estate services firm CBRE overseeing the mall leasing business. \u201cMore landlords are looking at food as an anchor to create sizzle for their centers.\u201dRestaurant chain P.F. Chang\u2019s is getting better rental rates and more flexible lease terms, said Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell.Mall owners, who negotiate lease terms with tenants individually, said they would offer more favorable terms to certain occupants if they believe their presence makes a difference to the property.Malls in good locations are still seeing strong demand from tenants. Mall rents and occupancy rates in metro areas have held steady as landlords have been able to backfill space with other retailers, fitness centers, restaurants, entertainment and grocery stores that are still expanding.Vacancy rates in enclosed malls were at 7.9% in the first quarter, up slightly from the 7.8% recorded in the previous quarter, while rents excluding anchor stores rose 0.4% from a year earlier, unchanged from the 0.4% growth recorded in the previous quarter, according to real-estate data provider REIS INC.In cases where the store location attracts other tenants or where the store is still performing well with respectable sales numbers, landlords say they still have some negotiating power.\u201cA lot of it is posturing,\u201d said       Joel Bayer,        president at property developer and owner O\u2019Connor Capital Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a game of chicken.

Andrew Cuomo       and state legislators to pass a long-sought measure making it easier for victims to press charges or sue their alleged abusers.The issue has gained steam during the past year, and legislation backed by advocates passed in the state Assembly earlier this month with bipartisan support. But the bill faced pushback from the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America, and has stalled in the Republican-led state Senate.The measure passed by the Assembly would allow sexual-abuse victims to bring civil lawsuits until their 50th birthday and felony criminal cases until their 28th birthday. Currently, they only have until the age of 23 to pursue either type of case.More controversially, the legislation would provide a one-year window after it takes effect for any past victims of child sex abuse to sue or press charges against a former alleged perpetrator, as well as well as certain institutions, such as churches.\u201cThe choice for any legislator is stark,\u201d said       Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal,        the Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill. \u201cVote to protect children who have been abused, or stand with the institutions that have allowed the abuse to occur.\u201dA spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader,       John Flanagan,        said the conference is reviewing the issue. \u201cFor years, Senate Republicans have been at the forefront of efforts to protect New Yorkers from dangerous sexual predators,\u201d he said.Sen.       Jeff Klein,        Democratic leader from the Bronx who is allied with Mr. Flanagan, has introduced a potential compromise. His legislation mirrors the Assembly\u2019s bill but changes the protocols around the one-year window for reviving cases.Mr. Klein\u2019s bill would task a commission\u2014comprised of former law-enforcement officials, sexual trauma experts, and defense-attorneys\u2014with considering if a case could move forward within the one-year window. The Assembly has been cool to that proposal.The New York state Catholic Conference has led efforts against Ms. Rosenthal\u2019s legislation, but has said it would support a different version.\u201cWe continue to oppose the retroactive window in the Child Victims Act that would allow for old claims against institutional defendants from decades ago to be revived, with no caps or limits of any kind,\u201d said       Dennis Poust,        a spokesman for the Catholic Conference.A representative for the Boy Scouts of America said, \u201cWhile there are a number of provisions in the bill [we] support, we do have concerns with components of the bill as it is currently written.\u201dMr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has said passing the measure this year is a priority, but advocates are growing anxious, with about a week left in the session.Several proponents of the legislation said Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office had promised that the governor would introduce his own bill related to the issue if the Legislature is unable to come to consensus. The Legislature would still have to pass the governor\u2019s bill for it to become law but it would amp up the pressure on lawmakers.\u201cWe expect and frankly we need the governor. to bring everybody together,\u201d said       Michael Polenberg,        vice president for government affairs at Safe Horizon, an advocacy group for victims of sexual violence. \u201cTime is running short.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s aides met with advocates last week to discuss the issue.\u201cThese victims deserve justice and we have been actively working with advocates to build support for this in both houses of the legislature.

Conventional wisdom holds that suddenly weaker currencies spur growth by making a country\u2019s exports more competitive on the global stage. But nearly a year after the Brexit vote sent the British pound into free fall, U.K. businesses are finding that higher costs for overseas components and materials have erased much of that advantage, WSJ\u2019s Christopher Whittall and Mike Bird report. That\u2019s because much of the U.K.\u2019s shrinking manufacturing sector no longer relies on domestic supply chains for components. While consumers abroad have been buying more British products, rising import volumes and higher purchasing costs for raw materials and parts have blunted that impact.England\u2019s nascent wine industry has a Brexit hangover. The fall in the pound means U.K. vineyards have to absorb higher costs for vines and equipment such as fermenting tanks, which usually come from France or other eurozone countries where winemaking is more established, WSJ\u2019s Laurence Fletcher and Tapan Panchal write. While British wine is now cheaper to export and sell abroad, winemakers say rising import costs have eaten away at margins, offsetting any gain from cheaper prices. English wine is also mostly sold domestically, unlike Scottish whiskey, which has a broad global market and has seen exports rise over the past year. What\u2019s more, English drinkers aren\u2019t readily willing to give up their beloved and thoroughly French Champagne.Count slow and expensive logistics among the hurdles in Africa that have many companies rethinking their growth plans on the continent. International brands and South African retail heavyweights alike have struggled to grow after investing heavily in Africa a few years back, WSJ\u2019s Alexandra Wexler writes.

They say the government will struggle to pass legislation needed to prepare Britain for exit without a change in approach.Ruth Davidson,        the influential leader of the Scottish branch of the Conservative party, said last weekend the government should look again at its Brexit approach and \u201cmove to a consensus within the country about\u2026what we seek to achieve as we leave.\u201dYet for Mrs. May, there are no easy alternatives. Whether she seeks to maintain closer economic ties with the EU or simply drops her threat that no deal is better than a bad deal, there are risks involved.For now at least, Mrs. May is suggesting her pre-election Brexit plans are unchanged. She says her government is ready to start negotiations with the EU team next week as planned, although no date was agreed during discussions in Brussels on Monday.Her plan is for Britain to leave the EU\u2019s single market of goods and services, a zone of common regulation that allows a British company to operate and sell its products across the bloc.Mrs. May has also pledged to take the U.K. out of the EU\u2019s customs union\u2014which imposes zero tariffs on trade among EU members and a common set of tariffs on imports from nonmembers\u2014although she has said she is open to a future U.K.-EU customs union arrangement. She also wants an end to the jurisdiction of EU courts over British laws and regulations.In the short-term, the least economically disruptive alternative would be to remain in the single market either inside the customs union or, like Norway, outside it.The Norway model has delivered strong economic benefits, yet it would require Britain doing two things Mrs. May has ruled out: maintaining freedom of movement of EU citizens into the U.K. and continuing large budget payments to the EU.It would also continue to give EU courts a key role in shaping British rules. In other words, Britain would have to accept some of the least attractive parts of EU membership while surrendering any influence over the bloc\u2019s direction.\u201cMake no mistake, the Norway option is not going to be an easy sell to euroskeptics, and has never been seen by Brussels as a credible model for the U.K.,\u201d said       Mujtaba Rahman,        Europe director with Eurasia Group, a London-based consultancy. \u201cNorway\u2026pays into the EU budget amounts that would basically be the same were it a full EU member.\u201dAnother alternative would be to leave the single market but seek customs-union membership. That would ensure Britain retained the benefits of the EU\u2019s 38 regional and bilateral trade deals and nullify one of the biggest risks from Brexit\u2014the imposition of EU tariffs and onerous customs checks on U.K. imports and exports to the EU.It would also help resolve one of the thorniest issues sparked by Brexit: how to avoid a hard border in Ireland\u2014which is a specific pledge of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party that looks set to enter an agreement to prop up a minority Conservative government. If Britain is in the customs union, major customs checks on the border with the Republic of Ireland won\u2019t be needed.But staying in the customs union would thwart perhaps the strongest economic argument used by Brexiteers: It would prevent Britain from being able to negotiate and sign its own trade deals. The U.K. would have to continue to apply the common external tariff and rely on Brussels to negotiate new trade deals. EU courts would also likely continue to have oversight of U.K. rules and regulation.There are two other options for the U.K. One would be to join the European Free Trade Association, an organization Britain helped found. That could offer some economic protection by allowing Britain access to EFTA\u2019s 27 trade deals covering 38 countries while also allowing the U.K. to start negotiating its own trade deals. Yet it isn\u2019t clear if EFTA would take Britain back and, in any case, it could take some time for Britain to have full access to those deals.Most significant, the benefits in terms of new export markets would be relatively small compared with the EU single market and EU trade deals. That is why three of EFTA\u2019s four members\u2014Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein\u2014all joined the EU\u2019s single market. Switzerland didn\u2019t, though it has some benefits and obligations of the single market through bilateral deals with the EU.There is also one other option Britain could push: negotiating a long transitional agreement with the EU which allowed one of these alternative models to stand for a number of years before Britain fully exited.That looks difficult. EU officials and lawmakers have said any transitional deal should be short-lived, no more than three years, according to the European Parliament.\u2014Jason Douglas in London contributed to this article.Write to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'May Faces Pressure To Ease Up on Brexit.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 06:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-may-faces-pressure-to-soften-brexit-approach-1497287871", "news_title": "U.K.\u2019s May Faces Pressure to Soften Brexit Approach", "keywords": "brexit, conservative party, conservatives, efta, eu, european union, norway, u.k. election, u.k. vote, uk election, uk vote,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "A drone believed to be from North Korea flew to the site of a controversial U.S. missile-defense battery in South Korea\u00a0to take photos, a spokesman for Seoul\u2019s defense ministry said.Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0disclosure highlights North Korea\u2019s growing capabilities with unmanned aerial vehicles. The drone, which South Korea\u2019s Ministry of National Defense had identified last week after it crashed in\u00a0eastern South Korea, carried a Sony camera and a 64-gigabyte memory chip that contained about 10 photos of the site where the U.S. has deployed the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, according to a spokesman for the ministry.The site, on a golf course in Seongju, is 170 miles south of the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas. With a wingspan of about 8 feet, the drone traveled undetected before crashing just south of the demilitarized zone, the spokesman said. It is unclear how far it flew or where its journey began.Separately, a spokesman for the South\u2019s defense ministry said late Tuesday that a North Korean soldier had defected across the demilitarized zone. Few details were immediately available, but while tens of thousands of North Koreans have defected to the South through third countries including China, it is relatively rare for soldiers to cross the heavily-fortified DMZ by land, given the large number of land mines, barbed-wire fences and artillery on both sides.News that the drone flew deep into South Korea is a potential source of embarrassment for its defense ministry. Two weeks ago, President Moon Jae-in\u2014a liberal who took office last month after the impeachment of his conservative predecessor\u2014criticized\u00a0the ministry for failing to inform him of the arrival of additional components for the system, known as Thaad.The drone development adds to the drama of the deployment. In recent months, Thaad has become a magnet for geopolitical tension. China, Russia and North Korea strongly oppose its deployment, which Mr. Moon has suspended to review the decision-making process.The review, together with U.S. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       remark that South Korea should pay for the $1 billion system, has generated tension between allies Washington and Seoul.Still, the White House announced the dates of an expected visit by President Moon to Washington, set for June 29-30. The two leaders are expected to discuss economic issues and also \u201ccoordinate on North Korea-related issues, including countering the growing North Korean nuclear and missile threats,\u201d according to the statement.Experts fear North Korea may soon have the capability to launch a nuclear missile capable of hitting U.S. targets. Since taking office Mr. Trump has sought to win more cooperation from China in getting North Korea to forsake its nuclear weapons program.\u2014Peter Nicholas in Washington contributed to this article.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 05:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korean-drone-spied-on-missile-defense-site-seoul-says-1497347423", "news_title": "North Korean Drone Spied on Missile-Defense Site, Seoul Says", "keywords": "dmz,korea drone,korean penisula,missile defense,north korea drone,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons,thaad,u.s. missile defense system,South Korea's Ministry of National Defense,U.S. State Department,Dennis Rodman,basketball,political,general news,national,public security,risk news,sports,recreation,military action,routine general news"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Consumer prices in the U.K. rose in May at the fastest annual rate for almost four years, intensifying a squeeze on households just as the country faces a prolonged spell of political uncertainty.Annual inflation in the U.K. accelerated in May to 2.9%, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday, the fastest rate of price-growth since June 2013.Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had been expecting inflation to hold steady at April\u2019s 2.7% rate.Renewed pressure on the economy from rising inflation marks another big challenge for the U.K.\u2019s embattled Prime Minister,       Theresa May,        who gambled on strengthening her authority with a snap election Thursday but came up short.A poor campaign cost Mrs. May her Parliamentary majority, throwing her Brexit strategy and a host of other Conservative Party policies into flux.

They say it allows them to make unpopular decisions in the economy\u2019s long-run best interest, such as raising rates to curb inflation even if it means slowing growth, as then-Fed chairman Paul Volcker did in the early 1980s.\u201cIt was clear to me, if you looked at the       Paul Volcker       experience, for example, having an independent Fed in terms of its decisions and credibility was critically important,\u201d\u00a0said former Treasury Secretary       Robert Rubin,        who in 1993 established a rule within the Clinton White House that the Fed\u2019s policy decisions shouldn\u2019t be publicly questioned.The administrations of presidents       George W. Bush       and       Barack Obama       maintained that policy, ushering in an unusual quarter-century of independence.It wasn\u2019t always that way.\u00a0Political pressure on Fed Chairman       William McChesney Martin       by the Johnson administration and on       Arthur Burns       by the Nixon administration to follow easy-money policies is widely blamed for the inflation surges of the 1970s.President       Jimmy Carter       chose Mr. Volcker for Fed chief to break the back of inflation, which Mr. Volcker did by raising interest rates to sky-high levels, triggering recessions in 1980 and\u00a01981.Shortly after President       Ronald Reagan\u2019s       inauguration, a White House staffer asked Mr. Volcker if he wanted to host the new president at the Fed. Mr. Volcker said no, nervous about the message it would send, but replied he would be happy to meet with Mr. Reagan anywhere else. They settled on the Treasury Department as a neutral ground.Top Reagan officials frequently criticized the Volcker Fed, but the president refrained. \u201cSome of his staff would have liked him to come out fighting\u2014criticizing the Federal Reserve when things got tough politically, and he just never did it,\u201d said Mr. Volcker. Mr. Reagan reappointed Mr. Volcker in 1983 before selecting       Alan Greenspan       to replace him in 1987.Mr. Greenspan had a strained relationship with President       George H.W. Bush,        who had criticized the Fed for keeping rates too high during his 1988 campaign. Mr. Bush ultimately reappointed Mr. Greenspan, but later blamed the Fed for his 1992 re-election defeat.At their first meeting after his election in 2000, then-President-elect George W. Bush pledged to Mr. Greenspan his full confidence. \u201cWe will not be second-guessing your decisions,\u201d he told Mr. Greenspan after an introductory breakfast meeting in downtown Washington, Mr. Greenspan later wrote.If Mr. Trump nominates\u00a0Fed Chairwoman       Janet\u00a0Yellen       to another term, it would extend a tradition.

The hearing, open to the public, came together quickly after former FBI Director       James Comey       testified before the same committee last week.\u201cIn light of reports regarding Mr. Comey\u2019s recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is important that I have an opportunity to address\u201d matters related to the Russia probe at the Justice Department, Mr. Sessions wrote in a weekend letter.The hearing will begin at 2:30 p.m. EDT. The Wall Street Journal will have a live video feed, along with instant analysis and updates. Here are five lines of questioning to watch for in the hearing:Democrats are expected to question Mr. Sessions about whether it was appropriate for him to recommend that President       Donald Trump       fire Mr. Comey, who was leading the probe into Russian meddling in the election. Mr. Sessions recused himself in March from matters associated with the probe, citing his high-profile role in the Trump campaign. His recusal also came after the disclosure that Mr. Sessions had conversations with a Russian official while advising the Trump campaign but didn\u2019t disclose those meetings in his confirmation hearings. The Justice Department has said Mr. Comey\u2019s firing was a personnel decision.Mr. Sessions may be asked more about the nature of his recusal from the Russia investigation. Last week, Mr. Comey raised the possibility of new concerns about Mr. Sessions\u2019 contacts with Russia during the campaign. Mr. Comey said he was \u201caware of facts\u201d weeks before Mr. Sessions formally recused himself, and that those facts made Mr. Sessions\u2019 \u201ccontinued engagement\u201d in the investigation \u201cproblematic.\u201d Senators could ask Mr. Sessions to offer insight on Mr. Comey\u2019s remark.It\u2019s likely Mr. Sessions will be asked his opinion on whether the general nature of Mr. Comey\u2019s behavior\u2014recording in memos his one-on-one interactions with the president and orchestrating the leaking of the content to the media\u2014was appropriate. Mr. Trump, in a Sunday tweet, openly asked if Mr. Comey\u2019s decision to disseminate his memo was \u201ctotally illegal?\u201d A yes or no answer from the attorney general would be big news.Mr. Sessions offered to resign recently amid tensions with the president. Mr. Trump\u2019s displeasure with Mr. Sessions appears to trace back to the attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself. White House spokesman       Sean Spicer       wouldn\u2019t answer a question last week about Mr. Trump\u2019s level of confidence in Mr. Sessions, so senators may turn to Mr. Sessions for answers about the relationship.It will be interesting to see if the questions to Mr. Sessions from Democrats and Republicans strike similar chords or diverge. During many politically charged congressional hearings, the members of the president\u2019s party look to stand up for the administration while the opposition party launches into tougher lines of questioning.

He found a vacant shop online and booked it with a credit card.He paid $4,800 to rent the small store on Thompson Street in Soho for seven days. It\u2019s a great location, he says, perfect for the snack-and-beverage pop-up he\u2019s running this week.\u201cIt was a lot easier than you\u2019d expect,\u201d Mr. Berg says.These days, renting a store is as easy as booking a hotel room. At least, that\u2019s the pitch from Appear Here, an online platform recently launched in New York City.Like its rival, Storefront, Appear Here allows landlords to list vacant stores by the day, week or month. Sites can be viewed in person, but transactions are completed online, typically in three to six days.I love this. Our retail strips are looking awfully sketchy these days, as landlords hold out for high rents and long-term tenants. According to CBRE, the number of vacancies along Manhattan\u2019s major retail corridors grew 65% this past year. Vacancy rates in Times Square, Soho and Herald Square are topping 20%, according to Cushman & Wakefield.These platforms make it relatively simple for landlords to fill those vacancies with temporary tenants, and for anyone with an idea and a credit card to test a new business concept.Intrigued, I recently scanned Appear Here\u2019s listings to find a small space for NYCarrot, my imaginary pop-up shop devoted entirely to selling carrots of all stripes.Alas, the only thing more depressing than looking for an affordable New York City apartment is looking for an affordable store. The cheapest listing, at $3,330 a month, was a tiny stall in a Canal Street market.A 1,200-square-foot space in Brooklyn looked like a deal at $200 a day until I realized it was a \u201crepurposed\u201d shipping container.Prices on the high end, meanwhile, are truly eye-popping. A 5,000-square-foot showroom in Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District fetches $105,000 a week\u2014the price of a small condo in Tampa.There are about 200 New York City listings on the Appear Here site so far, mostly in low-rise Manhattan neighborhoods such as the West Village and Lower East Side, says Chief Marketing Officer       Elizabeth Layne.       The typical rental, paid in advance, costs between $10,000 and $40,000 a month.So far, the service is getting a lot of interest from fashion designers, food-concept entrepreneurs and coffee-shop owners. Come on people, is that the best we can do? The barriers to entry certainly are low enough to encourage some creativity.Designer       Kelsi Yuanyuan       Xi says that when she asked a traditional broker to find a Manhattan pop-up location for Myrra, her jewelry line, his suggestions required large security deposits, extensive documentation and years of tax records\u2014which the recent transplant from Australia couldn\u2019t provide.Through Appear Here, she found a Garment District shop that required no deposit and little documentation. \u201cIt was really simple,\u201d she says of landing her three-month rental.These platforms can\u2019t replace traditional brokers of course.       Seth Peichert,        who is involved with operations and leasing for Centaur Properties, says the developer has been renting Soho and Nolita spaces through Appear Here, while brokers are seeking long-term tenants for them.\u201cThis is a way to generate some revenue in the meantime,\u201d he notes.The drawbacks?Rates for short-term rentals on Appear Here run 1.5 times higher, on average, than rates for multi-year leases. And Appear Here takes a 15% cut from landlords, compared with the 6% commission typical of a commercial broker.Landlords, meanwhile, are on their own when it comes to screening tenants for proper operating licenses and adequate insurance.But why not experiment?       Ms. Xi       says her first run went so well, she\u2019s planning to test different neighborhoods to find the right spot for a permanent store.\u2014anne.kadet@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-13 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tough-time-renting-pop-up-space-online-service-could-help-1497346201", "news_title": "Tough Time Renting Pop-Up Space?

That bodes well for America\u2019s biggest lenders.The U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s report on bank regulation, issued Monday evening, is the most detailed statement to date of the Trump administration\u2019s view of financial regulation. It calls for an across-the-board streamlining of the regulatory approach to depository institutions.Like all such calls for deregulation, it is pitched as being on the side of beleaguered community lenders. But it is hard to miss how much it would benefit top Wall Street banks. Importantly, while only some of its recommendations can be implemented without Congressional legislation, these measures alone would be enough to move the needle significantly for bank profitability.The House of Representatives last week passed its own plan, which goes much further in dismantling the postcrisis Dodd-Frank regulatory regime. That bill stands little chance of passing the Senate, though. By contrast, the various tweaks proposed Monday by the Treasury are far more likely to be realized in the near to medium term.The Treasury plan calls for raising the asset-size threshold under which banks must submit to Federal Reserve stress-testing, which is currently $50 billion. This would aid midsize banks near the threshold, but it would also require legislation that may or may not be forthcoming.The Treasury also envisions several changes to the stress-test process aimed at making it less cumbersome and more predictable. These could be put in place easily by the Federal Reserve, once Mr. Trump has nominated his own vice chair of supervision to the Fed board.The report also recommends changes in how regulators calculate banks\u2019 total leverage by excluding safe assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds and cash on deposit with the Fed. This would be a boon to Wall Street banks with large securities portfolios.So too would the report\u2019s proposal to significantly pare back enforcement of the Volcker rule. The Treasury said it advocates \u201csimplifying the definition of proprietary trading and allowing banks to more easily hedge their risks and conduct market-making activities.\u201dThe report doesn\u2019t commit to an outright lowering of capital requirements for the biggest U.S. banks. It does open the door to such a move, though, noting that the current practice of requiring them to hold more capital than international peers risks making them less competitive.All these changes, with the exception of changing the asset-size threshold, could be implemented without Congress, though they can\u2019t happen overnight. The administration still needs to fill various regulatory posts and coordinate desired changes between agencies.Action on these fronts is still likely over the next year or two, and the combined impact on bank profitability and capital returns would be significant. Investors will start pricing that into bank stocks sooner rather than later.", "news_time": "2017-06-13 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-regulation-plan-makes-for-pleasant-reading-on-wall-street-1497346202", "news_title": "Trump Regulation Plan Makes for Pleasant Reading on Wall Street ", "keywords": "dodd-frank,dodd-frank wall street,financial regulation,heard on the street,treasury bank regulation,treasury banks,trump finance industry,trump financial overhaul,trump wall street,volcker rule,U.S. Treasury Department,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,deregulation,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Proterra Inc., the electric-bus maker heading toward a possible initial public offering,\u00a0has raised an additional $55 million in funding from investors including             BMW AG\u2019s             venture-capital arm and       Al Gore\u2019s       investment fund.The fundraising follows a $140 million investment in January and\u00a0brings the total capital collected by the company to $345 million since it was founded in 2004.Burlingame, Calif.-based Proterra, which has manufacturing facilities in South Carolina and near Los Angeles, has sold more than 400 buses to cities and communities such as Dallas and Philadelphia. The vehicles sell for $750,000 each.

It\u2019s more of a reupholstering.I mean that both literally and figuratively. The interior of the Surface Laptop, which arrives in stores later this week, is covered in soft fabric. Snack lovers, be warned: This laptop isn\u2019t compatible with Doritos fingers.The rest of the $1,000-and-up machine is surprisingly traditional. It\u2019s a handsome new dressing on the slim, lightweight workhorse design Apple popularized with the MacBook Air nine years ago. After using the Surface Laptop for a week, I found it to be a dependable road warrior\u2014but I\u2019m still not sure why Microsoft made it.I love Microsoft\u2019s other Surface hardware for evolving the idea of a PC. The Surface Pro made the world realize a finger-operated tablet could be a real computer. The Surface Book pioneered a new form of laptop that detaches from its keyboard. The Surface Studio reinvented the desktop as a giant swiveling touch screen.But the Surface Laptop is\u2026just another under-3-pound aluminum laptop. Making a touch-friendly Windows 10 rival to the MacBook is a good idea\u2014but it\u2019s already been done. One of my favorites, Dell\u2019s XPS 13, is just as powerful and nearly as slim as Microsoft\u2019s, and its base price is $200 less.Microsoft says it made the Laptop with students in mind. It\u2019s the first computer to run a special version of its operating system called Windows 10 S, designed to make computers safer and easier to run. Its biggest change is that you can only download apps from the Windows Store, which vets them.That\u2019s a good idea, in theory. But right now, some pretty important apps are missing from the store, like Google\u2019s Chrome and             Adobe\u2019s       Photoshop Lightroom. Anyone with software needs as basic as those would need to upgrade to regular Windows 10\u2014free now, but $49 starting in 2018.That\u2019s not to say the Laptop is a bad laptop. Here\u2019s what\u2019s good:Microsoft didn\u2019t skimp on             Intel\u2019s       latest chipset. I could even stream three videos at once without triggering the annoying whir of a fan to keep it from overheating.The Laptop lasted slightly longer than 10 hours in my brutal web-surfing test\u2014a half-hour longer than the 13-inch MacBook Pro and 15 minutes longer than a similarly equipped Dell XPS 13.The screen is a stunner, packing in more pixels than even the latest MacBook Pro. You can touch it and even write on it with a stylus (sold separately). Unlike touch PCs such as             HP\u2019s       Spectre x360, though, you can\u2019t swing the screen all the way around to make it lie flat.The keys have a more satisfactory click\u2014called \u201ctravel\u201d in the industry\u2014than the latest MacBooks. The trackpad is responsive. The laptop is even weighted so you can open it with one hand.But if you\u2019re considering getting one, particularly for business use, there are a few caveats to keep in mind. Here\u2019s what\u2019s bad:Along with a Mini DisplayPort for an external monitor, there\u2019s just one old-fashioned USB-style port. That\u2019s not enough. Besides, in the next few years you\u2019ll probably need the newer USB-C plugs. The Dell XPS 13 has both the old and new\u2014and an SD-card reader.The $1,000 base model comes with just four gigabytes of RAM, half what you get for that price from Apple or Dell. I recommend eight for a computer you plan to hold on to for a few years, which immediately hikes up the price to $1,300.The speakers, nestled in an unusual spot behind the keys, are anemic and can\u2019t hold a candle to the MacBook Pro.And that takes us to the most controversial element of all: fashion. You\u2019re going to either love or hate the cloth interior. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t buy the Surface Laptop without it. A fraction of the people I\u2019ve shown it to say they think it makes the laptop feel more homey. I can picture the focus group where Microsoft decided that millennials would prefer a cuddly laptop.Placing cloth where your filthy hands rest is asking for trouble. Made of a synthetic fabric called Alcantara, also used on race-car seats and inside Louis Vuitton purses, Microsoft says it\u2019s \u201ceasy to clean and durable.\u201d It puts the same material on some Surface 4 covers, to mostly positive reviews.In the interest of science, I reviewed this laptop with fingers covered in delicious cheesy Dorito powder. They left their mark, though I was able to clean it mostly off with a moist cloth. It still smells like nacho cheese. Who knows what a few years of Doritos will do?So where does that leave the Surface Laptop? Its slim, nearly seamless body is a thing of beauty, but it doesn\u2019t advance much in important areas like battery life.Unless you\u2019re really smitten by that design (and always wear gloves while typing), the Laptop has few talents that would lead me to recommend it over the Dell XPS 13 or other promising new ultraportable laptops arriving this summer, such as Huawei\u2019s 2.3-pound MateBook X.The Laptop\u2019s price is a particular head-scratcher for students. More and more of them are choosing Chromebooks, which offer great performance on Google\u2019s web-centric operating system for $500 or less. While other Windows 10 S computers will directly compete in that price range, Microsoft\u2019s own offering can\u2019t. Microsoft adds some value by including a free year\u2019s subscription to Microsoft Office, but in the age of Google Docs, that\u2019s no longer a must-have for students.At $1,300\u2014the cheapest configuration worth considering\u2014you\u2019ve hit the same price as the MacBook Pro that Apple updated last week. And while the Surface Laptop has touch-screen capabilities, most students with that much money to burn would rather spend it on a Mac.

Without disputing Mr. Ruddy\u2019s claim, the White House added that \u201conly the president or his attorneys are authorized to comment.\u201dA spokesman for       Marc Kasowitz,        Mr. Trump\u2019s lead attorney in the Russia probe, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.But in a television interview on Sunday, one member of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team didn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Mr. Trump might dismiss Mr. Mueller.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that that issue is going to arise,\u201d       Jay Sekulow       told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, but added that it \u201cis an issue that the president with his advisers would discuss if there was a basis.\u201dIn his interview with PBS NewsHour, Mr. Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media, said he believes firing Mr. Mueller would be a \u201cvery significant mistake.\u201dMr. Mueller has been assembling a legal team to investigate issues arising from Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential race. Among the questions they could examine is whether Mr. Trump sought to quash the investigation, and if he did, whether that constitutes obstruction of justice. In an appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week, Mr. Comey said that Mr. Trump had pressured him to back off an investigation into Michael Flynn, the White House\u2019s former national security adviser.The president has denied doing so.Reached by phone Monday, Mr. Ruddy declined to comment.As Mr. Mueller\u2019s work picks up, Trump allies have begun raising questions about his independence.Mr. Ruddy told PBS that before taking the special counsel job, Mr. Mueller spoke to the president about possibly succeeding Mr. Comey as FBI director\u2014a job Mr. Mueller had held for 12 years before Mr. Comey\u2019s appointment in 2013. A White House official said Monday that such a job interview took place.When offered the position of special counsel investigating an administration that had recently interviewed him for a job, Mr. Mueller should have recognized a conflict and declined, Mr. Ruddy said.Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives and a Trump supporter, who last month had described Mr. Mueller as a \u201csuperb choice,\u201d tweeted Monday that \u201cRepublicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair.\u201dOusting Mr. Mueller in the thick of the Russia probe could create an even more intense backlash than the firing of Mr. Comey.Soon after Mr. Ruddy\u2019s comments aired, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) tweeted: \u201cIf President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately re-establish\u00a0independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Don\u2019t waste our time.\u201dJettisoning Mr. Mueller would inevitably invite comparisons with the Watergate scandal.

Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and refuses formal ties with countries that recognize the island as a country. Ms. Tsai\u2019s phone call in December congratulating President       Donald Trump       on his election victory broke with longstanding diplomatic protocol and raised the ire of Beijing.Taiwan condemned Beijing for \u201ctempting\u201d Panama to cut off relations with Taipei, saying China\u2019s continual effort to marginalize the island is provocative and endangers the stability in the region.\u201cIt\u2019s another way of turning the screws on the Taiwan government,\u201d said William Stanton, the top U.S. diplomat in Taipei from 2009 to 2012.Taiwanese Presidential Office Secretary-General Joseph Wu said during a press conference that Beijing\u2019s latest move \u201cpushes cross-Strait ties from peace to confrontation\u201d and that Taiwan would reassess the cross-Strait situation.Ms. Tsai has yet to publicly to acknowledge an agreement the two sides made in 1992 that there is only \u201cone China.\u201d The agreement didn\u2019t clearly lay out what that term means but allowed the two rivals to end decades of hostilities. \u201cThis is happening because Beijing is disappointed in Tsai Ing-wen for not respecting the 92 Consensus,\u201d said Jin Canrong, a Beijing-based foreign-relations professor at Renmin University.In recent years, China\u2019s growing economic heft has pushed more of Taiwan\u2019s allies to switch their diplomatic recognition to Beijing.In a televised statement also posted on Twitter, Panamanian President       Juan Carlos Varela       said China was the second most important user of the Panama Canal and the No. 1 supplier of goods in the Colon free-trade zone. \u201cThe role the People\u2019s Republic of China plays at the regional and global level is important,\u201d he said.He said, in an apparent reference to the absence of ties with Beijing until now, \u201cthis is a situation no responsible leader could allow to continue.\u201dFollowing Panama\u2019s decision, Taiwan will have only 20 formal diplomatic allies, mainly small nations in the Pacific and the Caribbean.After a detente in the competition for allies under Ms. Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, who advocated warmer relations across the Taiwan Strait, Beijing resumed its efforts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically after Ms. Tsai\u2019s election in January 2016. In March 2016, shortly before Ms. Tsai took office, Beijing renewed ties with Gambia, which had severed ties with Taipei in 2013.In December of last year, another African nation, Sao Tome and Principe, broke ties with Taiwan to forge relations with China.Taiwanese political experts said Beijing\u2019s pressure appeared likely to continue.\u201cThis is a harsh reality we have to face in Taiwan that we are going to lose diplomatic allies in the next few years,\u201d said Chen-shen Yen, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University.Last month, China blocked Taiwan\u2019s attendance at a meeting of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization.\u2014Sofia McFarland contributed to this article.Write to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com and Jenny W.

Still, senior U.S. officials acknowledged that China has indicated in the past that it would punish North Korea, only to dash the hopes of successive U.S. administrations. As a result, the Trump administration needs to be prepared to act unilaterally, these officials said.The U.S. officials declined to name the entities being targeted.But several Chinese entities of concern are identified in a report to be released\u00a0Monday by a Washington nonpartisan research group, C4ADS, which works to expose illicit trading networks. Those identified in the report include a Chinese businessman and his sister said to be connected to a ship intercepted by Egypt last year while smuggling 30,000 North Korean rocket-propelled grenades.U.S. officials say the report is in line with part of the Trump administration\u2019s strategy toward North Korea. While C4ADS is a private organization, its reports have been shared widely with U.S. government agencies and Congress. The Justice Department used C4ADS findings in its indictment last September of a Chinese businesswoman and Communist Party member accused of aiding Pyongyang\u2019s military programs, according to current and former U.S. officials involved in the case.While thousands of Chinese firms trade with North Korea, many are interconnected through parent companies or shared ownership, according to U.S. officials and C4ADS. That means shutting down even a handful of these connected networks would make it harder for North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un       to finance and supply his nuclear program, current and former U.S. officials said.Pyongyang conducts roughly 90% of its recorded foreign trade through China, according to Chinese trade data.\u201cWe\u2019ve told the Chinese we hope they\u2019ll act against certain companies and people,\u201d said a senior U.S. official briefed on North Korea policy. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also said that we\u2019re prepared to act alone and can reach North Korea if we choose.\u201dChina\u2019s foreign ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing has said repeatedly that while it implements United Nations sanctions on North Korea, it is opposed to unilateral action and favors a negotiated solution. U.S. sanctions on North Korea target virtually the nation\u2019s entire economy; U.N. sanctions are less stringent and still allow for significant nonmilitary trade.Mr. Trump first asked Chinese President       Xi Jinping       to crack down on North Korean trade during a summit at the president\u2019s Florida resort in April, U.S. officials said. It remains unclear whether Beijing would take action against the Chinese companies of concern to the U.S.C4ADS said Chinese corporate and trade records show 5,233 local companies traded with North Korea between 2013 and 2016. Many of them share Chinese\u00a0owners, addresses or other identifying features, it said.\u201cYou need to deny these networks access to Chinese markets and more broadly the international financial system,\u201d said David Thompson, author of the C4ADS report.While noting that much of China\u2019s trade with North Korea is legal, the report identified several Chinese companies exporting potential \u201cdual use\u201d items that could be used either for civilian purposes or in North Korea\u2019s missile programs.Among the key players it identified was Sun Sidong, a businessman in the northeastern Chinese city of Dandong. Relatives identified one of his business partners as his elder sister, Sun Sihong, and Chinese corporate records show them using the same address.C4ADS said the pair were connected to a ship that U.N. sanctions experts say was seized near the Suez Canal last year while illegally transporting the North Korean rocket-propelled grenades hidden under iron ore.That ship\u2014the Jie Shun\u2014was owned at the time by a Hong Kong-based company controlled by Sun Sihong and had previously been owned by Sun Sidong via another Hong Kong company, according to the Equasis shipping database and Hong Kong corporate records.Ms. Sun declined to comment.Another of Mr. Sun\u2019s companies, Dandong Dongyuan Industrial Co., exported $28.5 million of goods to North Korea\u2014including trucks, machinery and electrical goods\u2014between 2013 and 2016, according to Chinese customs data provided by a U.S.-based firm, Panjiva.C4ADS said Dandong Dongyuan was the biggest exporter of potential \u201cdual use\u201d items in its sample and that last year they included navigational apparatus in a category that could be used in vehicles or in ballistic missile guidance systems.\u201cOnce charted, not only do links between top firms become more apparent, but it becomes much more apparent that a very small number of key executives control a disproportionate share of the trade,\u201d said C4ADS.Mr. Sun agreed to meet a Wall Street Journal reporter in Dandong, but soon afterward a dozen of his staff pulled over the reporter\u2019s taxi, boxed it in with their vehicles and called local police, who briefly detained the reporter.Mr. Sun and his staff then came to the police station and answered a few questions in the presence of several officers before leaving with his entourage. He denied doing any trade with North Korea or having any knowledge of the Jie Shun.But he acknowledged having a business in the U.S. called Dongyuan Enterprise USA, which is based in Queens in New York City. He declined to answer further questions.C4ADS said the U.S. business could \u201cprovide him the ability to register for business services within the U.S., including sending or receiving shipments, establishing bank accounts, or applying for employment visas.\u201dDandong Dongyuan reported that it was exporting to North Korea in corporate filings from 2010 on but removed the reference in November 2016.\u00a0From 2011 to 2016, it had approval to export trucks and in 2015 it was allowed to join a trade exhibition in Pyongyang, according to Chinese government notices.The Trump administration has been seeking in recent months to increase economic pressure on North Korea beyond just China, senior U.S. officials said. This has included dispatching top diplomats on missions to Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa, all places where the North Koreans have conducted trade.\u201cWhen countries are under extended sanctions\u2026they look for the cracks and seams,\u201d said a senior U.S. diplomat involved in North Korea policy. \u201cSo everything goes to unlikely spots in the world where they are less likely to be tracked down.\u201d\u2014Kersten Zhang in Beijing contributed to this article.Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Jeremy Page at jeremy.page@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Pyongyang Trade Partners Targeted.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 02:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-weighs-sanctioning-chinese-entities-over-north-korea-1497281112", "news_title": "U.S. Asks China to Crack Down on Shadowy Firms That Trade With North Korea", "keywords": "drug,substance usage,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,international relations,international sanctions,cybercrime,hacking,politics,social issues"}, {"content": "OAKLAND, Calif.\u2014The NBA has bad teams, laughably bad teams, mediocre teams, good teams, even great teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers, and then it has the Golden State Warriors.The other NBA teams with perfectly normal amounts of professional basketball talent spent this year scheming to beat the Warriors. It seemed impossible at the beginning of the season. It really was impossible by the end of the season.Golden State capped one of the greatest postseason runs in the history of the league, an unprecedented 16-1 romp through the playoffs, by winning the NBA championship with a 129-120 win over the Cavaliers in a tense Game 5 of the Finals on Monday night.Kevin Durant,        the most valuable player of the finals, scored 39 points.       Stephen Curry       scored 34 points. And the sight of them holding a trophy over their heads wasn\u2019t simply a reminder that every other team spent this year trying and failing to figure out how to stop them. It was also visual evidence of the league\u2019s future: The Warriors are a potential basketball dynasty capable of dominating the NBA for a long time.They\u2019re a problem that might take the league\u2019s other teams several years to solve.The Warriors have a core of star players\u2014Curry, Durant, Draymond Green, and       Klay Thompson      \u2014who happen to be in their primes. They can keep all of them for at least the next two seasons and, almost equally important, surround them with free agents willing to accept less money for the privilege of playing in the basketball Eden they have created.That\u2019s why the Warriors are the favorite to win the title next season, too, and once again the season after that. How any mere NBA team is supposed to beat the Warriors is still a question without an answer.\u201cWe\u2019re just getting started,\u201d Curry said.The only team to make the Warriors sweat in the last three years, a stretch in which they won two championships and most games of any team in any era, was the team they had to beat in this year\u2019s Finals. It was also the team that beat them in last year\u2019s Finals.This championship avenged that crushing loss to the Cavaliers. The Warriors also led that series, 3-1, and found themselves one minute away from being known as the greatest team of all time after winning a record 73 games in the regular season, something that no team had ever done. But then the Cavs did something that no team had ever done. They came back from a 3-1 hole in the Finals and beat the Warriors on their home court in an epic Game 7.The new, improved, altogether terrifying Warriors were born from that failure. Golden State improved almost immediately upon the publication of an online essay with the nine words the rest of the NBA feared: \u201cI am going to join the Golden State Warriors.\u201d The blogger was an extraordinarily talented basketball player named Kevin Durant.The Warriors signing Durant, who saved his most stunning performance of the season for Monday, as their consolation prize was part luck and part shrewd management. They were rewarded on the court for every decision they made off the court. A massive, one-time spike in the NBA\u2019s salary cap cleared enough space on Golden State\u2019s books to add Durant, but they never would have been in that position without prudent work by the team\u2019s front office drafting Curry, Green and Thompson and building a team culture that attracted Durant.The result was a collection of talent so rich that other teams felt the title had been won before the season even started. Then the season began, and the Warriors were scarier than anyone imagined.They had the most explosive offense statistically in the history of the NBA. As if that weren\u2019t enough, Golden State also had one of the league\u2019s most suffocating defenses. That combination won them a lot of games\u201467 in the regular season, to be exact, and their first 15 of the postseason\u2014and their advanced metrics put them in the same company as the 1996 Chicago Bulls and even last year\u2019s Warriors among the greatest teams ever.The difference this year was that Golden State started to peak at the end of the regular season. They were playing their best basketball as the playoffs began. The Warriors won 15 of their last 16 regular-season games and then reeled off another 12-game winning streak to reach the Finals.To win the championship, though, they would have to beat the Cavs.It wasn\u2019t surprising when Cleveland and Golden State ripped through the playoffs with a combined one loss after demoralizing the rest of the league into believing their third consecutive Finals showdown was inevitable. The postseason was the same as the regular season: The Cavaliers and Warriors had no competition except for each other.The Warriors controlled Game 1, dominated Game 2, came from behind in Game 3 and lost Game 4 after Cleveland had one of the greatest shooting nights in Finals history. But the Cavaliers were one upset away from being in unexpected control of the series. All they had to do was win on Monday.The crowd here was noticeably anxious before and during Game 5\u2014at least until a 28-4 run from the Warriors resulted in Oracle Arena erupting. It was as if the fans had been given a year of free toast. The Cavs still cut Golden State\u2019s lead to three points in the fourth quarter, but they never had a shot to tie the game or take the lead, and the final minutes turned into a cathartic party.Not even the most sublime player of this generation could stop it.       LeBron James       being LeBron James was still only enough for the Cavs to win one game.\u201cThey\u2019re going to be here for a while,\u201d James said. \u201cThey\u2019re built to last a few years.\u201dJames would know better than anyone. The Warriors were too good for the Cavs. Now, and maybe for a long time, they\u2019re also the NBA champions.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'The Warriors Strike Gold Once Again.'", "news_time": "2017-06-13 02:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/golden-state-warriors-win-nba-championship-1497325510", "news_title": "Golden State Warriors Win NBA Championship", "keywords": "basketball,championship,cleveland cavaliers,golden state warriors,kevin durant,lebron james,nba,nba finals,stephen curry,Cleveland Cavaliers,Golden State Warriors,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "The 9/11 Tribute Center in lower Manhattan has given tourists the opportunity to walk alongside a person who was affected firsthand by the\u00a0Sept. 11, 2001,\u00a0attacks.That intimate experience, however, hasn\u2019t been paired with an impressive gallery for exhibits and teaching. Put together quickly in the shadow of Ground Zero, the 9/11 Tribute Center has operated in a relatively small space formerly used as a deli since 2006.That will change this week, however, when the Center, primarily the work of the\u00a0September 11th\u00a0Families\u2019 Association charity, opens at 92 Greenwich Street. The museum\u2019s new home is a few blocks south of its former location and three times as large at 36,000 square feet.The museum aims to use the new space to try to appeal to bigger tour groups. It has attracted some 450,000 people annually, with large groups limited to around two dozen. The goal is to accommodate hundreds at a time and draw in 1 million visitors a year.Jennifer Adams-Webb,        a co-founder and chief executive of the 9/11 Tribute Center, said she and a former board member looked at nearly every open site around the World Trade Center before settling on the new space, which has a small area at street level, galleries on the second floor and administrative and gathering space in the basement.A lease of 36 years provides cost savings over the long term, Ms. Adams-Webb said. She conceded that moving away from the World Trade Center site is a concern, and that the museum would need to step up its marketing efforts.\u201cThe beautiful part of this location is that we are halfway between the Statue of Liberty and the World Trade Center,\u201d she said.Visitors to the new space will still see the elements of the old one, including an evocative wall displaying hundreds of photos of those killed on 9/11 and a small assemblage of artifacts.
