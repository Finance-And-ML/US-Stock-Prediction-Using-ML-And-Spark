The department declined to give details on the guidelines, which will take effect the same day.A version of the guidelines under discussion late Wednesday afternoon called for a restricted definition of what family ties would qualify as a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship that allowed for U.S. travel, according to one person familiar with the discussion. Under this version, applicants would need to prove a relationship to a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son- or daughter-in-law or sibling in the U.S., he said. Others, including grandparents, grandchildren and fianc\u00e9es, wouldn\u2019t qualify.Late Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that this version of the policy had been finalized and sent to U.S. embassies.Omar Jadwat, the lead attorney on this issue for the American Civil Liberties Union, replied with dismay to the news. \u201cSpouse, but not fianc\u00e9? Son in law, but not mother in law? Makes no sense,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.The DHS action follows a Supreme Court\u00a0decision to lift lower courts\u2019 injunctions on the executive order temporarily banning travel to the U.S. by citizens from six Muslim-majority countries that the GOP president has said poses particular security risks.The court said the ban could be implemented in the months before it hears a pair of legal challenges this fall. But it also ordered the administration to make exceptions for visa and refugee applicants who have a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship with people or institutions in the U.S.There are few expectations of the sort of chaos at airports that accompanied Mr. Trump\u2019s first version of this executive order. After its release in January, some travelers were abruptly stopped at arrival gates and sometimes held for hours. A flurry of court challenges followed, and thousands of people protested at airports around the country.The March order allows for existing visas to remain valid, including those issued as recently as\u00a0Wednesday. So it is unlikely that people will be turned back unexpectedly in the near term.Airlines abroad were awaiting details of the travel restrictions. Airline officials said they were ready to quickly inform passengers to minimize disruptions.Still, immigration advocates are bracing for trouble. Amnesty International USA said it would station researchers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C.,\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0to monitor implementation of the new rules.An Amnesty spokeswoman said it is unclear exactly what guidelines border agents will be given. \u201cBecause immigration officers have such discretionary power, we\u2019re not sure what they will abide by,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very up in the air.\u201dQuestions also remain about how to interpret the Supreme Court order.A letter sent\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly by advocacy groups, including Muslim Advocates, said: \u201cThe public is in urgent need of information about the manner through which persons can establish a \u2018bona fide\u2019 relationship with a person or entity in the United States,\u201d as well as how to make such a request.Beyond the new travel rules, the DHS is also developing new rules for vetting visa and refugee applicants, and is still conducting a country-by-country review of security procedures that could lead to new and possibly more sweeping travel restrictions by people from the six targeted countries and elsewhere.Mr. Kelly said\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that he looks forward to those reviews.By the time, \u201cthe government wins this case in the Supreme Court, we\u2019ll be able to move forward\u2014not focusing on people from one religion or one culture, but focusing on every airport, every country around the world, doing a better job at determining who the person is who wants to come and why they want to come here,\u201d he said at a\u00a0conference sponsored by the Center for a New American Security.When the Supreme Court hears arguments on the executive order in October, it is possible that the original travel restrictions will have been replaced by new ones, based on the reviews that are now under way. That could give the court an opening to avoid issuing a definitive ruling on the policy now in place.The Supreme Court\u2019s decision on\u00a0Monday\u00a0wasn\u2019t exactly what either side wanted.\u00a0The court\u2019s unsigned opinion said it was attempting to strike a balance until the justices could give the case full consideration in the fall.The court didn\u2019t offer a comprehensive list of what U.S. connections allow travelers to avoid the ban, but it did list some examples.\u00a0It said traveling to visit or live with a close family member in the U.S. would count.\u00a0It also cited students who have been admitted to U.S. universities, workers who have accepted jobs from U.S. companies and lecturers who have been invited to address a U.S. audience.Three conservative justices\u00a0on Monday\u00a0expressed concern that the compromise approach could prove unworkable and generate more litigation.Dueling reactions from the White House and civil-rights and immigrant-rights groups\u00a0on Monday\u00a0suggest each side may have a different vision of how broad a ban can be in place for now.Mr. Trump applauded the decision as a significant win for his effort to curb travel and combat terrorism.\u00a0But critics argued the travel restrictions endorsed by the court are narrow. Refugee organizations, for example, say that virtually any refugee can claim a relationship to the U.S. because of their ties to resettlement organizations that partner with the State Department.\u2014Robert Wall contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Travel Restrictions to Be Unveiled.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 23:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeland-security-to-unveil-travel-ban-guidelines-1498692488", "news_title": "Homeland Security to Unveil Travel-Ban Guidelines", "keywords": " airports, department of homeland security, immigration advocates, refugees,travel ban, travel restrictions, trump administration, u.s. embassies, visas,political,general news,national,public security,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch,judicial branch"}, {"content": "A collapse in more than a dozen small-cap companies\u2019 shares in Hong Kong this week has wiped billions of dollars off their value, and shone a light on the murky underbelly of the city\u2019s stock market just as it gears up to mark 20 years since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule.Market participants remain stumped over what, or who, triggered the declines of as much as 90% for a number of stocks listed on Hong Kong\u2019s Growth and Enterprise Market, home to a plethora of so-called penny-stocks that trade for less than one Hong Kong dollar ($0.13) each.That includes the man who last month raised questions about the network of cross-shareholdings that appears to link the firms which were part of the plunge.In a report titled \u201cThe Enigma Network: 50 Stocks Not To Own\u201d, Hong Kong-based activist investor       David Webb       highlighted several companies with high valuations that appear to be tied by their ownership of each other\u2019s shares\u2014a network Mr. Webb illustrated with an intricate spidergram.The companies included umbrella-maker China Jicheng Holdings Ltd., consultancy             GreaterChina Professional Services Ltd.       and             AMCO United Holding Ltd.      , whose businesses include manufacturing, lending and securities investing.Investors initially shrugged off Mr. Webb\u2019s missive. But on Tuesday the trio were among the leading decliners, suddenly tumbling 94%, 93% and 70%, respectively. AMCO fell a further 49% Wednesday while GreaterChina lost 34% of its remaining value. China Jicheng rose 6.3%.With other stocks named in Mr. Webb\u2019s report tumbling, the S&P/HKEX Growth Enterprise Market Index, made up of more than 70 small-cap companies, plunged 9.6% on Tuesday, its biggest drop since mid-2015, and a further 0.8% Wednesday\u2014a fourth-straight decline that put cumulative lost market value at some $3 billion, according to Reuters data. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, its main benchmark, fell 0.6% on Wednesday.AMCO United said it had no comment. China Jicheng and GreaterChina Professional Services couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Other major financial centers have markets for small and medium-size companies, including London\u2019s Alternative Investment Market and Tokyo\u2019s so-called Mothers market. Such markets offer investors the chance to buy into companies that often have strong growth prospects. But they are also often associated with loose regulation, and several have been tarnished by intermittent scandal. Hong Kong\u2019s GEM market carries the slogan \u201cA \u2018Buyers Beware\u2019 Market for Informed Investors\u201d atop its website.In Hong Kong\u2019s case, the timing of the sudden selloff is embarrassing, given the international spotlight on the city this week. Chinese President       Xi Jinping       is due to visit Hong Kong on Thursday as part of the celebrations marking two decades since China regained sovereignty.Hong Kong has long been viewed by global investors as a more predictable market than those in mainland China, owing to its English language common-law courts, independent judiciary and a strong rule of law.But some argue the city\u2019s relatively loose approach to regulation has led to a casino-like environment for some stocks. Companies listed on the GEM market traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 46.7 at the end of May, according to exchange data. That compares to a 34 times multiple for the Shenzhen market, home to many of China\u2019s fastest-growing companies.Mr. Webb said the unexplained plunge in the GEM market was indicative of poor oversight of markets by the city\u2019s authorities, including exchange operator             Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.      , known as HKEx, which owns the market.\u201cThe bigger picture here is that there\u2019s been a structural failing in financial stock-market regulation, and these problems have been allowed to build up by HKEx,\u201d said Mr. Webb. He said the problem was \u201cnot restricted to the GEM\u201d given that many of the stocks which plunged Tuesday were listed on Hong Kong\u2019s main board.A spokesman for HKEx disputed Mr. Webb\u2019s accusations of regulatory laxity. \u201cWe have rules and we enforce them,\u201d he said.A spokesman for Hong Kong\u2019s market regulator the Securities and Futures Commission, meanwhile, declined to confirm whether the regulator has been, or will be, pursuing investigations into specific individuals or companies operating in the small-cap market. He said common features of the stocks that plunged included concentrated ownership among few investors, small floats and thin trading volume. He added that some of the companies involved own or have stakes in local brokerage firms.Some market participants said rumors of tighter regulation over the GEM market may have sparked its dive this week.\u201cThe story has been going around the HKEx is trying to force the delisting of some of these smaller caps,\u201d said       Hao Hong,        managing director and head of research at Bank of Communications.An HKEx spokesman said it had no plans to forcibly delist companies.Others said the sudden drop could have been exacerbated by the close links between the companies involved, with some being forced to sell their holdings in others as prices dropped.The selloff \u201cmay have been further accelerated by margin calls,\u201d said Pun Tit-Shan, chief executive at local brokerage Asia Wealth Securities.\u2014Joanne Chiu contributed to this articleWrite to Ese Erheriene at ese.erheriene@wsj.com and Gregor Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'In Hong Kong, Small-Cap Share Plunge Is Puzzling.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 22:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-stocks-suffer-enigmatic-plunge-as-major-anniversary-looms-1498650367", "news_title": "Hong Kong Stocks Suffer Enigmatic Plunge as Major Anniversary Looms", "keywords": "financial regulation,hk stocks,hong kong anniversary,hong kong exchange,hong kong financial center,hong kong market,penny stocks,regulation,AMCO United Holding,0630.HK,HK:0630,China Jicheng Holdings,Bank of Communications,3328.HK,601328.SH,GreaterChina Professional Services,HK:8193,David Webb, Hao Hong,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,energy commentary,routine market,financial news,refined product market commentary"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014When China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, the flourishing financial center seemed set to become a gateway for foreign investors to the then-largely closed mainland economy.Two decades on, Chinese influence over Hong Kong\u2019s markets, rather than foreign investors\u2019 clout in China, is far more striking.From the ever-rising activity of China\u2019s traders to the plethora of mainland companies listing on Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange, China looms over Hong Kong\u2019s markets in a way few expect to dissipate in the coming years.At the time of the handover, Beijing pledged to keep the former British colony as a largely independent entity for half a century. Less than halfway through that arrangement, Hong Kong\u2014still one of Asia\u2019s leading financial markets, despite the rise of mainland rivals such as Shanghai\u2014is increasingly being molded in China\u2019s image.\u201cThe influence of the mainland is ubiquitous,\u201d says       Paul Gruenwald,        Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global.One sign of China\u2019s importance to Hong Kong\u2019s markets is the shift in the largest constituents of the city\u2019s stock benchmark, the             Hang Seng                   Index. Back in 1997, the index\u2019s biggest companies were either conglomerates owned by local tycoons or traditional British colonial firms, such as banking giant         HSBC Holdings               PLC.\u2018The influence of the mainland is ubiquitous.\u2019Of the index\u2019s 10 biggest constituents by market capitalization then, only HSBC remains in its same form. Hutchison Whampoa and             Cheung Kong Holdings,       two companies 20 years ago, have since merged into         CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.      , which is in the top 10.Today, the Hang Seng is dominated by state-owned lenders such as         China Construction Bank Corp.      ,         Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.       and         Bank of China Ltd.      , which are also listed in Shanghai.Chinese technology and telecom companies are a big presence, too.         Tencent Holdings Ltd.      , the owner of China\u2019s largest social network, WeChat, holds the Hang Seng\u2019s largest weighting at 11%.It isn\u2019t just the market leaders that have changed. In 1997, mainland Chinese companies, including those incorporated offshore, made up less than 20% of Hong Kong\u2019s market capitalization, according to             Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.      , which operates the city\u2019s stock market.Today, that number has ballooned to north of 60% and looks set to rise, given the high level of new listings in Hong Kong accounted for by mainland companies. Some 92% of the total volume of initial public offerings in the city was from Chinese companies last year, according to Goldman Sachs, helping Hong Kong retain its mantle as the world\u2019s most-popular venue for listings for the second consecutive year.This trend has proved controversial. Companies from the mainland often have high investment from so-called cornerstone investors, who buy up large amounts of the company\u2019s stock ahead of the IPO, pledging to hold on to the shares for a few months. When state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China Co. raised $7.4 billion in its IPO in September, 80% of the shares were preordered by six other, mostly state-owned firms.The presence of cornerstone investors makes it easier for companies to launch their IPOs. But critics say such deals are diluting the quality of the Hong Kong market.\u201cHong Kong has essentially become a China growth derivative,\u201d says Kinger Lau, chief China strategist at Goldman Sachs.China is also changing the way Hong Kong stocks are traded.The advent of the Stock Connect trading links between Hong Kong and the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets on the mainland in recent years has allowed mainland investors to buy shares of Hong Kong-listed securities via the link. Foreigners, in turn, can buy shares in China more freely than before.While many predicted a rush of foreign money into Chinese stocks when the links were launched, so-called southbound trading, or money coming from mainland China, has become a vital source of inflows into Hong Kong.Trading volume measured by southbound net buying via the Shanghai Connect link made up almost 10% of Hong Kong\u2019s overall market in June, according to Jefferies, near its high since the program launched 2\u00bd years ago.In turn, mainland traders are influencing which sort of stocks outperform in Hong Kong, analysts say. Mainlanders often buy into big Chinese companies with listings in Hong Kong, such as state-owned banks.\u201cThe composition of Hong Kong\u2019s market is only becoming much more China-driven and China-exposed,\u201d says Ben Luk, global macro strategist at State Street Global Markets.Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 22:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/defying-expectations-china-looms-large-over-hong-kong-markets-1498702872", "news_title": "20 Years After Handover, China Looms Ever Larger Over Hong Kong Markets", "keywords": "china markets, hong kong handover, hong kong handover anniversary, hong kong markets,HSBC Holdings (HK Reg),HK:0005,China Construction Bank,CN:601939,Industrial & Commercial Bank of China,CN:601398,Bank of China,CN:601988,Tencent Holdings,HK:0700,CK Hutchison Holdings,HK:0001,Paul Gruenwald,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,capacity,facilities,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,facility closures"}, {"content": "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters union was incorrectly called the United Brotherhood of Teamsters in a Business News article Wednesday about United Parcel Service Inc.\u2019s plans to freeze pension plans for nonunion employees.Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cThe Last Judgment\u201d fresco adorns a wall in the Sistine Chapel.

Google has complied with the rule in Europe, but has resisted removing links from its search results world-wide.Japan\u2019s Supreme Court ruled in favor of Google earlier this year that individuals there couldn\u2019t force the company to remove search results.As Google has become the world\u2019s go-to source for information, the company has battled with privacy groups, regulators and government authorities over its search results. Google has argued its search results are determined by algorithms and are a matter of free speech, and it has resisted attempts to censor results.Google on Tuesday was fined a record $2.7 billion by the European Union\u2019s antitrust regulator for what it alleged was Google\u2019s use of its search engine to favor its own comparison-shopping service.Free-speech advocates criticized the Canadian decision, saying it could encourage censorship. \u201cOther countries may soon follow this example, in ways that more obviously force Google to become the world\u2019s censor,\u201d Dinah PoKempner, general counsel of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cIf every country tries to enforce its own idea of what is proper to put on the internet globally, we will soon have a race to the bottom where human rights will be the loser.\u201dWrite to Jack Nicas at jack.nicas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 20:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-must-remove-a-search-result-globally-canada-court-rules-1498697435", "news_title": "Google Must Remove a Search Result Globally, Canada Court Rules ", "keywords": "links,right to be forgotten,search engine,search results,website,Alphabet Inc.

The move together with the departure of a smaller insurer leaves 14 of the state\u2019s counties poised to have no insurer on its exchange.The state insurance marketplace, the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, said that insurers had filed to offer plans only in Clark, Washoe and Nye counties, leaving the remaining, largely rural region without any exchange options for 2018. Around 8,000 people living in the 14 potentially bare counties currently have exchange coverage. Anthem had offered marketplace plans throughout the state this year.In addition to Anthem, a smaller insurer, Prominence Health Plan, a unit of hospital company             Universal Health Services Inc.,       will leave the Nevada exchange next year; Prominence had been selling marketplace plans in seven counties, including four of those that are now poised to lack exchange insurers.Anthem\u2019s pullback in Nevada follows announcements that it will completely exit the ACA marketplaces in Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana.The 14 Nevada counties join an estimated 47 counties in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri that currently appear at risk of having no exchange insurers in 2018, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, after a series of withdrawal announcements. Still, the situation remains fluid, since other companies may come in to fill the gaps, as has happened in Tennessee and Washington state.Anthem\u2019s latest announcement comes as Senate Republicans are trying to push forward a health overhaul, and insurer exits and rate-increase proposals have become flashpoints in the debate over the bill. Republicans point to them as backing the need for their legislation, while Democrats say the insurers are reacting to the uncertainty created by Republicans\u2014including questions about the future of federal payments that help with health costs for low-income enrollees, which the Trump administration has threatened to stop.Nevada\u2019s situation may draw more of the spotlight because its Republican Sen.       Dean Heller       has said he opposes the Senate bill, which is now being reworked.Nevada Republican Gov.       Brian Sandoval       called the insurers\u2019 decisions \u201cdevastating and unfortunate.\u201d He said the state \u201cwill pursue all available options to help the individuals and families who will be hurt by this decision\u2026.Lack of coverage in rural Nevada will set back the years of work we have done to reduce the uninsured rate throughout our state.\u201dDavid K. Livingston, the chief executive of Prominence, said the insurer was exiting the exchanges in Nevada and Texas, the two states where it participated, because of the uncertainty around the future of the marketplaces, including the federal cost-sharing subsidy payments and enforcement of the current ACA mandate for individuals to have insurance. \u201cThere is not enough clarity on what direction it\u2019s going that would allow us to continue to operate,\u201d he said.Echoing comments it previously made around other withdrawals, Anthem said its Nevada decision came as the \u201cindividual market remains volatile.\u201d The company said that \u201cplanning and pricing for ACA-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance, including cost-sharing reduction subsidies.\u201d Anthem also said it was \u201cpleased that some steps have been taken to address the long-term challenges all health plans serving the Individual market are facing.\u201dAnthem is a major presence in its 14 state exchanges, with nearly 1.6 million people enrolled in its ACA plans, 1.1 million of those bought through the marketplaces. Overall, 302 counties in states including Georgia, Missouri and Ohio currently have only Anthem plans available in their marketplaces, according to the Kaiser foundation. So far, the insurer has filed 2018 ACA plans with regulators in other states, including Virginia, Maine and Connecticut. Anthem has said it is evaluating its ACA plans on a state-by-state basis.Nevada\u2019s exchange said it is drawing two new insurers next year,             Centene Corp.       and             Aetna Inc.,       both in Washoe County, which includes Reno, and also in Clark and Nye, which comprise one coverage region that includes Las Vegas.Outside of the marketplace, Nevada consumers trying to buy individual plans in the 14 at-risk counties will likely have just one choice: a bare-bones \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plan, which Anthem will sell off-exchange statewide next year, said Heather Korbulic, executive director of the Silver State exchange.Ms. Korbulic said state officials are exploring various possible solutions, including talking to insurers about filling the coverage gap. One option might be to apply for a federal waiver to alter some aspects of the ACA\u2019s typical rules, she said, something that officials in Iowa have done. \u201cThis creates a health-care crisis for rural Nevada,\u201d she said.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 20:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-pulling-back-on-offering-aca-plans-in-nevada-1498688376", "news_title": "Anthem Pulling Back on Offering ACA Plans in Nevada", "keywords": " affordable care act, nevada aca plans,obamacare,Anthem,ANTM,Universal Health Services,UHS,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,health,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,hospital care,financial services,health maintenance organizations,healthcare provision,private health insurance"}, {"content": "To federal prosecutors, the investors who put millions of dollars into       Martin Shkreli\u2019s       hedge fund\u2014and the board members of the pharmaceutical company he allegedly looted to conceal their losses\u2014were victims of fraud.To Mr. Shkreli\u2019s defense team, they were opportunists: \u201chigh-rollers\u201d and \u201cgamblers\u201d who bet on a \u201cboy genius\u201d to make them rich, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer,       Ben Brafman,        told jurors in opening statements Wednesday afternoon in Brooklyn federal court.\u201cMartin Shkreli never intended to defraud anyone, and no one in this case was defrauded,\u201d Mr. Brafman said during an opening statement to a jury of seven women and five men. \u201cYou may not like Martin Shkreli, and you may have reasons to hate Martin Shkreli, but that isn\u2019t enough to convict him.\u201dMr. Shkreli, 34 years old, is on trial facing charges of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud. Since becoming infamous two years ago, for dramatically jacking up the price of a drug used for AIDS patients, Mr. Shkreli has remained a lightning rod, accused of smirking in congressional hearings, harassing reporters and taunting his critics.His notoriety complicated efforts to find a jury for the trial, with dozens of prospective jurors dismissed for voicing negative opinions about Mr. Shkreli.But in court on Wednesday, it wasn\u2019t federal prosecutors who dwelled on Martin Shkreli\u2019s reputation: it was his own lawyer.\u201cDespite his flaws and dysfunctional personality, he is brilliant beyond words,\u201d Mr. Brafman said, imploring the jury to ignore the controversy Mr. Shkreli leaves in his wake and consider just the facts of the case.In the government\u2019s opening, Assistant U.S. Attorney       G. Karthik Srinivasan       outlined four interconnected frauds related to his management of two hedge funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, and a publicly traded pharmaceutical company,             Retrophin,       which he founded.Mr. Shkreli got people to give him their money \u201cby convincing them he was a Wall Street genius,\u201d Mr. Srinivasan said. \u201cIn reality, he was just a con man.\u201dWhen the hedge funds lost all their money, Mr. Srinivasan said, Mr. Shkreli \u201cdoubled down by engaging in an even bigger fraud,\u201d secretly using more than $10 million in stocks and cash from Retrophin \u201cto pay off his debts and conceal his lies.\u201dAnticipating Mr. Brafman\u2019s defense that all of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s investors were repaid, Mr. Srinivasan told the jury: \u201cThey got their money back only because the defendant stole from a public company that happened to be profitable.\u201dMr. Brafman described a number of the investors as savvy millionaires who wanted Mr. Shkreli to make them rich.

Staples shares rose 8.4% to close at $9.93 Wednesday after the Journal reported that an announcement was imminent. They edged up further after hours.The deal would be the biggest leveraged buyout this year, according to Dealogic. Private-equity deal activity has been restrained, in part because many companies have become expensive in the stock-market surge.But retailers of all stripes have been buffeted by shifting buying patterns as consumers increasingly shop online, and many of their shares have fallen as a result. The agreement values Staples at a deep discount to where the company traded just a few years ago\u2014and to its annual revenue, which was $18.2 billion in the fiscal year ended in January.Sycamore prevailed over other private firms in the auction for Staples, which also has a big business supplying corporate and government clients. The company\u2019s shares peaked at more than $25 a decade ago, before the financial crisis caused cash-strapped businesses to cut back on purchases of office essentials. By the time the economy recovered, online retailers were increasingly siphoning off Staples\u2019 sales. The digital transformation of workplaces, meanwhile, has dented the market for printer paper, filing cabinets and the like.After years of sales declines, the Framingham, Mass., company in 2015 mounted a roughly $6 billion bid to merge with rival             Office Depot Inc.,       but a federal judge scuttled the deal a year later over concerns it could raise the prices big companies pay for office essentials. The failure led to the ouster of Staples\u2019 then-Chief Executive       Ron Sargent,        who had run the company since 2002.Staples subsequently closed stores and sold operations in the U.K., Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Executives say they are redoubling efforts to improve performance in their home market. Staples has more 1,500 stores, according to a May investor presentation, down from nearly 2,300 five years ago.About two-thirds of the company\u2019s earnings comes from its relatively stable corporate and government business. That unit accounts for most of the company\u2019s online sales and tends to enjoy more predictable demand, though it still posted a 0.9% sales decline in the last fiscal year.That was still healthier than the retail unit, which reported a 7.1% revenue decline.Staples has previously had private-equity ownership. Bain Capital, an early backer of the company, took Staples public in 1989, making multiple times its investment.Sycamore often invests in struggling retail brands and its current portfolio includes department store Belk Inc., shoe seller Nine West and apparel chain The Limited, which it bought after the company filed for bankruptcy this year. It was also a major lender to teen retailer             A\u00e9ropostale Inc.,       which filed for bankruptcy last year.Barclays                   and             Morgan Stanley                   & Co.

Lawmakers said they hoped to hammer out a new version of the bill before leaving Washington on Friday, but some doubted they could overcome the intraparty rifts by then.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d said Sen.       Susan Collins       (R., Maine), one of nine Senate Republicans who publicly oppose the bill.Senators with concerns about the legislation traipsed in and out of Mr. McConnell\u2019s office, and GOP leaders worked to figure out whose concerns could be soothed by extra funds and whose would require more radical alterations to the bill.GOP Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, currently opposed to the bill, and the two Republican senators from Alaska,       Lisa Murkowski       and Dan Sullivan, were among those meeting with Mr. McConnell, but no deals to win them over emerged publicly.In a long and contentious closed-door luncheon Wednesday, roughly 15 to 20 GOP senators aired competing ideas over how to improve the bill, Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.) said after the session. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long ways to go,\u201d added Mr. Paul, another opponent of the bill.Lawmakers said much of the discussion centered on how to shore up the faltering individual market, where people buy insurance if they don\u2019t get it through work or safety-net programs. Conservatives have been pushing an idea backed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) that would allow insurers who offer at least one plan that meets ACA requirements to also offer a cheaper plan covering fewer benefits.\u201cThat would have the effect of significantly reducing premiums and enabling people to purchase health insurance they can afford,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Supporters of Mr. Cruz\u2019s plan say people who don\u2019t need a specific benefit shouldn\u2019t have to buy it\u2014for example, men should not be required to buy policies that include maternity services.Others dismissed such arguments, saying men are involved in pregnancy also. \u201cWomen don\u2019t get pregnant without sperm,\u201d Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.) said drily.The Cruz plan, critics added, would encourage healthier, younger people to buy the skinnier plans, driving up premiums for sicker and older consumers.Conservatives are also pressing to allow higher contributions to health savings accounts, and possibly remove the requirement that HSAs can only be used by employees with high-deductible plans, people familiar with the talks said.Centrist Republicans, meanwhile, want changes in the bill\u2019s phase-out of higher federal support for the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, which the current bill would start reducing in 2021 and fully eliminate by 2024. Centrists also want to change a provision that lowers the growth rate for Medicaid spending in 2025. Such a shift could ease concerns about passing those costs to states.But in a sign of the challenges facing Mr. McConnell, such a change would also create new problems among conservatives. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very important that we keep the growth-rate provisions that we have, because it\u2019s the only way to make this program sustainable,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said this week.Some lawmakers also are pushing for higher per-capita limits on Medicaid payments for beneficiaries who are elderly or disabled, according to people familiar with the talks.Republicans hope to resolve these policy disputes by Friday, giving the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office time to evaluate a new version\u2019s cost and coverage by the time lawmakers return the week of July 10.Because no Democrats are expected to support the GOP health-care bill, Mr. McConnell can lose no more than two GOP votes, even with Vice President       Mike Pence       as a potential tiebreaker. Mr. McConnell has told Republicans that if they can\u2019t pass the bill, they will have to work with Democrats to take steps to stabilize the individual market.Democrats said the delay shows that Republicans should work with them to fix the ACA, rather than dismantling it. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) suggested that GOP President       Donald Trump       invite all 100 senators to discuss health care at Blair House, a government residence where former President       Barack Obama       hosted a health-care summit in 2010.Mr. Schumer said: \u201cLet\u2019s abandon more tax breaks for the rich, let\u2019s abandon cuts to Medicaid, and discuss what the American people are really concerned about\u2014premiums, deductibles, the costs and quality of health care.\u201dAs the congressional recess approaches, health industry organizations, patient advocacy groups and political groups on both sides are gearing up to intensify pressure on lawmakers.The American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, AARP and other organizations plan to pressure centrist Republicans, especially those who represent states where rolling back the Medicaid expansion could endanger coverage. Their goal is to persuade more centrists to oppose the bill, and to ensure that those already opposed don\u2019t change their minds.\u201cIf it\u2019s possible, we are going to ramp up even more over the next week,\u201d said Mike Munger, president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians.FreedomWorks, a conservative group, is pushing for changes like more deregulation of insurance companies. \u201cWe want to get this bill to a place where we can say it\u2019s an improvement over Obamacare,and we\u2019re slowly getting there,\u201c said Jason Pye, FreedomWorks\u2019 director of public policy. \u201dThat means incorporating amendments that would give Americans more choice and bring costs down.\"\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com, Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com and Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Senate GOP Scrambles To Win Over Opponents.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 19:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-republicans-scramble-to-rework-health-bill-1498693958", "news_title": "Senate Republicans Scramble to Rework Health Bill ", "keywords": "affordable care act,chuck schumer,donald trump,health bill,mitch mcconnell,obamacare,republicans,senate,Bill Cassidy,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Big U.S. banks plan to increase dividend payouts and share buybacks to their highest levels in years after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved capital plans for all 34 firms taking part in its annual stress tests.The approvals\u2014the first time since the annual tests began in 2011 that all firms got passing grades\u2014reflect a turning point for big financial institutions that have been shackled by tighter regulation since the financial crisis. They could also herald a return to precrisis days when banks were reliable dividend payers and shareholders flocked to them.Bank of America Corp., for example, said that it would increase its dividend by 60% to 12 cents a share per quarter, putting it above a threshold where             Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.        BRK.B 0.52%       may convert a stake in the firm into common stock and become the bank\u2019s largest shareholder. The second-biggest U.S. bank by assets also said it received approval to repurchase up to $12.9 billion of its shares, far above the $7.7 billion it bought back over the previous year.On average, the group of firms taking part in the stress tests requested payouts that are near 100% of their expected earnings over the next year, up from 65% last year, senior Fed officials said. That means banks in some cases will be able to start whittling away at capital buffers that many bank executives say are well in excess of what is needed to absorb potential losses.Such moves signal an easing of the Fed\u2019s hardline stance toward banks since the crisis and could provide a durable pillar of support for higher bank stock prices. Those soared following President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election but largely have treaded water so far in 2017 amid lackluster economic indicators, political defeats for the White House and a flattening yield curve that threatens to weigh on bank profits.The KBW Nasdaq Bank index is up 2.8% year to date versus an 8.9% gain for the S&P 500. That said, bank stocks are still well ahead of the broader market when measured from November\u2019s election. Big-bank shares rose in many cases more than 1% in after-hours trading Wednesday, while some, like             Citigroup Inc.,       were up more than 2%.The payouts announced by banks following the tests\u2019 release Wednesday were in many cases above what investors had expected.Citigroup, for instance, said it planned to return $18.9 billion to shareholders over the coming four quarters. That is equal to 132% of what Wall Street analysts expect the bank to earn over the same period. Analysts had expected the bank\u2019s payout ratio would be around 110%.Morgan Stanley                   and Alabama-based             Regions Financial Corp.       were also among those that were approved for payout ratios in excess of 100%, according to FactSet estimates and Wall Street Journal reviews of corporate filings.\u201cThe absolute minimum is there won\u2019t be increased capital in these businesses,\u201d Morgan Stanley Chief Executive       James Gorman       said earlier this month. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be and there won\u2019t be.\u201dMorgan Stanley,             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       and             State Street Corp.       cleared one of the Fed\u2019s yardsticks by just tenths of a percentage point, suggesting they have gotten more adept at figuring out how to squeak through the tests.The latest result was the second part of the Fed\u2019s test results. In the first leg, released last week, the Fed said all big U.S. banks were able to survive a hypothetical recession.Fed governor       Jerome Powell       said the stress-test process, now in its seventh year, \u201chas motivated all of the largest banks to achieve healthy capital levels.\u201dBorn of the financial meltdown, the stress tests have come to command bankers\u2019 and investors\u2019 attention each year. Executives manage with the tests in mind and have collectively spent billions of dollars to develop risk-management systems to meet the Fed\u2019s expectations.This year\u2019s passing grades suggest that those efforts have paid off. Banks today are better capitalized and more conservatively managed than in the years before the financial crisis and have better insight into risks lurking in their own books.J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co., the nation\u2019s biggest bank by assets, was approved for a 12% increase to its dividend and a $19.4 billion buyback program. CEO       James Dimon       said the bank was \u201cpleased to further increase capital returns to our shareholders while continuing to invest in our businesses.\u201dIn a nod to progress at banks, the Fed has made changes to the exams. This year, only 13 of the biggest, most complex banks faced a qualitative exam of their risk-management abilities. Others, such as the U.S. arm of Spain\u2019s             Banco Santander SA,had to pass only a numerical assessment.The results had some banks breathing sighs of relief. At Santander, the U.S. chief executive said he planned to hold a champagne toast in the boardroom after the Fed approved its capital plan. The bank had failed the tests the previous three years.Wells Fargo                   & Co.\u2019s approval, too, is a sorely needed win for the bank, which has been in the spotlight for months over a sales-practices scandal. Some analysts had predicted that the Fed might flunk Wells Fargo on \u201cqualitative\u201d grounds even if it passed the numerical part of the exam.Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer       John Shrewsberry       said this spring that the bank was \u201cvery self-aware\u201d of that risk and that it had \u201csized our [capital-return] ask appropriately.\u201dThe Fed said the largest and most complex firms, however, still have work to do in maintaining accurate data and identifying risks in new products.One spot hit hard this year was credit cards. Credit-card defaults are rising after years in record-low territory and were a chief focus of Fed officials who designed this year\u2019s tests. Last week\u2019s results forecast $100 billion of credit-card losses in a severe downturn across the industry.Two of the largest standalone card issuers,             Capital One Financial Corp.       and             American Express Co.      , revised their payout requests downward after receiving the results of the stress test\u2019s first part last week.The Fed approved Capital One\u2019s plan, but only contingent on the firm resubmitting it within six months to address what the regulator called \u201cmaterial weaknesses.\u201dThe bank is \u201cfully committed to addressing the Federal Reserve\u2019s concerns with our capital planning process in a timely manner.\u201d       Richard Fairbank,        Capital One chief executive, said in a statement.Some executives still say the Fed\u2019s process is overly opaque and stringent and have complained that the higher capital required by them has choked lending and harmed the economy.The Trump administration has been sympathetic to bankers\u2019 complaints and recently recommended changes to the tests.\u2014Christina Rexrode contributed to this article.Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com and Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Banks Boost Payouts After Passing Tests.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 19:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-stress-tests-all-banks-cleared-on-payouts-to-shareholders-1498681800", "news_title": "Fed \u2018Stress Tests\u2019 Clear All Banks to Issue Payouts to Shareholders", "keywords": "Berkshire Hathaway,BRKA,J.P.

But Caracas residents have been glued to social media since Tuesday, looking for any clues that would explain the bizarre events of that night.Mr. P\u00e9rez had suddenly become the country\u2019s most-wanted man. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered the National Guard to deploy around the Supreme Court building and other sensitive sites. In a late-night televised address to the nation, he called the flight a \u201cterror attack\u201d aimed at destabilizing the government. \u201cThe person who took that aircraft launched a coup and took up arms against the republic,\u201d Mr. Maduro said.No one was killed or injured in the incident that capped a dramatic day in Venezuela, in which Mr. Maduro threatened civil war, congress was overrun by national guards, and Attorney General Luisa Ortega, who has become a fierce critic of Mr. Maduro, was shorn of more of her powers. On Wednesday she was barred from leaving the country and had her bank account frozen.The president\u2019s fiery speech and rapid military response only fueled suspicions among his opponents and ordinary Venezuelans that Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s flight was no act of resistance, but rather a stunt staged by the unpopular government to justify further consolidating its authority.\u201cWhat happened doesn\u2019t make much sense,\u201d said Luis Manuel Esculpi, a retired lawmaker and defense expert who said he was puzzled by how a rogue helicopter could fly over the nation\u2019s capital without setting off its air-defense system.Efforts to reach Mr. P\u00e9rez for comment were unsuccessful.Shortly before taking off on Tuesday evening from a military air base in the capital, Mr. P\u00e9rez announced a rebellion against Mr. Maduro\u2019s \u201ctyranny\u201d in a series of videos published on his social-media account.\u201cThis fight is against the hunger, against lack of health care,\u201d he said, as four men with balaclavas and automatic weapons stood behind him. \u201cWe have to reconnect with our armed forces so that together we can recover our Venezuela.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the first time Mr. P\u00e9rez fixed his penetrating blue eyes on an audience to deliver a dramatic speech. In 2015 he starred in a Venezuelan action movie, \u201cSuspended Death,\u201d in which he pilots police helicopters, jumps out with a parachute and shoots down Colombian gangsters.Mr. P\u00e9rez trained for two weeks as an actor before starring in the movie, said the film\u2019s director, Oscar Rivas. He said the two became friends in recent years as Mr. P\u00e9rez looked to make short films showcasing the professionalism of the country\u2019s police, which most Venezuelans revile for corruption and indifference to rampant crime.\u201cHe\u2019s a pilot, he dives, he\u2019s very talented. He is splendid,\u201d Mr. Rivas said.Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s Instagram profile brings to mind spoofs like \u201cZoolander\u201d or the latest hit from Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, mixing photos of daring action exploits with amateur modeling poses. In some 900 photos and videos posted, Mr. P\u00e9rez is often featured in fatigues and holding a rifle posing next to the logo of his employer, CICPC, Venezuela\u2019s FBI.In one post he fires a handgun over his shoulder at a mannequin behind him, aiming with a hand-held mirror. In another he is scuba diving and testing a gun underwater. One features him skydiving with a German shepherd strapped to him.The government said Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s plot this week was a real one, hatched by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency with the help of retired Gen. Miguel Rodr\u00edguez Torres, a former top ruling-party official who broke with Mr. Maduro earlier this year. Officials didn\u2019t provide any evidence. The U.S. government has called Mr. Maduro\u2019s frequent assertions of American involvement in antigovernment plots absurd and false.Gen. Rodr\u00edguez Torres dismissed the attack as \u201ca stupid montage.\u201d They \u201cattack with grenades, and none explode; attack with bullets and no one is injured,\u201d he wrote in a text message in response to questions.Gen. Rodr\u00edguez Torres, who headed Venezuela\u2019s intelligence agency for 12 years, also questioned how a hostile helicopter could buzz around the city freely without encountering any resistance for more than half an hour. He said the Venezuelan military\u2019s Sukhoi jets frequently patrol over the capital and that helicopters are permanently on duty to respond within minutes to any attack.Mr. Maduro and his predecessor spent billions of dollars on Russian jet fighters and antiaircraft missiles. \u201cNo one will be able to touch a centimeter of our fatherland,\u201d Mr. Maduro said in 2013 after installing the latest-generation Russian air-defense system. Just hours before Tuesday\u2019s incident, jet fighters flew over the capital in preparation for a military parade planned for next month.Many Venezuelans are also wondering how Mr. P\u00e9rez could remain at large after apparently landing on a residential apartment building in daylight. The country\u2019s vice president said on Wednesday afternoon that the missing helicopter had been found in the jungle about 20 miles east of Caracas.Members of Venezuela\u2019s opposition have publicly played down the incident, saying they need to know more before commenting. In private, opposition leaders say they fear Mr. Maduro will use the alleged chopper attack to further crack down on dissent. More than 80 people have died in the last three months in clashes between protesters and security forces.Hours before Mr. P\u00e9rez took off from the air base, soldiers carried boxes of unidentified equipment into the opposition-controlled congress, an action that engendered clashes with lawmakers. Congressmen say the move was a prelude to\u00a0a government takeover of the building ahead of Mr. Maduro\u2019s plan to rewrite the constitution in August.Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s alleged hijacking came as the government-controlled court published a decision granting investigative powers to the human-rights ombudsman, a close ally of the president. That usurps the powers of the attorney general, Ms. Ortega, who said she would ignore the ruling. \u201cThis is state terrorism,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThese decisions don\u2019t have force because they aren\u2019t based on the constitution.\u201d The court subsequently barred her from leaving the country and froze her bank account.The decision to hand Ms. Ortega\u2019s powers to the ombudsman could also compromise about 800 cases the prosecutors have pending against police and military officials accused of human-rights abuses during three months of protests by making sensitive evidence available to the presidential ally, said Nizar El Fakih, a lawyer and head of legal watchdog group Proiuris.\u201cThat thesis that the government is using smokescreens I feel could be applied almost everyday,\u201d Mr. El Fakih said.\u2014Mayela Armas contributed to this article.Write to Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.com and Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Helicopter Mystery Confounds Venezuelans.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 19:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chopper-flight-leaves-venezuelans-mystified-1498673746", "news_title": "Chopper Flight Leaves Venezuelans Mystified", "keywords": " venezuela dissidents, venezuela military, venezuela opposition,venezuela politics,political,general news,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,hijacking,piracy,movies,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Easy money unleashed by global central banks is receding, a development that could test a range of assets\u2014from stocks to real estate\u2014that have become tightly linked to monetary support since the global financial crisis.Top European Central Bank officials left investors with mixed impressions over the past two days about when the ECB would reel in its \u20ac2.3 trillion ($2.6 trillion) bond-buying program, and the chiefs of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada both suggested they\u2019d be reducing stimulus.The euro plunged against the dollar on Wednesday, then recovered. The pound and the Canadian dollar leapt. Yields on U.K. government bonds shot up. Yields on Treasurys and other bonds also moved higher.When and how much Western central banks pull back from their unprecedented run of ultralow interest rates and large-scale asset purchase programs, known as quantitative easing, are the foremost questions for global investors.The prospect of an end to stimulus has lurked in the background for months but has zoomed to the fore now that signs of an economic recovery are beginning to appear in regions, especially Europe, that have struggled to shake off the aftereffects of the global financial crisis.An end to the ECB\u2019s bond buying \u201cis probably the most important supply-demand change that we can foresee in bond markets,\u201d said Tim Haywood, investment director for fixed income at Swiss money manager GAM.Global bond markets have been strongly interconnected, and U.S. government bonds closely tracked moves in Europe on Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.223%. Higher yields on European government bonds make U.S. government bonds less attractive to overseas investors, who have been buying up Treasurys in search of better returns than what they can get at home.Investors had been selling government bonds and buying the euro since Tuesday, when ECB President       Mario Draghi\u2019s       comments, delivered at an ECB conference in Sintra, Portugal, on a \u201cstrengthening and broadening\u201d economic recovery were interpreted as a sign the central bank was preparing to trim its massive bond buying.But those moves briefly reversed on Wednesday. In an interview on CNBC,       V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio,        the ECB\u2019s vice president, suggested investors might have overreacted to Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments. An ECB spokesman declined to comment. The euro, which had neared $1.14 earlier in the day, dropped below $1.13.Then Mr. Draghi, speaking again at the ECB conference, repeated his positive outlook for the eurozone economy. By the early evening in London, the euro was at $1.1375, up 0.3% on the day.\u201cCentral banks are stumbling here and losing a bit of credibility with mixed communications, whether that\u2019s in Europe or the U.K.,\u201d said Jon Jonsson, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman.Bank of Canada Gov.       Stephen Poloz       joined the fray Wednesday, noting in a television interview in Portugal that excess slack in the Canadian economy is being absorbed \u201csteadily\u201d at the current pace of growth, a comment investors took as evidence the Canadian central bank could raise short-term interest rates as early as next month.Together, the policy makers\u2019 comments highlight a readiness to start moving away from the extraordinary measures\u2014including interest rates pushed to zero and below and large-scale asset-buying programs\u2014employed since the crisis to revive their battered economies.At the same time, many central bankers face a policy dilemma. Falling unemployment normally justifies higher interest rates to prevent their economies and asset prices from overheating, but still-muted inflation calls for continued stimulus measures to ensure it doesn\u2019t drift lower.Officials at the Fed, the ECB and BOE are actively debating whether they might be withdrawing support too soon, or too late.A range of factors are suggesting a shift away from easy money may be in the offing. As financial crises recede and economic growth proceeds steadily, central bankers see slack in their economies disappearing. That raises the potential for inflation to pick up after running below their targets for several recent years.The World Bank earlier this month forecast global growth to hit 2.9% next year, which would be its fastest pace in nearly seven years, up from 2.7% this year.Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks follow a run of strong eurozone economic data this year. Growth has firmed, unemployment has fallen, and business and consumer confidence is at highs not seen since before the financial crisis. Lending to households in the eurozone grew at a faster pace in May while lending to firms held steady, the ECB reported Wednesday.Mr. Poloz said Canada\u2019s growth would proceed at a \u201cmore normal pace but still above potential. That\u2019s the important thing. That means that we\u2019re absorbing excess capacity that was built up in the wake of the crisis and then built up again in the wake of the oil shock two years ago.\u201dThis is the Fed\u2019s calculation, too. With the U.S. jobless rate down to 4.3%, the Fed is expected to raise short-term rates one more time this year and start shrinking its bond portfolio.Some government officials in Europe are growing concerned about the side effects of years of easy money. In Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, senior officials have complained for years that low interest rates harm savers and pensioners. The nation\u2019s central bank has warned that house prices may be overvalued by as much as 30%.Jens Weidmann,        who sits on the ECB\u2019s governing council as head of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, has pressed the ECB to consider changing course. Central banks shouldn\u2019t allow themselves to be taken hostage by governments or the markets, Mr. Weidmann said in an interview published Tuesday on the Bundesbank\u2019s website.Not all central banks are ready to shift toward tighter policy. Bank of Japan officials have emphasized that, with inflation still far below its 2% target, they will stick with its current mix of stimulus efforts, including negative interest rates and asset purchases. BOJ Gov.       Haruhiko Kuroda       touched on the issues raised by a shift in policy at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council in Tokyo in May, but he insists the bank hasn\u2019t reached the stage of talking about an exit strategy.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com, Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 19:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/signals-on-stimulus-roil-global-markets-1498691765", "news_title": "Signals on Stimulus Roil Global Markets", "keywords": "central banks,european markets,europe banks,federal reserve, federal reserve, interest rates,the fed,Bank of Canada,European Central Bank,U.K. government,euro zone,currency,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt"}, {"content": "Two Metropolitan Transportation Authority workers supervising repairs to an area of track in Harlem where a subway train derailed on Tuesday have been suspended without pay.The supervisors were overseeing the installation of a new piece of rail on tracks north of the 125th Street station during the overnight shift that ended Tuesday morning, an MTA spokeswoman said.Around 9:40 a.m., two cars on a southbound A train approaching the station jumped the tracks and struck a concrete wall, causing minor injuries to 39 passengers.The MTA suspended the supervisors Wednesday pending a formal review process and an internal investigation. The state\u2019s Public Transportation Safety Board also has launched a probe.Paul Navarro,        chairman of the track division of the Transport Workers Union Local 100, said that replacement rail comes in 39-foot pieces. During repairs like the one in Harlem workers cut the rail to size. In this instance, he said workers left behind a 13-foot piece of rail that should have been secured to the track bed to be picked up later.Beth       DeFalco,        an MTA spokeswoman, couldn\u2019t confirm whether it was that piece of rail or another \u201cspare\u201d part of track that caused the derailment. She said track in the area of the derailment was replaced the night before the incident and that a piece of rail stored in the track bed caused the accident.The rail shouldn\u2019t have been in the track bed and it hadn\u2019t been secured, she said.\u201cThere are proper protocols to ensure equipment is fastened and cannot shake loose and that equipment that is too small to be safely stored is never stored in between tracks,\u201d Ms. DeFalco said. \u201cThose protocols were not followed, according to our preliminary investigation.\u201dMike Carrube,        leader of the union that represents subway supervisors, said the MTA was \u201ctoo quick to point the finger\u201d at his members before an investigation has been completed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what really transpired,\u201d said Mr. Carrube, president of the Subway Surface Supervisors Association. \u201cWas it a vibration that caused the rail to jump up under the train? Was it something hanging under the train that lifted the rail up causing the derailment?\u201dThe derailment comes at a time of rising frustration among subway riders because of increasing delays and disruption caused, in part, by decades-old equipment and infrastructure that is struggling to cope with rising demand.About 5.7 million people rode the subway on an average weekday in 2016, up from 5.2 million in 2011.Rider advocacy groups have raised concerns about safety too. At the beginning of June, a video went viral of passengers trying to pry their way out of a stalled F train after being stuck without lights or air conditioning for 40 minutes.Following Tuesday\u2019s derailment, MTA officials sought to allay concerns, saying that subway workers would inspect \u201cevery inch of rail to ensure that each and every replacement part is properly stored and secured.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-28 19:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mta-suspends-supervisors-in-nyc-subway-derailment-1498691651", "news_title": "MTA Suspends Supervisors in NYC Subway Derailment ", "keywords": "mta,nyc subway derailment,train derailment,political,general news,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,transport accidents,transport,urban,commuter transit,urban mass transit systems,road,rail transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Blue Apron Holdings Inc. stumbled in its initial public offering, a warning to companies seeking to live up to their private valuations in the public markets.The meal-kit maker sold its shares for $10 apiece in its IPO, according to people familiar with the offering, valuing the company at about $1.9 billion. Blue Apron was valued at $2 billion in a 2015 private fundraising round by investors such as Fidelity Investments.The outcome is far from what Blue Apron anticipated when the company launched its cross-country pitch to investors. Blue Apron sought to sell shares between $15 and $17 apiece, which would have valued the company at $3 billion at the midpoint of the range. However, the startup struggled to find buyers at those prices. Investors who considered the IPO expressed concern about Blue Apron\u2019s marketing costs and customer turnover, according to fund managers and analysts.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see what the bull case is,\u201d said       Sean Stiefel,        portfolio manager at Navy Capital LLC who didn\u2019t invest in Blue Apron\u2019s IPO. Mr. Stiefel\u2019s firm participated in recent IPOs by             Snap                  chat parent Snap Inc. and enterprise software companies Appian Inc. and             Okta Inc.Earlier Wednesday, Blue Apron lowered its expected price range to $10 to $11 a share in a regulatory filing. Such a cut is fairly uncommon: Since the start of 2012, 10% of U.S.-listed IPOs have lowered their ranges, by 34% on average, according to data provider Dealogic.Blue Apron raised $300 million by selling 30 million shares at $10 apiece, less than the $480 million the company and its underwriters had expected at the midpoint of its earlier target price range.Some investors looking at the IPO said they were worried about Blue Apron\u2019s profitability. The company\u2019s revenue has been increasing, but it has posted net losses each year since its inception in 2012, and those losses have been rising. Marketing costs as a percentage of revenue have also climbed in recent years. In the first quarter, marketing costs rose to 25% of revenue, up from 15% a year earlier.Blue Apron\u2019s disclosures show its cash on hand is shrinking. It tapped Fidelity for $64 million of additional financing in May at its 2015 share price, an unusual move so close to an IPO.Peter Lee,        a data scientist at Triton Research LLC, which analyzes pre-IPO companies, said Blue Apron would likely impress some investors with its consistent revenue growth, but it was unclear how it would transform into a company with strong profit margins given the complexity of food distribution and lack of customer loyalty.Daniel McCarthy,        a professor of marketing at Emory University, analyzed Blue Apron\u2019s numbers and estimated that roughly 60% of customers stop using the service after six months.Mr. Stiefel said his concerns about Blue Apron deepened after             Amazon.com Inc.       said this month that it would acquire             Whole Foods Market Inc.Amazon\u2019s announcement came days before Blue Apron launched its roadshow to pitch its stock offering to investors. The deal shook shares of grocers and raised the prospect of heightened competition in the online food-delivery market. While startups like Blue Apron were among the first to offer meal-kit services on a subscription basis, conventional grocery stores are launching their own versions to try to keep market share.Kroger Co.       last month launched a series of meal kits at the supermarket chain\u2019s Cincinnati stores.While Blue Apron is smaller than other high-profile private companies Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., it is one of the first well-known startups to test the market since Snap went public in March.Shares of Snap, the biggest U.S.-listed IPO in years, soared in their first day of trading, but have fallen toward their offer price in recent weeks. As of Wednesday\u2019s close, Snap shares were trading 76 cents above their $17 IPO price.Any IPO hiccup could act as a deterrent to still-private companies, some analysts say.There are dozens of consumer-focused private companies like Blue Apron\u2014often with little connection to the tech sector beyond selling their products online\u2014that are valued at $1 billion or more in the private market.Overall, the market for IPOs this year has been relatively robust after a rough 2016.U.S.-listed IPOs have raised about $27 billion this year, dwarfing the $8.1 billion raised by IPOs at this point last year, according to Dealogic data through Tuesday. Technology companies have raised $5.9 billion in 2017, compared with just under $900 million at this point last year.This year\u2019s class of IPOs have performed well after their stock-market debuts, too. Shares of companies that went public in 2017 are up roughly 11% from their IPO prices through Tuesday\u2019s close, and tech IPOs are up about 25% in that period, Dealogic data show. That outpaces the S&P 500\u2019s 8.1% gain in 2017 through Tuesday\u2019s close.Even though Blue Apron\u2019s shares priced poorly, its stock could still perform well when it starts trading. Hotel-search company             Trivago                   NV priced its IPO below its projected range at $11 apiece in December. Its stock climbed in its first day of trading and closed at $20.96 on Wednesday.Blue Apron is set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol APRN on Thursday.             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       is leading the deal.\u2014Maureen Farrell and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com and Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Blue Apron Serves Up Undercooked Offering.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 19:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blue-apron-prices-ipo-at-10-a-share-1498688019", "news_title": "Blue Apron Serves Up an Insipid Offering", "keywords": "blue apron,ipo,price per share,pricing,vc ipo,Blue Apron Holdings,Fidelity Investments,Airbnb,Amazon.com,AMZN,Snap,SNAP,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Kroger,KR,Okta,OKTA,trivago,TRVG,Uber Technologies,Whole Foods Market,WFM,Appian,Daniel McCarthy,Peter Lee,Sean Stiefel,corporate changes,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,financial investments,e-commerce,financial services,internet,online,investing,securities,technology"}, {"content": "President Trump is finally filling out the National Labor Relations Board, and not a moment too soon. Repudiating the Obama NLRB\u2019s radical rulings will take time, but Congress could lend a hand.Last week Mr. Trump nominated       Marvin Kaplan,        counsel at the Occupational Safe and Health Review Commission, to one of two vacancies on the board. And this week the President rounded out the five-member board by naming       William Emanuel,        an employment lawyer at Littler Mendelson who helped challenge the Obama NLRB ruling that bars class-action waivers in arbitration agreements. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the board\u2019s theory, and the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case.Both are well-qualified attorneys who will hew to statutory or case law. They are unlikely to get rolled by union-friendly staff who have sometimes been more knowledgable and influential than the board\u2019s GOP members.The nominations will give Republicans their first board majority in a decade, and there\u2019s little time to waste. Some 360 cases are pending before the board, many of which present opportunities to correct recent board rulings that depart from longstanding precedent. The Coalition for a Democratic Workplace last year estimated that the Obama NLRB overturned 4,559 years of established law.One example is the 2015 Browning-Ferris decision, which created a new \u201cindirect influence\u201d joint-employer standard that has upended contractual relationships as well as the franchise business model. The ruling, which nullified three decades of board and judicial precedent, allows unions to drag companies into labor disputes with subcontractors and franchisees.Also pivotal is the 2011 Specialty Healthcare decision that let unions form micro-bargaining units within a \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d that shares job classifications, functions and skills, among other commonalities. This lets unions use a divide-and-conquer strategy to organize workplaces.Last year the board melded Browning-Ferris and Specialty Healthcare by ruling that employer consent isn\u2019t needed for bargaining units that combine jointly employed and solely employed workers. Other Obama NLRB departures include letting university teaching assistants unionize and letting workers defame their company on social media and keep their jobs.Don\u2019t forget how the Obama NLRB rigged union election rules to deny employers due process. One change restricted employers\u2019 ability to dispute the eligibility of workers in a bargaining unit before an election. And an expedited election schedule limits employers\u2019 opportunity to present their case to employees. While employers can contest the board\u2019s decisions in court, President Obama packed the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with liberal judges who are inclined to defer to the board\u2019s judgment under the Chevron standard.This is why it\u2019s important for the GOP Congress to clarify ambiguities in the National Labor Relations Act that unions have exploited to give themselves organizing advantages that Congress never intended. For starters, Congress could codify the direct control joint-employer standard as well as union election procedures that protect employer and worker rights.Legislation would protect the Trump NLRB\u2019s decisions against legal challenges from the left while hemming in future Democratic majorities.

The outcome of this debate will define what the Republican Party stands for\u2014and whether the problems of America\u2019s entitlement state can ever be solved.The biggest policy divide concerns the future of Medicaid, and here the problem is the moderates who are acting like liberals. Despite their campaign rhetoric, some Senators now want to ratify ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion as an unrepealable and unreformable welfare program.Most of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance coverage gains have come from opening Medicaid eligibility beyond its original goal of helping the poor and disabled to include prime-age, able-bodied adults. The federal-state program has become the world\u2019s single largest insurer by enrollment, covering more people than Medicare or the British National Health Service. Total spending grew 18% in 2015 and 17% in 2016 in the 29 states that expanded, and the nearby chart shows the growth of overall federal Medicaid spending under current law and without reform.The Senate bill attempts to arrest this unsustainable surge by moving to per capita spending caps from an open-ended entitlement. When states spend more now, they generate an automatic payment from the feds. The goal is to contain costs and give Governors the incentive and flexibility to manage their programs.Meanwhile, four long years from now, the bill would start to phase-down the state payment formula for old and new Medicaid beneficiaries to equal rates. Governors ought to prioritize the most urgent needs.This would be the largest entitlement reform ever while still protecting the most vulnerable. The bill is carefully designed to avoid overreach and would save taxpayers $772 billion compared with what Medicaid would otherwise spend under current law, according to the Congressional Budget Office. This does not \u201ccut\u201d spending; it merely slows the rate of increase.This has nonetheless made some Senators nervous, like West Virginia\u2019s       Shelley Moore Capito       and Ohio\u2019s       Rob Portman.       The growth rate for the block grants would be set at the rate of medical inflation for most beneficiaries at the start and then fall to the consumer price index in 2026, which is more ambitious than the House bill. Some Senators would like to see more generous growth rates, while others favor waiting six or seven years, rather than four, to start the phase-down of the expansion.The danger is that both approaches could dilute reform to the point where it\u2019s not worth the political trouble and wouldn\u2019t improve the federal fisc. Postponing change until after 2020 means waiting a political eternity, and a formula that on paper says the government will cut spending in the future is already uncertain enough fiscal discipline. It certainly doesn\u2019t qualify as cruel, barbaric, or any of the other adjectives the bill\u2019s critics are abusing.More to the political point, Republicans run in every election on cutting federal spending and a smaller, more efficient government. Well, here\u2019s their best chance in a generation, and eventually Republicans will have to follow the money.Some 65% of the federal budget is mandatory spending, meaning Social Security and the health-care entitlements. Interest on the debt is 6% and more than half of the discretionary budget flows to defense. The GOP can\u2019t meaningfully reform government or increase defense spending without fixing Medicaid and replacing ObamaCare.The alternative will be much higher levels of taxation across society, reaching deep into the middle class, or a debt crisis. \u201cTo avoid fiscal and economic calamity,\u201d as one GOP Senator wrote in a 2014 op-ed on these pages, Washington must \u201creform Social Security and health entitlements. The CBO estimates that a deal saving $4 trillion over the decade would put the budget on a path to sustainability. . . . The longer we wait to enact reforms, the more abrupt and painful they will be. It is time for everyone to come together and start to erase the red ink.\u201dThat Senator was Mr. Portman, a former White House budget director and member of the \u201csuper committee\u201d of 2011 that tried to negotiate entitlement reform with       Barack Obama.       The Senate bill doesn\u2019t save close to $4 trillion but you\u2019ve got to start somewhere.Someone should also ask the Governors like       John Kasich       who are predicting doom a substantive policy question or two. Some 43% of the Ohio all-funds budget goes to Medicaid compared to a mere 14% for K-12 education. The average state all-funds Medicaid share is 28%. Does Mr. Kasich think this is the correct fiscal priority for America\u2019s future\u2014skimp on educating the next generation to finance free health care for able-bodied adults?If Republicans fail to pass a bill or weaken the Senate bill so much that it won\u2019t make a difference, the result will be a calamity of a different kind. GOP Governors who declined to join ObamaCare\u2019s new Medicaid will conclude that the expansion is permanent and the political pressure will rise to take the federal bribe. Medicaid costs will soar, and national Republicans will show that they\u2019re incapable of doing what voters sent them to Washington to do.Democrats will conclude that Medicaid is politically untouchable and thus a wedge for single payer. They\u2019ll enlarge eligibility to ever-higher income levels and gradually crowd out private insurance. Republicans won\u2019t have a plausible argument against the idea if they can\u2019t reform Medicaid now.Appeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 19:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-republicaid-party-1498690805", "news_title": "The Republicaid Party?", "keywords": "British National Health Service,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "Illinois Governor       Bruce Rauner       has this message for legislators as they struggle to deliver a budget to him by Friday\u2019s deadline: No one leaves the capital until a deal is done.\u201cIf the legislature fails to send a balanced budget package to my desk by Friday, we will have no choice but to keep them in session until they get the job done,\u201d Mr. Rauner, a Republican, said in a statement Wednesday.The warning comes as Illinois lawmakers spent Wednesday in negotiations trying to end a two-year budget stalemate that has led to a nearly $15 billion backlog of unpaid bills and economic pain across the state.Steve Brown,        the spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, said many Democrats believe that Mr. Rauner isn\u2019t negotiating in good faith and contrary to his rhetoric, has no intention of signing any deal.\u201cI think people realize that they are probably chasing a set of moving goalposts,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThere is widespread disbelief that this guy is really capable of any deal that includes a tax increase.\u201dOn Tuesday Mr. Madigan unveiled a $36 billion budget proposal but didn\u2019t spell out how much taxes would have to increase to get the state\u2019s fiscal house in order.If a budget isn\u2019t passed by Friday, credit-rating firms have warned they will downgrade the state\u2019s rating to junk.On Tuesday Mr. Madigan said his budget would cut about 5% from most state operations out of their normal appropriation.

President       Donald Trump\u2019s       nominee,       Neil Gorsuch,        wasn\u2019t seated until April, so the court operated with just eight justices for much of the term. That may explain why the Supreme Court decided on fewer cases than normal. According to data from the Supreme Court Database, the just-completed term had the fewest cases decided in at least 70 years.The slowdown didn\u2019t just affect the number of decisions handed down by the court. The number of cases they agreed to hear next term is also below the recent historical average. That pace could still pick up in the fall, but it\u2019s likely to remain below the norm.In the midst of this otherwise quiet court term, the most eagerly anticipated decision of the past few months has been one that falls to a lone justice,       Anthony Kennedy,        and whether this was his last term. Speculation about his possible retirement has been swirling for months. Justice Kennedy made no such revelation Monday, considered the most likely day for the decision, though he could still announce at any time. If he were to step down, the consequences would be significant. Justice Kennedy, appointed to the court by President       Ronald Reagan,        has in recent years become the crucial swing vote in an otherwise ideologically divided court.Of the current members of the court, Justice Kennedy is the only one to have crossed the ideological divide, shifting from somewhat conservative to slightly liberal, based on a prominent measure of judicial ideology known as the Martin-Quinn score.And that shift has had consequences. Twenty years ago, Justice Kennedy was often aligned with the conservatives in 5-4 decisions. Today, most closely divided cases are decided by Justice Kennedy joining with the court\u2019s liberal wing. If he were to retire, President Trump almost certainly would nominate a much more conservative jurist to replace him, significantly altering the balance of the court.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 18:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-slowdown-1498577964", "news_title": "Supreme Court Slowdown", "keywords": "Anthony Kennedy,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Citigroup Inc.

The bank had failed in 2014 and 2012, significantly setting back its payback plans.Citigroup\u2019s current plan is to pay out $18.9 billion in dividends and share repurchases over the four quarters starting in July. That would equal more than 130% of the income that analysts, surveyed by FactSet, expect it to generate over that period.That is a big leap from the bank\u2019s 88% payout ratio coming out of last year\u2019s Fed review. It is also beyond what several analysts had been forecasting. Their expectations were for a payout ratio closer to 110%, or roughly $16 billion.The bank said Wednesday that its quarterly dividend will double to 32 cents a share from the current 16 cents. It will also aim to buy back as much as $15.6 billion in stock.

Trump and Moon, who will have dinner Thursday night at the White House and meet again on Friday, come amid growing urgency about confronting the threat from North Korea. The two leaders have suggested dramatically different approaches to the issue.Mr. Moon, South Korea\u2019s first left-leaning president in nearly a decade, has called for closer ties with North Korea, primarily through economic cooperation, while the Trump administration has called for tougher sanctions, military pressure and diplomatic isolation.White House officials said North Korea is likely to dominate the talks between Messrs. Trump and Moon. They played down differences in the two leaders\u2019 approaches and said Mr. Trump will stress to Mr. Moon the need to coordinate their policies.Mr. Trump\u2019s policy is to apply pressure on North Korea \u201cto change their calculus to have substantive talks with us once they show they are willing to reduce the threat,\u201d a senior White House official said. The official said Mr. Trump sees nothing \u201cproblematic\u201d with Mr. Moon\u2019s positions.The U.S. administration is seeking to ramp up sanctions on North Korea and apply new diplomatic pressure to Pyongyang, though the White House official said no new sanctions are imminent.\u201cThe State Department has been talking to our friends and partners throughout the world really to address North Korea\u2019s trade, to address many of their illegal activities sometimes conducted under the guise of diplomatic missions to raise capital, hard currency for their weapons programs,\u201d the official said. \u201cI think there\u2019s plenty more pressure that could be brought to bear on North Korea in the form of U.N. Security Council resolutions and also unilateral sanctions by the United States.\u201dThe U.S. wants China to do more to cut off North Korea\u2019s economic pipeline. Mr. Trump, who said last week that North Korea is a threat that has to be \u201cprobably dealt with rapidly,\u201d recently wrote on Twitter that China\u2019s effort to use its influence on North Korea \u201chas not worked out.\u201d The senior White House official echoed that view, saying \u201cChina is still falling short on what it could bring to bear on North Korea.\u201dMr. Trump will host Mr. Moon for cocktails and dinner Thursday night in the State Dining Room. The two will have an official meeting on Friday at the White House, followed by joint public statements.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about South Korea and U.S. relations, both as a candidate and since taking office in January, have roiled South Korea. Mr. Trump said in April that he wanted to renegotiate a trade deal with South Korea. He said South Korea should pay for a U.S. missile-defense installation known as a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, that is designed to protect against a North Korean missile attack. Days later, Lt. Gen.       H.R. McMaster,        Mr. Trump\u2019s national-security chief, told his South Korean counterpart that the U.S. would pay for the system.Mr. Trump also has suggested in the past that South Korea pay more for the cost of U.S. troops stationed in the country, a deployment that long has been a tenet of America\u2019s security alliance with the country.The alliance particularly has been tested by the troubled deployment of Thaad. Over the past 12 months, Thaad has become a political football, upending ties between Seoul, Washington and Beijing, and even straining relations between Mr. Moon and his own defense ministry.South Korean commentators and media have drawn comparisons with the two previous left-leaning South Korean presidents, whose summit meetings with then-President       George W. Bush,        a conservative, were widely regarded as failures.Evan Medeiros,        managing director for Asia at Eurasia Group, said that while a face-to-face meeting would help stabilize relations in the near term, it \u201cwill not solve underlying differences on missile defense, North Korea and economic ties. Disagreements on these issues are just below the surface.\u201dMr. Medeiros, who served on former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       National Security Council as senior director for Asian affairs, said, \u201cMoon\u2019s ambiguous stance on Thaad, his weak commitment to increasing pressure on Pyongyang, and his penchant for engagement with the North will raise tensions with the U.S. later this year.\u201dKang Kyung-wha, South Korea\u2019s newly-appointed foreign minister, directly addressed concerns that Messrs. Trump and Moon don\u2019t see eye to eye. In her first policy address on Monday in Seoul, Ms. Kang said the two leader\u2019s North Korea policy was in sync and that the summit would \u201cunderscore their common vision and mutual understanding.\u201dMs. Kang also reaffirmed that Mr. Moon\u2019s decision to freeze Thaad deployment in South Korea didn\u2019t mean that Seoul would reverse Thaad or remove it altogether, in remarks aimed at soothing concerns in Washington about the alliance.On the issue of the five-year-old U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, known as Korus, the U.S.\u2019s largest bilateral trade pact, Mr. Moon\u2019s aides expect Mr. Trump will be eager to discuss the issue. Mr. Trump has lambasted it as \u201ca horrible deal.\u201dAnd when Mr. Trump called Mr. Moon last month to congratulate the South Korean leader on his electoral victory, a major topic was Korus, said Choi Jong-kun, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul and a campaign adviser to Mr. Moon on foreign policy.\u201cI think Mr. Trump is more eager to talk about the free-trade agreement than Thaad,\u201d Mr. Choi said.On an interpersonal level, some analysts have expressed worries about the personal rapport and body language between Mr. Trump and Mr. Moon.Mr. Moon is a careful, measured politician who doesn\u2019t speak English and is only believed to have visited the U.S. once. Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings with China\u2019s       Xi Jinping       and Japan\u2019s       Shinzo Abe       have been marked by personal warmth and lavish praise.\u201cBoth Abe and Xi had the advantage that they\u2019re now very seasoned political figures,\u201d said Michael Mazarr, a senior political scientist at Rand Corp., a policy think tank. \u201cMoon will still be in the process of accumulating that\u201d experience.\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting between two people who haven\u2019t met each other, so anything can happen,\u201d Mr. Choi said. \u201cBut the alliance is not just about the personal relationship, but about institutional consistency.\u201dThe senior White House official said it is possible at some point Messrs.

President       George Washington\u2019s       new administration faced a broiling frontier war in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions, where Indian nations had long been resisting American settlement. Aiming at a sphere of influence in the area, British officials were colluding with the natives, offering moral and material support for their resistance. In November of that fateful year, these forces combined to deliver the greatest victory ever achieved by native peoples against the United States.Gen.       Arthur St. Clair,        a Revolutionary War veteran and governor of the newly created Northwest Territory, led an army of about 1,500 regulars and militia to quell native resistance in what is now northwest Ohio. In a gruesome battle along the Wabash River, around 1,000 Indian warriors routed the entire American army, inflicting nearly 70% casualties and killing almost a third of all the nation\u2019s troops in the space of three hours. The battle became known as St. Clair\u2019s Defeat\u2014a name that allowed Americans to blame their collective humiliation on one man and to diminish the natives\u2019 powerful demonstration of military skill.\u201cAutumn of the Black Snake\u201d explains how, in large measure, the U.S. Army\u2019s future existence hinged on the events of this period\u2014particularly the nameless war fought against western Indian nations from 1790 to 1794. While the story is familiar to professional historians,       William Hogeland       breathes new life into a transformative conflict unknown to most modern Americans but decisive in shaping the future trajectory of the United States.By William Hogeland  Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 447 pages, $28Mr. Hogeland tells of how, in an era when it was uncertain what capacity and strength a national military force would be permitted\u2014or whether one would exist at all\u2014St. Clair\u2019s Defeat tipped the balance in favor of a permanent national army. Debate on the subject refracted the essential issues that had arisen out of the transition from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution, with Anti-Federalists promoting the militia system under state control and Federalists like Washington and       Alexander Hamilton       advocating a national army that would bind the union and establish federal sovereignty over the common defense.Washington\u2019s military experience reinforced this preference, as he had developed a distrust of the militias\u2019 reliability and effectiveness in the protracted war against Britain\u2019s professional army and navy. With political adroitness, Washington and his allies used St. Clair\u2019s Defeat to promote legislation expanding the U.S. Army and nearly doubling the federal budget, which narrowly passed the Senate in 1792.The officer whom Washington chose to lead the new national army was his old subordinate Maj. Gen.       Anthony Wayne.       Though he was a grizzled veteran of the Revolutionary War, by 1792 financial ruin, political scandal and family discord had left Wayne\u2019s reputation in tatters. Wayne knew that this was his last chance to achieve redemption. He set about salvaging the remains of St. Clair\u2019s force by strengthening its morale, organization and discipline, transforming it into a new combined-arms unit called the Legion of the United States.With his infantry, cavalry and artillery, Wayne marched north toward Miami country. He exhibited such \u201cmaniacal carefulness\u201d that natives took to calling him the \u201cBlack Snake\u201d\u2014a general who never slept as he relentlessly constricted their room for maneuver. By late 1793, Wayne had reoccupied the battlefield of St. Clair\u2019s Defeat. He buried the bones of St. Clair\u2019s men and transformed a place of shame into a tangible symbol of victory: a new outpost named Fort Recovery.The final blow fell in August 1794, when an Indian army of around 1,000 warriors ambushed Wayne\u2019s army at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, near present-day Toledo. The unfazed, disciplined infantry of the Legion countered with a bayonet charge and swept their native adversaries before them. Fleeing Indian warriors sought protection at nearby Fort Miamis only to discover that the British commander had barred the gates shut. Wayne\u2019s real triumph, Mr. Hogeland observes, was his demonstration of the \u201cfaithlessness of the enemy\u2019s so-called British allies.\u201d The following year, the British abandoned not only their remaining posts on American soil but also their Indian friends, who would face the United States alone.Wayne\u2019s leadership of the Legion of the United States during the nation\u2019s first major war vindicated the expansion of the regular army, and his negotiation of the 1795 Treaty of Greeneville with the defeated Indian coalition opened most of what is now Ohio to American settlement. What was at stake here, according to Mr. Hogeland, was nothing less than the future commercial and industrial development of the United States\u2014the westward expansion that defined American nationhood.By placing relationships with Native Americans at the center of his narrative, Mr. Hogeland underscores the salient role of Indian peoples in shaping the early republic and its national army. He paints vivid portraits of leaders such as Blue Jacket (Shawnee) and       Little Turtle       (Miami), who were among the most formidable indigenous adversaries that U.S. forces ever faced. He also shows how, for all its tactical brilliance, the Indian coalition was hindered by internal differences over strategic and tactical priorities\u2014divisions that would ultimately contribute to its military defeat.While \u201cAutumn of the Black Snake\u201d offers little in the way of new research, it convincingly argues the significance of Washington\u2019s decisions during this episode. Mr. Hogeland\u2019s portrait of Washington himself is controversial, interpreting the first president\u2019s motives as starkly expansionist. Indeed, Mr. Hogeland\u2019s work invites reflection on why some of the most important (and darker) legacies of Washington\u2019s presidency\u2014establishing federal supremacy over the west and its native inhabitants in a war of unbridled conquest\u2014have also been the most readily forgotten.Mr. Preston is a professor of history at the Citadel and the author of \u201c      Braddock\u2019s       Defeat: The Battle of the Monongahela and the Road to Revolution.\u201dAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Washington\u2019s Indian War.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 18:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/president-washingtons-indian-war-1498688622", "news_title": "President Washington\u2019s Indian War", "keywords": "book review,books,political,general news,national,public security,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,risk news,reviews"}, {"content": "In 2016, Donald       Trump       stood on debate stages and ran against a half-dozen Republicans in the party\u2019s presidential primaries.

With his presidential victory came Republican control of the House and Senate, in part because of his coattails.After Senate Republicans this week failed to move a bill to repeal and replace       Obama      Care,       Mr. Trump       must be asking himself: Why do I need these people?Just now, that\u2019s a good question.If the congressional Republicans can\u2019t do ObamaCare reform after years of chanting they would, what chance is there they\u2019ll pull off the heavier lift of tax reform?Mr. Trump has to be wondering whether he would be better off with his version of the Obama presidential model: govern by pen-and-phone executive order through the agencies he controls.Barack Obama rendered Congress moribund with little outcry from voters. The Obama error was his predictable left-wing overreach with extralegal decrees like the Clean Power Plan, which failed a court challenge before the D.C. Circuit.To succeed as president, Mr. Trump has to show he can govern, and it looks like that may require separating himself from a Republican Party disabled by a permanent blocking minority with no interest in governing.At the level of domestic politics, successful presidential governing means not much more than enabling and attaching oneself to an improving economy, as the impeached but popular       Bill Clinton       proved possible.The economy is already strengthening, and Mr. Trump can direct Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       and White House economics chief       Gary Cohn       to accelerate their deregulation of financial and energy markets.Before the Republicans lose seats and maybe control of the House in 2018, Mr. Trump can still extract a few things helpful to himself. Desperate incumbents, such as Nevada\u2019s ObamaCare reform opponent Sen.       Dean Heller,        will be looking for a legislative life raft. Mr. Trump no doubt could get a modest tax-cut bill passed this year. That will support slow but steady upward growth unless he retards even that with a regime of steel tariffs and myriad trade uncertainties.Real tax reform would liberate the U.S.\u2019s ocean of pent-up capital and produce an economic boom, assuring continued GOP control of Congress. But Republicans like West Virginia\u2019s Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       see their reason for being as protecting the Medicaid status quo.Some may say Mr. Trump and the Republicans will now take political ownership of the steady collapse of the ObamaCare exchanges. But he didn\u2019t create these things; Congress did, and when voters elected a Congress to reform ObamaCare, it failed.The press will dump full responsibility for this political nonfeasance on congressional Republicans, and voters will take it out on them in 2018. Health and Human Services can tinker with the failing ObamaCare exchanges, as it would have under       Hillary Clinton       anyway, and Mr. Trump can blame Congress for the residual mess.As to Mr. Trump\u2019s low approval rating, the danger there was always that it would scare away Republicans from his agenda. That looks moot now. The Republicans\u2019 approval rating is no doubt already plummeting. Mr. Trump\u2019s approval will rise as the economy improves and if he modulates himself by about half, as he\u2019s done recently.Most intriguing of all is the longer term future of Mr. Trump\u2019s formal relationship with the Republican Party. After voters in 2018 reorder Congress, Mr. Trump can consolidate his base with a big infrastructure bill co-designed by Democrats and likely approved by independent voters. By then, the Republican opposition that tanked ObamaCare reform will be irrelevant.And please, hold the faux shock when Mr. Trump, a nonideological pragmatist, entertains Chuck Schumer\u2019s Medicare-for-all as the final health-care fix. In Mr. Trump\u2019s world, subcontractors come and go. The GOP shouldn\u2019t bother trying to collect for work done.This disorder could surface the possibility that dare not speak its name until now: a more centrist Trumpian political party of the sort favored by Ivanka Trump. No one thought       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       party bolt in France could go so far.Look who\u2019s out front undermining Mr. Trump\u2019s health-care reform:       Ted Cruz,       Rob Portman,       Rand Paul,       Mike Lee       and Ohio Gov.       John Kasich.       The nominal reasons each has given for opposing the reform don\u2019t add up. What makes sense is compulsively ambitious Republican politicians positioning themselves to emerge from the rubble and run in 2020 against what they think will be a wounded president. They may end up with nothing but the rubble.Reasons abound for the GOP\u2019s rump opposition to spend the July 4 holiday rethinking what it is doing. But the biggest of all is this: After eight years of rule by progressive presidential decree, they are putting in motion four more years of centralizing power by a Republican president. The opposition may alter American government forever, but this couldn\u2019t be further from what they intended.Write henninger@wsj.com.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 18:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-trump-abandon-the-gop-1498688524", "news_title": "Should Trump Abandon the GOP?", "keywords": "donald trump, health care, republicans, senate,Mr. Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Have public-relations professionals joined the anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d?

I heard about the survey while it was still under way, via a tweet from my profession\u2019s national association, the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA): \u201cNew survey from @USCAnnenberg. Do you believe that the White House is damaging the reputation of our industry?\u201dThat struck me as a leading question, from an organization that is usually nonpartisan. I clicked the link to find the online survey. It asked whether White House communications staffers \u201cwork hard to explain the policies of the current administration,\u201d \u201cpurposefully lie,\u201d \u201cdo their best under the circumstances\u201d and \u201cact like PR professionals.\u201d Survey respondents were asked whether they would hire       Sean Spicer,        Kellyanne Conway and others for their next jobs.A quick search revealed other tweets and social-media posts from others in the communications field, including the prestigious Arthur W. Page Society, urging public engagement with the survey. Yet the online poll required no validation of PRSA affiliation or other professional credentials. Respondents were merely asked what kind of company they worked for and how long they had been in a PR-related position.That setup yields what is known as a \u201cconvenience sample\u201d\u2014a survey group not necessarily representative of the population, and in this case likely biased by the anti-Trump framing. The 900 participants, according to the press release, were 55.3% liberal, 29.6% moderate and only 15.1% conservative.As a moderate conservative myself\u2014one who cares about what the presumed spokesmen for my profession are saying\u2014I wrote Mr. Cook June 6 to express my concerns. He responded the same day and acknowledged some of my points. He told me the center was working \u201cwith a number of organizations to distribute the survey and we don\u2019t control how they do that.\u201d He added: \u201cI had not seen the PRSA tweet and did not anticipate they would show any bias. We have been very careful with the language we have used in encouraging people to take the survey.\u201dHe assured me that \u201cwe aren\u2019t really looking for a critique\u201d of the White House and promised \u201cwe will try not to display any bias as we report the results.\u201d On that score, the press release speaks for itself\u2014but it was also picked up by politically enthusiastic media as an indictment of the administration by the entire public-relations profession.I\u2019m not a fan of the Trump administration\u2019s every message and mode, but such things should be argued on the merits, not with contrived data and sensationalism.Ms. West runs a public-relations agency in Alcoa, Tenn.Appeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 18:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-takes-flak-from-a-pr-school-1498688569", "news_title": "Trump Takes Flak From a PR School", "keywords": " annenberg school, kellyanne conway, pr, prsa,public relations, sean spicer, trump, university of california, usc, white house,Public Relations Society of America (PRSA):,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,surveys,polls,market research,advertising,marketing,business,consumer services,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "President       Obama       has been busy since leaving office. In February he was photographed kite surfing with billionaire       Richard Branson       in the British Virgin Islands. March brought a visit to Hawaii, followed by four weeks in French Polynesia and yachting with       David Geffen,        Oprah,       Tom Hanks       and       Bruce Springsteen.May included biking and golfing at a pal\u2019s luxury hotel in Tuscany, before speeches in Berlin and Scotland, the latter providing the chance to play 12 holes at St. Andrews. Now the Obamas are in Indonesia for a nostalgic return to what was briefly his childhood home. But before jetting off on Friday, the former president, that champion of the poor and dispossessed, waded into the health-care debate with a lengthy             Facebook                   post.It was a trite, tone-deaf, partisan and condescending attack on the Senate Republicans\u2019 health-care proposal. The comments show that the former president, still prickly and defensive, doesn\u2019t understand how flawed ObamaCare really is.Mr. Obama sold the Affordable Care Act with well-formulated falsehoods. \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan,\u201d he said repeatedly, and \u201cif you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\u201d The law would \u201ccover every American and cut the cost of a typical family\u2019s premium by up to $2,500 a year.\u201d It would \u201cbend the cost curve\u201d for health care, he said, without adding \u201cone dime to the deficit.\u201d None of this was true, and Mr. Obama must have known that.So did he address these failings in his Facebook post? Of course not. The former president changed his talking points for ObamaCare. \u201cWomen can\u2019t be charged more for their insurance,\u201d he bragged\u2014but the GOP proposal doesn\u2019t alter that policy. \u201cYoung people can stay on their parents\u2019 plan until they turn 26,\u201d he said\u2014but Republicans would leave that in place, too. \u201cContraceptive care and preventive care are now free,\u201d Mr. Obama added\u2014except taxpayers actually pay for them with levies on, among other things, hospital stays, medical devices and insurance policies. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama shoved his broken promises down the memory hole.Mr. Obama did repeat the left\u2019s canards that the GOP proposal \u201cwould raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid.\u201d He piously added: \u201cThat\u2019s not my opinion, but rather the conclusion of all objective analysis,\u201d starting with \u201cthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\u201dThe CBO, however, did not issue its report on the Senate legislation until four days after Mr. Obama posted on Facebook. And when the CBO report did come out, it didn\u2019t back up his indictment. For example, the CBO concluded: \u201cBy 2026, average premiums for benchmark plans for single individuals in most of the country under this legislation would be about 20 percent lower than under current law.\u201dOne could scour the CBO\u2019s report in vain for anything to justify saying the bill would \u201croll back protections\u201d or \u201cruin Medicaid.\u201d Under the Senate plan, Medicaid outlays would continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate.Wielding the left\u2019s favorite new club, Mr. Obama also claimed that \u201c23 million Americans would lose insurance\u201d if the GOP bill passes. But how can that be, since only 10 million people get coverage through the ObamaCare exchanges? Further, how many of those people want insurance in the first place? The CBO says that \u201cin 2018, 15 million more people would be uninsured under this legislation than under current law\u2014primarily because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated.\u201dAnd that\u2019s not the worst of the Democrats\u2019 rhetoric. Sen.       Bernie Sanders       says that if the Republican legislation passes \u201cthousands of people will die.\u201d Sen.       Elizabeth Warren       claims Republicans want to pay for \u201cjuicy tax cuts for their rich buddies\u201d with \u201cblood money.\u201d The left-wing Center for American Progress pegs the number of Republican-caused deaths over the next decade at a precise 217,000.       Hillary Clinton       ratcheted it up by tweeting: \u201cIf Republicans pass this bill, they\u2019re the death party.\u201dThese comments demonstrate how intellectually bankrupt Democratic leaders are on health care. ObamaCare is falling apart, with its major promises broken. Democratic leaders have offered no package to fix it because it\u2019s structurally unsound and unfixable. All they can do is scream \u201cDisease and death!\u201d and hope Republicans are dissuaded from fixing the mess.The danger for Republicans lies in not acting, which would allow Democrats to brag about all the imaginary terrible things they prevented from happening. The danger for Democrats comes if Republicans act and then voters see that the dreadful outcomes liberals predicted never come to pass (as happened with welfare reform).

The ECJ plays a crucial role underpinning the U.K.\u2019s trade arrangements with the EU and its membership in EU regulatory agencies as well as policing EU-wide rules on everything from counterterrorism to data transfer.Whether the U.K. prime minister fully appreciated the implications of unraveling all of this when she announced her red line at the Conservative party conference last October is an open question. Some of those closely involved in Brexit planning say the decision was made for political reasons, without the usual consultations that precede major statements of government policy. But now that negotiations are under way, the key question is: How red is this red line?The first big test concerns what role, if any, the ECJ should play in enforcing the rights of EU citizens in the U.K. post-Brexit. The EU argues that since these rights stem from EU law and since only the ECJ can interpret that law, the ECJ should retain the final say. The U.K., on the other hand, says the post-Brexit rights of EU citizens will be enshrined in both U.K. law and the Article 50 withdrawal agreement, which will have the status of international law, so there is no question of the ECJ having any jurisdiction.This doesn\u2019t tell the full story. The U.K. has already conceded in its white paper on the \u201cGreat Repeal Bill\u201d that British courts will continue to respect ECJ rulings on matters of EU law as it exists on the day the U.K. leaves the EU. Many lawyers also expect the U.K. to agree that its courts should pay attention to future judgments of the ECJ as they pertain to questions of EU law up to the point of the U.K.\u2019s departure. It seems Mrs. May\u2019s real red line is that British courts should no longer be allowed to ask the ECJ to rule on questions of EU law.It\u2019s easy to see why the EU is unhappy about this. It fears that a future British Parliament might decide to change U.K. law in ways that infringe on the rights of EU citizens in the country. Under those circumstances, British courts would be bound to follow U.K. law, regardless of what was agreed upon in the Article 50 withdrawal deal. The only recourse for EU citizens would be the International Court of Justice.But since only states can sue states in the international court, individuals would first have to persuade an EU government to take up their case\u2014and risk turning what may have started as a minor dispute over benefit entitlements into an international crisis. Legally speaking, EU citizens could retain their rights but their inability to enforce those rights would render them useless.Yet it\u2019s also easy to see why the U.K. is determined to stand its ground. This has as much to do with Britain\u2019s anxiety about future ECJ rulings as it does with concern for sovereignty. Mrs. May\u2019s problem is that the rights she wants to offer EU citizens fall short of guaranteeing the rights they currently enjoy.In particular, she wants to apply rules to EU citizens post-Brexit that she introduced as Home Secretary for British citizens, preventing them from bringing family members into the country unless they meet a certain minimum income threshold. The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled, albeit with reservations, that this is compatible with British law. If the ECJ ruled that such a policy breached EU law, it would trigger a serious clash.How this issue is resolved has important implications for other parts of the Brexit negotiations, notably trade. Brexit secretary       David Davis       has suggested the solution to the ECJ problem is to create new dispute resolution mechanisms that would allow the U.K. and EU to settle disagreements without involving the courts. But such arrangements are typically state-to-state affairs.What makes the ECJ unique is that any citizen or business can enforce their rights under EU law directly, via local courts. There is no need to lobby the government to fights one\u2019s corner. Indeed, British firms have been remarkably successful over the years in enforcing their EU rights through the ECJ, leaving many lawyers puzzled as to why the court\u2014as opposed to the European Court of Human Rights\u2014has loomed so large in the Brexit debate. The risk is that U.K. businesses, like EU citizens, stand to lose significant protections.Meanwhile, the recent election result has added a further complication. There is now a growing political clamor for a softer Brexit, perhaps by retaining membership in some EU regulatory agencies or even forming a new customs union with the EU.This would certainly avoid the potentially devastating economic consequences of a hard Brexit, but it would also require the U.K. to continue to abide by EU rules\u2014rules over which it would cease to have any influence and which it might no longer be able directly to enforce.

American pilots have struck forces threatening our allies and shot down a Syrian plane and Iranian-made drones. The probability of direct military confrontation between the U.S. and Russia has risen. Yet the coverage of these incidents and the tactical responses that have been suggested obscure the broader story: The slow-moving campaign against Islamic State is finally nearing its conclusion\u2014yet major, long-range strategic issues remain unresolved.The real issue isn\u2019t tactical. It is instead the lack of American strategic thinking about the Middle East after Islamic State. Its defeat will leave a regional political vacuum that must be filled somehow. Instead of reflexively repeating President       Obama\u2019s       errors, the       Trump       administration should undertake an \u201cagonizing reappraisal,\u201d in the style of       John Foster Dulles,        to avoid squandering the victory on the ground.First, the U.S. ought to abandon or substantially reduce its military support for Iraq\u2019s current government. Despite retaining a tripartite veneer of Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Shiite Arabs, the capital is dominated by Shiites loyal to Iran. Today Iraq resembles Eastern Europe in the late 1940s, as the Soviet anaconda tightened its hold. Extending Baghdad\u2019s political and military control into areas retaken from ISIS simply advances Tehran\u2019s power. This cannot be in America\u2019s interest.Iraq\u2019s Kurds have de facto independence and are on the verge of declaring it de jure. They fight ISIS to facilitate the creation of a greater Kurdistan. Nonetheless, the Kurds, especially in Syria and Turkey, are hardly monolithic. Not all see the U.S. favorably. In Syria, Kurdish forces fighting ISIS are linked to the Marxist PKK in Turkey. They pose a real threat to Turkey\u2019s territorial integrity, even if it may seem less troubling now that President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s       plans have turned so profoundly contrary to the secular, Western-oriented vision of Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.Second, the U.S. should press Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf monarchies for more troops and material assistance in fighting ISIS. America has carried too much of the burden for too long in trying to forge Syria\u2019s opposition into an effective force. Yet even today the opposition could charitably be called \u201cdiverse.\u201d It includes undeniably terrorist elements that are often hard to distinguish from the \u201cmoderates\u201d the U.S. supports. Getting fresh contributions from Arab allies would rebalance the opposition, which is especially critical if the U.S. turns away, as it should, from reliance on the Iraqi forces dominated by Tehran.Third, the Trump administration must take a clear-eyed view of Russia\u2019s intervention. The Syrian mixing bowl is where confrontation between American and Russian forces looms. Why is Russia active in this conflict? Because it is aiding its allies: Syria\u2019s President       Bashar Assad       and Iran\u2019s ayatollahs. Undeniably, Russia is on the wrong side. But Mr. Obama, blind to reality, believed Washington and Moscow shared a common interest in easing the Assad regime out of power. The Trump administration\u2019s new thinking should be oriented toward a clear objective: pushing back these Iranian and Russian gains.Start with Iran. Tehran is trying to cement an arc of control from its own territory, through Baghdad-controlled Iraq and Mr. Assad\u2019s Syria, to Hezbollah-dominated Lebanon. This would set the stage for the region\u2019s next potential conflict: Iran\u2019s Shiite coalition versus a Saudi-led Sunni alliance.The U.S.-led coalition, enhanced as suggested above, needs to thwart Iran\u2019s ambitions as ISIS falls. Securing increased forces and financial backing from the regional Arab governments is essential. Their stakes are as high as ours\u2014despite the contretemps between Qatar and Saudi Arabia (and others)\u2014but their participation has lagged. The U.S. has mistakenly filled the gap with Iraqi government forces and Shiite militias.Washington is kidding itself to think Sunnis will meekly accept rule by Iraq\u2019s Shiite-dominated government or Syria\u2019s Alawite regime. Simply restoring today\u2019s governments in Baghdad and Damascus to their post-World War I boundaries would guarantee renewed support for terrorism and future conflict. I have previously suggested creating a new, secular, demographically Sunni state from territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria. There may well be other solutions, but pining for borders demarcated by Europeans nearly a century ago is not one of them.At the same time, the U.S. must begin rolling back Russia\u2019s renewed presence and influence in the Middle East. Russia has a new air base at Latakia, Syria, is involved in combat operations, and issues diktats about where American warplanes in the region may fly. For all the allegations about Donald Trump and Russia, the president truly in thrall to Moscow seems to have been Mr. Obama.Russia\u2019s interference, particularly its axis with Mr. Assad and Tehran\u2019s mullahs, critically threatens the interests of the U.S., Israel and our Arab friends. Mr. Assad almost certainly would have fallen by now without Russia\u2019s (and Iran\u2019s) assistance. Further, Moscow\u2019s support for Tehran shatters any claim of its truly being a partner in fighting radical Islamic terrorism, which got its modern start in Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution. Both Iran and the Assad regime remain terror-sponsoring states, only now they are committing their violence under Russia\u2019s protective umbrella. There is no reason for the U.S. to pursue a strategy that enhances Russia\u2019s influence or that of its surrogates.As incidents in Syria and Iraq increasingly put American forces at risk, Washington should not get lost in deconfliction negotiations or modest changes in rules of engagement. Instead, the Trump administration should recraft the U.S.-led coalition to ensure that America\u2019s interests, rather than Russia\u2019s or Iran\u2019s, predominate once ISIS is defeated.Mr. Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and author of \u201cSurrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad\u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2007).", "news_time": "2017-06-28 18:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-needs-a-post-isis-strategy-1498688109", "news_title": "America Needs a Post-ISIS Strategy", "keywords": " iran,isis, islamic state, middle east, moscow, putin, raqqa, russia, strategy, tehran, trump,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,terrorism,military action,war crimes,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion bid for             Whole Foods                   has stirred speculation among investors, business reporters and consumers. If Amazon CEO       Jeff Bezos       has a strategy for marrying the online and brick-and-mortar operations, he hasn\u2019t explained it\u2014and perhaps for good reason. It\u2019s rarely wise to show your cards to competitors or regulators.A decade ago, the Federal Trade Commission turned Whole Foods CEO       John Mackey\u2019s       statements against him in an antitrust suit that sought to unwind its merger with Wild Oats Markets. Mr. Mackey said Whole Foods\u2019s goal was to \u201celiminate a competitor\u201d that a conventional supermarket might otherwise purchase and use as a \u201cgrowth platform.\u201dMarkets are dynamic\u2014meaning businesses face constant pressure from competitors that offer innovations or lower prices. In 2007, then-Sen.       Barack Obama       asked Iowa voters, \u201cAnybody gone into Whole Foods lately? See what they charge for arugula?\u201d At the time, Iowa didn\u2019t even have a Whole Foods, and Republicans seized on his statement to portray him as an out-of-touch elitist. Now you can buy a box of arugula at a 99-cent store.The problem is that FTC regulators defined competition so narrowly when evaluating prior mergers that they failed to see the market for the trees. Antitrust enforcement actions that sought to prevent grocery stores from consolidating have helped Amazon, which has been able to expand unencumbered by the FTC. Now supermarkets may be in a weaker position to give Amazon a run for its money.After Whole Foods proposed the Wild Oats merger in 2007, the FTC accused Whole Foods of trying to corner a distinctive \u201cpremium natural and organic\u201d market. The agency argued that             Wal-Mart,       Safeway and Trader Joe\u2019s\u2014all of which are among Whole Foods\u2019s top competitors today\u2014drew different clienteles and thus were not direct competitors.Whole Foods spent two years battling the FTC in court. But the agency\u2019s arguments lost weight as Wal-Mart and supermarkets expanded their offerings of organic products and poached price-conscious customers from Whole Foods. In 2009 the government settled, with Whole Foods agreeing to sell 13 of its Wild Oats stores, which accounted for a token 1.3% of the company\u2019s sales.But although the merger strengthened Whole Foods\u2019s position in the organic market, its stock price has sagged over the past two years as competition in groceries has escalated. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart and conventional supermarkets, which were booming during the 1980s and \u201990s, have to fend off competition from warehouse outlets, dollar stores and German low-cost retailers Aldi and Lidl.Online food retailers like FreshDirect, Amazon and Jet.com (acquired last year by Wal-Mart) are now catering to customers who prize convenience over cost. Silicon Valley startup Instacart promises to deliver groceries from retailers like Whole Foods,             Costco                   and Target within two hours. And meal kit service Blue Apron is pitching an initial public offering.The result has been a wave of supermarket consolidation. In 2015 Albertsons merged with Safeway to maximize economies of scale and negotiate leverage with suppliers. Yet the FTC complained the deal would significantly reduce competition and potentially increase prices.The FTC came to this conclusion by narrowly defining the market as consisting of \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d supermarkets and excluding discounters, warehouses, convenience stores and organic retailers. The commission also arbitrarily evaluated geographic competition by examining supermarkets that operated between 0.2 and 10 miles of each other. In the Whole Foods-Wild Oats deal, the FTC defined the relevant geographic market as \u201can area as small as approximately five or six miles in radius\u201d from each store. With the growth in online shopping, delimiting markets by geography is increasingly absurd.To get their merger approved, Albertsons and Safeway agreed to sell 146 of their stores to the small Northwest supermarket chain Haggen, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization within a year.Government antitrust interventions have a history of backfiring. When rental-car company Hertz sought to buy Dollar Thrifty in 2012, the FTC forced it to divest Advantage Rent A Car. Regulators argued that the merger would have reduced competition in the airport rental market, which was beginning to see disruptions from ride-hailing startups and Zipcar, a rental agency with an innovative business model. One year after its brokered sale, Advantage went bankrupt. In 2013 Avis bought Zipcar for $500 million.Car-rental companies are continuing to struggle because of competition from Uber and Lyft, but are innovating to keep up. In the past three years, Hertz\u2019s stock price has tumbled more than 90%. This week, Hertz and Avis announced self-driving car partnerships with Apple and Waymo.That story of creative destruction has been repeated across industries throughout history. Wired broadband has replaced dial-up Internet in most of the U.S. but is now being usurped by mobile. Or consider the evolution from pagers and car phones to cell phones and smartphones. A decade ago,             BlackBerry                   led the \u201cpersonal digital assistant\u201d market, which was tiny compared to the market for flip phones. Regulators can\u2019t foresee how innovations will disrupt markets. Antitrust interventions that seek to preserve the status quo will invariably fail\u2014and could cause businesses to fail.How the Amazon-Whole Foods merger will play out is anyone\u2019s guess, but businesses typically have a better record of predicting\u2014and spurring\u2014market revolutions than government. That\u2019s something for President Trump to keep in mind as he fills three vacancies on the FTC.Ms. Finley is an editorial writer for the Journal.Appeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 18:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-myopic-antitrust-policy-helped-amazon-gain-dominance-1498688044", "news_title": "How Myopic Antitrust Policy Helped Amazon Gain Dominance", "keywords": "amazon, competition, ftc, jeff bezos, john mackey, merger, monopoly, purchase, whole foods,Federal Trade Commission,Whole Foods,WFM,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,John Mackey,plans,strategy,regulation,government policy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,anti-competition issues,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,competitive intelligence,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,retail,wholesale,food retailing,supermarkets,grocery stores,specialty stores,mixed retailing,shopping malls,superstores,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "Earlier this month, a man armed with a rifle and handgun targeted members of Congress and their staffs as they practiced for the annual congressional baseball game\u2014a bipartisan tradition dating back decades. Rep.       Steve Scalise       was wounded, as were two U.S. Capitol Police officers, a congressional staffer, and a former aide. Thankfully all are recovering.I was horrified. I know well the Alexandria, Va., community where the shooting happened. I represent the people who live there, and that practice field is a mile from my house.Despite our political differences, my colleagues and I respect each other. We should come together with a shared agenda in such moments. I\u2019ve been inspired by the bipartisan spirit I\u2019ve witnessed in the wake of the shooting. I am troubled, however, by the gun lobby\u2019s attempt to exploit the tragedy by advancing a dangerous political agenda that would make us less safe.On the morning of the shooting, Republicans who control the House Committee on Natural Resources were set to hold hearings on a sportsmen\u2019s bill called the Share Act. In an attempt to mass market the sale of dangerous firearm silencers as hearing protection, members of that committee had quietly attached to the bill an unrelated measure called the Hearing Protection Act. More accurately, they might have called it the Gun Profits Protection Act.The measure\u2019s sole purpose is to remove gun silencers from the National Firearms Act, the law that for 80 years has regulated the sale of the deadliest weapons and gun accessories. Removing existing safeguards to mass-market silencers would profit gun manufacturers at the expense of public safety, and enable dangerous individuals to buy silencers on the private market without the scrutiny of a background check.Shortly after the shooting, Republicans on the committee canceled the hearing\u2014for now. I was glad they did. They should shelve this dangerous proposal permanently. The noise from       James Hodgkinson\u2019s       rifle alerted those on the scene in Alexandria to the shooting. Often the sound of gunshots is what causes people to take cover and notify law enforcement.In the weeks since the shooting, I\u2019ve also noticed an uptick in calls for concealed-carry reciprocity among my colleagues. Some have proposed legislation to override local laws and allow more guns on the streets of Washington and beyond.For the National Rifle Association\u2019s leadership, which spent $50 million on the 2016 elections, federal concealed-carry reciprocity legislation is agenda item No.\u00a01. They\u2019ve said it themselves. It\u2019s a policy that would enrich gun makers while decimating our public-safety laws and creating chaos for law enforcement.Concealed-carry reciprocity would force every state in the nation to accept the standards of every other state. It would make the weakest link the de facto law of the land\u2014forcing states to allow concealed carry by people with no gun-safety training, and by many people with recent convictions for violent crimes.A dozen states have dismantled their concealed-carry permitting requirements altogether. If a federal concealed-carry reciprocity law passes, people with no permits whatever, who have never even passed background checks, would be free to carry guns across the country.Mass shootings resemble day-to-day gun violence in some ways, but both have a strong statistical likelihood of being committed by people with histories of domestic violence or other abuse. Hodgkinson, who is reported to have had a history of domestic violence, is another deadly data point confirming this trend. With a federal concealed-carry reciprocity law on the books, people who have a record of domestic violence or are experiencing a mental-health crisis could carry hidden, loaded guns in all 50 states.That\u2019s a recipe for disaster, which is why many law enforcement organizations have firmly opposed the idea for years.Politicians from both parties should focus on the recovery of Hodgkinson\u2019s victims and on crafting policies that will make us all safer. What we must not do is allow the gun lobby to exploit this tragedy in pursuit of its own dangerous agenda.Mr. Beyer, a Democrat, represents Virginia\u2019s Eighth Congressional District.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 18:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-answer-to-the-virginia-shooting-isnt-looser-gun-laws-1498688000", "news_title": "The Answer to the Virginia Shooting Isn\u2019t Looser Gun Laws", "keywords": " concealed carry permit, gun control, hodgkinson, scalise,shooting, silencer, suppressor,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,gun control,murder,manslaughter,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Biopharmaceutical developer             Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.

The regulator alleges that the executives reclassified operating expenses as capital expenditures in order to make costs appear lower and boost net income.Obsidian announced in 2014 that it would restate its financial results for the previous two years. In a complaint, the SEC said the accounting misconduct resulted in the company understating operating expenses for 2012 by 16% and for 2013 by 20%.The company\u2019s current chief executive officer, David French, said Wednesday that he was \u201cnaturally disappointed that the SEC has chosen to pursue these past matters which we reported to them and fully remediated years ago.\u201d\u201cWe respect and appreciate the SEC\u2019s view of its obligations regarding these past matters and look forward to a timely resolution,\u201d Mr. French said.The regulator said it is seeking to bar Messrs.

BAC 0.67%The Charlotte, N.C., bank, the second largest in the country by assets, received permission from the Federal Reserve Wednesday to boost its per-share dividend to 48 cents a year. Mr. Buffett has said a dividend of this size would prompt his             Berkshire Hathaway Inc.        BRK.B 0.52%       to swap its preferred shares in the bank into about $17 billion worth of common stock.The move would make the famous stockpicker\u2019s firm the largest shareholder of the second and third largest U.S. banks\u2014the third being             Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       & Co.\u2014while also providing a vote of confidence for Bank of America stock.On Wednesday as a part of the \u201cstress test\u201d process, the Fed approved Bank of America\u2019s plan to pay out the 48-cent dividend, a 60% increase from the current 30-cent level. The regulator also approved the bank\u2019s plans to buy back $12.9 billion worth of shares. Over the last year, the bank got permission to buy back $7.7 billion worth of shares.In February, Mr. Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders that Berkshire planned to make the switch in its Bank of America stake if the bank could increase its annual dividend to 44 cents a share from its recent level of 30 cents a share. That is because a common-stock dividend of 44 cents would pay Berkshire more than the $300 million that the preferred stake gives the firm annually.Berkshire bought its preferred shares in the bank in 2011, when the lender sorely needed to shore up investor sentiment. The $5 billion deal also included warrants to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America common stock for $7.14 apiece, far below the current price.The preferred shares have little downside, so long as Bank of America stays solvent. But they have no upside either. With a change in Berkshire\u2019s shares, Mr. Buffett effectively would be saying that he would like to take part in possible gains on Bank of America\u2019s stock while still enjoying a steady dividend.After an exchange, Mr. Buffett\u2019s firm would own about 7% of the bank\u2019s common shares, giving it a significant role in corporate governance issues from compensation to the election of new directors. Currently, the largest shareholder of Bank of America is Vanguard Group with a 6.6% stake, according to FactSet.Before his February letter, Mr. Buffett had said he would wait to exercise the warrants, which expire in 2021.It isn\u2019t clear when exactly a Berkshire exchange could happen now that the dividend hike has been approved. Mr. Buffett couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.Big banks need approval from the Fed to increase their dividends, a process that culminated in Wednesday\u2019s annual review of how the lenders would perform under severely stressed economic conditions. This is the second year in a row that Bank of America has gotten permission to increase both its dividend and buybacks. In the early years of the test, the bank struggled to get a clean approval for such capital-return hikes from the regulator.The dividend and buyback boosts are positive for Bank of America Chairman and CEO       Brian Moynihan.       The 57-year-old lawyer has worked to restore the bank\u2019s relationships with shareholders after years of large mortgage fines and losses stemming from the bank\u2019s crisis-era purchases of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.When Berkshire bought the preferred shares in 2011, Bank of America was slumping, losing confidence among many investors. Mr. Buffett helped to change that narrative by agreeing to purchase $5 billion in preferred stock and calling the bank \u201cwell led,\u201d an important endorsement for Mr. Moynihan more than a year after he had risen to the chief-executive role.The terms though were expensive for Bank of America. The preferred stock paid a chunky 6% annual dividend, or $300 million a year. Bank of America shares have tripled since the investment, from about $7.60 to $23.88, giving Berkshire a paper gain of almost $12 billion. The Omaha-based investor also has made about $1.7 billion in dividends on the preferred shares.Mr. Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s chairman and chief executive, amassed stakes in a number of lenders and financial services companies, sometimes at cut-rate prices around the financial crisis. Berkshire\u2019s other bank holdings as of March 31 included Wells Fargo,             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.      ,             American Express Co.      ,             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,M&T Bank Corp.       and             U.S. Bancorp.Bank of America shares are up about 88% over the past 12 months in large part because of a big rally right after the November election. But one issue for the bank is that profit gains from higher interest rates have slowed as long-term rates have remained low.Write to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com and Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 18:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-warren-buffetts-16-billion-bet-on-bank-of-america-may-change-with-fed-stress-test-1498642203", "news_title": "Berkshire Hathaway On Path to Be Top Bank of America Holder", "keywords": "bac,banking stress tests,bank of america, boa shareholder,buybacks,common stock,dividend,financial stress test,preferred shares,preferred stock,shareholder,stress test,swap, top boa investors,warren buffett,Bank of America,BAC,BACL,Berkshire Hathaway,BRKA,Federal Reserve,Wells Fargo,WFC,WFCL,Warren Buffett,financial performance,earnings,dividends,corporate funding,share capital,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,swaps,banking,commercial banking,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,credit,financial services,integrated banks"}, {"content": "Greenpoint is getting its first waterfront high-rise apartment tower to rival those in neighboring Williamsburg in Brooklyn, though with slightly lower prices: High-floor one-bedroom condos are coming on the market starting at just under $ 1 million.The glass 40-story tower at 21 India Street, known as the Greenpoint, is the first of a number of long-delayed luxury towers to move toward completion in industrial areas in Greenpoint, following a rezoning more than a decade ago to encourage waterfront redevelopment.The building is located next to a ferry landing, and a new 29,000 square-foot waterfront park.

He initially sought to run as a Republican but was disqualified because of a registration mishap.A Quinnipiac University Poll released\u00a0May 17\u00a0showed Mr. de Blasio leading both Mr. Massey and Ms. Malliotakis three-to-one.Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at CUNY Hunter, said Ms. Malliotakis is a much stronger candidate. Still, her bid to unseat Mr. de Blasio in the heavily Democratic city faces strong headwinds. Ms. Malliotakis has said she voted for President       Donald Trump,        for example, who is deeply unpopular in New York City.Mr. Massey said his partners in his real estate firm had encouraged him to run.

The pound and the Canadian dollar leapt. Yields on U.K. government bonds shot up. Yields on Treasurys and other bonds also moved higher.When and how much western central banks pull back from their unprecedented run of ultralow interest rates and quantitative easing are the foremost questions for global investors.An end to the ECB\u2019s bond buying \u201cis probably the most important supply-demand change that we can foresee in bond markets,\u201d said Tim Haywood, investment director for fixed income at Swiss money manager GAM.The prospect of an end to stimulus has lurked in the background for months but has zoomed to the fore now that signs of an economic recovery are beginning to appear in regions that have long struggled to shake off the aftereffects of the global financial crisis a decade ago, especially in Europe.Owing to aggressive bank lending and bond buying, ECB has the largest balance sheet of any global central bank.Global bond markets have been strongly interconnected, and U.S. government bonds closely tracked moves in Europe on Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.223%, up from 2.198% Tuesday. Higher yields on European government bonds make U.S. government bonds less attractive to overseas investors, who have been buying up Treasurys in search of better returns than what they can get at home.Investors had been selling government bonds and buying the euro since Tuesday, when ECB President       Mario Draghi\u2019s       comments on a \u201cstrengthening and broadening\u201d economic recovery were interpreted as a sign the central bank was preparing to trim its massive bond buying.But those moves briefly reversed on Wednesday. In an interview on CNBC,       V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio,        the ECB\u2019s vice president, suggested investors might have overreacted to Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments. An ECB spokesman declined to comment. The euro, which had neared $1.14 earlier in the day, plunged below $1.13.Then Mr. Draghi, speaking at a conference, repeated his positive outlook for the eurozone economy. By the early evening in London, the euro was at $1.1375, up 0.3% on the day.Meanwhile, Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       said on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that removal of stimulus in Britain may become necessary if the economy improves. That surprised investors, who have been counting on a very gradual withdrawal. The pound rose 1% against the dollar to $1.2937. U.K. government bond yields moved sharply higher. Yields rise as prices fall.\u201cCentral banks are stumbling here and losing a bit of credibility with mixed communications, whether that\u2019s in Europe or the U.K.,\u201d said Jon Jonsson, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman.Speaking at the same conference as Mr. Carney, Bank of Canada Governor       Stephen Poloz       said that the central bank might raise interest rates next month, sending the Canadian dollar 1.2% higher against the U.S. currency and pushing up government bond yields.The volatile trading highlights the sway central banks still hold in markets.\u201cThe central banks are the near-term likely candidates for triggering more volatility,\u201d said Mr. Jonsson, who expects yields to continue to rise.In the eurozone, a run of strong economic data has put investors on alert that the ECB will soon start to withdraw its stimulus. Most investors believe that this will start happening in 2018, but they say the ECB could signal that as soon as this September.Frederik Ducrozet, senior European economist at Pictet Wealth Management, said that he had received an unusually large number of questions about Mr. Draghi\u2019s speech on Tuesday. But he believed the market reaction that followed was largely unjustified.\u201cIt should be no surprise that Draghi sounded increasingly confident over the growth outlook,\u201d he said. The eurozone economy grew 1.8% in the first quarter of the year over the same period in 2016, compared with 1.2% in the U.S.This week\u2019s moves reminded investors of other so-called taper tantrums, when markets have tried to pre-empt central banks\u2019 scaling back their stimulus measures by selling bonds.In 2013, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply and emerging markets fell after the Federal Reserve raised the prospect of slowing its bond purchases. It is also not the first time that investors have sold off European bonds in recent years as investors anticipated an end to the stimulus.But others have cast doubt on how far bond yields can rise given continued appetite for fixed income from funds. Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said he believed that German 10-year bond yields could climb another 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point by year-end, while the euro could rise to $1.15. The 10-year bund yield traded at 0.363%\u00a0on Wednesday, up from 0.247% at\u00a0Monday\u2019s\u00a0closeOlivier de Larouzi\u00e8re, head of interest rates at Natixis Asset Management, said yield-hungry institutional investors had seen the selloff in eurozone bonds as a buying opportunity. He said his trading desk had seen flows from Japanese and French insurance companies scooping up long-dated French government bonds on Wednesday.\u201cAs soon as you get a yield pickup, you get buyers, because investors are desperate for yield,\u201d said Mr. de Larouzi\u00e8re.\u2014Tom Fairless, Sam Goldfarb and Paul Vieira contributed to this article.Write to Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 17:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-bonds-extend-selloff-on-hints-of-ecb-taper-1498638797", "news_title": "Global Bonds Gyrate as Investors Try to Parse Central Banks\u2019 Next Stimulus Moves", "keywords": " asset buys, asset purchases, bonds, bunds, draghi,ecb, euro, eurozone, government bonds, qe, stimulus, tapering,Bank of Canada,Bank of England,European Central Bank,U.K. government,euro zone,currency,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Downtown Brooklyn\u2019s cultural district is getting a new city-owned public plaza, just across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where theatergoers and shoppers can go to see and be seen.After decades as a parking lot, the site opened as a public plaza on Wednesday with a party including music and food.

The rally stalled this year as investors become less optimistic on the economy, and long-term interest rates declined.Now, factors are aligning again for a new bank rally. Long-term interest rates are rebounding, not only in the U.S. but also sharply in Europe and the U.K. This is significant since ultralow rates abroad had been acting as an anchor on U.S. rates.Even more important, major banks have now all passed the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual stress tests. On Wednesday, the Fed gave the country\u2019s biggest lenders a green light to substantially boost dividends and share buybacks.On Wednesday             Citigroup                   doubled it quarterly dividend and said it would buy back $15.6 billion of stock over the next four quarters, up from $10.4 billion in the previous stress test cycle.             Bank of America                   and             J.P. Morgan Chase                   also upped their dividends and buybacks.Analysts raised concerns last week that             Goldman Sachs                   and             Morgan Stanleymight have to scale back their capital return ambitions after they came close to hitting regulatory limits on a new measure of overall leverage in the tests. But the two banks received approval for their capital return plans anyway.Morgan Stanley boosted its quarterly dividend by 25%, and said it would buy back $5 billion of shares over the next four quarters, up from $3.5 billion the previous four.These payouts are crucial for bank shares. Not only do they go directly into shareholders\u2019 pockets, they also help the banks whittle down piles of excess capital that weigh on their returns. Particularly for lower-valued banks like Citigroup and Bank of America, reducing this dormant capital is crucial to achieving higher valuations.The only institutions that had to dial down their payout plans were two consumer lenders\u2014            Capital One Financial                   and             American Express.       The biggest negative surprise of the Fed\u2019s stress tests this year was higher-than-expected losses on credit card loans in a recession scenario. Banks have gotten more aggressive in this area in recent years.This suggests that consumer debt, including credit cards as well as auto and other personal loans, is a potential risk area for the entire sector that investors should keep an eye on.Credit losses are still very low and bank shares have rallied this week on higher rates. The Fed\u2019s tests will add to the enthusiasm.

Moeller-Maersk        AMKBY 0.55%       A/S, the world\u2019s biggest container-ship operator, has shuttered many of its ports around the world. French construction giant             Saint Gobain        CODYY 0.18%       resorted to manually operating some factory gear.The origins of the virus were still unknown early Wednesday. Security experts described the computer disruption as a cyberattack and said the virus\u2014dubbed Petya\u2014appeared to stem in part from an obscure Ukrainian tax software product. A type of \u201cransomware,\u201d the bug locks data, asks for ransom and spreads quickly from computer system to system\u2014in this case across Ukraine, Russia, Europe and the U.S. There were few reports from Asia of disruptions.The ransomware was designed to spread within corporate networks running             Microsoft Corp.\u2019s        MSFT 0.76%       Windows operating system, but didn\u2019t appear to be affecting consumers, security experts said. A Microsoft spokeswoman on Tuesday said that the company was investigating the outbreak.Companies that reported disruptions included U.S. pharmaceuticals firm             Merck                   & Co., British advertising giant             WPP Group                   PLC and Russian oil producer PAO Rosneft. Rosneft said on Twitter Wednesday that the virus hadn\u2019t affected production, but added that \u201cit is premature to evaluate the cyber attack impact.\u201dMondelez International Inc. confirmed Wednesday that it was also a victim, a day after it said it was investigating an outage of its global IT network. A spokesman said the cause was determined to be a virus, which had been isolated, though the company\u2019s systems remain down. The maker of Oreo cookies and Trident gum is working with outside specialists and global security agencies, aiming to minimize any impact on deliveries of its food to retailers.In Ukraine, the country that appeared most affected by the attack, the government said it had halted the spread of the virus and that key government and business systems were stable. But others were still struggling Wednesday to restore critical operations. One of those most severely affected: Maersk, a key cog in the world\u2019s global supply chain.Maersk said early Wednesday that widespread computer outages at its APM Terminals subsidiary were preventing it from taking new bookings or offering quotes at affected terminals. Later in the day, the company said it was accepting cargo bookings through a third-party platform for existing accounts, though booking confirmations would take longer than usual. \u201cWe are still working on resuming normal operation,\u201d the company said on Twitter.Ports in the U.S., Europe and India reported some Maersk-run container terminals weren\u2019t taking ships. Whether those APM port closures ricochet more broadly will depend on how quickly Maersk restores systems, shipping experts said.Coordinating ship arrivals, unloading containers and then scheduling storage and trucks to move products out of ports requires a high degree of coordination and efficiency. A big bottleneck in a single port can reverberate widely and quickly.\u201cThe longer it drags on the more the entire logistics chain will be disrupted,\u201d said Lars Jensen, chief executive of CyberKeel, a Copenhagen advisory firm in maritime cybersecurity. \u201cThe ships can be operated manually but if you don\u2019t have access to your operational and commercial databases you won\u2019t know where your containers are.\u201d\u200bMaersk Line vessels are maneuverable, able to communicate and crews are safe, Maersk said.APM terminals in New Jersey and Los Angeles were closed Wednesday. The Port of New York and New Jersey said the New Jersey terminal would be closed Thursday as well. The Dutch port of Rotterdam, one of Europe\u2019s biggest, said Wednesday that two container terminals operated by Maersk\u2019s APM had stopped activities. \u201cThe port is still running at three quarters of its capacity,\u201d said Martijn Pols, a spokesman with the Port of Rotterdam.Several Saint Gobain factories were recovering Wednesday, including a plant in Amboise, France, that produces abrasive wheels, used to cut metal.\u201cAt first there was panic on board,\u201d said one Saint Gobain employee who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. \u201cWe\u2019re having to operate some of the machines manually because the hack infected some of our IT systems.\u201dAt the company\u2019s plant in Conflans, IT workers were going from computer to computer and implementing software patches to machines not already affected.A spokeswoman for Saint-Gobain said it had been affected by the virus and had isolated computer systems to protect data. \u201cOur production lines are still operational and we continue to serve our clients,\u201d she said.\u2014Jennifer Smith in New York, Valentina Pop in Brussels, Pietro Lombardi in Rome and Anant Kala in New Delhi contributed  to this article.Write to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com and Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Cyberattack\u2019s Fallout Fuels Scramble.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 17:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fallout-from-global-cyberattack-extends-into-second-day-1498639146", "news_title": "Companies Try to Contain Fallout From Global Cyberattack", "keywords": "bitcoin,cyberattack,global cyber attack , maersk, merck,petya,ransomware,rosneft,ukraine,Microsoft,MSFT,Compagnie de Saint-Gobain,SGO.FR,A.P.

NKE 0.21%       is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by FactSet expect Nike to report net income of $844 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $846 million, or 49 cents a share, a year ago.REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts are expecting $8.6 billion in quarterly sales, compared with $8.2 billion last year.WHAT TO WATCH:IT\u2019S THE SHOES: While the fourth quarter typically isn\u2019t Nike\u2019s biggest in terms of revenue, the company often provides details on strategy and category-specific revenue, such as those for running, basketball and the Jordan brand. Those metrics may give investors clues as to what sneaker might dethrone             Adidas AG\u2019s       Stan Smiths.             Foot Locker Inc.       CEO Dick Johnson noted last spring that the white tennis shoe trend, which made Adidas a hot property, was cooling off. A successor, if Nike and its marketing machine have their way, is its new Air VaporMax.AMAZON: After holding out for years, Nike has agreed to sell some of its products through             Amazon.com Inc.,       a deal that underscores the online retailer\u2019s increasing power to lure brands to its site. What isn\u2019t yet clear is what Nike goods will appear there. The swoosh has long been adept at developing and selling different product lines to different retailers, so that Foot Locker and             Kohl\u2019s Corp.      , for example, don\u2019t carry the same items. Analysts are likely to seek more information on Nike\u2019s strategy as it collaborates with Amazon.DOWNSIZING: In a rare, pre-earnings release earlier this month, Nike said it would cut 2% of its workforce -- more than 1,000 jobs -- as well as 25% of the products it makes, efforts to stave off slumping sales. Data from industry tracker NPD Group show Nike\u2019s U.S. retail market share for athletic footwear has dropped by 1 percentage point to 50% this year through May, while rival Adidas\u2019s share rose to 11% over the same period. How will Nike\u2019s cutbacks affect its outlook for the coming fiscal year, especially considering it is aiming for $50 billion in revenue by 2020?ORDERS AND INVENTORY: Nike has tweaked its reporting metrics, taking a closely watched one known as futures orders, or wholesale orders scheduled to ship in the next six months, off its earnings release. It now typically discusses them during its call with analysts, a move it says is tied to its lessening reliance on the wholesale business. In a research report earlier this month, Stifel analyst       Jim Duffy       predicted that Nike\u2019s inventory growth rates will fall to 3.9%, from 7.5% in the previous quarter.Write to Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 17:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-earnings-what-to-watch-1498685253", "news_title": "Nike Earnings: What to Watch ", "keywords": "air jordans,airvapors,athletic clothes,earning preview,shoes,sneakers,stan smiths,swoosh,Nike,NKE,Adidas,ADS.XE,Foot Locker,FL,financial performance,earnings,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,clothing,textiles,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods,sports goods,sports clothing,footwear"}, {"content": "Key-Ventures Inc., a boutique brokerage that has been a fixture on the Upper East Side world of white glove co-ops for more than four decades, is closing its Park Avenue office and moving to             Berkshire Hathaway                   HomeServices\u2019s newly established New York operation.The co-managing principals at Key-Ventures,       A.

For Blue Apron and still-private firms in need of cash, the stumble shows public investors aren\u2019t necessarily going to embrace high-profile companies with lofty valuations.Blue Apron filed early Wednesday to lower the expected price range for its shares to $10 to $11 apiece, below the $15 to $17 it sought earlier, according to regulatory filings. Such a cut is relatively rare: Since the start of 2012, 10% of U.S.-listed IPOs have lowered their ranges, doing it by an average of 34%, according to Dealogic.If the company prices shares at $10, the low end of its expected range, the company would be valued at about $1.9 billion, below the $2 billion it was valued at in a 2015 fundraising round by investors such as Fidelity Investments.Blue Apron sends a box full of gourmet ingredients and recipe instructions to customers, who pay $10 per individual meal for the service.Potential IPO investors expressed concern about Blue Apron\u2019s prospects for profitability, according to fund managers and analysts. The company\u2019s revenues have been growing, but it has posted net losses each year since its inception, and those losses have been growing. Marketing costs as a percentage of revenue has also climbed in recent years. In the first quarter, marketing costs rose to 25% of revenues, up from 15% a year earlier.Blue Apron\u2019s disclosures show its cash on hand is shrinking. It tapped Fidelity for $64 million of additional financing in May at its 2015 share price, an unusual move so close to an IPO.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see what the bull case is,\u201d said       Sean Stiefel,        portfolio manager at Navy Capital LLC. Mr. Stiefel\u2019s firm participated in recent IPOs by social-media company             Snap Inc.       and enterprise software companies Appian Inc. and             Okta Inc.Peter Lee,        a data scientist at Triton Research LLC, which analyzes pre-IPO companies, said that Blue Apron will likely impress some investors with its consistent revenue growth, but it\u2019s unclear how it will transform into a company with strong profit margins given the complexity of food distribution and lack of customer loyalty.Daniel McCarthy,        a professor of marketing at Emory University, analyzed Blue Apron\u2019s numbers and estimated that roughly 60% of customers stop using the service after six months.Mr. Stiefel added that his concerns about Blue Apron deepened after             Amazon.com Inc.       announced its plan to acquire             Whole Foods Market Inc.earlier this month.Amazon\u2019s announcement came days before Blue Apron launched its cross-country roadshow to pitch its stock offering to investors. The deal shook shares of grocers and raised the prospect of heightened competition in the online food delivery market. While startups like Blue Apron were among the first to offer meal-kit services on a subscription basis, conventional grocery stores are increasingly launching their own versions to try to keep market share. For instance,             Kroger Co.       last month launched a series of meal kits at the supermarket chain\u2019s Cincinnati stores.While Blue Apron is smaller than other high-profile private companies Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., it is one of the first well-known startups to test the market since Snap Inc. went public in March. Any IPO hiccup could act as a deterrent to these and other private companies, some analysts say.At the middle of its new targeted range, Blue Apron would raise $315 million in its IPO, less than the $480 million the company and its underwriters had expected a week before. At $16 a share, the midpoint of its earlier price range, Blue Apron would have been valued at about $3 billion.Overall, the market for IPOs this year has been relatively robust after a rough 2016.U.S.-listed IPOs have raised about $27 billion so far this year, dwarfing the $8.1 billion raised by IPOs at this point last year, according to Dealogic. Technology companies have raised $5.9 billion in 2017, compared with just under $900 million at this point last year.This year\u2019s class of IPOs have performed well after their stock market debuts, too. Shares of companies that debuted in 2017 are up roughly 11% from their IPO prices through Tuesday\u2019s close, and tech IPOs are up about 25% in that period, Dealogic data shows. That outpaces the S&P 500\u2019s 8.1% gain in 2017 through Tuesday.Even if Blue Apron\u2019s shares price poorly, its stock could still perform well when it starts trading. For instance, hotel-search company             Trivago N.V.       priced its IPO below its projected range at $11 apiece in December. Its stock climbed in its first day of trading, and closed at $20.95 on Wednesday.Blue Apron is set to price its IPO later Wednesday, according to people familiar with the offering, and start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol APRN on Thursday.             Goldman Sachs                   is leading the deal.\u2014Maureen Farrell and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com and Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 17:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blue-apron-chops-its-ipo-price-range-1498652104", "news_title": "Blue Apron, Struggling to Woo Investors, Lowers Price Range for IPO", "keywords": "blue apron,blue apron ipo,food startups,ipo,ipo market,ipos,meal delivery,startups,vc ma,Blue Apron Holdings,Bessemer Venture Partners,Fidelity Investments,Appian,corporate changes,stock listings,analysts' comments,recommendations,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,beverages,tobacco,consumer goods,e-commerce,food products,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "The Federal Reserve conditionally approved             Capital One Financial Corp.\u2019s        COF -0.23%       capital plan in the regulator\u2019s annual \u201cstress tests,\u201d saying the firm will have to resubmit its plan later this year to address shortcomings in its process.Capital One\u2019s plan was approved Wednesday after the Fed found the bank could keep lending in a severe economic downturn. The approval clears the way for the firm to reward investors by returning more capital.But the Fed didn\u2019t give Capital One a clean pass. Rather, the firm received a \u201cconditional non-objection\u201d after the Fed said Capital One \u201cexhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning practices.\u201d Capital One must resubmit its plan by Dec. 28. If the revised plan doesn\u2019t satisfy the Fed, the regulator said that it may restrict the firm\u2019s capital distributions.However, Capital One was also one of just two firms to revise lower its capital-return request since results from the first round of stress tests were released last week. If it hadn\u2019t revised its request, its hypothetical common equity Tier 1 ratio would have fallen to 5.6%.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear why Capital One revised its request since its initial results didn\u2019t breach any of the Fed\u2019s required minimum capital ratios.The other firm to revise its request lower was             American Express Co.The bank is \u201cfully committed to addressing the Federal Reserve\u2019s concerns with our capital planning process in a timely manner.\u201d said       Richard Fairbank,        Capital One chairman and chief executive officer, in a company statement. The bank said it expects to maintain its quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share, subject to board approval. Its board has approved the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of the company\u2019s common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2017 through the second quarter of 2018.In after-hours trading, following the stress-test results, shares of Capital One fell 2.3% to $81.05.The Fed\u2019s test report criticized Capital One\u2019s senior management for not being \u201cin a position to\u00a0provide the firm\u2019s board of directors with a reliable assessment upon which to determine the reasonableness of the capital plan.\u201d Capital One\u2019s capital plan didn\u2019t appropriately take into account the potential impact of the risks in one of its most material businesses, according to the Fed, which didn\u2019t specify which business. The report added that the bank\u2019s internal controls didn\u2019t identify those issues.Capital One was the only bank to receive conditional approval. But other banks have received similar results in years past, including Morgan Stanley last year. Its revised plan was eventually accepted.This is the latest in a string of run ins with regulators for Capital One. That has included a consent order\u00a0with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency over deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering program. In February, Capital One disclosed that it was\u00a0under investigation\u00a0by the New York District Attorney\u2019s Office, the Justice Department and the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for similar issues.\u00a0The company has said it is cooperating with the agencies.The stress tests measure how the banks would fare in a severe recession. The results did find that Capital One has the capital to keep lending in a severe economic downturn. At the low point of a hypothetical recession, Capital One\u2019s common equity Tier 1 ratio would be 5.9%, exceeding the 4.5% level the Fed views as a minimum, the central bank estimated.Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com and Christina Rexrode at christina.rexrode@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 17:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/capital-one-gets-conditional-passing-grade-on-fed-stress-test-1498683178", "news_title": "Capital One Gets \u2018Conditional\u2019 Passing Grade on Fed Stress Test ", "keywords": "capital one, capital one financial, capital plan, capital ratio, conditionally, fed, federal reserve, fed stress tests, stress test,Capital One Financial,COF,Federal Reserve,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,banking,credit types,services,credit cards,credit,financial services,plastic cards,regional banks"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014The U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority issued a damning critique of the country\u2019s $7 trillion asset-management industry, condemning weak price competition and performance in a sector it says needs a substantial overhaul.The regulator on Wednesday set out an extensive range of remedies to drive competition and transparency, including introducing a single \u201call-in fee\u201d and an increased duty on fund managers to act in the best interest of investors.The report stops short of the industry\u2019s worst-case scenario\u2014referring the entire sector to competition authorities\u2014but fund managers will have to grapple with a call for major changes.It comes as London\u2019s financial district faces competition from other financial centers following 2016\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and as it gears up to implement significant regulatory changes, including Europewide modifications to rules governing financial firms in January 2018.Scrutiny of fees and transparency in the world\u2019s second-largest investment market is likely to reignite an industrywide debate on pricing and the benefits of active or passive investing, industry participants said.\u201cI think regulators in every jurisdiction are going to be looking at this report,\u201d said       Dan Brocklebank,        head of U.K. for investment manager Orbis Investment Management Ltd. \u201cAll regulators are confronted with the same problem: They have to protect consumers in the market who are faced with an overcomplex, opaque product,\u201d Mr. Brocklebank said.Richard Withers,        head of policy for Europe at U.S. fund company Vanguard Group, said European regulators would be closely watching the U.K.\u2019s actions. \u201cThere is very significant interest at an EU level as to what is happening in the U.K. I think the U.K. is influencing the direction of travel,\u201d Mr. Withers said.The FCA\u2019s action is also likely to increase the pressure on money managers who actively manage funds. Active fund managers are facing competition from cheaper passive funds, which are snatching market share by offering lower fees in exchange for attempting to match an index, rather than trying to beat it. While the FCA was clear it doesn\u2019t favor either strategy, it said some actively managed funds were found to offer similar exposure to passive funds, while charging significantly more.The regulator\u2019s analysis showed \u00a3109 billion ($139.7 billion) is invested in actively managed funds that are more expensive than passive funds but offer little discernible benefit as they also closely mirror the market. It added both actively and passively managed funds didn\u2019t usually outperform their own benchmarks after fees.Among its most harsh findings, the FCA outlined widespread concerns about the value investors receive and the relationship between price and performance throughout the industry. It said investment firms didn\u2019t typically compete on price and tended not to lower them to win new business. The regulator also said there is considerable price clustering in some parts of the market.The FCA said it would push for a single all-in fee for investors, which the industry has previously lobbied against, a move that could hit profitability in the sector. An all-in fee would include asset-management charges and trading costs.In an interim report in November, the FCA said it was considering referring the entire investment-advisory sector to the U.K.\u2019s competition authority.The sector provides a range of services, from manager-selection advice to managing assets for institutional investors, particularly pension funds. Wednesday\u2019s report said the regulator would make a final decision in September on whether to request competition authorities review the industry. The FCA has also requested the U.K. Treasury be given oversight of investment consultants.The report follows an 18-month investigation, which included meetings with 135 organizations. The FCA said it had consulted widely on the proposals. The regulator said improvements in getting good value for investments could have a significant positive impact on U.K. pension systems and savings.Sean Hagerty,        managing director for Vanguard Europe, said the report\u2019s publication is an important moment.\u201cCosts matter. Every pound that investors pay in charges is a pound out of their potential returns, reducing their chances of being able to afford a comfortable retirement or save for a mortgage deposit,\u201d Mr. Hagerty said.Vanguard, the world\u2019s second-largest money manager by assets, has looked to capitalize on the shifting regulatory landscape in the U.K. and last month launched a low-cost fund aimed at individual investors.\u201cFund and platform fees in the U.K. are high. This is about value for money for investors across the board,\u201d Mr. Hagerty said.Martin Gilbert,        chief executive of             Aberdeen Asset Management,       said the FCA\u2019s recommendations are constructive and sensible.\u201cWith investment risk increasingly being passed down from governments and employers to individuals, it is crucial that asset management evolves to meet this new world,\u201d Mr. Gilbert said.Many of the proposals will now be put out for further consultation.\u2014This story is from WSJ City -- fast, fact-packed intelligence from London https://city.wsj.com/articles/Write to Philip Georgiadis at philip.georgiadis@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 17:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-regulator-calls-for-major-shake-up-of-asset-management-industry-1498637039", "news_title": "Giant Fund Industry Charges Too Much, British Regulator Says", "keywords": "asset management companies, fca, financial conduct authority,investment advisors, pension funds,Financial Conduct Authority,Vanguard Group,Orbis Investment Management,FCA,Martin Gilbert,Dan Brocklebank,Richard Withers,Sean Hagerty,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private pension funds,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,credit,financial services,investing,securities,pension funds,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "The U.S. dollar tumbled Wednesday as a string of foreign central bankers hinted they could soon move away from ultraloose monetary policy, sparking big rallies in the euro, British pound and Canadian dollar.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, fell 0.4% to 88.

A formal restructuring process began in Azerbaijan in April, court paper show.The bank, which is owned by the Azerbaijani government, sought chapter 15 protection last month to help it restructure $3.3 billion in bad loans. With a judge\u2019s approval, chapter 15 provides foreign companies with the full benefits of U.S. bankruptcy law, including those that halt lawsuits and block creditors from seizing assets.A group of the Azerbaijani bank\u2019s international creditors, namely U.S. and European investors facing big losses on bondholdings, had complained that the plan was fundamentally unfair and designed to shortchange them.Bondholders say a voting process has been skewed to benefit the bank\u2019s owners, noting that if they vote against the plan or abstain from voting, their ultimate recovery will be substantially less than if they vote to support it.\u201cThe whole process has been allowed to preference local creditors,\u201d Fredric Sosnick, a lawyer for the bondholders, said during a court hearing last week.But to halt recognition, the bondholders had to clear a high legal bar, showing that chapter 15 recognition would be \u201cmanifestly contrary to the public policy of the United States.\u201dIn his ruling\u00a0Wednesday, Judge Garrity said issues raised by the bondholders \u201cdid not rise to the level of violating fundamental U.S. principles.\u201dCourt papers show the objecting bondholders, owed $220 million, include funds and accounts managed by Fidelity Management & Research Co., Franklin Templeton Investment Management Ltd., Promeritum Investment Management LLP and VR Global Partners LP.The International Bank of Azerbaijan has over 750,000 customers in Azerbaijan and abroad and says it provides a critical economic link between Azerbaijan and the rest of the world.Thomas MacWright, a lawyer for the bank, told Judge Garrity that U.S. recognition of its restructuring process was \u201ccritical to that country\u2019s banking sector and economy.\u201dMr. MacWright also pointed to the fact that the objecting bondholder group holds less the 10% of the bank\u2019s overall debt. And he said that Cargill Financial Services International Inc., the bank\u2019s largest creditor owed $715 million, supports its chapter 15 petition.With chapter 15 approved and with similar protections granted in the U.K., a court in Azerbaijan is next slated to hold a hearing on the bank\u2019s restructuring plan. Once the plan is approved in its home country, the bank will have to return to Judge Garrity to seek enforcement of its terms in the U.S.Azerbaijan is a small oil-rich country on the Caspian Sea, nestled between Russia and Iran.

The work had been expected to sell for up to $35 million but Mr. Nathan said afterward it was worth more because \u201cKandinsky is synonymous with the birth of abstraction, which must rank among the most important developments in art history, so the artist has an iconic status.\u201d\u201cWhite Lines\u201d also hailed from a key year in the artist\u2019s development, 1913, when Kandinsky began experimenting with using color as a subject matter, rather than employing colors to fill in the lines of something figurative. Other pieces he painted in 1913 now hang in institutions like St. Petersburg\u2019s Hermitage Museum. Mr. Nathan said collectors consider 1913 a \u201ceureka moment\u201d for the artist, a connection that made \u201cWhite Lines\u201d even more appealing.Earlier in the same sale, Kandinsky\u2019s 1909 German street scene, \u201cMurnau\u2014Landscape with Green House,\u201d sold to a German telephone bidder for $26.4 million. A teal-colored tribal scene the artist painted in 1943, \u201cFour Figures on Three Squares,\u201d also sold within estimate for $586,003.Kandinsky has been on a roll during the past year. Last fall, Christie\u2019s established a new auction high when it sold his 1935 \u201cRigid and Curved\u201d for $23.3 million, but other examples of his signature style\u2014roiling lines mingled with patches of color\u2014remain relatively scarce. Sotheby\u2019s said his \u201cGreen House\u201d got a boost because it had been tucked away in a private collection since the 1920s.Heading into these sales, Sotheby\u2019s had been under more pressure than usual because its lockstep rival, Christie\u2019s, decided to forgo conducting its traditional June sale of contemporary art in London but continue with sales of older art, creating a lopsided series. Collectors showed up all the same for the tilted line-up, buying $223 million worth of art at Christie\u2019s during the series, including additional sales of British and Irish art. Christie\u2019s hits included Max Beckmann\u2019s $45.8 million \u201cBirds\u2019 Hell\u201d from 1937-38, which was bought Tuesday by New York dealer Larry Gagosian, and Pablo Picasso\u2019s \u201cWoman Writing (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se),\u201d which sold for $44.4 million.For its part, Sotheby\u2019s sold at least $268 million, including Joan Miro\u2019s 1940 \u201cWoman and Birds\u201d that sold for $30 million and Alberto Giacometti\u2019s gold-tinged bronze \u201cGrand Figure\u201d of a woman from 1947 that sold for $22.6 million. Besides the Warhol, other hits of its Wednesday contemporary art sale included an untitled Jean-Michel Basquiat from 1983 that sold for $8.4 million and Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s 1983 \u201cTwo Paintings with Dado,\u201d that sold for $4.3 million.London\u2019s sales end Thursday with boutique auctioneer Phillips\u2019 sale of contemporary art.Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'London Sales Buoy Art Recovery.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 16:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/london-sales-help-art-market-recovery-1498681796", "news_title": "London Sales Help Art-Market Recovery", "keywords": "financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,art,art collecting,auctions,political,general news,arts,entertainment,retail,wholesale,specialty stores,art dealing,auction houses"}, {"content": "JERUSALEM\u2014Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shifted closer to his ultraorthodox coalition partners on a controversial religious issue, sparking fresh tension with more liberal American Jewish groups that accuse the leader of putting his political survival before their interests.Mr. Netanyahu earlier this week suspended a previously agreed plan to allow Reform and Conservative movements of Judaism to help administer the religion\u2019s Western Wall shrine. Members of his government also proposed a bill in parliament that would allow only Israel\u2019s ultraorthodox-dominated Jewish authority, known as the Chief Rabbinate, to administer and determine who can convert to the religion.The moves have rekindled longstanding strains between Israel\u2019s rabbinate and the Reform and Conservative movements in the U.S. that take a more progressive approach to interpreting Judaism\u2019s laws and want equal standing in administering the faith and its holy shrines. Some American Jewish groups are now threatening to cut donations and investment to Israel that could amount to billions of dollars.\u201cIf you cause Jews in the diaspora, particularly Jews of the United States to feel alienated\u2026it has a strategic impact that should be of great concern to all the leaders of Israel,\u201d said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism in North America, in a broadcast Wednesday on Israel\u2019s Army Radio.His group, which represents roughly 2 million American Jews, \u200b canceled a planned Thursday meeting with Mr. Netanyahu in protest over the Israeli government\u2019s position on the religious conversion bill and the Western Wall.The shrine is one of Judaism\u2019s holiest sites and the last of the four walls that abutted the Temple Mount compound in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, where an ancient Jewish temple once stood. The Temple Mount, known as Haram al Sharif to Muslims, is now the location of the Al Aqsa mosque, one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites.President       Donald Trump       became the first sitting U.S. leader to visit the Western Wall on a trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories last month.Israel\u2019s rabbinate has long had a monopoly on many important religious matters in Israel, such as marriage, divorce and modes of worship. This stems from the political sway ultraorthodox parties wield as longstanding kingmakers in governing coalitions. Animosity between the ultraorthodox and Reform and Conservative movements goes back decades. Most Jews in America practice the more liberal Reform and Conservative forms of Judaism.The U.S. groups have long accused the Israeli government of being beholden to ultraorthodox parties. The two ultraorthodox parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, have 13 members in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fragile 66-member governing coalition in a parliament that holds 120 seats.\u201cWe are not willing to give a foothold here to the Reform. We don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Yaakov Litzman, health minister and member of the ultraorthodox political party United Torah Judaism, told Army Radio on Wednesday.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s move has faced criticism from opposition leaders and members of his own government, including hard-line Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the Yisrael Beiteinu party. The Jewish Agency, a body that facilitates Jewish immigration to Israel, also openly criticized the government\u2019s decision.About 4.2 million American adults \u200bsaid they were Jewish by religion, according a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center.\u201cThe representatives of U.S. Jewry feel they were slapped in the face by the Israeli government and that they are apparently no longer welcome here,\u201d said Naftali Bennett, who is also leader of the Jewish Home party in the governing coalition and minister of diaspora affairs. \u200b \u201cThis isn\u2019t true. The Jews of the U.S. are \u200bwelcomed and loved.\u201dMr. Netanyahu\u2019s office has said his government has only suspended the planned agreement on the Western Wall and discussions are ongoing to come to a compromise. The proposed bill on religious conversions will have to pass three votes in parliament to become law.\u201cThis despicable decision sends an unmistakable message to diaspora Jewry, one of divisions and of alienation,\u201d said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and deputy minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s office who is against the government suspension.Israel\u2019s government in January 2016 announced a deal that would give Reform and Conservative movements access to the Western Wall from the main entrance and included participation on a council to administer the site. The ultraorthodox rabbinate currently controls access to the main entrance and segregates men and women. Visitors currently can access a small mixed-gender area for prayer from a side entrance.Write to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Israel\u2019s Shift Upsets U.S. Groups.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 16:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-leans-closer-to-ultra-orthodox-jews-upsets-u-s-groups-1498681750", "news_title": "Israel Leans Closer to Ultra-Orthodox Jews, Upsets U.S. Groups", "keywords": "political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,religion"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014France\u2019s new government laid out its plans to remake the country\u2019s decades-old labor regulations, opening President       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       effort to give the eurozone\u2019s second-biggest economy the vigor it has long lacked.Mr. Macron wants to revise more than 3,000 pages of labor rules that employers say discourage hiring by making it complicated and financially risky to dismiss workers. His proposals include capping fines for unfair dismissals and giving companies more leeway to work around rules set by unions.\u201cThe world is changing and it\u2019s changing fast,\u201d said Labor Minister       Muriel P\u00e9nicaud,        who used to head human resources at French dairy company             Danone SA      . \u201cWe are obliged to change our social model.\u201dThe proposals will be refined and amended over the summer in preparation for the government to decree the changes in September.Revising the labor laws is a major test of Mr. Macron\u2019s authority, two months after he won election as president by putting such change at the heart of his campaign.The success or failure of his mission to reinvigorate France\u2019s economy will shape the future of the European Union and its shared currency, the euro. France\u2019s stagnation paired with neighbor Germany\u2019s recent strength has left the bloc\u2019s economy and politics deeply unbalanced. Recent optimism that the EU is turning a corner and leaving a crisis-hit decade behind it rests to a large extent on hopes that France can shake off its malaise.The country suffers from a litany of problems that most other continental European countries have tackled with greater determination in recent years. French unemployment has been stubbornly high since the 1980s. Rigid labor regulations and high payroll taxes have deterred business from hiring workers on indefinite contracts with full benefits.Mr. Macron\u2019s agenda mimics in some ways Germany\u2019s reforms in the early 2000s under then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who made widespread changes to labor rules and the welfare state, as well as overhauls in the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In all cases, the goal was to protect Europe\u2019s cherished \u201csocial model\u201d of capitalism with a strong safety net, while adapting it to the competitive pressures of globalization.Mr. Macron\u2019s labor overhaul is the most politically charged part of his agenda, but its economic efficacy will depend on nitty-gritty details yet to be defined, as well as on corporate shake-ups, consumer and investor confidence, and a wider package of policy overhauls,The current economic climate favors Mr. Macron. The Bank of France recently raised its economic forecasts, saying it expects a rebalancing of the domestic economy with more foreign demand. And the consumer confidence reading jumped in June to its highest level in a decade.Economists, business people and labor lawyers have also welcomed the thrust of Mr. Macron\u2019s proposals. \u201cIf Mr. Macron takes this through to the end, it will be a really deep reform of the labor code,\u201d said       Baudouin de Moucheron,        a senior partner specializing in labor law at the law firm Gide Loyrette Nouel.French companies have refrained from commenting on the preparations of new labor laws, avoiding being tarnished by a perennially controversial debate in France. But business federations have long said that restrictive labor laws are the primary hurdle discouraging foreign companies from investing and native businesses from expanding.\u201cReforming our labor laws is urgent, imperative, vital,\u201d       Pierre Gattaz,        the head of France\u2019s laregest business lobby Medef, said earlier this month.A crucial aspect of Mr. Macron\u2019s plan is to let companies negotiate some working conditions with their employees in ways that depart from sector-wide agreements between unions and employers\u2019 federations. Giving individual companies more flexibility in this way would make French labor relations more like those in Germany, where pragmatic deals between companies\u2019 management and workers\u2019 representatives are widely credited with boosting the competitiveness of many industries and with saving jobs in downturns.But some economists warn that small French companies, which the government says hold the key to stronger growth and lower unemployment, may lack the size and institutional know-how to embark on negotiations with their employees. Olivier Passet, economist at French business consultancy Xerfi, notes that big companies used a 2003 law to negotiate overtime pay with employees and drive down costs, while small companies typically pay more because they stick to sector-wide scales.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that changing the law in France is the most effective way of rebalancing big and small companies,\u201d Mr. Passet said.Other proposed measures include capping the cost for companies of legal settlements when laid-off workers go to court. Business lobbies in France and elsewhere in Europe have long complained that the time and unpredictable expense of laying off workers is a strong deterrent to hiring.The government also presented measures that Mr. Macron hadn\u2019t flagged during the campaign, including a plan for a new type of labor contract tied to the duration of a project. It also wants to change rules for determining whether an international company can justify layoffs in France, a move that is likely to anger labor unions. Currently, many companies are barred from laying off employees if a subsidiary in another part of the world is considered in good financial health.The French leader says the changes to employment regulations are needed to restore France\u2019s credibility in Europe. Mr. Macron says that unless the country brings its labor laws more in line with its European peers, he will struggle to push Germany and the eurozone\u2019s richest members to provide a larger financial backstop for the bloc to cushion against future shocks.German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       signaled last week she is open to talking about some of Mr. Macron\u2019s more ambitious demands for Europe, such as a eurozone budget and eurozone finance minister. But officials in Berlin still want to see evidence the youngest ever French president is making progress on labor reform.Making deep changes to French labor laws proved too great a challenge for many of Mr. Macron\u2019s predecessors. The government of Socialist leader       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande,        in which Mr. Macron served as economy minister, repeatedly scaled back attempts to change labor laws when faced with organized opposition.To overcome the opposition, Mr. Macron is moving quickly to capitalize on his popularity among French voters. The National Assembly, where he won a commanding majority in elections earlier this month, is expected next month to give the government the power to change employment regulations by decree, a procedure that reduces the risk of lengthy and divisive parliamentary tussles. The government will then negotiate the details of the decrees with unions over the remainder of the summer, a period during which unions traditionally struggle to organize large strikes or demonstrations.The radical leftist union CGT has called for a day of strikes and demonstrations on September 12, but other unions are cautious and haven\u2019t yet launched nationwide efforts to oppose Mr. Macron.\u201cI am neither naive nor suspicious,\u201d       Jean-Claude Mailly,        head of the Force Ouvri\u00e8re, said Wednesday in an interview with French daily Le Monde. \u201cThe negotiation isn\u2019t useless,\u201d he added.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com and Marcus Walker at marcus.walker@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'France Opens Bid to Recast Labor Rules.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 16:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/macron-outlines-plans-to-overhaul-frances-labor-laws-1498660870", "news_title": "Macron Outlines Plans to Overhaul France\u2019s Labor Laws", "keywords": "france economy,france eurozone,france germany,france politics,Danone,DANOY,BN.FR,Emmanuel Macron,plans,strategy,regulation,government policy,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,recruitment,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,food,beverages,tobacco,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "S\u00c3O PAULO\u2014More than three years into a vast antigraft scandal that once sparked massive protests and a former Brazilian leader\u2019s ouster, a wide swath of society is fed up with political instability.\u200bThis craving for normalcy goes a long way to explain why few \u200bBrazilians are protesting President       Michel Temer\u2019s       government despite the corruption charges leveled against him this week and his \u200bprofound unpopularity. He has a 7% \u200bapproval rating, the lowest in a generation.From bankers to builders and millionaires to slum-dwellers, many Brazilians are tacitly choosing stability over rule of law. That, many observers say, may help Mr. Temer cling onto power until his mandate ends next year.\u201cI\u2019m sick of watching about all this on TV every night. We just want an end to the chaos,\u201d       Edilson Sousa,        29, said on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0from his makeshift restaurant in one\u00a0of\u00a0S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s biggest slums. \u201cElections are next year anyway so why not just let Temer stay until then?\u201dBrazil\u2019s top prosecutor filed criminal charges against Mr. Temer on Monday, accusing him of accepting about $150,000 in bribes in the so-called Car Wash corruption scandal. The president denies the allegations.For Mr. Temer to face trial, two-thirds of Brazil\u2019s lower house of Congress must approve. But with scores of legislators accused of corruption and other crimes\u2014including rape and murder\u2014Congress may be reluctant to turn against the president without public pressure, said       Rafael Cortez,        a political scientist at S\u00e3o Paulo-based consultancy Tend\u00eancias.\u201cThe lack of big street protests against Temer puts less pressure on Congress to end his mandate,\u201d Mr. Cortez said.Academics, pollsters and other commentators attribute Brazilians\u2019 apparent acquiescence not just to simple protest fatigue but also to a fear of the unknown. With no appealing alternative to Mr. Temer on the horizon, many Brazilians worry that ousting him would only stir more political instability, jeopardizing the country\u2019s incipient economic recovery.\u201cThere is just nobody left to take Temer\u2019s place who could make things better\u2014not on the right, nor on the left,\u201d said       Katia Gomes da Costa,        a feminist activist. She had come to S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s main Paulista Avenue\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night, not to protest but to play Pok\u00e9mon Go.Not everyone agrees with that assessment.Marcelo Kayath,        founding partner at QMS Capital and former head of Latin American Securities at             Credit Suisse,       said the economic overhauls Brazil needs might be more successful under another leader. \u00a0\u201cI want to see all corrupt politicians go to jail,\u201d Mr. Kayath said. \u201cTemer doesn\u2019t represent stability anymore so if we can\u2019t have stability, we might as well have justice.\u201dBrazilians widely support the Car Wash investigation itself, which has unearthed a multibillion-dollar scheme in which companies bribed politicians of all major parties in exchange for government contracts, state loans and other favors. An Ipsos poll in May showed 95% of Brazilians want the investigation to continue.       S\u00e9rgio Moro,        the investigative judge leading the probe, is now a national hero.But Brazilians are reluctant to remove another president so shortly after protests led to President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s impeachment in August.       Rafael Alcadipani,        an academic at the\u00a0Getulio\u00a0Vargas Foundation, a business school, said protest leaders are doing little to encourage street demonstrations since many of them are now tied to parties tarnished in the Car Wash scandal.\u201cIf a new group or protest leader emerges that is able to tap into this frustration the street demonstrations may explode again,\u201d he said.The president of Brazil\u2019s National Industry Confederation,       Robson Andrade,        said in an interview with Brazil\u2019s Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper before the widely anticipated charges this week against Mr. Temer that he believed business owners largely wanted the president to remain in power.\u201cIt\u2019s better to keep going ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been enough\u00a0turbulence.\u201dMr. Temer\u2019s own defense strategy has centered on positioning himself as a figure of stability. In a defiant speech\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0in which he denied the charges, he said his accusers \u201cwanted to bring the country to a halt.\u201dWhen he took over from Ms. Rousseff ten months ago, Mr. Temer promised to pull the country out of a recession and revamp a near-insolvent pension system. While analysts now expect Mr. Temer to pass only watered-down reforms at best, the country has at least now returned to growth, albeit tepid, and Brazil\u2019s once stubbornly-high inflation rate is at a decade low.\u201cI\u2019d like to see him stay, but only because getting rid of a second president would only scare investors even more,\u201d said       Bruno Manzoli,        who works for a railroad logistics company in S\u00e3o Paulo.A controlling shareholder of a national retail chain said he also wanted to keep Mr. Temer in power because ousting him might allow former President       Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva       and his leftist Workers\u2019 Party to reclaim the presidency.\u201cIf Lula comes back it would be chaos, so anything is better than that,\u201d he said.Dorival Mata-Machado, director at Data Popular polling firm, said poorer Brazilians are even more likely to be concerned with issues of stability than bringing corrupt politicians to justice.\u201cOther issues such as education, health, housing and even hunger rank highly for them,\" he said.\u2014Jeffrey T.

Market participants noted that the latest changes to storage levels may have been influenced by disruptions from Tropical Storm Cindy.Wednesday\u2019s move continued a rebound from when prices fell into bear market territory last week, helped by bargain hunters and reports of cyberattacks on global businesses impacting shipping giant A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S and Russian oil producer PAO Rosneft.Oil prices are \u201ccoming back from the brink,\u201d said       Mark Waggoner,        president of Excel Futures. \u201cIt was right on the edge\u2026That tells us we\u2019re back in the trading range.\u201dOil recently returned to a bear market even as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a handful of nations outside the cartel have cut global supply by about 2% with the aim of easing a supply glut. But despite efforts by the major oil producers, global stocks remain elevated and investors are growing concerned that the cuts have proven ineffective.\u201cThe market is somehow getting the fact that the rebalancing is not occurring,\u201d said Olivier Jakob from the Switzerland-based consultancy Petromatrix. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to have a strong rebound when you continue to have builds in the U.S.\u201dGasoline futures rose 1.6% to $1.4833 a gallon and diesel futures rose 1.4% to $1.4330 a gallon.Write to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com, Neanda Salvaterra at neanda.salvaterra@wsj.com and Jenny W.

GOOGL 0.59%       company\u00a0\u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) and order the search giant to remake its shopping service.Companies like British comparison-shopping website\u00a0Foundem.co.uk\u00a0blame lost business on Google and cheered the EU\u2019s ruling\u00a0Tuesday, which followed more than seven years of investigations.Foundem in\u00a02009\u00a0lodged the first formal\u00a0complaint to the EU about Google\u2019s behavior. In December it\u00a0temporarily shut down due to plunging traffic. Other smaller sites have consolidated to survive after losing hundreds of employees.The EU decision\u00a0said Google manipulates its search results to favor its own services and penalize those of rivals. Competitors including Foundem and Kelkoo.com Ltd., which rely on traffic from Google, say the manipulation caused catastrophic web-traffic losses.Analysis by the EU found that Google\u2019s actions, some starting in 2004, led to what the EU said was a 45-fold traffic increase for Google in the U.K. and a 35-fold increase in Germany, while certain rivals saw sudden drops in traffic of 85% in the U.K. and up to 92% in Germany.Google promotes its comparison-shopping service in a box atop broader search results, a practice the EU said was self-serving.Google disputed the EU\u2019s conclusions. Google\u00a0General Counsel Kent Walker said in a blog post\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0that its research shows people prefer links that bring them directly to the products they\u2019re looking for, instead of having to repeat searches on another comparison-shopping website. Google has also previously\u00a0said some of the algorithm changes that may have hurt competitors were introduced to target spam and websites with unoriginal content.Still,\u00a0the EU gave Google 90 days to end any discriminatory conduct and explain how it would implement the decision, or face additional penalties of up to 5% of average daily global revenue.Competitors say they are confident changes to Google\u2019s behavior will help shore up business.\u00a0Google declined to comment for this article.\u201cAt the point where the commission\u2019s interventions restore a level playing field, we are intending to relaunch our service,\u201d said Foundem Chief Executive       Shivaun Raff.Ms. Raff has previously faced criticism that she benefited financially from the Google antitrust case. She was previously paid as a special adviser to the anti-Google lobby group, Icomp, which until recently had strong links to             Microsoft Corp.       Both Foundem and Microsoft are no longer members of Icomp. Microsoft last year ceased active involvement in the fight against Google in Brussels after an agreement with the search giant to end their regulatory disputes.Google\u2019s Mr. Walker questioned his company\u2019s liability for rivals\u2019 fates. While some sites have shrunk over the examined period, \u201cmany sites\u2026have grown in this period\u2014including platforms like Amazon and             eBay,      \u201d he said in the blog post.For\u00a0several months after Foundem\u2019s 2009 complaint, it was alone in alleging anticompetitive conduct by Google, Ms. Raff said. Dozens of companies have since complained to the EU, both formally and informally.At a meeting in December 2014 with newly installed EU antitrust commissioner       Margrethe Vestager,        Olivier Sichel, CEO of French comparison-shopping company LeGuide Group, presented data showing a drop of\u00a0roughly\u00a090% in visibility of unpaid search results in France since 2011 for eight rival comparison-shopping sites.\u201cThe company I run, LeGuide.com, may have taken wrong directions as regards consumers\u2019 expectations, and thus be penalized by Google, but how can you explain all our competitors suffered from the same demotion?\u201d Mr. Sichel said he asked Ms. Vestager at the time. Kelkoo bought LeGuide last year.On Tuesday,\u00a0the EU\u00a0said the sudden drops in traffic to the rival websites it cited couldn\u2019t be explained by other factors.\u00a0The EU said it based its decision on documents from Google and other market players, as well as on real-world data of Google search results, traffic data and market surveys.It remains unclear how Google will implement the order and whether a redesign will return traffic\u2014and business\u2014to its rivals.Google could opt to scrap its shopping ads in Europe. More likely, analysts said, Google will propose rebuilding the service. EU regulators may require Google to retool the system to let results from competing comparison-shopping sites be mixed with its own and be as easy to click through as Google-hosted ads.\u201cHow they fix that is crucial,\u201d said\u00a0Kelkoo CEO Richard\u00a0Stables.\u00a0The right remedies \u201cwould transform our business\u2026I would stop spending all my time trying to survive, cut costs and [instead] try to innovate.\u201dBut\u00a0Nicolas\u00a0Petit, an antitrust professor at the University of Liege, said consumers would lose out if Google simply dropped image-rich search results.Google\u2019s other search services, such as travel, maps and local search, are also under the commission\u2019s scrutiny. Ms. Vestager said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0the shopping decision could serve as a precedent in the other cases.News Corp,      \u00a0owner of The Wall Street Journal, is an interested third party in the shopping case, meaning it can participate in the investigation. The company has also formally complained to the EU about Google\u2019s handling of news articles in search results.Other complainants say action in other search areas is urgent too. Local search service             Yelp Inc.       says it has recently cut more than 175 jobs in Europe\u2014almost its entire workforce there\u2014due to Google\u2019s conduct.Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Google Rivals Take Heart From EU\u2019s Antitrust Ruling.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 15:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-rivals-cheer-eu-antitrust-rulingbut-will-it-help-1498679020", "news_title": "Google Rivals Cheer EU Antitrust Ruling\u2014But Will It Help?

It portends a deeper struggle over the safety net that pits the elderly against the poor.The federal government is often called an insurance company with an army. Thanks to aging and health-care inflation, the cost of that insurance is rising relentlessly. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid now swallow 58% of tax revenue, and are on track to take 80% by 2047.Heading off this fiscal collision is a task no politician relishes because of the ugly trade-offs required: whose taxes should rise? And if the answer is nobody\u2019s, then whose benefits should be cut?In that regard, the Senate Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act could be a watershed. Not only would it enact among the steepest cuts to a pillar of the safety net in decades; by singling out Medicaid, it would signal that the burden of cost containment will fall more on the poor than the elderly.Of course, this isn\u2019t the explicit intent of either the Senate draft or the slightly different ACA replacement passed by the House of Representatives last month. Neither deals with Medicare benefits.That omission, however, speaks volumes. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate       Mitt Romney       and running mate       Paul Ryan       (now speaker of the House) proposed converting Medicare from fee-for-service to vouchers, and federal Medicaid to a block grant. The aim was to arrest the growth of both open-ended federal obligations.Donald Trump       later deduced those promises contributed to the ticket\u2019s\u00a0defeat, and so when he sought the Republican nomination, he promised\u00a0not to touch Medicare or Social Security. Initially he also promised to spare Medicaid but that gradually receded from his pitch. When Mr. Trump\u2019s first budget was unveiled last month, it pledged to curb safety-net programs including Medicaid and Social Security disability insurance but, at Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence, not Medicare or Social Security pensions.The electoral dividend: The elderly are a growing and highly motivated part of the electorate. Indeed, the ACA was unpopular in part because former President Barack Obama curbed Medicare hospital fees and some Medicare insurance plans to help pay for it. Most workers pay Medicare taxes, and everyone regardless of income becomes eligible at age 65. Thus, most Americans feel entitled to Medicare, creating an emotional bond that transcends party affiliation and background.That bond is much weaker with Medicaid. Because touching Medicare is toxic, the entitlements debate has been shunted to Medicaid, \u201ca less vocal more vulnerable population,\u201d says Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.Still, while singling out the poor and walling off old-age entitlements may be politically shrewd, it is economically blinkered. Entitlements for the poor such as food stamps and tax credits are hardly out of control. Their cost as a share of gross domestic product fluctuates with the state of the economy, and after rising sharply after the last recession, is expected to return to its historical trend. Exceptions are disability benefits which have trended higher and Medicaid, which I will come back to.By contrast Medicare\u2019s costs are being pressured by both an aging population and the tendency of health costs to grow faster than general inflation. The Congressional Budget Office estimates federal Medicare spending will soar from 3.1% of GDP this year to 6.1% in 2047.Roughly 8% of Medicaid\u2019s 70 million beneficiaries are elderly and they receive 16% of benefits; the remainder are children, working-age adults and the disabled. So while aging does contribute to the program\u2019s rising costs, the main factor is health-care inflation. The program\u2019s costs are projected to rise from 2% of GDP this year to 2.7% in 2047.The federal government funds about 60% of Medicaid by matching state\u00a0spending. Republicans note this reduces the incentive to control costs, since a state shoulders only 40 cents of each dollar of spending. Both the House and Senate health bills would replace the matching formula with either a block or a per-enrollee grant. The financial impact, however, depends crucially on how the grant is determined.Starting in 2025 the Senate would index per-enrollee payments to the overall inflation rate, a more stringent cap than either Mr. Romney or the House contemplated. If the cap held, federal Medicaid spending in 2047 would fall by nearly half relative to current law, to 1.4% of GDP, according to rough estimates by the CRFB.Advocates argue this will encourage states to find more efficient ways to deliver health care, without hurting the poor. Those opportunities, however, are limited: administrative costs are negligible, and most states are funneling Medicaid patients into cost-conscious managed care plans. States will either have to replace the missing federal money themselves, or reduce benefits, restrict eligibility, cut fees to providers, or some combination thereof, widening the quality disparity between Medicaid and Medicare coverage.Mr. Goldwein says while Medicaid is unsustainable, fixing it will not correct \u201cour structural deficit until we deal with Social Security and Medicare.\u201d Those two programs, he says, can be mended more gradually and thoughtfully by paring back benefits for middle class and upper income beneficiaries, which would in the process encourage more to keep working.Economic reality favors, eventually, just such a fix.

AAL -1.02%       removed certain \u201cdescriptive language\u201d from its financials at the behest of the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to recently released correspondence.The regulator directed the airline to stop telling investors that numbers inconsistent with standard accounting were \u201cmore indicative\u201d of company performance and \u201cmore comparable\u201d to metrics reported by other major airlines.American Airlines, in an April 3 letter to the SEC, said it would drop the references from its future filings and replace them with language that describes adjusted measures as useful to investors.The description was added when American Airlines was in the process of exiting chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2013, merging with US Airways and establishing reporting practices for the combined company, said company spokesman Joshua Freed.\u201cWe altered that language at the SEC\u2019s request beginning with our presentation of our first quarter results,\u201d Mr. Freed said. The company released its first-quarter earnings report on April 27.The SEC has been on a push to rein in the use of accounting figures that deviate from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Companies often use non-GAAP figures to give a rosier account of performance, and the regulator has been concerned the practice could mislead investors.An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.The SEC, in separate letters, also queried             JetBlue Airways Corp.       and             Delta Air Lines Inc.       on how they calculate return on invested capital. This non-GAAP metric pits operating income as a ratio of company obligations, like debt and stockholder equity to show how effectively companies deploy capital.\u201cIt\u2019s a business where capital intensity is high [...] airlines are notorious for generating returns that do not exceed their cost of capital,\u201d said Michael Linenberg, airlines analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.Airlines include an estimate for aircraft rent obligations when calculating return on invested capital to reflect the long-term and hefty nature of those leases.The SEC asked the companies why they assumed they would pay seven times the aircraft rent incurred during the past year. Both Delta and JetBlue, in their separate responses to the agency, said seven years was an industry standard and that a more detailed calculation yields a very similar result.A Delta spokesman declined to comment. A JetBlue spokesman referred to the company\u2019s responses to the SEC.Mr. Linenberg confirmed that an assumption of seven years of current rent was commonly used by the airline industry and credit-rating firms to measure aircraft lease obligations. Aircraft rent is a combination of interest expense and the depreciation rate, so while some airlines may rent their equipment for a shorter period, their depreciation may be higher, he said.Airlines also must estimate their likely interest expense over the life of the lease and can\u2019t rely on current low rates, Mr. Linenberg added.Under current accounting rules, airlines don\u2019t record aircraft leases on their balance sheets. However, this will change in 2019 when new lease accounting rules come into effect.Write to Tatyana Shumsky at tatyana.shumsky@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 15:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-tells-american-airlines-to-rein-in-praise-of-its-non-gaap-metrics-1498678669", "news_title": "SEC Tells American Airlines to Rein In Praise of Its Non-GAAP Metrics   ", "keywords": "adjusted,american airlines,cfo journal,financial language,finreg,non-gaap,sec,securities and exchange commission,u.s. generally accepted accounting principles,American Airlines Group,AAL,Securities and Exchange Commission,regulation,government policy,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,accounting,rental,leasing services,aircraft rental,leasing,consulting,air transport,business,consumer services,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "It\u2019s been three decades since a rookie led the American League or National League in home runs. But both the Yankees\u2019 Aaron Judge and the Dodgers\u2019 Cody Bellinger are on pace to do so this season.Entering Wednesday\u2019s play, Judge has 26 home runs while Bellinger has 24 to lead their respective leagues. With a couple of days still left in June, only Mark McGwire hit more homers in the season\u2019s first three months as a rookie.But history says a major regression is coming. McGwire, the last rookie to lead the league in home runs, had 28 for the 1987 Athletics entering July. He finished the season with 49. McGwire, however, was a bit of an anomaly, as other big-slugging rookies slipped even further.More recently, White Sox first baseman Jose Abreu had 25 home runs on July 1, but cleared the fences only 11 more times the rest of the season, while Dodgers outfielder Joc Pederson slowed even more dramatically after a powerful first half of the season in 2015.Pitchers around the league usually figured out a way to pitch to these budding stars. The average home run regression for the league\u2019s top rookie sluggers is hitting only slightly more than half the number of homers they had in the first half.So if the past is predictive and barring injury, Judge is likely to hit about 16 more blasts, still giving him 42 for the season, while Bellinger should tally 15 additional home runs, for 39.

His predecessor,       Peter Hancock,        agreed to depart following pressure from the board.Mr. Duperreault\u2019s task is to improve AIG\u2019s profit margins after years in which it has trailed many peers. Many of its woes stem from its near collapse in the 2008 global financial crisis. A U.S. government bailout required it to sell off some prized businesses to fully repay nearly $185 billion provided by taxpayers.Some activist investors\u2014including       Carl Icahn,        who has a representative on AIG\u2019s board\u2014last year called for the insurance conglomerate to improve its results by splitting itself apart. But those same investors have since given AIG some leeway to improve returns using other methods. Mr. Duperreault has promised investors he wouldn\u2019t split up AIG and instead would \u201cgrow it.\u201dThe prior CEO, Mr. Hancock, pledged to complete at least $25 billion in share buybacks and dividends over the two years ending Dec. 31. Through early May, AIG had made good on $18 billion of that pledge.But Mr. Duperreault\u00a0said Wednesday he will be more receptive to other uses of the cash generated by its businesses.\u201cI prefer to apply the capital to grow the company and create some strategic moves that ultimately benefit the shareholder,\u201d he said.\u201dThe likelihood we would continue the \u200b[buyback] \u200bpace we\u2019ve been on is low, because\u200b I think there are other things that I can use the\u200b money for,\u201d he added.The new CEO said he didn\u2019t arrive at AIG with a specific acquisition plan, or list of deals, in mind.\u201cBut I\u2019m open for business,\u201d he added.AIG sells property and a wide range of liability insurance to businesses globally, and is well known for its coverage of multinationals. It also has a large U.S.-based life-insurance and retirement-savings business, and is a leading insurer of cars, homes and other property of wealthy people.Mr. Duperreault praised AIG\u2019s global footprint and diverse businesses and said there are \u201clots of growth opportunities,\u201d internationally in particular.He spent 21 years at AIG before leaving in 1994 to run three other companies, including consulting and insurance-brokerage firm             Marsh & McLennan Co      s., and insurer             ACE Ltd.       Last year, ACE acquired Chubb Corp., one of AIG\u2019s biggest rivals, and now is known as Chubb Ltd.His last stop before rejoining AIG was Bermuda-based Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd., which he helped found in 2013 with principals of hedge fund Two Sigma Investments. Hamilton\u2019s goal was to apply computing to underwriting and pricing insurance.\u00a0Since last year, AIG, Hamilton and Two Sigma\u00a0have had\u00a0a joint venture to sell insurance online to small businesses, using data analytics.As part of Mr. Duperreault\u2019s move to AIG, the three companies announced an expansion of that partnership.

MET 0.35%       on Wednesday cleared one of the last obstacles to spinning off most of its longtime core business of selling life insurance to U.S. families.Delaware state insurance regulators approved the company\u2019s planned divestiture, which will create a new company called Brighthouse Financial.

MetLife has yet to file some details of the share distribution, but Wall Street stock analysts generally expect a launch-of-trading ceremony at the             Nasdaq Stock Market                   within the next month or two.Delaware regulates the unit that is at the heart of Brighthouse, and the job of approving MetLife\u2019s plan belonged to a new insurance commissioner, Trinidad Navarro, who was elected in November and inherited a backlog of work. He said in a release Wednesday that the state\u2019s internal and external experts analyzed the transaction for the last eight months.\u201cI am satisfied that my department has done a careful and thorough job,\u201d he said in the release.The Delaware department also has had before it a pending application for Chinese investment firm             China Oceanwide Holdings                   Group Co. to acquire mortgage- and long-term-care insurer Genworth Financial Inc.Besides life insurance, Brighthouse will be a leading seller of annuities, which are retirement-income products favored by many conservative investors. For its part, MetLife will be focused on an international network of life-insurance businesses as well as group life-insurance and other benefits sold to employers, and some other products.Analysts have said these remaining MetLife businesses have better growth possibilities than the ones moving into Brighthouse, and aren\u2019t as hurt by low interest rates.By splitting apart, MetLife could avoid being redesignated as a \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d by a panel of federal regulators, analysts say. Last year, a federal court rescinded the label in a legal challenge brought by MetLife, and the matter is now in the hands of a federal appellate court.MetLife Chief Executive       Steven Kandarian       has said that the company doesn\u2019t pose a risk to the broader economy, and that extra regulation would hurt it competitively. Historically, insurers have been state-regulated.MetLife\u2019s decision to split itself apart coincided with a push by activist investors for a breakup at insurance conglomerate             American International Group Inc.       Advocates of such breakups say that smaller companies are more nimble and better focused on product development and other keys to improving sluggish results.Brighthouse will sell its products through securities brokerages, financial advisers and other outside sales forces. Its chief executive is       Eric Steigerwalt,        who has been the MetLife executive vice president in charge of the business that is becoming Brighthouse.Write to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 14:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/metlife-closer-to-spinning-off-u-s-life-insurance-business-1498675107", "news_title": "MetLife Closer to Spinning Off U.S. Life Insurance Business ", "keywords": "brighthouse,delaware, divestiture,eric steigerwalt, insurance, insurance regulators, life insurance,metlife,metlife spinoff, prudential,spinoff,steven kandarian ,MetLife,MET,Prudential Financial,PRU,corporate changes,plans,strategy,regulation,government policy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,new companies creation,demergers,insurance,life insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "The Houston Rockets were one of the best teams in the NBA last season. They hired Mike D\u2019Antoni as their coach and unleashed James Harden as their point guard, and the result was one of the most explosive offenses the league has ever seen. Now the league will never see that exact offense again.Houston on Wednesday made the first huge move on an NBA free agent even before free agency begins this weekend by trading for another point guard to play alongside Harden: Los Angeles Clippers star Chris Paul.In return for their franchise player, who could have opted out of his contract this summer to become a free agent, the Clippers are getting Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker, Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, other fringe players on non-guaranteed contracts and a first-round pick from the Rockets.The sign-and-trade was only possible after Paul agreed to a one-year player option on his contract, according to The Vertical, which first reported the deal. That sounds like semantics, but it amounts to a $50 million difference, because it allows Paul to sign a five-year deal with the Rockets worth about $200 million next summer due to a clause in the league\u2019s new collective-bargaining agreement. Players used to be prohibited from signing long-term contracts past their 36th birthdays until Paul, who is now 32, increased the age to 38 as the president of the players\u2019 union.There are two big questions in the immediate aftermath of this trade. What does this mean for the Rockets, and what does this mean for the rest of the NBA?The one thing that hasn\u2019t changed about basketball in recent years is the number of basketballs. There is still only one. Paul and Harden have to learn how to share.That\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s a good problem, but it\u2019s still a problem, and it\u2019s not the only one. Paul slows the game down, for example, while Harden exploded this year by playing fast. They could fail spectacularly without an experimental, unorthodox solution, and there are few people in the NBA as comfortable with experimental, unorthodox solutions as Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni and general manager Daryl Morey.Paul is one of the greatest point guards in NBA history. Harden didn\u2019t even consider himself a point guard at this time last year. D\u2019Antoni can stagger them to make sure he keeps an elite ball-handler on the court for every second of every game. But when they play together, they might work best with a crazy idea: Paul, not Harden, becoming more of a shooting guard.D\u2019Antoni\u2019s system worked so well last year because the Rockets surrounded Harden with shooters, giving him the space to create shots for himself and create even better shots for his teammates. Of the four players with the most catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last year, three played for the Rockets. Eric Gordon, Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson each attempted more catch-and-shoot threes last season alone than Paul tried in last four seasons combined.But here\u2019s the thing: Paul has made 44.3% of his 325 catch-and-shoot threes since the NBA started tracking such numbers in 2014. The only players this year with as many shots and a higher percentage were Stephen Curry and J.J. Redick. That\u2019s a reason to believe Harden and Paul could be a deadly combination..Houston\u2019s roster isn\u2019t anywhere near set, though, and the Rockets still have to make some moves to make this work under the salary cap. They might even be able to add a third star like Paul George or Carmelo Anthony. The ripple effects of this deal are still unclear.But what is clear is the reason for their big swing: the Golden State Warriors. The Rockets were good, but they weren\u2019t good enough to beat the Warriors last year, and they weren\u2019t going to be good enough to beat the Warriors next year.Golden State is responsible for the escalating arms race across the NBA. One team is making the entire league get better. For the Rockets, getting better meant getting Chris Paul.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 14:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rockets-fire-at-the-warriors-by-trading-for-chris-paul-1498675710", "news_title": "The Rockets Fire at the Warriors by Trading for Chris Paul ", "keywords": "basketball,chris paul,houston rockets,james harden,nba,rockets,Houston Rockets,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Did the             New York Times                   smear former Alaska Gov.       Sarah Palin       because of bias\u2014or was it for the money? A jury may one day decide, now that Mrs. Palin has decided to seek redress. According to the Times:In a June 14 editorial following James Hodgkinson\u2019s attempted assassination of Republican legislators, the Times recycled a bogus claim that Mrs. Palin\u2019s political action committee had incited Jared Loughner to shoot Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in a 2011 attack that also wounded others and killed six. This fake news about Mrs. Palin had been thoroughly debunked years earlier.As this column noted, the Times later amended its editorial to acknowledge there was no link between Mrs. Palin and the 2011 shooting. But the Times continued to mention her in a story about horrific events to which she obviously had no connection. Even after acknowledging errors, the paper made essentially no effort to clear her name and instead opted for a more subtle smear.Given her role as a prominent politician, your humble correspondent mentioned that she would have to clear an extremely high legal bar to win a libel case against the Times. Now that she\u2019s decided to try,       Floyd Abrams,        the dean of First Amendment attorneys and now senior counsel at the law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel, tells this column in an email:The Times for its part is promising to defend itself vigorously, but few others are willing to do so, and this is significant. When a conservative political figure sues a news organization over its harsh coverage, you might normally expect the journalistic community to rally around the defendant. Mrs. Palin in particular has few fans in this community. On the other hand, other news outlets compete with the Times. In any case, few media types are stepping forward to defend the indefensible.After the Times amended its Palin smear, the Washington Post ran a \u201cFact Checker\u201d piece on June 15 that warned politicos not to try pretending that Sarah Palin had a role in the Loughner shootings: \u201cAny future references to this talking point by politicians or political groups will receive Four Pinocchios.\u201dNow the Post\u2019s Erik Wemple, who will never be accused of being conservative, says \u201cPalin\u2019s just-filed suit against the New York Times Co. comes off as a convincing legal argument.\u201d He notes that some legal experts disagree with him, but adds:This sounds like classic media bias at work, but the Palin lawsuit, which is posted on the Daily Caller website, suggests that the Times was pursuing profits in its attack on Mrs. Palin. The suit quotes Times columnist Charles M. Blow in a 2010 piece that noted the relentless attacks on her by media with left-wing audiences:Mr. Blow couldn\u2019t resist taking cheap shots at Mrs. Palin even in a column about his media brethren taking too many of their own. But he wisely suggested that his colleagues move on to other fascinations and they may regret not taking his advice. It appears that for the New York Times, Sarah Palin was a money maker. Now she intends to collect it.Bottom Stories of the DayCommune Core Standards  \u201cPark Slope Collegiate \u2018Communist organizing\u2019 probe of principal, others widened by Education Department,\u201d New York Daily News, June 27The Lonely Lives of Scientists  \u201cLions scared by voices of Rush Limbaugh and Rachel Maddow,\u201d The Bulletin, June 28Otherwise They Have To Live in the Communities that Elected Them  \u201cChaffetz calls for $2,500 legislator housing stipend,\u201d The Hill, June 27The Real Collusion?  \u201cThe FBI\u2019s boss is under investigation for possible Hatch Act violations,\u201d Circa, June 27If By \u2018Romance,\u2019 You Mean Tinder Hookups  \u201cHow       Donald Trump       is killing romance,\u201d Sacramento Bee, June 27***Follow James Freeman on Twitter.Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.(Carol Muller helps compile Best of the Web.

Amtrak said no one on that train was injured. Names of the two CSX crew members haven\u2019t been released.\u201cWe have few definitive facts at this early stage,\u201d Mr. Weener said.He said investigators will explore whether CSX notified Amtrak of the wheel check before the incident. They also will view footage from an outward-facing camera on the Amtrak train and one aimed into the Amtrak locomotive, he said.Officials from CSX and Amtrak declined to comment on details of the incident, citing the NTSB investigation. CSX said it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the deaths of the two employees.The CSX train stopped after a trackside detector triggered an alert. Mr. Weener said the devices are positioned every 25 miles or so. A railroad union official said they are known in the industry as \u201chot box detectors\u201d and can detect overheating of a train car\u2019s axle.\u201cThe dispatch was notified that there was probably something wrong with one or more of the wheels,\u201d Mr. Weener said.The train, which started in Baltimore and was carrying mixed freight in a line of railcars stretching about 9,000 feet, came to a halt so the crew could investigate, he said. The conductor and a conductor-in-training got off, while a third crew member, the engineer, stayed on the train.Mr. Weener said the speed limit is 95 miles an hour approaching the area where the men were hit, but it drops to 30 miles an hour on the approach to Union Station. He said the Amtrak train was slowing down and that data recorders will provide a clearer picture of its speed at the time of the incident.The incident severely disrupted rail service between Philadelphia and Washington. All four tracks in the collision area were closed until 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, and trains were initially restricted to 10 miles an hour on a single track. Some trains crept out of Union Station nearly three hours late.Alice Hunt, a minister with the United Church of Christ, arrived at Union Station 90 minutes early for a 10 a.m. train, which was delayed at least 40 minutes. She waited in a line at an Amtrak counter that snaked through the departures hall, but said the clerk had little information about when her train would leave.Ms. Hunt, who lives in Alabama and was visiting family in the nation\u2019s capital, was on her way to Baltimore for the church\u2019s general senate. \u201cYou can\u2019t get mad.

Morgan. Mr. Gehl started his career at             Goldman Sachs                   in New York and moved to London to cover the EMEA region in 2001.The banker will start in his new role after the summer. Mr. Gehl\u2019s hiring comes after Deutsche Bank slashed employee bonuses for 2016 and in March announced plans to recombine its corporate and deal-advisory business with its trading operations as the German bank tries to return to profitability.Mr. Gehl will succeed       Sanjay Jain,        who remains with J.P.

It certainly isn\u2019t the first and likely won\u2019t be the last.The meal-ingredient delivery company priced its initial public offering at $10 a share Wednesday, at the low end of the company\u2019s already lowered range. The deal values Blue Apron at $1.9 billion\u2014below the $2 billion where it was valued in a 2015 fundraising round.Its marketing costs and high churn have made investors wary, but Amazon\u2019s announcement June 16 that it was moving further down the grocery aisle with a purchase of Whole Foods Market may have turned many of those still on the fence into doubters.The weak demand for the startup\u2019s IPO demonstrates the long shadow that Big Tech has cast over younger companies trying to get a piece of the action. Blue Apron\u2019s business has low barriers to entry, as evidenced by the raft of imitators that have cropped up, including Purple Carrot, HelloFresh and SunBasket. But even for a more innovative company like Snap, imitative updates from             Facebook\u2019s       Instagram led investors to question its ability to continue to grow its user base ahead of its March 1 IPO.Shares of Snap have fallen 28% since they first began trading. They are now trading just above their IPO price of $17 a share.Etsy\u2019s       public beginnings were also overshadowed by Amazon. Just a little more than a month after the seller of artisanal goods priced its IPO on April 15, 2015, news broke that Amazon was preparing to launch a similar marketplace called Handmade. Shares of Etsy have fallen by 50% since their first day of trading and trade below their IPO price of $16 a share.A number of startups, including Jet.com, ModCloth and Bonobos have opted to sell to             Wal-Mart Stores                   instead of pursuing an IPO.

Such, in fact, is the presentation now at Danspace Project in St. Mark\u2019s Church, where \u201cSlowDancing/TrioA,\u201d a video work by artist       David Michalek       in collaboration with Ms. Rainer, is being shown in four-hour runs. They are open to the public for free, though reservations at danspaceproject.org are recommended.As an isolated dance, \u201cTrio A\u201d plays out in five minutes, more or less, depending on its performer\u2019s rate of presentation. It was first shown as it was executed simultaneously by Ms. Rainer and two other dancers,       Steve Paxton       and       David Gordon,        in the Judson Memorial Church, where from 1962 to 1964 the Judson Dance Theater flourished as a place in which the ways of modern dance evolved into those of dance\u2019s postmodern phase.Ms. Rainer was a leading participant in Judson Dance Theater, and by the time of \u201cTrio A\u201d\u2014which unfolds as the plainest-seeming of dances\u2014she had asserted what\u2019s now known as her \u201cno\u201d manifesto. Rejecting, as her manifesto did, such expectations from dance presentations of the time as \u201cspectacle,\u201d \u201cvirtuosity,\u201d \u201cglamour,\u201d \u201ccamp\u201d and \u201cstyle,\u201d her choreography for \u201cTrio A\u201d suggests a soft-spoken run-on sentence by way of moves that have an air of matter-of-fact pedestrian activity. The articulations require keen coordination for the upper body, often against moves for the lower. Largely unemphatic actions\u2014such as the tapping of the front of the foot in an arc on the floor or the lifting of a leg in counterbalance to a hop without striking a leg-extension pose\u2014are not so much addressed to onlookers as seemingly passing before them as a matter of course in daily life.In 2007, Mr. Michalek\u2019s acclaimed \u201cSlow Dancing\u201d film installation on the facade of Lincoln Center\u2019s then New York State Theater\u2014and later given in 42 other cities\u2014slowed five seconds of movement personally devised by 43 diverse dancers to a glacial pace, with each performer\u2019s appearance lasting 10 minutes. \u201cSlowDancing/TrioA\u201d documents 46 individuals captured by Mr. Michalek\u2019s high-speed, high-definition filming and transforms each dancer\u2019s seven-second portion of Ms. Rainer\u2019s choreography into a dream-like five-minute segment.Additional displays of related, smaller scale films, one from 2016 and another from 1978, and a slide presentation of photos by       Peter Moore       from the 1960s get projected on the perimeter of the vaulted sanctuary where the main-attraction, slow-paced films fill expansive, free-standing screens. The secondary films and stills document the actions and tone of \u201cTrio A\u201d as Ms. Rainer initially intended them.One side screen shows the choreographer last year, at age 82, going through her dance from start to finish as separately filmed by Mr. Michalek at normal speed. For all the arresting visuals of \u201cSlowDancing/TrioA\u201d\u2014in which more limber and, in any number of cases, more keenly schooled men and women perform in simple but smart, mostly close-fitting casual clothes and contemporary footwear\u2014this smaller-size record of Ms. Rainer has a distinction all its own.As the dancing choreographer works through the moves she strung together for the more plain than fancy, though hardly easy, challenges of \u201cTrio A,\u201d Mr. Michalek\u2019s once-through record of the dance shows Ms. Rainer forthrightly.

Beef Products, during the litigation, decried ABC\u2019s coverage of its company as \u201cfake news,\u201d a term widely used to describe fabricated internet reporting that has broadened in use since the 2016 presidential election.BPI\u2019s lawyer,       Dan K. Webb,        said despite what he called \u201cABC\u2019s 30-day media attack\u201d five years ago, the company\u2019s legal team was able to get across to the 12-person jury that lean finely textured beef was safe.\u201cWe didn\u2019t use the term \u2018fake news\u2019 with the jury because we didn\u2019t need to,\u201d said Mr. Webb of the law firm Winston & Strawn. \u201cWe got across to the jury that lean ground beef product was safe and it was healthy.\u201dIn 2012, lean, finely textured beef, or LFTB, was found in about 70% of the ground beef found on supermarket shelves. ABC didn\u2019t coin the term \u201cpink slime,\u201d but it exploded on social media after the broadcasts. \u201cIt took BPI 30 years to build up the success, it took ABC 30 days to destroy that by rebranding the product as pink slime,\u201d said Mr. Webb.Beef Product\u2019s battle followed a string of other high-profile legal clashes involving the media. Gawker Media was forced into bankruptcy last summer after it lost an invasion-of-privacy suit brought by the former professional wrestler       Hulk Hogan.       Rolling Stone magazine last year lost a libel lawsuit related to a discredited 2014 story about an alleged fraternity gang rape at the University of Virginia. And just this week, former Republican Gov.       Sarah Palin       sued the             New York Times                   for defamation over a recent editorial.ABC\u2019s first segment on the product, in March 2012, opened with Ms. Sawyer telling viewers: \u201cA startling ABC News investigation, a whistleblower has come forward to tell consumers about the ground beef a lot of us buy at the supermarket. Is it what we think it is?\u201dIn the report, Mr. Avila described the company\u2019s meat product as pink slime made from \u201cbeef trimmings\u2026once used only in dog food\u201d and \u201csprayed with ammonia to make them safe to eat and then added to most ground beef as a cheaper filler.\u201dIn the ensuing weeks, ABC followed the segment with several more broadcasts and more than a dozen online stories about the beef, reporting on the fallout for Beef Products.Beef Products claimed ABC News whipped up the controversy about the meat product to boost ratings, inflaming consumers\u2019 fears that forced it to close three of its four plants, erasing hundreds of jobs when consumers recoiled.The company filed suit later that year, accusing ABC of creating a false impression \u201cthat BPI\u2019s product was not beef or meat, had little or no nutritional value, and was not safe to eat.\u201dThose three BPI production plants remain closed, but the company said it hopes to rehire the laid-off employees and bring the plants back online if the market for LFTB recovers.\u2014Joe Flint contributed to this article.Write to Patrick Fitzgerald at patrick.fitzgerald@wsj.com and Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 14:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/abc-news-settles-pink-slime-food-libel-lawsuit-1498662340", "news_title": "ABC News Settles \u2018Pink Slime\u2019 Food-Libel Lawsuit ", "keywords": "abc news,bankruptcynews,defamation, finely textured beef product,food libel,ground beef,jim avila,lawsuit,lean,lftb,pink slime,reporting,settlement,Beef Products,Walt Disney,DIS,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,crime,food,drink,living,lifestyle,broadcasting,television broadcasting,food products,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "ZURICH\u2014The world\u2019s biggest packaged-food company may be cutting back on packaged\u00a0food.Nestl\u00e9 SA        NSRGY 0.52%       outlined a far-reaching strategic shift this week, days after activist investor       Daniel Loeb,        who has accumulated a 1.25% stake, asked for big changes. Nestl\u00e9 promised new investment in its high-growth business like bottled water, coffee, infant nutrition and pet care. It also signaled it would consider consumer health-care acquisitions.What Nestl\u00e9 didn\u2019t mention in its new strategy: \u201cprepared\u201d food, a core Nestl\u00e9 sector that includes household names like Lean Cuisine, DiGiorno pizza and Herta processed meats, a brand popular in Europe. That, coupled with a number of high-profile food sales in recent months, has analysts and investors expecting more divestitures, though it may take awhile.Earlier this month, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s new Chief Executive       Mark Schneider      put on the block its U.S. confectionery business, which includes the Butterfinger, Baby Ruth and Crunch candy bars. Last month, Nestl\u00e9 agreed to sell three of its frozen food brands in Italy.A Nestl\u00e9 spokeswoman decline to comment on its prepared foods business.\u201cIt\u2019s a small revolution that\u2019s taking place,\u201d said       Jean-Philippe Bertschy,        analyst at Vontobel Research. \u201cNestl\u00e9\u2019s frozen foods, ice cream and pizza businesses are areas for possible disposals\u201d over the next three to four years, he said.       Jon Cox,        head of Swiss equities at Kepler Cheuvreux, said he expects additional disposals in confectionery, frozen foods and cereals in the coming years.Nestl\u00e9 hasn\u2019t signaled any specific new divestitures. On Tuesday, it said only that it \u201cwill continue to adjust its portfolio in line with its strategy and growth objectives.\u201dFew analysts expect a full buffet of food-brand sales from Nestl\u00e9. The company has been investing heavily in some of its brands, including ice cream and Lean Cuisine, which it says it has successfully turned around in recent years.But the company said it is targeting acquisitions and investment at faster-growing segments far from its traditional base in prepared food. The cheap, ready-to-eat brands were staples of supermarket shelves for decades but have recently fallen out of favor amid competition from healthier options.Nestl\u00e9 Chairman       Paul Bulcke       has said Nestl\u00e9, like other consumer-goods companies, has been slow to respond to rapidly changing consumer tastes. In an interview late last year, when he was still chief executive, he cited its reliance on the word\u00a0\u2018lean,\u2019 which is on all of its packages of Lean Cuisine meals.\u201c\u2019Lean,\u2019 that was so in: diet; lean. All these arguments all of a sudden were not valid anymore because \u2018lean\u2019 is linked with sacrifice,\u201d he said. Not having seen this change coming \u201cis somewhat a frustration, but then we reacted then pretty fast when we saw it.\u201dNestl\u00e9 breaks out its products in broad categories. Its prepared dishes and cooking aid business brought in 12.15 billion Swiss francs ($12.6 billion) in sales last year, or about 13.6% of overall sales. But sales have lagged behind in other segments, delivering just 2.7% growth, excluding things like acquisitions and divestitures. Organic sales at Nestl\u00e9 grew as a whole 3.2% last year.Still, the businesses are among the company\u2019s biggest revenue generator. Adding in various slower-growing brands in some of its other food-oriented units\u2014those units include confectionary, milk products and ice cream and powdered and liquid beverages\u2014these businesses make up a big chunk of Nestl\u00e9 sales, particularly in the U.S. \u201cIt may not tick many attractiveness boxes, bottom up,\u201d said       Martin Deboo,        consumer goods analyst at Jefferies International, referring to prepared meals. \u201cBut, top down, it represents 20-25% of sales in their biggest market [in the U.S.] and is making a significant contribution to both central overheads and overall clout with the likes of             Wal-Mart,      \u201d said Mr. Deboo.The packaged food business is also a bit of a buyer\u2019s market recently.             Unilever                   PLC put its spreads business, including margarine but not mayonnaise, up for sale earlier this year.             Reckitt Benckiser Group                   PLC is selling its French\u2019s mustard.Write to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Nestl\u00e9 Tidies Up Its Food Cupboard.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 13:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestles-future-may-see-less-reliance-on-packaged-foods-1498672691", "news_title": "Is Food Giant Nestl\u00e9 Turning Away From Food?", "keywords": "nestle,nestle outlook,nestle packaged food,Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,corporate,industrial news,food,beverages,tobacco,baby food,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014Police detained prominent pro-democracy activists late Wednesday during a sit-in protest at an iconic city monument before the arrival of Chinese President       Xi Jinping,        who is to mark the 20th anniversary of the former British colony\u2019s return to China.The arrested activists included       Joshua Wong       and       Nathan Law,        co-founders of the Demosisto political party, which grew out of student-led protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2014, a party spokeswoman said. Mr. Wong, who has become the face of the opposition movement, was already scheduled to appear in court next week on charges related to the earlier protests, which shut down parts of the city for 79 days.Under a 1997 handover agreement that saw China regain sovereignty over Hong Kong from Britain, the city was granted semiautonomy until 2047. But in practice, Beijing is asserting its power aggressively, from asserting itself in the city\u2019s governance to reinterpreting its effective constitution.A massive security operation is under way to lock down parts of the city ahead of official events to mark the anniversary, which will include a flag-raising ceremony on Saturday where the protest took place Wednesday. The opposition movement has been hindered by prosecutions of its leaders, including Mr. Wong. In a separate case, prosecutors are seeking to remove Mr. Law from the city\u2019s legislative council for failing to properly execute his swearing-in oath.China\u2019s surging economic and military influence has raised alarm bells in this Cantonese-speaking city of 7 million, although many have resigned themselves to further encroachment by mainland authorities. A core group of young activists is seeking to keep the protest movement alive. A street rally is set for July 1, the handover anniversary and the day Mr. Xi is scheduled to leave the city.On Wednesday, the activists staged a sit-in at the Golden Bauhinia monument, which was given to Hong Kong by mainland China in 1997 to mark the handover. Around nightfall, police told the protesters they would be arrested if they didn\u2019t leave. Mr. Wong and Mr. Law were among those who remained and were taken away and loaded into police vans, according to witness accounts.Last week, Mr. Wong said he believed Britain\u2019s handover of Hong Kong had violated international norms, since sovereignty should have been returned to the local population, not to China.In a statement late Wednesday, his party called mainland China\u2019s government \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and a \u201cbrutal regime\u201d that had \u201cperverted Hong Kong people\u2019s civil and political rights to free elections and democracy.\u201dThe statement also criticized the Chinese government\u2019s treatment of       Liu Xiaobo,        a Chinese activist awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize while serving a prison sentence for political crimes.

The screeching U-turn in bond markets is a good example. The world\u2019s central banks are sending out a message that loose monetary policy can\u2019t last forever.The shift is mainly rhetorical, and action may yet be some way off. But expectations matter, as they did when the Federal Reserve indicated in 2013 that its quantitative-easing program could be wound down. That caused global bond yields to surge, led by the U.S., and sparked extended turmoil in emerging markets.This time, the bond reversal has been centered on Europe. Ten-year German bund yields started Tuesday just below 0.25%, but by Wednesday afternoon stood at 0.37%. That helped lift bond yields elsewhere, since low German yields have been acting as an anchor. The selloff in the bund Tuesday was the worst in 22 months, according to Deutsche Bank.The immediate trigger was a speech from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi arguing that as the eurozone recovery progresses, keeping policy unchanged would be a form of monetary loosening. Instead, the central bank could \u201cadjust the parameters of its policy instruments.\u201d In more straightforward terms, ultra-stimulative policy measures are set to be reined in, though Mr. Draghi emphasized that this would be a careful, gradual process. If they can, central bankers are likely to want to avoid a rerun of the \u201ctaper tantrum.\u201dWhat is surprising is that markets are surprised by this shift. The tone from global central banks has been growing steadily more confident. The Fed has raised rates and is talking about shrinking its balance sheet, and has shown little sign of stepping back.The ECB has sounded more encouraged by a broadening eurozone recovery, and there has been a good deal of debate about its exit strategy. And the design of the ECB\u2019s bond-purchase program, which includes limits on the amount of government securities it can buy, means it is hard to avoid winding down stimulus.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has shifted toward tightening policy, too. Gov. Mark Carney added a fresh dash of volatility to markets Wednesday by hinting that a rate rise may become necessary if the economy keeps growing, and in particular if investment picks up.

Before that, staffers had complained of a lack of communication from Washington they said made it difficult to do their jobs.U.S. diplomats have said they hoped Mr. Branstad\u2019s arrival would steady the ship. The former six-term Iowa governor, who endorsed Mr. Trump in the election, is one of a relatively small number of ambassadors to be formally nominated and approved under the new president.Appearing before reporters with family members at the ambassador\u2019s residence on Wednesday, Mr. Branstad struck an optimistic tone, saying he hoped to work with China on issues like North Korea and trade.\u201cWe recognize this is an important relationship between the two greatest economic powers in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to work together to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.\u201dMr. Branstad arrives at a time of uncertainty in relations between Washington and Beijing. U.S. President Donald Trump reversed course on earlier threats to launch a trade war with China in exchange for Beijing\u2019s help reining in North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons program, but in recent tweets appeared undecided about that strategy. Other elements of U.S. policy in China, including human rights, have been left in the air.In his remarks Wednesday, which largely echoed a taped message published on Chinese video sites earlier this week, Mr. Branstad said he had traveled to China several times before on trade missions and recalled welcoming Chinese President       Xi Jinping       on a visit to Iowa in 1985, when Mr. Xi was a local-level Communist Party secretary.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry refers to Mr. Branstad as an \u201cold friend.\u201d Chinese government advisers say Beijing hopes his agricultural background and ties with Mr. Trump will make him a strong voice in favor of trade inside the administration.Mr. Branstad concentrated most of his brief comments Wednesday on trade, saying he hoped to help reduce trade barriers in a way that would both benefit Chinese businesses and increase U.S. jobs.\u201cBeing the governor of an agricultural state, we sell a lot of soybeans and pork in China. We\u2019re excited about the trade expansion,\u201d he said, noting the recent resumption of U.S. beef imports into China. He also flagged a visit to Beijing later this week by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, who he said was eager to work out a deal with China over rice imports.Mr. Branstad was cautious when asked whether he intended to push China to allow Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo to seek medical treatment abroad. The dissident writer was diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer last month was and recently granted medical parole.\u201cWe Americans would like to see him have the opportunity for treatment if that could be of help,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s important that we work together between our two countries to address these important human-rights issues.\u201d\u2018Being the governor of an agricultural state, we sell a lot of soybeans and pork in China. We\u2019re excited about the trade expansion.\u2019Because of his relationship with leaders in both countries, Mr. Branstad said, \u201cI hope I can be a go-between on these important issues.\u201dU.S. ambassadors are closely scrutinized in China. Former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       first envoy, Utah Gov.       Jon Huntsman,        made waves by having a certain command of Mandarin, and later sparked controversy by showing up at a pro-democracy protest in Beijing. Mr. Huntsman\u2019s successor, former Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, was celebrated as a humble public servant after photos surfaced of him buying his own coffee and carrying his own luggage in the airport.The most recent ambassador, Mr. Baucus, a former Montana senator, had a lower public profile, but was well known in diplomatic circles for dispensing with protocol and going off script in meetings with Chinese officials.Write to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 13:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/terry-branstads-arrival-in-beijing-ends-u-s-embassys-months-of-limbo-1498626925", "news_title": "Soybean Diplomacy: New U.S. Ambassador to China Touts Agricultural Trade", "keywords": "branstad , china ambassador,david rank,donald trump,iowa governor,max baucus,terry branstad, trump, us ambassador, us ambassador to china, us embassy,Terry Branstad,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Copper prices rose to a high of nearly two months on Wednesday, lifted by a weaker dollar.Copper for September delivery rose 0.5% to $2.6760 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since May 1.The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, fell 0.4% to 87.98.

Stephen Poloz       reignited expectations for a rate increase next month by saying excess slack in the Canadian economy is now being absorbed \u201csteadily\u201d at the current pace of growth.His comments in Portugal, during an interview with CNBC Europe that aired Wednesday, drove the Canadian dollar to a four-month high and pushed up yields on government of Canada bonds. The remarks came as central bankers in Europe and the U.K. also signal their intent to remove stimulus from their economies.Mr. Poloz said growth in Canada would decelerate following a strong 3.7% annualized gain in the first quarter, top among the Group of Seven leading nations. But he said he doesn\u2019t envisage a dramatic slowdown.Growth would register at a \u201cmore normal pace but still above potential,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing. That means that we\u2019re absorbing excess capacity that was built up in the wake of the crisis and then built up again in the wake of the oil shock two years ago.\u201dWhen pressed on how that would affect the central bank\u2019s policy-rate decision next month, Mr. Poloz said officials \u201cneed to be at least considering that whole situation now that the excess capacity is being used up steadily.\u201dBMO Capital Markets altered its rate outlook following Mr. Poloz\u2019s comments, and said it expects the central bank to raise its policy rate, currently at 0.50%, in July. The firm previously forecast a rate increase in January 2018. It said messaging in recent weeks indicates the central bank wants to begin unwinding the rate cuts it delivered in 2015 to help the economy deal with a sudden drop in commodity prices.Jimmy Jean, economist at Desjardins Capital Markets, said in an interview he has a \u201cstrong bias\u201d toward a July rate increase, saying Mr. Poloz didn\u2019t mention in his interview any concerns related to soft inflationary pressure.\u201cTo me it is increasingly hard to square off these comments at this juncture, with a scenario of a central bank that is just happy to introduce hawkish language in the next statement and wait further before hiking,\u201d Mr. Jean said.On the overnight-index swap market, traders Wednesday priced in a roughly 70% probability of a rate increase July 12, up from a roughly 40% probability the previous day.Investors warmed up to the Canadian dollar, pushing the currency to a four-month high after Mr. Poloz\u2019s comments. The loonie was trading at about 76.59 U.S. cents early Wednesday, from 75.74 U.S. cents late Tuesday.Meanwhile, Canadian bond yields rose sharply, with the front end outperforming the rest of the curve, according to CanDeal. The yield for Canada\u2019s two-year bonds was at 1.017% from 0.964% on Tuesday, while the 10-year bond was yielding at 1.599% from 1.565%. Bond yields move inversely to price.Similar market movement unfolded in the U.K., as the pound jumped to a three-week high after Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       said interest rates in the U.K. may need to rise if the economy keeps growing despite weak consumer spending.Mr. Poloz and the Bank of Canada\u2019s No. 2 official,       Carolyn Wilkins,        rattled markets in June with a sea change in commentary that signaled the bank was laying the groundwork to raise its benchmark rate.They both said rate cuts they delivered in 2015 to offset the negative shock from the commodity-price swoon have worked, with the economy now growing at a firmer pace and broadening on a sectoral and regional basis. Ms. Wilkins said it is time to assess whether rock-bottom rates are still necessary.Previously, the central bank had urged caution on the Canadian outlook amid a string of strong economic data, citing uncertainty in U.S. trade policy as an important concern, and the presence of spare labor and production capacity.\u2014David George-Cosh contributed to this article.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 12:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boc-gov-stephen-poloz-signals-july-rate-rise-in-play-1498652646", "news_title": "Bank of Canada\u2019s Poloz Signals July Rate Rise in Play", "keywords": "bank of canada, benchmark rate, canada economy, canada interest rates, interest rate increase, stephen poloz,Bank of Canada,Stephen Poloz,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "As Hong Kong marks the 20th anniversary of its handover to China, a pessimistic mood hangs over the city. Some critics claim that the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d experiment has failed and as a Chinese territory Hong Kong has lost its competitiveness and economic vitality. Nothing could be further from the truth.While its enormous economic lead over its sister cities in mainland China has narrowed, Hong Kong\u2019s global position has improved significantly since the handover. Its economy has matched or outperformed nearly all its traditional peers internationally.Hong Kong achieved an annual real growth rate of 3.4% from 1997 to 2016, outperforming the average of 2% among advanced economies. Austria and Switzerland, comparable in population, grew 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, during the same period. Only Singapore recorded a slightly better performance.Hong Kong\u2019s feat is all the more remarkable considering it faced a series of shocks over the past two decades\u2014starting with the Asian financial crisis, ignited by the devaluation of Thai baht on July 2, 1997, only a day after Hong Kong\u2019s handover.That was followed by the SARS epidemic, severe deflationary pressures under the pegged exchange-rate system and the shocks of the global financial crisis in 2008-09. Time and again, Hong Kong demonstrated its stability and resilience.As for the stunning development of mainland cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, Hong Kong should rightfully deserve some of the credit. It was the role model for Chinese cities since the start of the reform era.Hong Kong\u2019s success story of achieving fabulous wealth and prosperity through a free-market economic system inspired mainland policy makers and entrepreneurs. Through its unique role in trade, direct investment and sophisticated services, Hong Kong has made crucial contributions to China\u2019s rise as a global economic powerhouse.In return, Hong Kong has cemented its status as a leading international financial center. Among Hong Kong\u2019s salient advantages is a strong banking system, which has proved to be one of the best-managed, most-resilient, and most-profitable in the world.Perhaps the most notable development since the handover is the rapid expansion of Hong Kong\u2019s stock market. The number of publicly listed companies on the exchange has increased three times since 1997 to just under 2,000, and market capitalization reached $3.2 trillion by 2016, five times that of Singapore\u2019s market.Hong Kong leads New York and London in initial public offerings. In terms of scale and importance in global capital markets, Hong Kong has left its chief regional rival Singapore in the dust.But Hong Kong does face challenges. First and foremost is preserving the autonomy of Hong Kong with unfettered freedom, a strong rule of law and complete openness.Under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula designed by       Deng Xiaoping,        the city retains its freewheeling capitalist system with an independent judiciary and guaranteed individual rights.While Hong Kong has benefited tremendously from the \u201cone country\u201d part over the past two decades, the \u201ctwo systems\u201d feature remains the crucial differentiator and cornerstone of its identity. That\u2019s mainly because political and legal developments on the mainland haven\u2019t kept pace with the remarkable economic progress there.Worries about the gradual erosion of liberty in Hong Kong have increased in recent years. As Deng recognized, the freer Hong Kong remains, the more prosperous and dynamic it will be, and the more valuable a role it can play in China\u2019s modernization.It is as vital as ever to uphold the \u201cone country, two system\u201d principle enshrined in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law. Beijing should cherish Hong Kong\u2019s uniqueness, and the local government should avoid becoming just another Chinese city. It is in Hong Kong\u2019s and China\u2019s best interest for Hong Kong to be a true global city under Chinese sovereignty.Second, like other high-income societies, Hong Kong faces the challenge of widening inequality. The local housing market is the most expensive in the world, making affordability a hot-button issue for the low-income population and fueling discontent.The city doesn\u2019t need a European-style social-welfare state, but it sorely needs a better housing policy to maintain social stability. That could be achieved mainly through increased supply of land for residential development and expansion of the existing public-housing program.Third, Hong Kong must diversify its economy by nurturing new growth sectors. Today Hong Kong relies on finance, real estate, trade and other services exactly as it did 20 years ago, with few new industries in sight. Meanwhile its neighbor Shenzhen successfully transitioned from a labor-intensive manufacturing hub to a tech powerhouse, where global leaders such as DJI, Foxconn, Huawei, Ping An, Tencent and ZTE are based.Hong Kong possesses many of the requisite factors for technological leadership, including world-class universities with top scientists in fields such as biotech and robotics. Yet it has failed to create a vibrant startup ecosystem. Beijing and Shanghai are in the top 10 of global startup rankings, while Hong Kong isn\u2019t even in the top 20.Hong Kong spends just 0.7% of its gross domestic product on research and development, compared to 2% in Singapore, 3.1% in Taiwan and more than 4% in Israel and South Korea. The city enjoys a large budget surplus, and its medium-term fiscal outlook appears positive. It has the resources to rapidly close the R&D gap if it chooses to.Hong Kong needs a strategic vision and strong action to transform the city into a 21st-century innovation leader. Building a startup ecosystem with rekindled entrepreneurial spirit holds the key to the city\u2019s future.As new startups proliferate, more opportunities beyond traditional industries will become available to the younger generation, enhancing their prospects of finding jobs with avenues of advancement.Despite missed opportunities and significant challenges, Hong Kong has been an unqualified success since its handover 20 years ago. Provided politics doesn\u2019t get in the way, the city is capable of reinventing itself and thriving.Mr. Hu is chairman of Primavera Capital Group.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 12:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-next-for-hong-kong-1498668152", "news_title": "What\u2019s Next for Hong Kong", "keywords": " capitalism, china, communism,hong kong, one country two systems, technology,economic performance,indicators,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Ford Motor Co.

The fund, which is a commodity trading adviser and commodity pool operator, is seeking to attract investors who typically shy away from the highly volatile commodities market, the person said.Both founders have traded energy for more than a decade. Mr. Rosenblum left Goldman Sachs in 2015 and spent a year trading energy at Elliott Management before leaving last year. Mr. Colarossi managed options trading at BBL Commodities, an energy-focused hedge fund. Before that he ran energy derivatives trading at             Natixis                   in London.The fund will charge investors \u201ctwo-and-twenty,\u201d\u20142% of assets invested and 20% of any profits generated\u2014a common fee structure for hedge funds, according to the person familiar.The fund is launching at a time when other energy-focused funds have struggled performance-wise. At the start of the year, investors bet heavily that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would succeed in working off a supply glut and boosting prices. OPEC and other major exporters, including Russia, agreed late last year to cut output and held closed-door meetings with major investors to win them over.But many have gotten burned as oil\u2019s gains have slipped away. Stockpiles have remained high, and some have lost faith that OPEC\u2019s cuts are enough. Crude prices have tumbled nearly 20% from highs in February, sliding into a bear market.Pierre Andurand, one of the world\u2019s best-known oil traders, suffered a large loss this year because of his wrong-way bets on crude. Andurand Capital is down about 17.3% through the end of May, according to figures sent to investors. In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Andurand abandoned most of his bullish bets, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Andurand declined to comment.More commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, have liquidated than launched in recent years, according to Preqin, a data provider. Last year, 107 such funds were liquidated and 71 were launched.

That\u2019s another story.As \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d heads to North American theaters on July 7, Spidey\u2019s dear old aunt continues her Benjamin Button-esque reverse-aging process. Fans of the       Stan Lee       comic book first met the gray-haired woman in the 1960s. She looked much the same in her screen debut, in 2002\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man.\u201d Actress       Rosemary Harris       was 74 the day that film opened.Fast-forward to 2012. The first reboot, \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man,\u201d brought audiences       Sally Field       as Aunt May. She was 65 on opening day.Which brings us to Reboot No. 2. Now the orphaned young superhero, played by       Tom Holland,        is looked after by an Aunt May, played by 52-year-old       Marisa Tomei.       Audiences already have briefly seen this iteration of the character parrying with Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s flirtatious Iron Man during her cameo in the 2016 release \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201dThe new family dynamic was something producers thought would give       Peter Parker       a more relatable life. \u201cWe wanted to show a new version of Aunt May who is more like a single mom,\u201d said       Kevin Feige,        president of Marvel Studios and a producer on \u201cHomecoming.\u201dThat\u2019s in keeping with the way Aunt May was portrayed in the Ultimate Spider-Man series in the 2000s, according to Mark Ginocchio, author of a coming Spider-Man book and co-host of Amazing Spider-Talk podcast. The writer of that series,       Brian Michael Bendis,        patterned a 50-something Aunt May after his mother, according to Mr. Ginocchio. \u201cSo this is an updating of his entire universe, versus having Spider-Man worried about getting Aunt May her heart pills.\u201dThe metamorphosis of Aunt May could open the door to accusations of Hollywood ageism. But some close observers have said the current version makes her stronger and less vulnerable.\u201cIn the comics, Peter was always protecting her it was like his second mission, which could supersede his first mission of \u2018with great power comes great responsibility,\u2019 \u201d says Washburn University adjunct sociology instructor       Ora McWilliams,        who has written about Aunt May.It makes a lot more sense that Peter Parker\u2019s aunt would be in her early 50s, given that Spider-Man is again a high-school student. \u201cShe\u2019s more like Grandma May as originally conceived,\u201d says Harvard Kennedy School lecturer       Chris Robichaud,        author of a coming book on superheroes and philosophy.Mr. Robichaud, while cautioning that we won\u2019t know how the character is written until the movie is released, anticipates that Aunt May will be more a mother rather than a damsel in distress. \u201cA more modern woman.

Gawker seeks evidence, if any exists, that Mr. Thiel conspired with Mr. Harder to destroy the media company, which could be used to build a lawsuit against the billionaire venture capitalist.Gawker\u2019s inquiry will be limited significantly by the settlement the company signed last year with Terry Bollea, Hogan\u2019s real name.

The litigation yielded a $140 million judgment against Gawker and its founder       Nick Denton,        and forced the business into bankruptcy in June 2016.\u00a0The lawsuit was over the publication of the wrestler\u2019s sex tape in 2012 on the company\u2019s flagship site, Gawker.com.Mr. Thiel, who had been angered by an article published years earlier that identified him as gay, has said he got involved in the Gawker litigation because he believed publication of the sex tape invaded Mr. Bollea\u2019s privacy.Ironically, the terms of Gawker\u2019s court-approved bankruptcy plan entitle Mr. Bollea to 45% of the proceeds generated by a possible legal claim the publisher brings against Mr. Thiel.Gregg Galardi,        a Ropes & Gray LLP bankruptcy lawyer representing the Gawker, said at a court hearing in April the any information that is gathered through this examination process could help entice an attorney to take up the legal case under a contingency-fee arrangement.Mr. Galardi declined to comment on the ruling.At the same hearing, counsel for Messrs. Harder and Thiel said the lawsuits that were brought against Gawker were justified and that no basis exists for new litigation. Mr. Bollea\u2019s lawyer also opposed Gawker\u2019s request to issue subpoenas, saying the wrestler wants to move on from his fight with the media company.\u201cWe are pleased that the judge is enforcing our settlement preventing Gawker from obtaining any discovery about Terry,\u201d Mr. Bollea\u2019s lawyer       Dan Tabak       said in an email.Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 12:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gawker-estate-cleared-to-subpoena-peter-thiel-1498667107", "news_title": "Gawker Estate Cleared to Subpoena Peter Thiel ", "keywords": "charles harder, gawker lawsuit, hogan lawsuit,hulk hogan, peter thiel,Gawker Media,Charles Harder,Peter Thiel,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,crime,digital content services,internet,online,media,entertainment,technology"}, {"content": "In \u201cEurope\u2019s Elites Seem Determined to Commit Suicide by \u2018Diversity\u2019\u201d (op-ed, June 19), Douglas Murray leaves out one critical ingredient. Europe\u2019s elites, just like those in the U.S., opt out of the multicultural system they advocate for the rest of us. They live in gated communities or doorman-guarded high rises, travel in chauffeured cars, fly in private jets or first class and generally meet and talk to people like themselves. How could they possibly understand the downside of diversity?Admittedly, the elites are well traveled, so they have seen the cultures immigrants come from, but they never live with them. They look at foreign cultures, skim the top and go back to their bubbles. In the end, their children and grandchildren will be the ones who lose.Charles H. GessnerMarblehead, Mass.Our country was built by immigrants and with them came changes to culture, and even crime. But in the end, immigrants built a country that surpassed Europe, a continent preoccupied with maintaining traditions.Terrorism must be addressed and taken into account in developing immigration policies, but we also must consider the benefits we Americans have seen that come from immigration.Joshua TenzerEnglewood, N.J.Douglas Murray\u2019s statement that \u201cmore immigration from Muslim countries produces many problems, including terrorism\u201d is wrong. The data show that migrants and asylum seekers are least likely to commit crimes, let alone violent crimes. Here in the U.S., as well as in Europe, more terrorism is committed by local citizens than by immigrants. But Mr. Murray\u2019s view seems not to be anti-immigrant, but anti-Muslim immigration. He joins a long list of people who propagate fear of Muslims by demonizing the whole Muslim community. The recommendation to reduce diversity by keeping Muslims out is racist and narrow-minded.Khalid RehmanNew YorkWith respect to the fracture between European and Muslim understanding of justice\u2014this is an opportunity, not a problem.

Negative consequences of the status quo are happening right now to hundreds of companies representing billions of dollars of the U.S. economy. If President Trump curbs imports of steel and steel products in the name of national security, positive impacts are very likely.The article\u2019s illustrations show countries of origin for steel imports to the U.S. Very little raw Chinese steel is imported to the U.S. since tariffs were imposed several years ago. However, millions of tons of Chinese steel are imported every year as pipe, tubing, rebar, structural steel, valves, fittings, car parts, machine parts, etc. None of those items enter the U.S. economy as steel imports even though 50% to 90% of the market value of the goods are comprised of the cost of the steel.

Although Baby wasn\u2019t born with earbuds attached to his head, they\u2019ve become part of his anatomy. He listens to music incessantly and obsessively because he has tinnitus, a ringing in his ears that\u2019s masked by whatever playlist he has chosen to play on whichever iPod he\u2019s decided to pack while driving at preposterous speeds with prodigious skill. The soundtrack is so loud that you may get tinnitus on your own. But you\u2019re also likely to come away with an uptick in your spirits and a grin on your face that won\u2019t quit.When people say there\u2019s nothing new under the sun, they\u2019re either resistant to originality or stuck in the shade. The elements here are as old as the Hollywood Hills: pop, rock, romance, shiny rides, daring heists, blazing guns, blood in the streets, the lure of the road. Plus charming bits of dance, and movie history\u2014\u201cBaby Driver\u201d is a movie about movies, just as \u201cLa La Land\u201d was; it\u2019s the latest in a long line of cinema celebrations from such directors as       Jacques Demy,       David Lynch,       Quentin Tarantino       and Nicolas Winding Refn, who made the stylized and far more violent \u201cDrive.\u201d (      Bill Pope       did the fluent cinematography.       Marcus Rowland       designed the production, which ranges from grungy to gorgeous; I can still see a lyrical scene in a laundromat, where rainbow-colored fabrics arc and fall in a row of rotating dryers.)Yet Mr. Wright, the filmmaker of \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. the World\u201d and the cult comedy trilogy consisting of \u201cShaun of the Dead,\u201d \u201cHot Fuzz\u201d and \u201cThe World\u2019s End,\u201d has put these pieces together into a motion picture that moves to familiar beats in new ways, and that catapults him into the ranks of mainstream filmmakers. The music drives the action, the action syncs to the notes, and the hypersonic car chases leave you popeyed; this is not the traffic of \u201cLa La Land,\u201d gridlocked along a freeway on ramp. (The film was shot in Atlanta and its title comes from the Simon & Garfunkel standard, one of many songs in a vast and eclectic soundtrack.) Cutting rhythms are jagged. Narrative structures aren\u2019t just contrapuntal, they\u2019re orchestral; every scene has been edited within a frame of its life. (The editors were       Jonathan Amos       and       Paul Machliss.      )In its simplest form, this approach gives Baby, a child of his times\u2014though also the adult of the piece\u2014a soundtrack for each segment of his daily adventures, and different iPods for different days and overall moods. In the larger scheme of things, it turns the movie into a time-capsule testament to the primacy of music and movement in contemporary life; the beat is both the medium and the message.There\u2019s a moral dimension as well, though it\u2019s sometimes obscured by the firepower of assault weapons; the action can get ugly, and not always whimsically so. At one point Baby is described as \u201ca good kid and a devil behind the wheel\u201d by Doc (      Kevin Spacey       at the top of his game), the crime boss who runs his gang and a devil who doesn\u2019t drive.He\u2019s more than a good kid. Appalled by the slaughter that the members of the gang visit on their enemies, he\u2019s our old film-noir friend the knight of honor, a hero with a tragic history and a rock-solid (or pop-solid) sense of right and wrong. In the noir tradition, he dreams of the good life he\u2019ll have after one last caper, even though we see that the gang\u2019s luck is running out. And he finds the girl of his dreams in a diner. A waitress named Debora, she\u2019s played radiantly by       Lily James,        who made such an appealing Cinderella in the Disney remake a couple of years ago, and who played Lady Rose MacClare in \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201dUntil now Mr. Elgort\u2019s most memorable role was opposite       Shailene Woodley       in \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d a hit weeper about two beautiful teens in a cancer support group. His performance here is mesmerizing and, in the midst of the choreographed chaos, quietly astonishing, whether he\u2019s surveying his volatile colleagues in crime from behind a pair of shades\u2014they can\u2019t abide his quietude\u2014or doing a casually lovely dance down a street suddenly pressed into service for a moment of musical comedy.The gang has its own claims to distinction.       Jon Hamm       is Buddy, formerly a stockbroker on Wall Street.       Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez       is Darling, Buddy\u2019s volcanic\u2014i.e. crazy\u2014girlfriend.       Jon Bernthal       is Griff, a hard case and a funny one.       Jamie Foxx       is Bats, the polar opposite of Baby\u2014a fast-talking thug who is not at all nice (though he\u2019s wildly funny), unencumbered by honor and unswervingly focused on the acquisition of wealth. By his own proud acknowledgment, Bats does drugs to support a robbery habit.So, in the end, what does all the style and flash add up to?

Soybean prices had fared better due to strong demand from China and elsewhere, though prices have declined as farmers ramped up planting. Heavy rain this spring also forced some farmers to switch some corn fields to soybeans, which typically can be planted later.That trend coincided with Monsanto\u2019s introduction of new soybean varieties that are genetically engineered to resist a more powerful combination of herbicides. About 20 million U.S. acres were sown with the new seeds, executives said Wednesday.\u201cFor soybeans, the momentum continues to be tremendous,\u201d Monsanto President       Brett Begemann       said, as the St. Louis-based company reported better-than-expected profit for the period.Chief Executive       Hugh Grant       said Monsanto\u2019s sale to German chemical conglomerate             Bayer AG       was progressing through antitrust reviews around the world. The $57 billion deal to create the world\u2019s largest supplier of pesticides, seeds and crop genes is expected to close this year, he said.Some jurisdictions already have cleared the deal. As a condition of the deal, South Africa required Bayer to sell a herbicide and crop-gene franchise that competes with Monsanto\u2019s \u201cRoundup Ready\u201d suite of crops and weed killers.A 29% increase in quarterly sales for soybean seeds and crop genes prompted Monsanto on Wednesday to maintain its forecast earnings of $4.09 to $4.55 a share for its fiscal year, which wraps up Aug. 31.Monsanto shares were ahead 1.1% at $118.56 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.Monsanto\u2019s new soybean variety, engineered to resist the herbicide dicamba as well as glyphosate, has been linked to crop damage in some Southern parts of the U.S.A growing number of farmers in Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Tennessee have reported crop damage allegedly caused by dicamba drifting from neighboring fields. Some farmers have sued Monsanto.The company has said it advises farmers on how to use the spray safely and will fight the lawsuits.For its latest quarter, Monsanto reported a profit of $843 million, or $1.90 a share, up from $717 million, or $1.63 a share, a year earlier.

Many women consider them the closest thing to an infallible garment the 21st century has yet produced. Skinnies owe their existence and money-grabbing allure to elastane, also known as Lycra, the stretchy synthetic fiber that allows for figure-sculpting cuts that Mr. Levi Strauss could never have imagined. But skinnies may have reached their snapping point: 100% cotton denim\u2014known in the industry as \u201crigid\u201d\u2014is in the midst of a comeback.Consider this: Brands that staked their reputations on an ability to craft jeans that cradled the derri\u00e8re and calves like a girdle, including Frame, Citizens of Humanity, and Current/Elliott, have all begun offering pure-cotton styles. One of the current exemplars of rigid denim is New York label Brock Collection\u2019s Wright jean (seen below). The brand reports a high, over 80% sell-through rate for the style at Barneys New York. Even Gap, always a reliable barometer of trend saturation, has returned to its roots with jeans completely free of Lycra.\u201cI feel old and not cool now when I wear my skinnies,\u201d said       Amy Leverton,        37, author of the 2015 book \u201cDenim Dudes,\u201d about indigo-loving guys (\u201cDenim Dudettes\u201d is due out next year).The stretch backlash gained momentum in 2015 when streetwear label Vetements, designed by Demna Gvasalia, repurposed vintage Levi\u2019s, said Barneys fashion director Marina Larroud\u00e9. \u201cFashion insiders were getting old 501s tailored for a long time, but Gvasalia brought [reworked Levi\u2019s] to a wider audience,\u201d she said. Despite a four-figure price tag, Vetements\u2019 pure cotton jeans\u2014pieced together from various vintage pairs\u2014were a hit.Although stretch denim first appeared in the 1970s, said designer       Chloe Lonsdale,        founder of M.i.h Jeans, it wasn\u2019t until the early aughts that it became the industry standard. Ms. Lonsdale, whose father owned Jean Machine, a seminal London denim boutique, sees the return to rigid as a quest for authenticity: \u201cThat classic jean aesthetic, that       Lauren Hutton       feeling, you don\u2019t get that in a skinny jean that hugs your ankles.\u201dThose making the switch should keep a few things in mind. The cut of vintage denim doesn\u2019t always work for modern sensibilities; older jeans will likely require alterations. When it comes to new iterations, Ms. Larroud\u00e9 recommends a slim straight-leg style with a mid- or high-rise, like Calvin Klein\u2019s fresh take on its original nothing-comes-between-me-and-my-Calvins jeans.While rigid jeans eventually excel at comfort, be prepared for an initial struggle, said Ms. Lonsdale, who grew up hearing stories of customers lying on the floor of her father\u2019s shop while a salesperson pulled up their zippers with a clothes hanger. But the jeans will, in time, ease up and mold to your body. More important, that fit, unlike that of stretch denim\u2014which eventually loses shape\u2014will stay. The beauty of rigid jeans is that they last for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s like leather. It\u2019s tough. So it\u2019s going to age beautifully,\u201d said       Erik Torstensson,        co-founder of denim brand Frame. The indigo dye eventually gets scraped away from the cotton fiber over time. \u201cYou get that beautiful fading as you wear them,\u201d said M.i.h\u2019s Ms. Lonsdale. And should you decide to let down their hem or chop your rigid jeans into cutoffs, they\u2019ll play along by fraying beautifully. Stretch fibers snap and break.For those loath to relinquish stretch entirely, denim brands are making styles with as little stretch as possible. M.i.h recently launched a style called Cult that uses denim with stretch only in the warp fibers and not in the weft. That means that they give lengthwise\u2014which makes sitting easier\u2014but not crosswise, avoiding the telltale bagging at the knees that even the best stretch jeans eventually exhibit.And remember: Denim is not a zero-sum game. \u201cOn a long flight, I\u2019m not going to wear rigid jeans,\u201d said Ms. Leverton. \u201cWhen I want to look cool, I will.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-28 11:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-skinny-jeans-backlash-why-non-stretch-denim-is-ruling-again-1498664543", "news_title": "The Skinny-Jeans Backlash: Why Non-Stretch Denim Is Ruling Again", "keywords": "denim trends,jeans without stretch,no stretch jeans,political,general news,fashion,living,lifestyle,clothing,cut,sew clothing,textiles,consumer goods"}, {"content": "\u2022 Senior wealth manager and fiduciary specialist at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, San Francisco/Menlo Park  \u2022 Education: B.A. Philosophy, Boston University; J.D. Golden Gate University School of Law SchoolBackground: A passion for social justice and championing equal rights has been a thread throughout Ms. Brasso\u2019s career. \u201cI went to law school because I wanted to change the world,\u201d she says. Ms. Brasso\u2019s first stop out of school was as a contract attorney with a Seattle law firm that specializes in trusts and estate planning. That experience gave her an appreciation for the importance of comprehensive estate planning, especially for groups such as the LGBTQ community, who, at the time, weren\u2019t guaranteed equal protection under the law. In 2007, Ms. Brasso took a position as a trust officer with Merrill Lynch Trust Co. where she had the opportunity to play an active role in clients\u2019 financial plans. Five years later, she returned to Northern California, and in 2016, she joined BNY Mellon Wealth Management.Her practice: BNY Mellon manages $212 billion for 18,000 client relationships, nationwide. Ms. Brasso is responsible for providing strategic guidance on a variety of tax and fiduciary matters, including complex estate planning. She also teams up with estate-planning attorneys to educate clients and colleagues alike about the intricacies of same-sex estate planning and the challenges same-sex couples face.On advising same-sex couples: In estate planning, clients often prefer leaving medical decisions to family members. That can sometimes be an issue for same-sex couples who don\u2019t have children whom they can designate as a trustee or give health-care directives or power of attorney. That means advisers should help same-sex couples explore other options\u2014whether it\u2019s a niece or nephew, close friend, or even corporate trustee\u2014who is willing to assume that responsibility, says Ms. Brasso.On the continued need for same-sex estate planning: After the Supreme Court struck down the Defense Of Marriage Act, there was a sense among many in the LGBTQ community that estate planning had become less important for same-sex couples. But today, people are nervous about how potential changes to the law under the Trump administration could restrict their rights and jeopardize their ability to provide for, and make critical decisions about, a spouse or partner, says Ms. Brasso. \u201cThat uncertainty reinforces the continued need for estate planning,\u201d she says. \u201cAs advisers, it\u2019s our responsibility to educate clients about these challenges and to really listen to their concerns so we can build plans together to help address them.\u201dOn the greatest challenge facing the advising industry: \u201cClients are skeptical about the safety of our financial system and the accountability of financial professionals,\u201d says Ms. Brasso. \u201cI think advisers overcome that skepticism through transparency, empathy and ensuring that clients feel they are truly being heard.\u201dHer proudest personal achievement\u2026 Being given the Humanitarian Concerns award at Boston University in recognition of her work on civil and human rights issues, she says.Outside of the office you\u2019ll find her\u2026 Marching in support of political and social causes, as well as enjoying the outdoors with her partner and their Australian shepherd, Buster Posey.\u2014Compiled by Alex Coppola", "news_time": "2017-06-28 11:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/estate-planning-for-same-sex-couples-1498663736", "news_title": "Estate Planning for Same-Sex Couples ", "keywords": "corporate,industrial news,political,general news,estate planning,personal finance,banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "WHEN IT COMES to leisure, my hat is off to the Italians.

The recipe is as easy as 3, 2, 1: three parts Prosecco, two parts Aperol, one part soda water, over ice with an orange, lime or grapefruit garnish.It\u2019s a thirst quencher, sure, cool, sparkling and quaffable. But the Aperol spritz also has a certain la dolce vita to it that, say, a gin and tonic doesn\u2019t. Prosecco will do that. And so will the color red\u2014just ask anyone who is fortunate enough to own a Ferrari that color.How do you further summerize the quintessential summer drink? Make it pitcher-friendly, because even a cocktail this easy becomes a chore when you have to mix one after another. The Pompel-Spritz, a twist dreamed up by       Pamela Wiznitzer,        creative director of New York cocktail bar Seamstress, dials back the sparkling wine and adds grapefruit juice, a natural companion to the delectably bitter Aperol.This drink, like all spritzes, is best in the late afternoon, with some antipasti, as you wait for the sun to set and the temperature to drop before settling into a late dinner of tortelli followed by grilled polpi and then maybe some formaggi and honey. You know, a typical Monday in Italy. But, hey, a long weekend and a backyard grill will work too.Just chill the above ingredients and pour into a pitcher with ice. Serve drinks in highball glasses with ice.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 11:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-pitcher-drink-that-confers-instant-cool-1498663616", "news_title": "The Pitcher Drink That Confers Instant Cool", "keywords": "aperol spritz recipe,entertaining cocktails,italian cocktail recipes,july 4 drinks,july 4 entertaining,pitcher drink recipe,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,wine,beer,spirits"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014By asking banks to examine the borrowings of a few high-profile conglomerates earlier this month, Beijing flagged its worries about these companies\u2019 overseas outreach, giving banks information the rest of the market didn\u2019t have.The instructions were given to a group of banks including the four largest and some midsize ones on June 6, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. But they only became known on June 22 after a morning of markets reacting to rumors centered on one of the companies, property and entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group. Before noon that day, Shenzhen-listed shares of             Wanda Film Co.      , the main listed unit of the group, fell nearly 10% before trading was halted. A Wanda-related bond also fell.The Journal and local media reported in the afternoon that Chinese banks had started a broad risk assessment that went beyond Wanda\u2019s borrowings. Once that became clear, the value of the bond started recovering. Wanda Film shares regained some ground after trading resumed Friday.The way the order was communicated quickly drew complaints from investors and academics, who said it enabled unfair trading as banks were in a position to pare holdings of Wanda and the other four groups\u2014Anbang Insurance Group, HNA Group Co.,             Fosun International Ltd.       as well as Rossoneri Sports Investment Management Changxing Ltd., the buyer of the AC Milan soccer club\u2014before the rest of the market knew their loans were under scrutiny. It\u2019s unclear if the regulator also addressed the potential for trading by the banks.The review order from China\u2019s banking regulator came as Beijing tries to get a grip on runaway debt. On Monday, a top-level Communist Party meeting chaired by President       Xi Jinping       stressed the need to strengthen monitoring of Chinese firms\u2019 overseas investments and operations, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.An analyst at             Bank of China Ltd.      , Wang Youxin, said on Wednesday that the banking regulator wants to make sure overseas investments are \u201crational,\u201d with valuations of targets like hotels and football clubs highly fluctuating. He said the regulator also wants to clamp down on firms buying in order to move money abroad. China has suffered waves of capital outflows that threaten the stability of its financial system.One institutional investor who had a big bet on Wanda bonds watched his investment turn from a profit to a loss as rumors swirled on Chinese social media Thursday, some of which said banks were dumping Wanda bonds because of \u201cpolitical risks.\u201dThe investor said that given the extent of losses in the market, the regulator should have come out to offer an explanation. The banking commission didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.It wasn\u2019t clear whether or to what extent banks had reacted to the directive by selling assets related to the companies mentioned. Bank of China began scaling back its holdings of Wanda bonds in early June, tagging those bonds as \u201crisky,\u201d according to a person familiar with the situation. Bank of China\u2019s news department didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.China Construction Bank,       the focus of one rumor, denied that it had sold Wanda holdings.In a public letter to the head of China\u2019s banking commission,       Liu Jipeng,        a capital-markets professor at China University of Political Science and Law, said the regulator failed to anticipate how its communication to banks would play out in the market.He suggested the market action showed that financial institutions, whether or not they had undertaken a review, had sold off bonds in a way that wasn\u2019t fair to Wanda or other investors.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the banking commission relying on financial institutions to lead the way in disrupting financial order and destroying the stability of capital markets?\u201d he wrote. Mr. Liu declined to comment beyond his letter. Wanda Chairman       Wang Jianlin       is a director at the school where Mr. Liu teaches.It wasn\u2019t the first time Chinese regulators came under criticism over market turmoil that followed measures intended to reduce risk. Chinese stocks and bonds took a hit earlier this year after Beijing\u2019s efforts to contain new borrowing left both banks and companies scrambling for funds.Officials have turned more cautious in their approach, but companies and investors that feel blindsided by regulators\u2019 intentions have few ways to complain.The China Banking Regulatory Commission \u201chas placed a heavy focus on how to make sure the banks are running in a healthy way,\u201d said Tiecheng Yang, a lawyer in charge of financial regulation at Clifford Chance LLP in Beijing. The commission may be less committed to protecting retail investors, he said.The protection of stock and bond investors is the responsibility of China\u2019s central bank and securities regulator, a task that sometimes collides with regulators\u2019 mandate to carry out the directives of the Communist Party leadership.Some analysts say that if the regulator had publicly declared a probe of risks associated with some major Chinese companies\u2019 overseas expansion publicly, broader market turmoil would have ensued.\u201cThey are not aiming to increase capital-market volatility,\u201d said David Millhouse, head of China research at brokerage Forsyth Barr Asia in Hong Kong.As investors learned about the regulatory message to banks on Thursday afternoon, Hong Kong-listed HNA Holding Group Co., a unit of HNA Group, fell 6%, while Fosun International Ltd. closed down 5.8%. Anbang doesn\u2019t have any listed units.Wanda said in a statement on Friday that more than 6 billion yuan ($876 million) of market value from its film subsidiary had been wiped out due to \u201crumors and slander\u201d and that investors had gotten hurt. It stopped short of blaming the regulator\u2019s order for the turmoil, and said regulators hadn\u2019t yet made an assessment of the risk related to any of its borrowing.Wanda declined to comment further.\u2014Grace Zhu, Lingling Wei and Gregor Stuart Hunter contributed to this article.Write to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Investors Say Beijing Gave Banks an Edge.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 11:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-say-beijing-enabled-unfair-trading-by-chinese-banks-1498663134", "news_title": "Investors Say Beijing Enabled Unfair Trading by Chinese Banks ", "keywords": "china banks,china government,china lending,china regulators,china risk,chinese conglomerates,dalian wanda,Dalian Wanda Group,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,corporate,industrial news,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Thailand has sold much of its ample stocks of rice, heralding a shift for the regional market: The grain is now trading in response to short-term shifts in supply and demand, which are driving prices higher.Rice prices have been weak since 2012 due to excess supplies, particularly in Thailand, a major producer, and declines in the currencies of a number of major exporters. Now, though. Thailand\u2019s government has reduced its stockpile of rice to 8 million metric tons from 2014\u2019s peak of 17.5 million tons.That has left rice supplies in the world\u2019s five largest exporters\u2014India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam and the U.S.\u2014at their lowest level since 2010 at around 29 million tons, according to Samarendu Mohanty, principal scientist at the International Rice Research Institute. The quintet\u2019s collective stockpile topped out in 2012 at 41 million tons.For three years, Thailand bought the grain from farmers at up to double prevailing market prices in an aggressive attempt to jack up rural incomes and boost spending. The program fell apart in early 2014 after incurring paper losses of some $15 billion. Much of the rice was left unsold in government warehouses. The cost of the program was a factor in the military overthrowing the then-elected government.The absence of a huge Thailand surplus and lower inventories elsewhere have pushed average spot prices to their highest level since August. Futures prices are also climbing, with U.S. rough-rice futures on the Chicago Board of Trade\u2014the most closely watched by international markets\u2014up 20% this year.\u201cThe upswing in prices recently has been almost entirely demand-led,\u201d said       Darren Cooper,        senior economist at the International Grains Council. \u201cI think the question is how much demand can be sustained over the coming year and how much that impacts on prices.\u201dDemand has been broad. Thailand recently completed a large sale of rice to Iran, while Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have had to buy the grain because of poor weather. Meanwhile, supplies in the Philippines and Indonesia are low, which could require them to import as well. The U.S. is experiencing increased demand from the Middle East.\u201cIf we see some big orders from Indonesia and the Philippines, you definitely expect the prices to move up further,\u201d Mr. Mohanty said.However, the extent of further price gains could prove limited.A number of agencies are forecasting strong production for the year through July. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has projected rice output of 483.1 million tons. If the department is correct, that would be a 2.4% increase from the previous year and a record high. Early projections show only a slight drop in production for the coming season.Write to Lucy Craymer at Lucy.Craymer@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 11:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rice-prices-on-the-rise-as-inventory-shrinks-1498663007", "news_title": "Rice Prices on the Rise as Inventory Shrinks", "keywords": "Darren Cooper,output,production,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,grain markets,grains,edible oils markets,rice markets,agriculture,farming"}, {"content": "Today\u2019s pop quiz: If Delta and American both have flights from Dallas-Fort Worth to Detroit leaving at 11 a.m., and both flights take 2 hours, 53 minutes to get to the gate in Detroit, which one is late?The answer: American Flight 43. American schedules that trip at two hours, 38 minutes. Delta Flight 653 is scheduled to make the trip in two hours, 47 minutes, with nine minutes of extra cushion. The same travel time could leave American 15 minutes late\u2014tardy in Transportation Department statistics. Delta, only six minutes overdue, would be on time in the eyes of DOT.On average, Delta schedules trips with five minutes more padding than American, helping Delta place higher in on-time performance rankings, according to DOT data.Every airline gives itself extra cushion in its schedule to account for weather delays, mechanical repairs, air-traffic control slow-ups and a thousand other things that leave planes and passengers stewing. It may not seem this way to casual travelers, but airline schedules are quite precise. They\u2019re planned to the minute based on seasonal winds, time of day, aircraft type and historical performance.Yet airlines disagree on how much cushion feels right. Delta and United add more padding into schedules than American and Southwest, according to DOT data comparing scheduled time with actual gate-to-gate time.The padding is only one factor in airline performance, but it makes a difference. In 2016, 86.5% of Delta domestic flights arrived on time under the DOT\u2019s definition, which is at the gate within 14 minutes of scheduled time. That was best among the four biggest U.S. carriers. United was second at 81.7%, according to DOT. Southwest had an 80.8% on-time arrival rate, American 79.4%.Among airlines, on-time performance is a competitive battle. Advertising as an on-time leader has benefits: Reliability matters to frequent fliers. Several airlines pay employees bonuses based on on-time arrivals. Some now promise rebates to top corporate clients if they don\u2019t beat competitors in punctuality.DOT data show Delta has increased its schedule cushion every year since 2009. This year through April, the most recent month available, Delta\u2019s flights have been scheduled about nine minutes longer than they actually took, on average. That\u2019s about a 6% cushion. In 2009, Delta\u2019s schedule employed just two minutes of padding, on average, or 1.4%. That year only 78.6% of Delta flights arrived on-time, according to DOT.Many changes drove Delta\u2019s operational turnaround. The airline hasn\u2019t only improved on-time performance, but also dramatically reduced cancellations. Better-managing maintenance and employees played a major role.Delta says a big shift for the airline came in 2011, when it decided to focus on its rate of arrivals at the scheduled minute, not the 14-minute cushion DOT offers. That\u2019s a tougher standard, but one that increases reliability, helps customers make connections and prevents traffic jams at big hubs.The airline says it increased scheduled time and decreased ground time for planes. Often airlines bolster ground time, so a 10-to-15 minute delay doesn\u2019t impact the next flight. Delta chose the opposite approach: increasing scheduled time\u2014what airlines call block time, so 80% or more of its flights arrive exactly on schedule, then shortening ground time between flights.\u201cWe think this is the best combination for             Delta Air Lines                   and our customers,\u201d says       Dave Holtz,        senior vice president operations and customer care. \u201cIf higher reliability is a bad thing, someone\u2019s got to prove it to me.\u201dSchedule padding has been on the rise overall, but it\u2019s not as extreme as many travelers suspect. In 1997 and 2007, scheduled time for domestic flights almost matched the actual time they took. Schedules were within 1% of actual flight times. By 2012, that average for all airlines was up to 3%. Last year, the average scheduled time for domestic flights last year was 145 minutes, but actual gate-to-gate time of 140 minutes. That\u2019s a 4% cushion.Congestion at busy airports has played a role, along with more bad weather. If you study a single flight over a number of days, the difference between the longest and shortest trip has widened, says       Tracy Lee,        United\u2019s vice president of network operations. As airlines have planned for that variance, scheduled trip times have gone up.\u201cI think everybody is higher than they used to be, and that\u2019s because we really don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Mr. Lee says.Every minute added to schedules can increase costs: higher crew pay for trips at many carriers, more planes and gates needed to fly the same number of trips. Adding one minute to every flight costs United $10 million in annual expenses.The changes Delta made influenced United, Mr. Lee says. United ran its average schedule buffer up to about nine minutes, or 5% padding, in 2015 as it worked to boost on-time performance. Last year, the padding increased more, to an average of 10 minutes per domestic flight. With operations running more reliably, United trimmed 90 seconds off every flight last fall, Mr. Lee says.Hawaiian, Alaska, Virgin America and Spirit are the stingiest on padding schedule minutes, according to an analysis of DOT data.American\u2019s schedule also runs lean: four minutes, or just over 2.5%, for its average domestic trip.American says it has been working to reduce delays and run more on time, but has resisted the temptation simply to add minutes to its schedule. American internally focuses on on-time departures more than arrivals.\u201cThe part you can control is when you leave,\u201d spokesman Josh Freed says. Padding the schedule to achieve more on-time arrivals \u201cwouldn\u2019t fix the problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThe schedule should be an accurate reflection of what it\u2019s going to take to operate that flight.\u201dSouthwest says it has gotten more surgical in its planning. As a result, schedules have moved closer to actual trip times. In 2012, Southwest had nearly 6% more time in its schedule than actual trips. In the first four months of this year, an average Southwest flight had just four minutes of schedule padding, or close to 3%.Southwest isolated aircraft flying New York-Chicago trips, as well as flights between San Francisco and southern California, says       Adam Decaire,        managing director for network planning and performance. Instead of flying a New York-Chicago trip, then on to other cities, those planes fly back and forth between the same cities. Delays there don\u2019t slow down the rest of Southwest\u2019s system.Southwest studies two years of historical performance when setting block times. \u201cIf we have a particularly bad year of weather, then you\u2019ll see some increase in block time the next year as a result of that,\u201d Mr. Decaire says.Write to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Your Flight Is On Time\u2014Sort Of.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 11:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/which-airlines-pad-their-schedules-the-most-1498662950", "news_title": "Which Airlines Pad Their Schedules the Most?", "keywords": "arrivals,delays,dot,eta,extra time,late flights,on time,padding,rankings,schedules,Delta Air Lines,DAL,United Continental Holdings,UAL,American Airlines Group,AAL,political,general news,living,lifestyle,travel,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,air transport,alternative investments,automotive,financial services,investing,securities,transportation,logistics,venture capital"}, {"content": "For the iPhone\u2019s 10th birthday,             Apple Inc.        AAPL 0.63%       is giving itself a big, new challenge.Maintaining its usual secrecy about product plans, Apple is widely expected later this year to announce three iPhones instead of the usual two\u2014updated versions of the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus as well as a 10th-anniversary iPhone with a different display and new features like wireless charging and facial-recognition technology.Such devices would make an attractive purchase for customers disappointed with the relatively incremental improvements of recent smartphones. But analysts say that such a plan also has big risks for Apple, including the possibility of a higher price tag that could dampen demand, trickier manufacturing requirements and the added complexity of forecasting and marketing a third model.Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs engineered Apple\u2019s revival in the early 2000s in part by slashing the number of Apple products sold, adopting the philosophy that making fewer but better devices would increase sales. The iPhone\u2019s popularity has tested that philosophy. Though Apple produces fewer handset models\u00a0than many of its rivals, it has increased the number of colors from one to six in the past decade and expanded from a single model annually to five models last year, including the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone SE. Apple also makes the iPad in four models, the Apple Watch in two versions with countless variations, 11 Macs, the Apple TV and a host of accessories.Most product expansions have come off without trouble under Apple Chief Executive       Tim Cook,        whose operational prowess helped turn Apple into the world\u2019s most valuable\u00a0listed company. The company did run into trouble, though, as its newest device, the AirPod headphones, were delayed several weeks by production challenges and remain back-ordered. It also missed out on sales of the iPhone 7 Plus, its highest-priced handset, during the December quarter because of what Mr. Cook has acknowledged were mistakes in forecasting demand and supply.Anticipation of the new iPhone has helped push up Apple\u2019s stock price to a record this year, although it has recently lost some of those gains.Challenges with some upcoming iPhone hardware features have stoked concerns about potential for delays this year specifically for the 10th-anniversary handset. Several analysts say they expect\u00a0it\u00a0to be several weeks late because of challenges related to a new type of fingerprint-verification technology. Apple also is running into problems with a lamination process during the device\u2019s assembly, multiple analysts have reported.\u201cIf they lose just one week, that\u2019s big numbers in terms of volume and a lot of revenue and a lot of angst,\u201d Dan Panzica, a supply-chain analyst at IHS Markit who follows Apple closely.Apple previously ran into production delays in 2012 with the iPhone 5, which featured a new coating material that was more susceptible to scratches.Broadcom Ltd.      , which supplies chips to Apple for the iPhone, fueled expectations of a delay during a June 1 analysts call, saying initial production of a next-generation handset from a large North American customer has been \u201cslower this year compared to prior years.\u201dThe past decade saw Apple\u2019s smartphone go from a rarity to a must-have, as apps and features ballooned.Broadcom didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Apple declined to comment.Apple\u2019s primary iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn Technology Group, has time to improve production processes. Still, supply chain experts said the anticipated risk of delay is greater with the anniversary phone because it is expected to be Apple\u2019s\u00a0first with an organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen.\u00a0OLED, made by only a few suppliers, is more flexible for phone design than the LCD screens in current iPhones.OLED technology could enable a thinner iPhone with better battery performance and a screen that bends around the phone\u2019s curved edges, according to display technology executives. But it also puts Apple at the mercy of its biggest competitor,             Samsung Electronics Co.      , which has a 97% share of manufactured mobile displays in the OLED market, according to the OLED Association.Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 phone, a large-display phone unveiled in March, also features an OLED screen, putting Apple in the position of catching up. Wireless providers\u00a0selling the iPhone\u00a0are expected to continue promotions for the Galaxy S8.With three new phones this year, Apple\u00a0will be pressed to predict sales,\u00a0supply-chain consultant John Haber of Spend Management Experts said, and it will have to react quickly\u00a0if it misreads\u00a0demand forecasts for any of the three devices.\u201cYou have all these variables and uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Haber said.Analysts project Apple could sell the anniversary iPhone for around $1,000. RBC Capital Markets estimated that price based on analysis of the higher costs of new materials such as the OLED display, a front-facing camera for facial recognition, increased RAM and storage.The other two phones, expected to be called the 7s and 7s Plus, will cost around $700 and $800 each, according to Nomura Holdings\u2019 Instinet LLC. Apple\u2019s current flagship models, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, sell for $649 and $769.The trick for Apple will be making sure the anniversary edition doesn\u2019t come so packed with new features that it completely overshadows the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus phones in the eyes of consumers, said Robert Cihra, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners.\u201cYou don\u2019t want the 7s and 7s Plus to suddenly be considered low-end\u2014because they won\u2019t be priced as such,\u201d Mr. Cihra asked.Ken Kahn, a business professor specializing in product forecasting at Virginia Commonwealth University,\u00a0said Apple will have to calibrate marketing carefully to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cYou can\u2019t put all the marketing on the new phone and have the other phones not get the marketing they need,\u201d Prof. Kahn said.\u2014Takashi Mochizuki contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Apple Tempts Fate With Next iPhone.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 11:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-anniversary-edition-gives-analysts-pre-party-jitters-1498642205", "news_title": "The 10th Anniversary iPhone: Is Apple Trying to Do Too Much?", "keywords": "anniversary,anniversary iphone,birthday,iphone,iphone 7s,iphone 7s plus,iphone anniversary edition,iphonedecade,iphone turns 10,iphone x,latest iphone,new iphone,Apple,AAPL,Foxconn Technology Group,Dan Panzica,John Haber,Ken Kahn,Robert Cihra,Tim Cook,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,metal products,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,industrial goods,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "Yvette Meunier, a scientist and avid bicyclist, last year took it upon herself to chronicle an increasing trash menace in Maine, those little liquor bottles, typical of minibars and airplanes.Along her regular 8.4-mile path from Augusta to Gardiner, she decided to stop, note and photograph every discarded tiny bottle. She placed her GPS device next to each one to document its location. \u201cIn no way did I want it to look like I was planting any of this stuff,\u201d she said.She tossed each mini into a bag tied by bungee cord to the back of her bike. \u201cIt was the worst bike ride ever,\u201d she said, of the frequent stops to collect used bottles. \u201cI was about four hours in when I called it quits.\u201dNonetheless, diligent mapping of her data concluded she collected 9.4 mini liquor bottles per mile, versus 2.3 \u201c5-Hour Energy\u201d drinks per mile and 1.25 milk containers per mile, she said.She lugged her bounty earlier this year to a State House hearing (except the milk cartons, which \u201cwere a little raunchy,\u201d she said). Ms. Meunier presented the evidence to lawmakers and spoke in favor of a plan to slap a deposit on the bottles to inspire consumers to return them for refunds. A bill requiring a five-cent deposit was passed in May by Maine\u2019s Democratic-controlled House and Republican-led Senate.That\u2019s when things got nippy. Gov.       Paul LePage,        a Republican, vetoed the legislation, initially calling the deposit on minis an \u201cantibusiness vote.\u201d Lawmakers overrode his veto, as they often do in Maine.Now, in a move that has shaken and stirred many Mainers, the governor is trying to boot mini liquor bottles off shelves. He cited increased costs to businesses and the state to expand the existing bottle-recycling program.Opponents point out a ban would also be unfriendly to businesses, yet Mr. LePage isn\u2019t backing down. State regulators said in a report Friday that taking away tiny bottles won\u2019t substantially affect state liquor revenue because fans will likely simply \u201ctransition to a larger container.\u201dMr. LePage has also argued the deposit doesn\u2019t address the root of the problem\u2014people chugging \u201cthe little nips,\u201d as the bottles are often dubbed, in cars and then flinging them out windows to get rid of the proof. \u201cThere is no possible way any deposit is going to get people to save the evidence,\u201d he said in a May interview with WGAN news radio in Maine.Mr. LePage\u2019s office said he had no updated remarks beyond his May public statement and radio interview.Maine has a history of being on the rocks with booze\u2014it became the first state to officially go dry in 1851, long before the 1920 start of the federal Prohibition, which ended in 1933. Maine wasn\u2019t a teetotaler all those years but it was \u201cmore dry than wet,\u201d said       Earle Shettleworth,        a historian in Maine. But the latest brawl surprises minibottle fans from imbibers to artists.\u201cIt does seem like a pretty big stretch over such a tiny thing, quite literally,\u201d said Whitney Gill, an assistant manager at the Maine Crafts Association. Local artists use pocket-size booze bottles to make funky wreaths, chess sets and salt-and-pepper shakers.Little liquor bottles once mostly livened flights and hotel stays. These days they are surging as manufacturers market them as a low-cost way to sample alcohol.Maine is one of 17 states that directly controls the supply of liquor, selling wholesale. Maine sold 9.8 million minibottles to retail establishments in the 12 months ending in late May, up 52% from the previous 12 months. These kinds of sales would offset costs off a deposit program, proponents say.\u200bMaine\u2019s hottest seller is a mini version of Fireball Cinnamon Whisky (Its slogan is \u201cTastes like heaven, burns like hell\u201d), the director of Maine\u2019s liquor bureau testified in a February hearing. \u200bA ban on tiny bottles in Maine would mean hotels could no longer stock them in minibars, according to the state. (Enterprising guests could still bring them in from out of Maine.)Boosters say the wee servings, which can be had for 99 cents, are convenient and promote responsible portions, while critics say discarded minis blight the landscape.After Santa Fe, N.M., outlawed small bottles of alcohol in 2015, a judge overturned that decision, saying it conflicted with state law.Currently, proposed Massachusetts legislation titled \u201cAn Act Promoting the Proper Disposal of Miniatures\u201d would put a five-cent deposit on little bottles. More than 1,000 supporters signed a petition titled \u201cNip the Nip.\u201dThe Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade association, opposes crackdowns on miniatures in Massachusetts and Maine, saying bottle-deposit laws crimp consumer choice.Maine Republican State Rep. Susan Austin wore two lapel pins, handmade from teensy bottles she had collected from roadways during one of her daily walks, to the State House hearing, where she supported the deposit bill. Ms. Austin also brought a bag of 40 or so of the miniatures. Each had been washed, laid out by her wood stove to dry, and then categorized by condition, including \u201croadkill\u201d for the particularly mangled.\u201cI offer specimen A as evidence,\u201d she testified, as she exhibited her inventory. Ms. Austin has since made a necklace out of the little bottles.State Sen. Thomas Saviello, a Republican, said the castoffs aren\u2019t a reason to cease sales of minibottles because people chuck beer cans from windows, too. \u201cDon\u2019t just pick on the nips,\u201d he said.On July 11, at the governor\u2019s request, the State Liquor & Lottery Commission will hold a public meeting on whether to \u201cdelist\u201d 50-milliliter-size spirits currently available for purchase. The commission, whose five members are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, will make the final decision.Ms. Meunier, the cyclist who documented the littered roadways, hopes it isn\u2019t last call. She backs the bottle deposit and wants the tiny bottles off the road, but not out of Maine.\u201cI like putting them in my Christmas stockings,\u201d she said.Write to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Last Call for Minibottles?

Now, it wants to officially become part of the metropolis.The nearly 15,000-student research university, which already brands itself as being in Atlanta and has an Atlanta address, filed paperwork Tuesday to annex itself into the city\u2019s borders. Currently, the school\u2019s 630 acre campus isn\u2019t under the city\u2019s jurisdiction, but lies in adjacent unincorporated DeKalb County.Emory administrators hope the annexation leads to, among other things, an expanded light rail route through the notoriously traffic-congested region.The university\u2019s move, and its strategy\u00a0to become more tightly linked to\u00a0Atlanta, reflects a broader trend of schools forging close ties with their urban communities\u2014as responsible or charitable neighbors, and because their own success may depend on the safety and business opportunities of the cities in which they are based.The University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University in recent years have invested in revitalizing parts of Philadelphia, while Johns Hopkins University acknowledges on its website that \u201cthe health and well being of the university is inextricably tied to the physical, social, and economic well being\u201d of Baltimore.Emory, which has about 29,000 employees, had been publicly considering the move for nearly a year before submitting its petition to the city. If the school doesn\u2019t join the city, it will miss out on the opportunity to benefit from a proposed expanded rail line and other transportation projects being funded by an increase in Atlanta sales tax, a move approved by the city\u2019s voters last November.The school already has a number of affiliations with other educational and cultural institutions in the city proper, and this move to more formally align with the growing, vibrant city is \u201cin the long-term interest of the university,\u201d said Emory spokesman       Vince Dollard.To legitimately pursue annexation, which requires the ownership of property spanning the Atlanta border, Emory bought a house across the street from the western edge of its campus last year. A portion of the home\u2019s plot is in the city.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also filed a petition Tuesday\u00a0for its campus, technically inside Emory, to be annexed by Atlanta. The annexation of that property, according to a statement, allows the CDC to continue critical response work in DeKalb County \u201cwhile linking to Atlanta\u2019s infrastructure and municipal services.\u201dThe city said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0that it welcomed the school and the CDC\u2014as well as some \u201cthriving commercial businesses,\u201d which could bring new tax revenue\u2014under its umbrella. Emory is a nonprofit institution and the CDC is a federal entity.Emory already has its own police force, and Mr. Dollard said the school would work with the city of Atlanta for fire services. The school will also remain part of DeKalb County.Emory and the CDC said they expect their new city affiliation to be effective this fall.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 11:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/emory-university-looks-to-be-incorporated-into-city-of-atlanta-1498662466", "news_title": "Emory University Looks to Be Incorporated Into City of Atlanta", "keywords": "annexation,atlanta,dekalb county,emory university,emory university annexation,emory university atlanta,southern ivies,southern ivy,Emory University,political,general news,education,university,college"}, {"content": "For years,             Nike Inc.        NKE 0.21%       was one of the biggest holdouts against             Amazon.com Inc.,        AMZN 0.24%       refusing to provide its sneakers and athletic clothing for sale on the hulking e-commerce site. Its products were so cool, the company reasoned, it didn\u2019t need or want the help.Recently, Nike reversed course. Behind that decision lies a dramatic shift in the balance of power between brands and Amazon.For decades, big consumer brands carefully controlled which retailers could sell their wares and at what prices. And for years, Amazon left the brands alone.Lately, the explosion of third-party sellers on the site has led to authentic goods from companies such as Nike, Chanel, The North Face, Patagonia and Urban Decay being sold on Amazon even though they don\u2019t authorize the sales, undercutting their grip on pricing and distribution.Even though Nike didn\u2019t send Amazon its products either directly or through approved wholesalers, Nike is the most purchased apparel brand on the site, according to a Morgan Stanley survey. A recent search for Nike products on Amazon turned up roughly 73,000 items.These days, there are so many third-party resellers, who generally are allowed to resell goods they have lawfully acquired at whatever price they want, that companies see few ways to stop them.\u201cIt\u2019s a Whac-A-Mole situation,\u201d said       Robert Payne,        an attorney who works with companies on the issue.Nike\u2019s recent deal represents one strategy: Add Amazon as a distributor to drown out the flood of third-party sales. Nike agreed to start selling some products directly to Amazon in exchange for stricter policing of counterfeits and restrictions on unsanctioned sales, according to a person familiar with the deal.Amazon told sellers this month that they won\u2019t be allowed to sell certain Nike items, including sneakers and apparel, starting July 13.Nike and Amazon declined to comment.As traditional stores close and shopping moves online, Amazon\u2019s dominance in retailing has grown, leaving even the most powerful brands unable to ignore it. Some companies disdain Amazon\u2019s site design, which doesn\u2019t conform to the tailored image they want to project, according to lawyers and consultants who work with them. They consider it a site that sells items, not one that builds brands.Most-Purchased ApparelBrands on Amazon.comSold directly by Amazon?YESNO1. Nike*2.

Christmas in June, etc. Only a Knicks fan would think this is something to celebrate. It\u2019s like celebrating your car running out of gas on an abandoned desert highway.The sudden and dismal end of the Phil Jackson era, while not a shock, is another disaster\u2014a disaster upon a disaster, a piece of tangled disaster art that only the Knicks are capable of sculpting.Let\u2019s go back to the beginning. 2014. Ancient history, it feels. Jackson\u2014a player from the Knicks early 70s championship era who became the title-hoarding coach of the Michael Jordan Bulls and Kobe Bryant Lakers\u2014is introduced with confident fanfare. Everyone agrees: this a brilliant coup. Yes, there are some skunks who point out that Jackson has been a coach, not someone flying around and evaluating talent, doing the grind work that team bosses do, but they\u2019re just skunks.The Knicks bask in unusual praise. Owner       James Dolan       has again overpaid (a reported $12 million a year) but he\u2019s done the wise thing \u2014 luring a Yoda to a club that badly needed an adult in the room. Jackson gives some smoky, Zen-like remarks and it\u2019s like a magical fog settles upon the city. The Knicks still stink\u2026but they now have an identity.They\u2019re Phil Jackson\u2019s team.Except Phil Jackson\u2019s team stinks, too. They\u2019re ragged and poorly-assembled and bitten by injuries, and in 2014-15, they assemble the worst Knicks season ever, 17-65, which is quite a feat. Jackson quiets his skeptics with a brilliant score at the draft\u2014the Latvian big man Kristaps Porzingis\u2014but the crummy play and bad vibes go on. The Knicks cycle through lineups and coaches (Derek Fisher to Kurt Rambis to Jeff Hornacek) and basically go nowhere.And that\u2019s just the half of it. Jackson\u2019s ruling style is omniscient, cryptic and weirdly petty. He writes bizarre things on Twitter (\u201cNBA analysts give me some diagnostics on how 3pt oriented teams are faring this playoffs\u2026seriously, how\u2019s it goink?\u201d\u2014literally weeks before 3-point revolutionaries Golden State win a title). He sandbags the Knicks to his playing style\u2014\u201cThe Triangle\u201d \u2014 when evidence suggests it might not fit the current NBA. He seems to delight in publicly needling his best player, Carmelo Anthony. It\u2019s entirely Jackson\u2019s right to criticize Anthony\u2014who has been far from a savior himself\u2014but a strange approach if you are trying to charm Anthony into unlocking his no-trade clause, not to mention create trade value for him with the rest of the league.What may have been a last straw is Jackson\u2019s recent dust-up with Porzingis, the 21-year-old who was, to put it mildly, the best development in the Phil Jackson era. Porzingis is a lean player who needs muscle and work, but possesses the talent and touch that seems particularly suited to the modern game. He\u2019s been compared with Dirk Nowitzki, and the comparison isn\u2019t totally laughable. And Porzingis enjoyed playing in New York! He really was a unicorn.Yet a frustrated Porzingis blew off an end-of-season exit meeting with Jackson\u2014a petulant, immature move, to be sure\u2014and Jackson was miffed, to the point the Knicks began considering calls before last week\u2019s draft to move their young star. It was messy, and even though nothing wound up happening, it was an unnecessary souring of what should be the beginning of a beautiful partnership.Today, Porzingis must be back watching the Knicks with both hands in his face. I have to go back to that?For Dolan, he\u2019s back in the muck. In Jackson, he bought not just a track record, but a safety valve. The Knicks were Phil\u2019s team now. Ask Phil. It was good for the owner; it clearly wasn\u2019t for the club. Now Dolan has to put down the blues guitar and get right back in it.It will go on because it has to go on. (Does it, Adam Silver? Could the Knicks simply be dissolved and rebooted?). There will be flashy names proposed, because it\u2019s New York, and we always have to propose the flashy names. The Nets over in Brooklyn learned the hard way, that flashiness for flashiness sake means nothing, and are now attempting a low-fi reboot with a long-term plan. It isn\u2019t the New York way, but it might be the correct path.And the Knicks? Assured of the promised land, they\u2019re out of gas on that abandoned desert highway.

The New York Knicks were not one of those teams.For the last three years, the Knicks Knicksed, and much of the most recent Knicksing was a reflection of team president Phil Jackson.Jackson, the 71-year-old former coach with so many championship rings he can\u2019t fit them on two hands, was seen as a savior when he came to New York three years ago. But then he insisted on his antiquated basketball strategy, publicly undermined his best players and tortured fans by threatening to trade the exciting young star who is the future of the team.That\u2019s why the Knicks had to do another Knicksy thing and fire Jackson on Wednesday morning only hours before the opening of free agency. It was the only way to undo the last three years of Knicksing.\u201cAfter careful thought and consideration, we mutually agreed that the Knicks will be going in a different direction,\u201d Knicks owner Jim Dolan said in a statement on Wednesday morning.Jackson, who finishes his five-year, $60 million contract after only three seasons in which the Knicks went 80-166 without making the playoffs or even thinking about making the playoffs, was a risky hire to lead the team\u2019s front office from the beginning. He was a legend for coaching Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal to 11 championships, but Jackson had watched the last several years of the NBA away from the sidelines. He also had no experience as a general manager or team president.He started the job at the exact time that job was evolving across the NBA to reflect the growing influence of analytics and the increasing premium on talented players with newfound power. He never adapted.Jackson\u2019s first season with the Knicks came right after the San Antonio Spurs won the title with a flowing, whirring, altogether beautiful offense, and it ended with the Golden State Warriors winning the championship with a revolutionary style built around shooting more 3-pointers than anyone thought possible.The modern game was making Jackson\u2019s prized \u201ctriangle offense\u201d obsolete. He made the Knicks run it anyway. Their offense didn\u2019t finish in the top half of the league in any of Jackson\u2019s three seasons. Neither did New York\u2019s defense.The other problem\u2014one of the many problems\u2014was that Jackson struggled to defer to his coaches in part because he struggled to find coaches who played the way he wanted to play. For his first big hire, he courted Steve Kerr, his former player and protege. Kerr turned down the Knicks to coach the Warriors. (This, as it turns out, was a wise decision.) He settled on another former player, Derek Fisher, who was fired less than two seasons later and eventually replaced by Jeff Hornacek, who had the triangle offense forced upon him.By then it had become plain to see that 3-point shooting was upending the NBA\u2014which is what made it so bizarre that Jackson was openly antagonistic to the new style of play. \u201cNBA analysts give me some diagnostics on how 3pt oriented teams are faring this playoffs,\u201d he famously tweeted in 2015. \u201cSeriously, how\u2019s it goink?\u201d The top 3-point shooting teams in the league this season were the Spurs, Cleveland Cavaliers and the reigning NBA champion Warriors. It\u2019s goink pretty good.Jackson was also the rare executive in the NBA today who publicly criticized his best players. He made it clear that he wanted Carmelo Anthony to leave New York, but Jackson couldn\u2019t make Anthony leave because he gifted him a no-trade clause. The only way he could get rid of him was by making the situation uncomfortable. That didn\u2019t work. Anthony is still on the Knicks.Other players around the league have noticed the way Knicks players were treated, though, and New York has become an unpopular destination among free agents. Jackson was famous for playing mind games with his players in the 1990s and 2000s as their coach, but that approach doesn\u2019t work anymore. Not winning was one thing. But being trolled by the boss only made the losing worse.That became clear again last week as Jackson entertained trade offers for a player who is the team\u2019s future. Kristaps Porzingis is young, affordable and supremely talented. He\u2019s the anti-Knick. Which makes him the perfect Knick.Jackson deserved credit for Porzingis. He knew Porzingis would be booed if he drafted him with the No. 4 pick in 2015. He did it anyway. It was one of the best decisions in the franchise\u2019s recent history.Porzingis is only 21 years old, but he\u2019s clearly the player the Knicks should build around. He\u2019s a 7-foot-3 star born for the modern NBA. He plays offense like a guard and protects the rim on defense like a center. He was a better 3-point shooter last year than James Harden, and he blocked more shots than DeAndre Jordan.A player like that isn\u2019t supposed to exist. He certainly isn\u2019t supposed to be traded.There wasn\u2019t even a financial incentive for Jackson to consider such a deal. Because the Knicks drafted Porzingis, they could keep him on a reasonable contract through 2024, and by then the Knicks might have actually made the playoffs.Jackson said in an interview with Knicks-owned MSG Network last week, however, that his relationship with Porzingis began to sour because of something that happened after this season\u2014or something that didn\u2019t happen. Porzingis skipped his exit interview.Exit interviews are meant for employees after they have decided to leave a company. Only the Knicks could have made exit interviews the reason an employee decides to leave the company.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a player over 25 years of coaching, maybe 30, not coming to an exit meeting,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not happened to me.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve communicated. Not through voice or anything, although I\u2019ve tried to call.\u201d Jackson\u2019s ultimate message to concerned Knicks fans: \u201cI think we know what we\u2019re doing.\u201dThey didn\u2019t. Even he couldn\u2019t stop the Knicks from Knicksing. He only made the Knicksing worse.But that\u2019s the irony of Jackson\u2019s own exit. As bad as the last three years have been, he\u2019s also responsible in a way for Porzingis, and Porzingis allows the Knicks to adopt a style that works in today\u2019s NBA. Now all the Knicks have to do is not be the Knicks about it.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 10:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-knicks-parted-ways-with-phil-jackson-1498659944", "news_title": "Knicks Part Ways With Phil Jackson, a Legend Who Failed to Adapt to Modern NBA", "keywords": "jim dolan,knicks,nba,new york knicks,phil jackson,New York Knicks,basketball,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Amazon.com Inc.        AMZN 0.24%       is masterful at changing our habits. Not long ago, it seemed unthinkable to buy clothes online. Or buy anything on your phone. Or talk to a speaker (also, mind you, a way to buy things).The $230 Echo Show is Amazon\u2019s most audacious product yet. Now it wants to colonize your countertop with a 7-inch touch screen and a camera. You can even use it to randomly peer through the always-on camera of loved ones\u2019 Shows and into their homes, if they list you as persona grata.Amazon is onto a good idea: the casual kitchen computer that doesn\u2019t require a mouse, keyboard or even meatloaf-kneading fingers to operate. But there is still work ahead to make the Show a welcome addition to most homes. This first version has limited skills that take advantage of the new screen\u2014yet it is so intrusive, I was ready to yank the plug after a week.The Show, which ships Wednesday, has all the functions of Amazon\u2019s original Echo speaker, the first home appliance to popularize internet-connected microphones. You call out the wake word \u201cAlexa,\u201d then command Amazon\u2019s AI assistant to play Beyonc\u00e9, turn on the lights or tell a joke. The Show\u2019s boxy design and wide bezels aren\u2019t as cool as the cylindrical Echo. But it could hear me just as well as the original, and its speaker sounded slightly better (but still not great).In some important ways, the Show is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, whether the original Echo or its competitors Google Home and Apple HomePod. The Show is part phone booth, part hands-free tablet, part countertop TV.So what can the Show show? In its first week, the screen \u201cskills\u201d\u2014Alexa\u2019s term for apps\u2014are limited and not particularly novel but suggest where things are headed:\u2022 It\u2019s a senior-friendly video-call station to use with people who also have a Show or the Alexa smartphone app.\u2022 It can pull up recipes or scan items to buy from Amazon.com.\u2022 It plays Amazon and YouTube videos. (There are no TV channels yet, but \u201cJeopardy\u201d live streams surely can\u2019t be far off.)\u2022 It shows lyrics while playing music, prompting spontaneous singalongs.I wouldn\u2019t bet against the Show getting more screen skills fast: Amazon has proven far more successful at lining up partners for Alexa than either Apple Inc. or             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google have for their talking assistants. One of the Show\u2019s first partnerships pairs it with the Ring video doorbell, one of my favorite smart-home devices. Just say, \u201cAlexa, show me the front door.\u201d It\u2019ll also work with cameras from Nest, August and others.As a gadget pioneer, I\u2019m willing to wait for more skills. My problem is more fundamental: Living with a Show is too often perturbing\u2014and occasionally creepy.The first time I turned the Show on, the screen asked me if I\u2019d like to subscribe to Amazon\u2019s Audible service. I couldn\u2019t proceed until I\u2019d replied. (\u201cNo.\u201d) It was my first reminder that the Echo Show is as much an Amazon sales kiosk as a kitchen helper.Once up and running, the Show started flashing a series of calendar events, headlines and usage tips. One read: \u201cVideo: Baseball Mascot Outruns Fan. Try \u2018Alexa, play the mascot video.\u2019 \u201d That\u2019s one way to teach owners about Alexa\u2019s ever-growing capabilities. I assumed the tips would eventually fade.But they didn\u2019t. They keep refreshing every seven seconds. In the span of one minute, the Show nagged me to play Katy Perry and told me about a Batman-costumed policeman. It felt like one of those elevator displays took up residence next to my toaster. Voice-only Alexa was well-bred enough to speak only when spoken to.This much is a relief: An Amazon spokeswoman tells me the company has \u201cno plans or future intentions to advertise products on Echo Show.\u201dEventually I found some settings that let me remove the \u201ctrending topics\u201d messages, but not the tips. A Do Not Disturb mode stops incoming calls and dims the screen. Using another setting, for the clock, you can turn off the screen completely in Do Not Disturb mode, until you call Alexa. This should be the default, not hidden in settings.Bringing home an always-on screen can disrupt family life in other ways. For one, it\u2019s catnip for children. Unlike a regular TV, they can operate it whenever they want, without a remote. It\u2019s cute when tykes ask Alexa for songs, weather and information but grating when they beg for videos. Now that Alexa can do so much, it\u2019s urgent for her to gain the ability to recognize the voices\u2014or faces\u2014of different family members.The Show is fingerprint-prone, too. You\u2019d think a device that begs to sit on a kitchen counter would be oil-resistant, or easier to clean.The biggest head scratcher is that 5-megapixel camera. True, Amazon got millions of us to live with microphones, but cameras are a different beast.One of the Show\u2019s headline features requires a very high level of comfort with being watched: \u201cDrop in\u201d mode lets approved friends turn on your camera and say hi, without requiring you to pick up the call. The nominal privacy protection is a 10-second countdown, in which the view into Lord-knows-what happening in your house is obscured by digital frosting. During that time, you can disable the camera or reject the call.That function is optional, but another one isn\u2019t: To figure out when to activate the screen, the camera remains on, watching for people in the room. Amazon says it isn\u2019t storing or sending that video over the internet, yet it feels like a needless risk, since so few functions actually require the camera. You can cut off the camera with Do Not Disturb or with the same button that cuts off the Show\u2019s microphone\u2014but using the button means the whole thing stops working.Another new Amazon product, the $200 invitation-only Echo Look, is designed first and foremost as a camera. It will doubtless come with similar baggage, if not more.I understand that Amazon is doing everything in its power to keep the Show from becoming a portal for hackers. It is certainly way safer than the cheap baby monitors and security cams that have fallen to malware. But it\u2019s unfortunate the Show isn\u2019t compatible with the oldest safety trick of all: You can\u2019t just put tape over the camera and take it off as needed. When you try that on the Echo Show, it gets confused and dims the screen so it becomes unusable.The Show is a promising talking home computer and may appeal to people already heavily invested in Alexa\u2019s world. But it\u2019s a shame Amazon\u2019s strange design choices muddy its potential. Walking the line between futuristic and creepy, the Show landed in the worst place of all: annoying.Write to Geoffrey A.

And he watered down an executive order issued by former President       Barack Obama       that banned antigay bias by federal contractors.The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group that endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent,       Hillary Clinton,        characterized the president\u2019s first five months in office as a relentless series of attacks on equality for the community.\u201cIt\u2019s a death by a thousand cuts, and if the trajectory continues, we\u2019re going to see a severe diminishing of LGBTQ protections by the federal government,\u201d said Robin Maril, HRC\u2019s senior legislative counsel.Still, some gay activists see it as a win simply that they aren\u2019t more of a focus of an administration that has found significant support among social conservatives.\u201cHe\u2019s perceived to be anti-progressive, but Trump is not a gay-basher either. It\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Rich Tafel, founder of the gay GOP political organization Log Cabin Republicans. The group declined to endorse Mr. Trump in 2016 because of concerns about his commitment to civil rights.A White House official, asked for comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s gay rights record, issued a short statement: \u201cPresident Trump has been clear in his commitment to improving the lives of all Americans, including those in the LGBT community.\u201dMr. Trump isn\u2019t the first president to walk a fine line on gay issues.President       Bill Clinton       advocated for gays to be allowed to serve in the military during his campaign, then settled for a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy.       George W. Bush       endorsed state-based civil unions for same-sex couples, but backed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Mr. Obama opposed same-sex marriage when elected president, then later supported it.In contrast with most past Republican presidential candidates, Mr. Trump cast himself as a friend of the gay community. After the Orlando massacre, he said he would prevent such attacks in the future by blocking antigay Islamic extremists from entering the U.S.The gunman had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 911 calls. But Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal wouldn\u2019t have applied to him since he was born in the U.S.While some gay activists were heartened by Mr. Trump\u2019s support, many criticized him for framing the shooting exclusively as a terrorist attack instead of as a hate crime targeting the gay community.\u201cHe talks about it in the context of the war on terror instead of the rights of LGBT people, and that\u2019s not sufficient for many people in the community,\u201d said       Lanae Erickson       Hatalsky, vice president for social policy and politics for Third Way, a centrist think tank.Mr. Trump\u2019s original order in January banning travel to the U.S. from several Muslim-majority countries cited reasons other than terrorism, saying the U.S. \u201cshould not admit those who\u2026would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.\u201d The revised order in March lacked that language.One of their biggest setbacks under Mr. Trump, LGBT activists say, was the revocation of guidance allowing transgender students to use public-school bathrooms matching their gender identity. Activists also criticized Mr. Trump for tapping same-sex-marriage opponents for top cabinet posts.Across the country, gay pride marches this month have been rebranded as \u201cResist\u201d marches to emphasize opposition to Mr. Trump.But the administration has tried to seek a balance. White House officials wrestled for months, under pressure from social conservatives, to craft an executive order that would expand the rights of religious organizations facing laws and regulations that clash with their views on gay marriage, abortion and contraception.In the end, the administration sidestepped decisions on the most contentious topics, including whether religious social-services agencies must allow adoptions by same-sex couples, or religious health-care providers must provide certain services to gay and transgender people even if the providers have objections.The issues were sent to the Justice Department, which will set new guidelines for federal agencies to accommodate religious beliefs.In mid-April,       Nikki Haley,        the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, released a statement on reports of kidnapping, torture and murder of gay men in Chechnya saying, \u201cWe are against all forms of discrimination, including against people based on sexual orientation.\u201dBut earlier this month, Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       said he hadn\u2019t raised the issue with the Russian foreign minister. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the issue is \u201con our pending list\u201d and that the U.S. is committed to the protection of LGBT rights around the world.Meantime, the administration\u2019s proposed budget for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development decreases or eliminates funding for some LGBT programs.While some evangelicals would like Mr. Trump to be more outspoken about opposing same-sex marriage\u2014which the Supreme Court in 2015 ruled was a constitutional right\u2014social conservatives praised the president when he nominated       Neil Gorsuch,        seen as a reliable conservative, to the Supreme Court.\u201cConservatives saw that Trump was the first Republican nominee for president to recognize and ask for the support of gay voters in his acceptance speech,\u2019\u2019 said       Ralph Reed,        chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which opposes same-sex marriage and abortion. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to see the advancement of a political, militant gay rights agenda out of this administration.\u201d\u2014Louise Radnofsky and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Beth Reinhard at beth.reinhard@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 10:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-mixed-messages-on-gay-rights-frustrate-activists-1498660803", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Mixed Messages on Gay Rights Frustrate Activists", "keywords": "bathroom law,gay march,gay pride,gay rights,gays,lgbt,transgender,trump,white house,Trump,political,general news,society,community,health,human rights,civil liberties,lgbt rights,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sexuality,social issues,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "The pound jumped Wednesday after Bank of England Gov.

Yields on 10-year U.K. government bonds jumped to 1.181%, the highest since early May, from the previous day\u2019s close of 1.078%.Speaking at the European Central Bank\u2019s forum on central banking in Sintra, Portugal, Mr. Carney said the U.K. central bank\u2019s tolerance of above-target inflation is wearing thin as slack in the labor market continues to diminish.His remarks come a day after the BOE tightened bank capital requirements in Britain and offer further evidence that the central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee is inching toward a withdrawal of the extra stimulus it put in place following last year\u2019s Brexit vote.\u201cSome removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing the MPC continues to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional,\u201d Mr. Carney said, according to a text of his remarks.He said a critical gauge of whether an interest-rate rise is needed will be whether business investment grows sufficiently to offset a slowdown in consumer spending. He added that he also wants to see faster wage growth, and be satisfied that uncertainty over the outcome of talks over the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union isn\u2019t weighing heavily on activity.Mr. Carney\u2019s comments mark a slight shift in tone from a speech he delivered last week, when he said that uncertainty over the U.K.\u2019s prospects meant now wasn\u2019t the time to begin lifting borrowing costs.A majority of MPC officials, Mr. Carney included, earlier this month voted to keep the central bank\u2019s benchmark rate at 0.25%. But three of the eight who voted broke ranks to argue for an immediate quarter-point increase to tame quickening inflation.Andrew Haldane,        the central bank\u2019s influential chief economist, has since signaled that he, too, would favor an interest-rate rise in the coming months if the economy holds up as expected.On Tuesday, the euro soared to its biggest one-day gain against the dollar in a year and eurozone bond prices slumped after ECB President       Mario Draghi       hinted the bank might start winding down its stimulus in response to accelerating growth in Europe.In the U.S., Federal Reserve officials have raised short-term interest rates four times since December 2015 and may do so again later this year.\u2014Jon Sindreu contributed to this article.Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 10:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boes-carney-some-removal-of-stimulus-may-be-necessary-if-economy-improves-1498658542", "news_title": "Pound Surges as Bank of England\u2019s Carney Hints at Rate Rise", "keywords": "U.K. government,Bank of England,Mark Carney,economic performance,indicators,consumer credit,expenditure,savings,monetary policy,central bank intervention,interest rates,economic news,debt,bond markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "General Mills Inc.\u2019s        GIS 0.34%       new chief executive said he would invest in turning around declining sales as the struggling yogurt business continues to weigh on the company.General Mills said revenue fell short of its standards as sales declined for the eighth straight quarter.On an earnings call with investors, CEO       Jeff Harmening       said much of General Mills\u2019 struggles in the past year were \u201cself-inflicted,\u201d through missteps like a lack of innovation in yogurt and pricing its products too high.\u201cThe vast majority of our challenges are correctable, both in the U.S. and other places,\u201d he said.

This means that as the burden on pension funds increases, options decrease, with merging seen increasingly as a more viable option.The FCA also called for more transparency in trading on Wednesday, which Mr. Mikulskis said should improve outcomes for underlying investors.Insurers and fintech apps have been focusing on making pensions more appealing to younger people\u2014although YouGov\u2019s findings suggest they may be unmoved by these efforts.Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0report called for a major shake-up of the U.K. asset-management industry, but the FCA hasn\u2019t referred it to the country\u2019s antitrust watchdog, assuaging fears that it could face further scrutiny.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 09:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-official-pension-funds-should-pool-to-stay-afloat-1498657569", "news_title": "It\u2019s Official: Pension Funds Should Pool to Stay Afloat ", "keywords": " fca, fca ruling, financial conduct authority, solvency crsisis,uk pension funds,Financial Conduct Authority,FCA,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private pension funds,financial services,investing,securities,pension funds"}, {"content": "A $9 billion restructuring deal covering Puerto Rico\u2019s public power monopoly failed to win approval on Tuesday from the island\u2019s federal oversight officials, raising the likelihood of default at one of the largest U.S. utilities.The federal board overseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s finances rejected the proposed settlement in a 4-3 vote, capping weeks of doubt about its viability.The decision marks a setback for creditors who have grown increasingly mistrustful of the oversight board and moves the electric utility known as Prepa one step closer to entering a court-supervised bankruptcy proceeding. The debt agreement, three years in the making, had run into resistance among the seven board members, four of whom were nominated by Republicans in Congress and were expected to be relatively creditor-friendly.Tuesday\u2019s vote \u201ccloses the door on this request for debt restructuring\u201d and makes a bankruptcy filing \u201cthe most likely course of action under the circumstances,\u201d the oversight board said in a statement.In rejecting the deal, the four members voting no said they wanted to shift Prepa from a government monopoly to a regulated private utility by privatizing the island\u2019s power generation. Private investors \u201cwill not involve themselves with Prepa\u201d under the proposed restructuring terms, they said.Two insurers of utility bonds sued the oversight board late Monday in a last-ditch effort to preserve the deal, but the odds of avoiding a court-supervised proceeding are dwindling given that creditors are owed a $450 million payment on July 1.The vote is sure to rankle Republicans in Congress who had urged the oversight board to approve the agreement as a road map for consensual settlements of Puerto Rico\u2019s other bonds. But criticism of the proposal had been growing in Puerto Rico, where residents pay higher rates than in any U.S. state but Hawaii.Bondholders had agreed to accept a 15% haircut\u2014a reduction on their claims\u2014in exchange for new debt with stronger legal protections. Paying for the deal required a new charge on ratepayers that local manufacturers said could stifle economic growth and crowd out private generation projects. Creditors argued that restructuring the debt would boost Prepa\u2019s creditworthiness and attract the private investment capital to upgrade plants and lower costs.Costly, unreliable utility service remains a drag on family incomes and qualify of life in Puerto Rico. A massive blackout last year, later blamed on a fire, left Prepa customers without power for three days. The federal rescue law passed last year empowers the oversight board to write down Puerto Rico\u2019s $73 billion in bonds either through negotiated deals or with the help of the courts.The value of Prepa\u2019s bonds has eroded since April, when creditors revised their restructuring terms at the request of Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f2, who obtained additional debt relief to mitigate the politically unpopular rate increases. A Prepa default would mean a financial hit for Assured Guaranty Corp. and             MBIA Inc.\u2019s       National Public Finance Guarantee Corp., which guarantee a combined $2.2 billion in utility debt.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 09:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-ricos-federal-supervisors-veto-9-billion-utility-debt-deal-1498605946", "news_title": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Federal Supervisors Veto $9 Billion Utility Debt Deal ", "keywords": "bankruptcynews,oversight,prepa,puerto rico electric power authority,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,electricity,gas utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "Whether you\u2019re just starting out or are well into your career, you may wonder: Are my retirement savings on track?An online calculator may help, provided you find one that makes reasonable assumptions about the amount you plan to spend in retirement and takes key factors, including inflation and taxes, into account. But if you want to avoid having to read the fine print to assess those assumptions\u2014not to mention the sales pitches often embedded in these tools\u2014there are several low-tech methods that can help.Why bother tracking your progress? With regular checkups, you can avoid the potential for a nasty surprise as retirement looms. Moreover, according to psychological research conducted on students at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, those prompted to monitor their savings progress are more successful.As with any generalized guidance, it\u2019s important to understand the pros and cons of each method and adapt it to your own situation.When financial planners assess whether clients are on track to reach retirement goals, they generally use software that\u2019s not available to the public.But with some relatively simple math, you can get a sense for what they do, says       Michael Kitces,        partner and director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md.The first step is to estimate the amount you want to spend in retirement. If you have no clue, use the 80% rule of thumb. It assumes that retirees can get by on about 80% of what they earned before retiring because they no longer need to commute or save for retirement and frequently wind up in a lower tax bracket. Using the rule, a couple with a $100,000 annual income would need an annual retirement income of $80,000.The next step is to deduct from that $80,000 the couple\u2019s expected Social Security and pension benefits. If they are entitled to $35,000 a year in Social Security, for example, they would need savings to supply the remaining $45,000.Mr. Kitces suggests multiplying that number\u2014$45,000 in this case\u2014by 25. The result\u2014or $1.125 million\u2014is the amount the couple would have to save to be able to withdraw $45,000 a year without violating the 4% \u201csafe\u201d withdrawal rate that historically has ensured retirees a high probability of never running out of money.If the couple has saved $560,000, they are about halfway to their $1.125 million goal. But assuming both partners are 50 years old, are they on track?Here, another rule of thumb can help. Known as the Rule of 72, it calls for dividing 72 by the rate of return the couple\u2019s investments can reasonably be expected to earn. The result is the number of years it will take to double their money.If the couple invests 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, they are likely to earn a real return of about 5% a year. (That\u2019s a weighted average of the 7% per year stocks have earned after inflation since 1926 and the 2% annual inflation-adjusted return on bonds.)Since 72 divided by 5 is about 14, the couple\u2019s savings are likely to double every 14 years. As a result, by the time they are 65, their $560,000 should double in real terms to reach $1.12 million.Cons: This method doesn\u2019t account for future contributions to retirement savings. And because returns rarely conform to long-term averages, it\u2019s important to repeat this exercise periodically.If you prefer to skip the math, Fidelity Investments has devised a shortcut. But you have to make sure the assumptions make sense for you\u2014and make adjustments if not.According to Fidelity, a person who starts saving around age 25 and expects to retire in 42 years should have saved an amount equal to his or her annual salary at age 30. By age 40, the goal is to have saved three times his or her current salary, en route to six times at age 50, eight times at age 60 and 10 times by age 67, the age at which people born after 1959 are entitled to full Social Security benefits. (This assumes a salary rises by 1.5% a year after inflation and that half the portfolio is in stocks.)This approach is designed to replace 45% of preretirement income\u2014or $45,000 annually for someone with a $100,000 salary\u2014for approximately 25 years. (Fidelity assumes Social Security covers the rest.)To hit those targets, Fidelity recommends saving about 15% a year, including any contribution your employer may make to a 401(k)-type account.\u201cThe methodology is based on maintaining your current lifestyle in retirement,\u201d says Meghan Murphy, a director at Fidelity. Those who want to live more lavishly in retirement or retire in under 42 years should save more than 10 times their final salary. Those who plan to live more frugally or retire later may be able to get by with less, Ms. Murphy says.Cons: This rule of thumb applies only to people making between $50,000 and $300,000. As with the other two methods, this one doesn\u2019t help you figure out how much to increase your savings rate if you need to catch up.With this method, you can avoid having to track your progress entirely. But while this rule of thumb is easy to use if you\u2019re starting out in your career, it\u2019s harder to adopt midstream unless you have access to specialized software for advisers.The method establishes the amount someone should save annually to replace half of preretirement income\u2014for example, $50,000 of a $100,000 salary\u2014with a high probability of sustaining that spending over a 30-year retirement. (As with the other two methods, this one assumes the initial withdrawal rises annually to keep pace with inflation.)For someone with 30 years to go before retirement and a portfolio with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, the required annual savings rate is 16.6%, says Wade Pfau, a professor of retirement income at the American College of Financial Services in             Bryn Mawr,       Pa. A person who plans to work for 40 years should save 8.8% a year. Those are the rates his research indicates would have been high enough over 30 and 40 years, respectively, to replace half of preretirement income over the past 150 years, even amid the worst stock-market returns.\u201cIf someone saves responsibly throughout her career, she will likely be able to finance her intended expenditures\u201d even if a bear market results in a smaller-than-expected balance at retirement, says Mr. Pfau. The reason why, he adds, is that during a bear market, stocks often become cheap enough to ignite a rally that helps the portfolio recover.With this approach, Mr. Pfau says, \u201cthe way to track your progress is simply to make sure you are saving the right amount every year.\u201dCon: If you are in the middle of your career and haven\u2019t saved the required rate, it\u2019s not easy without professional help to figure out how much more you\u2019ll need to save to catch up.Write to Anne Tergesen at anne.tergesen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 09:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-monitor-your-retirement-readiness-1498656937", "news_title": "How to Monitor Your Retirement Readiness", "keywords": " investing,journal reports, retirement, saving for retirement, wealth management,University of Waterloo,political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014U.S. Secretary of Defense       Jim Mattis       said the       Trump       administration\u2019s warning to Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad\u2019s       government against using chemical weapons appears to have worked, at least for now.Mr. Mattis said that President Donald Trump\u2019s warning issued Monday showed how seriously the U.S. took the threat of a chemical attack in Syria.\u201cThey took the warning seriously,\u201d Mr. Mattis said Wednesday, speaking to reporters aboard a plane flying to Brussels. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do it.\u201dOn Tuesday, the Pentagon said it had seen activity at Shayrat airfield indicating preparations to use chemical weapons.

Mr. Tillerson met earlier Tuesday with Qatar\u2019s foreign minister,       Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman       Al Thani.Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir is also in Washington, where he told reporters Tuesday that Saudi Arabia and others \u201cmade our point...took our steps,\u201d and that it\u2019s now up to Qatar to amend its behavior.\u201cOnce they do, then things will be worked out.

While Mr. Tillerson has encouraged talks and reconciliation among the GCC members, President       Donald Trump       earlier appeared to take credit for the feud as a positive result of a trip to the region and a push to end terror financing.Last week the State Department challenged the motives of Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and other parties, and questioned whether the spat stemmed from long simmering regional grievances, rather than specific demands about Qatar\u2019s support to terrorism.\u201cI think the issue of the mixed messages you should address to the administration, not to me,\u201d Mr. Jubeir told reporters, when asked about contrasting Trump administration statements. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any country in the world that doesn\u2019t want Qatar to stop what it\u2019s doing.

Heym,        chief economist at Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens, said the burst of activity in the current quarter reflected a release of pent-up demand in the postelection period, as more affluent buyers expected tax cuts to fuel continued economic growth. Now, he said, there are a host of new uncertainties, from worries over North Korea to gridlock in Washington, that could spook some buyers.\u201cPeople have strong opinions about these things,\u201d he said.Sales were up at all price points, rising 22% from the second quarter of 2016, the best second quarter since 2008. The analysis is based on closed sales filed with the city\u2019s Department of Finance as of seven days before the end of each quarter.At the same time, the median price of a Manhattan apartment set a record of $1.2 million in the quarter, 9% higher than the second quarter in 2016, with strength spread across multiple market segments. The average price was $2.16 million.Prices were at record levels for co-ops and condominiums, but below the peak for condos in new developments, which set a record last summer following a surge in closings at expensive new buildings.The median price for co-ops was $815,000, up 5.1%, while the median price for a condominium was $1.82 million, up 17%.Pamela Liebman,        president of the Corcoran Group, said business is good, though it lags behind the frothy years before the collapse of the last housing boom. \u201cIt is a healthy, realistic market,\u201d she said.Some new developments were drawing strong attention\u2014including Waterline Square, the last new development on Riverside Blvd on the West Side, where an opening event to kick off sales attracted 400 people, Ms. Liebman said. But she also cited two potential roadblocks to the market: not enough lower-priced inventory, and sellers with overpriced listings who refuse to reduce prices.The large increase in median prices reflected a 41% surge in sales of apartments selling for more than $4 million compared with the same quarter in 2016. This outpaced the slower 14% sales growth in what passes for lower-priced apartments in Manhattan, those selling for less than $1 million. Sales below $1 million make up about 43% of all Manhattan apartment sales, but inventory has been low.There are a number of signs of a modestly slowing activity. Real-estate data site UrbanDigs.com showed the number of contracts signed in April and May down 8.6% from the same period in 2016, to the second-lowest level in six years.Among more expensive apartments, those listed for more than $4 million, the number of contracts signed in the second quarter was up 3.9% from the second quarter last year, according to a report from Olshan Realty Inc.Listing inventory was up 7% in June, according to a report by Brown Harris Stevens, while the absorption rate\u2014the number of months it would take to sell all listings at the current sales pace\u2014was up 11% from June 2016, to 6.3 months.\u201cThis shows the pace of sales has slowed,\u201d Mr. Heym said.The sweet spot in the market is apartments listed from $4 million to $6 million, which were priced efficiently, said       Donna Olshan,        president of Olshan Realty.\u201cThere are too many overpriced properties,\u201d she said. \u201cThings move when they are priced efficiently.\u201dFor the first time since 2015, the top sale was at an existing apartment rather than in a new condo. Since the first quarter of 2016, condos at 432 Park Ave. topped the list of the most expensive new developments.But the top sale recorded in the second quarter this year was the $55 million sale of a third-floor co-op facing Central Park at 960 Fifth Ave., owned by the estate of Robert H. Ellsworth, a dealer of Asian art. The buyer was Carlos Alejandro P\u00e9rez D\u00e1vila, a financier.The second-most expensive sale was the resale a four-bedroom penthouse on the 40th floor of 15 Central Park West for $50.55 million.

Based in Singapore, Lazada operates in six markets including Indonesia and the Philippines.Alibaba, the owner of China\u2019s two most popular online retail sites, Taobao and Tmall, has made globalization a key focus of the firm\u2019s expansion plans as competition at home intensifies.

Most say they need more help and more time because they don\u2019t have the computers, the internet connection or even the basic knowledge of how much they owe.More than 50,000 textile traders are on strike this week, shutting their shops for three days through Thursday, in Prime Minister       Narendra Modi\u2019s       home state of Gujarat to protest the tax, said       Manoj Agarwal,        president of the Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association.\u201cWe will spend our time filing the returns instead of doing business,\u201d Mr. Agarwal said. \u201cSome of our members even don\u2019t know how to operate a computer. How can they even file their returns?\u201dThe Confederation of All India Traders said this week that about a third of the association\u2019s 60 million members still don\u2019t have a computer to register on the government\u2019s tax network. It has asked authorities not to act against traders for lapses in compliance until March.Another national association of businesses, the All India Manufacturers Organization, urged the government to allow small businesses more time to comply. The government has already relaxed the rules for filing returns for two months after implementation.\u201cThis is going to be creating chaos,\u201d said K.E. Raghunathan, president of the association.While the long-delayed implementation of the goods and services tax\u2014which different governments have been trying to pass for more than a decade\u2014is seen as positive step for the economy and a watershed moment for Mr. Modi, how smoothly it goes in the coming months could affect the prime minister\u2019s popularity as well as India\u2019s position as the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy.\u201cIt seems like a well-formed concept but there could be lots of problems in implementation,\u201d said       Bill Adams,        an economist at             PNC Financial Services Group.Mr. Modi needs to avoid the kind of market disruption that came with his previous big economic move, the voiding of close to 90% of the country\u2019s currency late last year to fight corruption, counterfeiting and other crimes. It was a painful speed bump for growth and Indian citizens, who had to stand in line for hours to exchange their old notes for new ones.The government says businesses need to adjust because it plans to go through with the new tax system, which is expected to draw in millions of new taxpayers and provide vital funds for infrastructure, sanitation, education and health.\u201cThe rollout of the Goods and Services Tax on July 1 will, in a single stroke, convert India into a unified, continent-sized market of 1.3 billion people,\u201d Mr. Modi wrote in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week.There is a general consensus among economists, executives and policy makers that the new system will eventually bolster economic expansion, but they warn there will be some short-term pain for that long-term gain.The government\u2019s crackdown on cash in November contributed to a slowdown last quarter, putting India\u2019s growth behind China\u2019s for the first time in two years.Growth decelerated sharply to 6.1% in the three months through March, from 7% in the preceding three months. China\u2019s economy grew 6.9% last quarter.The coming quarters could see a similar hit from GST, economists said.Companies say they will be buying and investing less as they adjust to the new system that will require India Inc. to file billions of documents each month. This will likely hurt growth this year. The extent of damage will be determined by how quickly India\u2019s businesses and bureaucrats can adjust.\u201cIt is a mammoth exercise and anybody looking for efficiency gains in the near term is going to be disappointed,\u201d said       Radhika Rao,        India economist at DBS.Analysts expect the kinks to be worked out and India to be back to normal by the end of this fiscal year.

It inherited a chip joint-venture with Toshiba when it acquired SanDisk, and is backing a rival bid led by             KKR & Co.        KKR 1.62%       to acquire Toshiba\u2019s chip business. Western Digital last month filed a suit to stymie the memory-unit sale. It insists that Toshiba has to get Western Digital\u2019s nod first.Toshiba upped the ante by countersuing Western Digital Wednesday in Tokyo court, asking the court to stop Western Digital\u2019s interference and demanding $1 billion in damages. It also stopped the U.S. chip maker from accessing information in their joint venture.A drawn-out legal battle will be costly. Toshiba has to complete the sale of its chip business to bring its net assets back to positive territory by next March. Otherwise, it could be delisted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, according to Travis Lundy, an independent analyst on the Smartkarma research platform.It would be smarter if Toshiba engaged with Western Digital, which seems the better mate in terms of scale. Combined, the two would have a similar market in the NAND flash memory chip market as industry leader Samsung.       And they would together be better able to afford the substantial investments required for the field\u2019s next technology, 3D-NAND.Western Digital seems willing to entertain Toshiba\u2019s concerns about the JV, which, according to Toshiba, sits outside the sales process. Western Digital submitted a new bid Monday with private-equity firm KKR to buy Toshiba\u2019s memory business, in which it will only provide debt financing. This could probably alleviate Toshiba\u2019s worry that it may lose control of the JV, in which it holds 50.1%.Toshiba management should take a clue from its share price, which has slipped of late as the once-promising chip sale got bogged down.

Without a deal, the Bank of England could have been forced to take over and move Co-op Bank\u2019s depositors to another lender, mirroring recent bank \u201cresolutions\u201d in Spain and Italy.That process could have wiped out the bank\u2019s equity and debt. Instead, investors including Silver Point Capital, Goldentree Asset\u00a0Management, BlueMountain Capital Management and Cyrus Capital Partners, opted to put up more cash and preserve the Co-op Bank brand.The bank put itself up for sale in February but abandoned the process earlier this week.For decades, backed by one of the U.K.\u2019s oldest mutuals, Co-op Bank was seen as a powerful challenger to the country\u2019s big five incumbent banks. Then a failed takeover in 2013 exposed deep fractures in the bank\u2019s finances and governance. The bank\u2019s current 20% shareholder, retailer and funeral homes mutual Co-operative Group Ltd., will retain a 1% stake under the planned restructuring.Co-op Bank\u2019s problems started in 2009 when it combined with a mutual lender stuffed with risky loans. By early 2013, the bank\u2019s capital base was razor thin and it had to cancel a plan to triple its size by buying 600 bank branches. Later that year, former Co-op Bank Chairman       Paul Flowers       was arrested on drug charges, days after being questioned by lawmakers over his qualifications for overseeing a bank. He pleaded guilty to possessing illegal drugs and paid a fine in 2014.In 2016, the bank\u2019s former chief executive and the head of its corporate division were banned from holding top jobs in finance for not safeguarding the bank in the lead up to the 2013 bailout.The bank\u2019s biggest asset has been its goodwill with depositors and borrowers, who rate the bank highly in surveys for the values it promotes. Co-op Bank bills itself as an ethical lender by supporting human rights and charities, and doesn\u2019t lend in areas involving animal testing or fossil fuels extraction.But even after cash injections in 2013 and 2014, it struggled to stem a capital drain from a costly technology upgrade, narrow margins and regulatory fines. Some hedge fund owners sold their stakes to others when it became clear there wouldn\u2019t be a quick recovery.But crystallizing a loss and losing any potential upside was unacceptable to some investors. Privately, some of the hedge funds have said they felt the Bank of England owed them a favor for having kept the bank going for so long.\u201cWe have supported the turnaround of The Co-operative Bank since 2013 and this further investment will provide the bank with the capital needed to realize its potential as the U.K.\u2019s leading ethical bank,\" the\u00a0group of junior bondholders who engineered the rescue said Wednesday.Write to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 08:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-hedge-funds-agree-885-million-rescue-deal-with-u-k-s-co-op-bank-1498651976", "news_title": "U.S. Hedge Funds Agree to $885 Million Rescue Deal With U.K.\u2019s Co-op Bank ", "keywords": " bank bonds,coop bank, co-op bank, coop bank bonds,Co-operative Bank,cpba,BlueMountain Capital Management,Silver Point Capital,corporate funding,corporate debt instruments,financing agreements,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,high-yield corporate bonds,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,swaps,banking,commercial banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,investment advice,alternative investments,credit,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Connecticut lawmakers are pushing back against lawsuits that threaten the state\u2019s colleges and universities with the loss hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition paid by financially struggling parents.Gov.       Dannel Malloy       signed a law earlier this month that discourages trustees who handle consumer-bankruptcy cases from suing both public and private institutions to get back tuition money parents paid before filing for bankruptcy protection.State Attorney General George Jepsen said in testimony this spring that the dozens of lawsuits filed in the state\u2019s bankruptcy courts in recent years have \u201chad an adverse financial impact on both public and private colleges and universities.\u201d His office defends suits filed against public colleges and universities.The lawsuits arise from federal law that gives trustees the power to recover money that a bankrupt person spent years before filing if the person didn\u2019t get value for the expense. Trustees have argued that parents who paid a tuition bill for an adult child didn\u2019t get value for that expense, meaning the funds can be recouped to pay other debts.In testimony to a joint Connecticut legislature judiciary committee in March, Mr. Jepsen took objection to the practice. \u201cParents and guardians unquestionably receive value for their children\u2019s college education,\u201d he said. \u201cOur state laws should recognize that value.\u201dSeveral colleges in other states, including Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I., and Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., have hired lawyers to argue that parents who help their children attend college do get some form of value.Recent rulings show judges are divided on the issue, enabling trustees, who are compensated with a portion of the recovered money, to take back funds in some cases but not in others.When schools return money, other students in effect share more of the institutions\u2019 expenses, said representatives for several colleges in testimony to Connecticut lawmakers. They also made it clear that students could also face consequences.Turning over the money to trustees \u201ccreates a delinquency in the student\u2019s account that was previously fully paid,\u201d a University of Connecticut enrollment official said in a written statement to the state legislative panel. \u201cIn other words, the student cannot continue his or her education.\u201dThe Connecticut law doesn\u2019t eliminate the lawsuits completely. It prohibits trustees from using state law to sue for payments made within four years of filing for bankruptcy. Federal law still permits them to sue for tuition paid within two years of bankruptcy.\u201cOnce this law takes effect it\u2019s likely to reduce the number of these claims by decreasing the potential damages,\u201d said Patrick Linsey, a Connecticut bankruptcy attorney who has represented universities. \u201cFor example, a $40,000 claim over a four-year look back might have made economic sense for a trustee to pursue, but a $20,000 claim over two years might not.\u201dA representative the National Association of Independent College and Universities said he wasn\u2019t aware of any other states that are pushing for a similar law regarding tuition payments.The measure isn\u2019t the first time that state lawmakers have rallied to change the rules for trustees.When multimillion-dollar Ponzi schemes were exposed in Minnesota and Florida, trustees successfully went after money the architects of the schemes had donated to charities in their effort to recover money for the scheme\u2019s victims. State lawmakers, angered by the suits, passed rules in both states that put older donations out of reach.State lawmakers have acted on \u201cpopular outcry for a specific group or donors,\u201d said Edwin Smith, a Boston lawyer with expertise on state-level changes to bankruptcy rules.Write to Katy Stech at katherine.stech@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/connecticut-lawmakers-pass-law-to-deter-tuition-lawsuits-1498651200", "news_title": "Connecticut Lawmakers Pass Law to Deter Tuition Lawsuits ", "keywords": "bankruptcy laws,bankruptcy trustee,college tuition,state bankruptcy laws,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,education,university,college"}, {"content": "Good morning.

The so-called Petya virus, a form of ransomware, infiltrated company networks and locked some computers, demanding payment in bitcoin for them to be returned back to normal.Global firms are scrambling to deal with the fallout from the cyberattack. WPP reacted quickly and told staff yesterday morning U.S. time to log out of its network and shut down their computers as a precautionary measure.

Around 21% of Americans say they are likely to drink beer at brunch, according to Nielsen CGA. Brewers\u2019 efforts to magic up a new daypart for beer come as sales of the beverage are falling, both in the U.S. and world-wide. So a marketing effort is under way to convince consumers that they should ditch their Bloody Marys and complement their scrambled eggs or pancakes with flavored beer instead. \u201cWe want to make beer more sophisticated,\u201d said Felipe Szpigel, president of Anheuser-Busch\u2019s High End business unit, which includes Goose Island and Stella Artois.

Oath\u2019s big pitch is that it can couple subscriber data from Verizon and user data from the likes of Yahoo and AOL mail with content brands like HuffPost and Yahoo Sports to deliver targeted ads next to quality content using its ad tech. Licensing data from rival firms would enhance Oath\u2019s location and behavioral targeting capabilities and, in the cases of Vodafone and Telef\u00f3nica in particular, expand its international footprint outside the U.S. In fact, AOL already struck a deal with Telefonica\u2019s O2 in the U.K. earlier this year, giving Oath access to 16 million opted-in mobile subscribers.A little CMO Today newsletter exclusive for you: there has been a shake-up in the top ranks at New York-based ad tech company Dstillery, which offers clients a DSP (demand-side platform) and DMP (data-management platform) combo.

For Walgreens in the U.S., that number fell to 33% last year, from 37% in 2013.A nudge toward healthier behavior can appeal to some shoppers but can also backfire, said       Phil Rubin,        CEO of marketing firm rDialogue, which focuses on customer loyalty. \u201cA big part of visiting a drugstore is habit, and you can risk alienating customers if you change things up and disrupt that habit.\u201dCVS says it thinks consumers largely are seeking healthier options and won\u2019t be deterred by the changes. It is gradually rolling out its new format; just four U.S. stores, including the one in North Arlington, have received the makeover so far. CVS plans to put the new format in several hundred of its 9,700 stores by 2018.Gary Mocik, a retired police officer in North Arlington, likes that his local CVS no longer sells tobacco products because the store attracts children from an area school. He isn\u2019t so sure about the other changes. \u201cWe\u2019re adults.

Container shipping giant Maersk Line was among a raft of global companies and institutions that were crippled by a virus similar to last month\u2019s ransomware attack, with operations around the world rocked by the hack. APM Terminals, another unit of             A.P. Moeller-Maersk        AMKBY 0.55%       A/S, halted handling at several ports, including New York-New Jersey. The WSJ\u2019s James Marson, David Gauthier-Villars and Michael Amon report other corporate victims of the Petya attack include pharmaceutical giant             Merck        MRK 0.34%       & Co. and Russian oil company PAO Rosneft, and TNT Express, the European operating unit of             FedEx Corp.      , was also affected. The biggest impact may have been on Ukrainian state institutions, but for a broad array of businesses the attack on Maersk marked an alarming sign of the vulnerability of supply chains to hacking. Maersk carries an outsize share of global trade on its ships, leaving the potential financial pain from the hack to reach companies far beyond the vessels themselves.Buying more tankers in an oversupplied market may seem foolhardy to some, but shipping magnate       John Fredriksen       is used to sailing against prevailing business currents. The self-made billionaire, leader of tanker operator             Frontline Ltd.       and head of a troubled offshore-drilling company tells the WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris that he\u2019s still looking to expand his fleet even after two unsuccessful takeover attempts of rival tanker firms. Mr. Fredriksen says he has some $2 billion targeted for acquisitions, and is looking for the biggest of tankers\u2014 very large crude carriers, or VLCCs. His reasoning: shipping companies will scrap three times as many tankers this year than they did last year, with fewer new vessels coming to market, placing a bigger premium on capacity. He\u2019s moving in a depressed tanker market, but analysts note the shipping veteran has always had strong timing. And he\u2019s trying to consolidate in a business that so far has averted the sort of consolidation that has marked the container shipping trade.Takata Corp.       may be going under, but the company isn\u2019t exactly going away. The company\u2019s bankruptcy filing this week sets the stage for the dissolution of the eight-decade-old auto-parts maker, although the WSJ\u2019s Sean McLain and Mike Spector write that the business could limp on for several years supplying parts for the approximately 54 million defective air bags that still need to be replaced in the U.S. alone. The unprecedented recall affects roughly 16% of the 260 million vehicles now on American roads. Takata is trying to get support from major car makers to support efforts to save the auto-components business, and in the meantime expects to sell itself to Key Safety Systems Inc. for $1.6 billion. That\u2019s far less than Takata owes to car makers that have been recalling vehicles, and it will leave new leadership to manage the logistics behind the biggest and most complicated recall the auto industry has faced.Blue Apron Inc. is hoping to sell investors on its initial public offering, but the meal-kit maker\u2019s biggest challenge may be finding customers. Company financial statements show that gaining and retaining buyers of its home-delivery service is getting harder and more expensive, the WSJ\u2019s Eliot Brown reports, highlighting the tough economics behind many e-commerce startups. To live up to its targeted $3 billion valuation, Blue Apron must replace a large share of customers who quit after trying its food and lure ever more people through ads and free offers. That\u2019s sent marketing costs as a share of revenue soaring, pressing the business to keep down spending in other areas while meeting its high logistics demands. The reality for such startups is that the vast majority of U.S. shopping still takes place in brick-and-mortar stores, and customers of online startups can easily jump from one app to another, making it difficult for a company to sustain growth.United Parcel Service Inc.       is taking bigger actions to pare its growing pension burden. The package carrier plans to freeze pension plans for about 70,000 nonunion employees, the WSJ\u2019s Paul Ziobro and Vipal Monga report, seeking to corral a retirement fund with a nearly $10 billion deficit. The company closed the pension plan to new hires last year and offered buyouts to former workers, joining major U.S. corporations looking to rein back a collective deficit in the S&P 1500 pension plans that totaled $408 billion last year. The deficits have persisted even as those firms contributed more than $550 billion combined into the plans from 2008 to 2016, pressing companies to look for more ways to stem the bleeding. The concern has been growing at UPS, and remains a major issue in other segments of the freight business. The Central States Pension Fund covering retired unionized truck drivers has assets of barely half of its obligations, and faces insolvency within the next decade.\u2018This is going to continue.

At $2.7 billion, the record fine the European Union handed to Google on Tuesday amounts to less than one month of parent company Alphabet\u2019s operating cash flow. The real question perhaps is how Google will do business in a world where its massive scale is seen increasingly as anticompetitive by regulators and critics. At the heart of the EU\u2019s case is what regulators believe is Google\u2019s outsize control over internet traffic. The decision, which came after more than seven years of investigations, threatens to have far-reaching ramifications not just for Google, but for the design of products and services from other increasingly dominant technology titans. Google is likely to appeal the EU\u2019s ruling.Senate Republican leaders Tuesday abruptly postponed a vote on a sweeping health-care bill until after the July 4 recess, setting off a high-stakes lobbying sprint that could determine the fate of the GOP\u2019s legislation to replace most of the Affordable Care Act. The delay came after stalled efforts to tweak the legislation and gain the support of nine Republican senators who have opposed the bill. Now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will need to bridge a divide between conservative Republicans, who say the bill retains too many of the ACA\u2019s regulations to significantly lower premiums, and GOP centrists, who worry the legislation goes too far in cutting funding to Medicaid. Until Congress returns from the recess, there is likely to be a run of deal-making, arm-twisting and lobbying, with voters voicing their opinions in town-hall meetings.The euro soared Tuesday to its biggest one-day gain against the dollar in a year and eurozone bond prices slumped after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hinted the ECB might start winding down its stimulus in response to accelerating growth in Europe. Any move by the ECB toward reducing bond purchases would put it on a similar policy path as the Federal Reserve, which first signaled an intent to taper its own stimulus program in 2013. However, the ECB is likely to remain far behind: The Fed has been raising interest rates gradually since December 2015, while the ECB\u2019s key rate has been negative since June 2014. Investors interpreted Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments as a cue to buy euros and sell eurozone bonds. Overnight, the euro extended gains, reaching $1.1374\u2014around its highest level since last June\u2019s U.K. vote to leave the EU. The currency has risen 8.1% against the dollar so far this year.Beer and Belgian waffles could be a delicious pair. As could ale and eggs. So say Anheuser-Busch InBev, Harpoon Brewery, Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, Founders Brewery and other brewers, who are rolling out morning-friendly beers and hosting brunches to entice people to consider beer at a new time of day. Restaurants are finding that beer on morning cocktail menus appeals to diners who crave new flavor pairings or a lower-octane alcoholic beverage early in the day compared with traditional vodka or Champagne-based drinks. Pairing beer with food is on the rise, helped by new beer flavors, including fruity, spicy or tart notes and varieties blended with juice, tea and soft drinks.

Jackson of Alabama said: \u201cIt is good to see that reasonable middle ground was taken instead of the totally unreasonable positions of \u2018we must let everyone in regardless\u2019 of the left and \u2018we must block everyone from being allowed in\u2019 of the right extremes. Hopefully the country will move more toward what is best for the country and replace the extremism on the left and right on all issues.\u201d Mary Thompson of New Mexico wrote: \u201cI was very pleased that the decision came down as it did. The Court made the decision based on the law, not an intent interpretation based on what Mr. Trump has said over the past year or so. I hope the administration makes their arguments this fall whether they need the ruling or not just to assert presidential authority and to put the lower courts in their place.\u201d And Charlie Van Pelt of Florida commented: \u201cThe decision maintains the status quo for the most unfairly affected persons (employees of International companies, family members, etc.) until the Court has more time to consider the case. Mr. Trump gets his ban on other travelers from the named nations. Given the level of scrutiny already being employed for all incoming travelers and the Court\u2019s intent to revisit the ban in the fall, hardly a Trumpian victory, though he tweetfully claims it to be so.\u201dThis daily briefing is named \"The 10-Point\" after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary \"What's News\" digest of top stories.

The latest rise amounts to a 4.3% increase over last year, and military spending is up by $45.8 billion since 2015, NATO Secretary-General       Jens Stoltenberg       said.\u201cWe have shifted gears, the trend is up, and we intend to keep it up,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said in Brussels.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has pushed for increased spending as a central part of its agenda, arguing that U.S. allies are not paying their fair share, though it\u2019s not clear to what degree the pressure has persuaded Europeans.Roughly a quarter of the increase this year is due to an 8% increase in military spending by Germany. Berlin announced its budget boost well before Mr. Trump\u2019s elections, and German officials have said the increase is not because of the current administration\u2019s demands.Still, other allied pledges for more spending have come since Mr. Trump\u2019s call, and the 2017 increase is greater than last year\u2019s. In 2016, before Mr. Trump\u2019s election but under pressure from the Obama administration, European and Canadian military spending rose by $10 billion, or 3.8%, from the previous year.Bruno L\u00e9t\u00e9,        a defense expert at the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, said Europe\u2019s defense budgets have been rising in the years after the allies made a 2014 pledge to reverse cuts in military spending.Mr. L\u00e9t\u00e9 noted that as European governments try to boost spending that is below the NATO goal of \u00a02% of gross domestic product, budgets should rise more quickly.While the spending agreements were made under the Obama administration, Mr. L\u00e9t\u00e9 said the additional spending was \u201ca nice win for Trump.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s say that Trump perhaps has added a sense of urgency to the whole exercise,\u201d \u00a0Mr. L\u00e9t\u00e9 said.NATO officials have been delivering the message that the U.S. is serious about the need for increased military spending in Europe.\u201cI welcome the strong focus of President Trump on defense spending,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. \u201cIt is important we deliver.\u201dSpeaking in Germany, U.S. Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       said allies would discuss new national spending plans in Brussels on Thursday.Mr. Mattis delivered a speech commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, a package of U.S. financial support for Europe after the end of World War II that helped rebuild the continent.Mr. Mattis said the U.S. commitment to defending Europe was ironclad, noting that Mr. Trump had this month endorsed a core NATO policy that an attack on one member is an attack on all\u2014a tenet he had previously held out on publicly supporting.Evoking       George Marshall,        who was secretary of state under President       Harry Truman       as the U.S. helped Europe recover from the war, Mr. Mattis used the history lesson to indirectly make the message that Europe must help pay for its own defense.\u201cEurope transformed from a security consumer into a security provider, something Marshall ardently desired, for he never envisioned that America would carry this burden alone. he knew from experience it had to be shared, both its benefits and its burdens,\u201d Mr. Mattis said.Write to Julian E.

WDC 0.22%      , which has a stake in the business. Toshiba had aimed to announce a deal by Wednesday with the consortium, which includes South Korean chip maker             SK Hynix Inc.,        000660 0.42%       a Western Digital competitor.Instead of announcing the deal agreement, Toshiba asked the Tokyo District Court to suspend a legal motion filed by Western Digital to halt the sale, and to award it \u00a5120 billion ($1.06 billion) in damages. Western Digital, which argues that its joint-venture contract with Toshiba gives it veto power over any sale, had filed the motion with a state court in California earlier this month.Western Digital submitted a new proposal to buy the operation itself on Tuesday, with U.S.-based private-equity firm             KKR                   & Co.A deal is critical for Toshiba because it has negative shareholder equity of \u00a5581.6 billion following the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by its Westinghouse Electric Co. subsidiary. The conglomerate will be removed from the Tokyo Stock Exchange if it fails to fix its financial standing by next March.Some analysts said Toshiba\u2019s legal action could backfire by prolonging the dispute and slowing the sale. It might have been quicker to seek a settlement, they say.\u201cThis means a war which Toshiba looks likely to lose,\u201d said Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japanese equity sales at             BGC Partners,       a brokerage. \u201cToshiba is running out of time.\u201dAt a shareholders meeting Wednesday, Toshiba Chief Executive Officer       Satoshi Tsunakawa       said that Western Digital is \u201cunreasonably interfering.\u201d A Western Digital spokeswoman declined to comment.Toshiba had initially aimed to pick a buyer for the chip unit by March. After postponing a decision several times it missed its latest self-imposed deadline: the shareholders meeting. Toshiba executives apologized at the meeting for the delay, and said they would confirm a sale as soon as possible. They didn\u2019t name a new target date.Taiwan\u2019s             Foxconn Technology                   Group and             Broadcom Ltd.       of the U.S. were among other bidders for Toshiba\u2019s NAND flash-memory operation, enjoying a boom thanks to demand for the memory for smartphones and computer servers.But Toshiba selected as its preferred bidder a group led by state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp. of Japan and 100% government-owned Development Bank of Japan, joined by U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital and SK Hynix. It called the group\u2019s proposal the best \u201cnot only in terms of valuation, but also in respect to certainty of closing, retention of employees, and maintenance of sensitive technology within Japan.\u201dThe selection of a Japanese-government-led group angered some, including       Terry Gou,        chairman of iPhone assembler Foxconn, formally known as             Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.      Hiroshige Seko,        Japan\u2019s economy minister, said the administration hadn\u2019t intervened.Western Digital made several proposals to buy the operation, including one to join the government-led group. Toshiba\u2019s Mr. Tsunakawa said it didn\u2019t pick the U.S. partner because Western Digital hadn\u2019t participated in the formal bid process.Analysts say that unless Toshiba can reach a settlement with Western Digital, the U.S. company is likely to employ every possible step to slow the deal process.\u201cIf a consortium with the Japanese government was a must, Toshiba should have made more effort to pull in Western Digital, not its competitor SK Hynix,\u201d Waseda Business School professor Atsushi Osanai said.The Toshiba-Western Digital relationship now looks irretrievably broken. Toshiba said that in addition to filing suit, it had cut off Western Digital\u2019s access to their joint-venture database to protect Toshiba\u2019s intellectual property.Analysts say the only winner from the dispute is             Samsung                   Electric Co., which holds top share in the NAND flash-memory market, according to IHS Markit. As the legal battle between Toshiba and Western Digital drags on and makes business planning harder, Samsung has the opportunity to boost chip investment and bolster its advantage.Write to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Toshiba Sues to Propel Sale.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 06:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toshiba-sues-western-digital-in-bid-to-keep-sale-of-chip-unit-alive-1498628971", "news_title": "Toshiba Sues Western Digital in Bid to Keep Sale of Chip Unit Alive", "keywords": "pe legal,struggling toshiba ,toshiba ,toshiba chip deal,toshiba chip sale,toshiba chips unit ,toshiba lawsuit,toshiba sale of semiconductor unit ,toshiba sues western digital ,SK Hynix,000660.SE,KR:000660,Toshiba,6502.TO,Western Digital,WDC,Amir Anvarzadeh,ownership changes,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,computer storage devices,semiconductors,personal electronics,computing,computer peripherals,computer hardware,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014In the two decades since Britain returned Hong Kong to China, a wave of mainland Chinese immigrants has flooded the former colony, deepening fears that local values\u2014from free markets to the Cantonese language and even basic politeness\u2014will get washed away in a tide of \u201cmainlandization.\u201dBut in the teeming immigrant enclaves on Hong Kong\u2019s outskirts, the process under way can sometimes seem more like the \u201cHong Kongization\u201d of mainlanders than the other way around. Many Mandarin-speaking newcomers say they relish the freedoms of their new home and are embracing its ways.\u201cYou get influenced by the people around you,\u201d said Lucy Pun, a 45-year-old who left China seven years ago for Tin Shui Wai, a dense cluster of apartment towers near Hong Kong\u2019s border with China. Ms. Pun, who works at a shopping mall, speaks Cantonese now and uses a Hong Kong-sounding name.Her experience shows how Hong Kong\u2019s identity might persist even as Beijing imposes its will. Preserving values grounded in the rule of law is crucial for the city if it hopes to push back, opposition figures say.\u201cHong Kong and China have a divergent history when it comes to culture and values,\u201d says Joshua Wong, the 20-year old activist who helped lead mass pro-democracy protests in 2014. \u201cWhat makes Hong Kong unique is its rule of law, its Cantonese and other traditions.\u201dThough Hong Kong is technically still a semiautonomous region, China is asserting its sovereignty. A visit by Chinese leader       Xi Jinping       for the July 1 anniversary of the handover is gearing up to be a celebration of mainland might. China\u2019s one operational aircraft carrier will dock in Victoria Harbour for the first time; fireworks will depict Chinese characters in the streamlined style of the mainland rather than using Hong Kong\u2019s more ornate forms.Late Wednesday, police detained Mr. Wong and other activists who had been protesting Mr. Xi\u2019s arrival with a sit-in at an iconic Hong Kong monument.Chinese authorities have meddled in elections and use the nation\u2019s wealth to influence economic decisions.

The pro-democracy movement has been muted by prosecutions.Hong Kong\u2019s incoming leader,       Carrie Lam,        who takes office during the festivities on Saturday, is under pressure from Beijing to introduce an anti-sedition law and a pro-China school curriculum\u2014initiatives that were dropped in the past after they sparked protests.But immigrant families leaving the authoritarian mainland can be more protective of Hong Kong\u2019s freer ways. At least two leaders of Hong Kong\u2019s student protest movement were born north of the border.\u201cHong Kong people are not going to accept the values of the Chinese government,\u201d said       Nathan Law,        a 23-year-old activist who helped lead the 2014 democracy protests and whose family moved from the mainland when he was a child. Mr. Law was also among the activists arrested late Wednesday.Many Mainland students studying at Hong Kong\u2019s universities seek to stay after graduation, students and professors said.\u201cThey arrive in Hong Kong and can\u2019t believe the level of freedoms. They see students challenging teachers in the classroom and say \u2018I want this for myself,\u2019\u201d said Jason Ng, an author who teaches law at Hong Kong University.About a million Chinese citizens have moved to Hong Kong since the handover\u2014roughly 13% of the 2016 population\u2014and that inflow is regulated by Beijing. At the current rate, the percentage will be closer to 25% by 2041, according to government estimates.Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy politicians want this \u201cone-way permit\u201d program ended. They say it smacks of China\u2019s use of migrants to dilute ethnic populations in restive regions like Tibet.The city\u2019s government says these immigrants are needed to rejuvenate an aging workforce. Officials say the program is designed to bring together families, often Hong Kong men who have married mainland brides.Hong Kongers often vilify mainland arrivals as interlopers who consume public resources and don\u2019t know how to behave\u2014pushing in lines, spitting in public and mangling Cantonese are common charges. They blame nouveau-riche apartment buyers from the mainland for driving up property prices. Videos of mainlanders behaving badly, such as one showing a couple allowing their toddler to urinate in public, often go viral.Some mainlanders view Hong Kongers as spoiled first-cousins who are miffed by the sudden rise in mainland wealth. Hong Kong\u2019s malls often cater to mainland tourists first. Mainlanders are beating out locals for coveted jobs at companies seeking deals in China.But there are reasons to believe these immigrants will adapt to Hong Kong life, rather than turn it into another Mandarin-speaking Chinese metropolis.For mainland immigrants such as Ms. Pun, assimilation can mean a better job in a competitive city.Modern Hong Kong is a city of immigrants who left the mainland because they didn\u2019t like what was happening there. Its population surged as mainland Chinese fled poverty, famine and persecution under Communist Party rule in the last century.Pollsters say Hong Kong\u2019s identity is getting stronger, not weaker.About 94% of residents between the ages of 18 and 29 say they are \u201cHong Kongers\u201d rather than \u201cChinese,\u201d compared with 68% at the time of the handover, a Hong Kong University poll released this month showed.In Tin Shui Wai, a cluster of cramped 40-story apartment buildings, some new arrivals said they were motivated by wanting a better life rather than identity politics.Fitting in means enjoying the free schools, inexpensive government health care and infrastructure that are often a step up from the places they left in China.\u201cIt\u2019s the quality of life,\u201d said recent immigrant Bobo Mok, a 42-year-old mother of two.Write to John Lyons at john.lyons@wsj.com and Chester Yung at chester.yung@wsj.comAppeared in the June 29, 2017, print edition as 'Chinese Immigrants Embrace Hong Kong.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 05:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-beijing-chinese-immigrants-embrace-hong-kong-way-of-life-1498643264", "news_title": "Goodbye, Beijing: Chinese Immigrants Embrace Hong Kong Way of Life", "keywords": "handover anniversary,hong kong anniversary of handover to china ,hong kong basic law,hong kong handover,hong kong politics ,mainlandization,xi jinping ,political,general news,migration,politics,international relations"}, {"content": "Buried in the Senate Republican health bill is a possible boon for insurers: an end to the Affordable Care Act rule that forced them to spend the lion\u2019s share of premiums on health care for enrollees.Under the ACA, the federal government requires insurers to spend 80% of premiums revenue, received for individual and small-business plans, on health costs. For large employer plans, the share is 85%. If an insurer doesn\u2019t hit the required ratio, it has to rebate the extra money to customers.The Senate bill would end that requirement, starting in 2019. Instead, the bill says, states would mandate their own versions of the ratio\u2014typically called a medical-loss ratio, or MLR\u2014for individual and employer plans. States would also determine how rebates would be paid, if necessary.The upshot for insurers would depend on states\u2019 actions, but analysts suggested that where states chose to loosen the requirements, the industry might be able to bolster its profits, particularly in the employer business. \u201cThey could see some margin expansion,\u201d said Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners LLC.Deep\u00a0Banerjee, an analyst with S&P Global Ratings, said the ACA\u2019s ratio requirements prodded insurers to reduce administrative costs and get more efficient, and also was one factor motivating the industry to seek big mergers, as companies sought to shave expenses further. The requirements also led to cuts in the commissions paid to brokers, squeezing them, industry officials have said.\u201cEffectively, you could see an increase in profitability\u201d in insurers\u2019 employer business of perhaps 2% or 3%, if the medical-loss ratio requirements were eased, Mr. Banerjee said. The ratio requirement affects fully insured employer plans, not those self-insured plans in which the employer pays the claims.In the individual insurance market, where consumers buy their own plans, insurers are generally already paying out a higher share of premiums on health claims than the law requires, he said, so the shift in the ratio requirement may not have much immediate effect.In addition, the law would make many other changes affecting the individual markets, including scrapping the ACA\u2019s mandate for individuals to have coverage, making its overall impact on that segment difficult to assess.Larry Levitt,       \u00a0a senior vice president at the\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation, said that the Senate bill didn\u2019t appear to repeal the ACA ratio requirement for Medicare Advantage plans, an important business for insurers.The Congressional Budget Office, in its analysis of the Senate bill, estimated that states representing about half the U.S. population would choose to maintain the current federal ratio. But in states that allowed insurers to drop the minimum share of premium going toward health care, \u201cthe provision would cause insurers to raise premiums,\u201d at least in areas where they faced little competition. The CBO said the provision would have little effect on the number of people with health insurance.A spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans said the group hasn\u2019t taken a position on the Senate bill\u2019s provisions about medical-loss ratios. The medical-loss ratio change is one of a number of sweeteners for the industry in the bill, which may be helping to win certain insurers\u2019 support for at least the legislation\u2019s provisions affecting the individual insurance market. Insurers that focus largely on the Medicaid business have criticized the bill\u2019s proposed cuts to Medicaid.If the Senate bill became law, it would mark the end of a policy that was highlighted by Democrats when they passed the ACA in 2010. At that time, many supporters of a health overhaul were blaming insurers for premium increases, rescissions (the canceling of a consumer\u2019s insurance policy) and other unpopular tactics in the individual-insurance markets. Insurers strongly opposed the ratio requirement, which they said would hurt their business.Before the ACA, around half of the states had standards for minimum loss ratios in individual insurance, said\u00a0      Scott\u00a0E. Harrington,        a health-care-management professor at the\u00a0University of Pennsylvania\u2019s\u00a0Wharton\u00a0School. Roughly 20 states had such floors for employer plans. But the states didn\u2019t seek to claw back rebates when insurers fell short of paying out the targeted share of premiums, he said. Also, some states had minimum ratio requirements that were considerably lower than those set by the ACA, he said.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/provision-in-senate-health-bill-could-be-a-boon-to-insurers-1498642202", "news_title": "Provision in Senate Health Bill Could Be a Boon to Insurers ", "keywords": " medical-loss ratio, mlr,obamacare, republican health bill, trumpcare,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Booming demand for passive investments is making exchange-traded funds an increasingly crucial driver of share prices, helping to extend the long U.S. stock rally even as valuations become richer and other big buyers pare back.ETFs bought $98 billion in U.S. stocks during the first three months of this year, on pace to surpass their total purchases for 2015 and 2016 combined, according to the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s most recent quarterly tally of U.S. financial accounts. These funds owned nearly 6% of the U.S. stock market in the first quarter\u2014their highest level on record\u2014according to an analysis of Fed data by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Surging demand for ETFs this year has to an unprecedented extent helped fuel the latest leg higher for the eight-year stock-market rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 are on pace for their strongest first six months of any year since 2013. The Nasdaq Composite Index is on track for its best first half since 2003.These gains have come despite stock-market valuations hovering just below their highest levels in 13 years, based on analyst expectations for S&P 500 earnings over the next year.The market rally also has shrugged off many middling economic readings and the diminished expectations of the Trump administration delivering economy-boosting policies. Some fear that stocks and other risky investments will come under selling pressure as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates from historically low levels.Some also worry that investors are likely to dump ETFs if the market reverses course, and they note that this already has happened in a few instances.On June 9, for example, when strong-performing technology stocks abruptly suffered their worst declines in nearly a year, trading volume in the PowerShares QQQ ETF\u2014which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index\u2014surpassed $15 billion and the ETF fell 2.5%. A day later, the ETF suffered an outflow of $1.9 billion. Both the trading volume and withdrawal were the biggest moves in nearly a decade, according to FactSet.ETFs haven\u2019t been the only factor pushing share prices higher, but Fed data show that ETFs are taking on a more prominent role as other buyers are showing signs of fading. A surge in corporate share repurchases helped lift the S&P 500 in recent years, analysts say, as many companies used buybacks as a way to boost per-share earnings even when profits weren\u2019t rising.But U.S. corporate demand for stocks in the first quarter was the smallest in a year and a half, at $136 billion, according to Goldman. A separate reading showed that S&P 500 companies repurchased $133.1 billion of their own shares in the first three months of the year, down 18% from the same period a year earlier, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.There are more than 1,800 U.S.-listed ETFs with nearly $3 trillion in assets under management, offering push-button exposure to everything from 3D-printing stocks to bonds issued by governments in emerging markets, according to data provider XTF. More than 1,300 funds and $2.3 trillion are linked to stocks, while another 302 funds and $500 billion are tied to bonds.Actively managed mutual funds, run by stock pickers who choose shares based on business prospects and valuations, have become sellers recently to meet redemption requests. These funds suffered $985 billion in withdrawals since the start of 2009 through May, according to Morningstar. Mutual-fund ownership of the U.S. equity market in the first quarter fell to 24%, the lowest since 2004, according to Goldman.The rising popularity of funds that track indexes is providing a broad-based support for the market this year. Investors\u2019 preference for ETFs is steadily boosting how much these funds control big U.S. companies. U.S. ETFs held 5.4% of             Apple Inc.\u2019s       shares as of May, compared with 3.7% five years ago, according to XTF data. They hold 5.8% of             Microsoft Corp.\u2019s       shares, up from 4%.\u201cThere\u2019s this rising tide of buying that tends to drive the day-to-day action,\u201d said       Michael O\u2019Rourke,        chief market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. \u201cThe market structure has definitely changed.\u201dThe rise of passive, index-tracking funds has been decades in the making, bolstered by evidence that active stock pickers struggle to beat broad market funds consistently.Still, some analysts warn that the rise of ETFs threatens to separate the market from underlying fundamentals because these passive investments buy an index, rather than focusing on stocks that are undervalued or benefiting from faster growth, as active managers do.\u201cAs people pile in, it can make that entire market expensive,\u201d said       Lance Humphrey,        a portfolio manager at USAA Asset Management Co., who has accumulated about $5.5 billion in ETFs in recent years.Most investors say the test will come once multiple central banks pare back their stimulus efforts, which have suppressed interest rates to near historic lows and made stocks more appealing. The worry is policy shifts could trigger bouts of volatility and prompt investors to take money out of ETFs.The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates twice so far in 2017 and said in its policy meeting earlier this month that it expects to boost rates again by year-end. The Fed also plans to unwind its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, which has helped push investors into risk assets. European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       hinted on Tuesday that the central bank could also begin to dismantle its stimulus efforts.\u201cBy next year, investors might not have monetary policy on their side,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cThe risk is blind buyers turn to blind sellers.\u201dWrite to Chris Dieterich at chris.dieterich@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-28 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/etf-buyers-propel-stock-market-rally-1498642201", "news_title": "ETF Buyers Propel Stock Market Rally ", "keywords": "Federal Reserve Board,Microsoft,MSFT,Apple,AAPL,Lance Humphrey,Michael O'Rourke,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,exchange traded funds,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Health and Human Services Secretary       Tom Price\u2019s       appointment to be a cabinet secretary inadvertently saved him a big stock market loss, while as many as five members of congress may not have been so lucky.When Dr. Price was appointed to run HHS, he said he would sell 461,238 shares in an Australian biomedical company to avoid any possible future conflicts of interest, in case the firm\u2019s primary drug came to the U.S. market.On Tuesday, the company,             Innate Immunotherapeutics,       announced a clinical trial for a multiple sclerosis drug had apparently failed, sending the stock tumbling 92%. If Dr. Price had sold the stock after Tuesday\u2019s decline, his shares would have been worth $22,601, registering a loss on an initial $94,000 investment.Instead, Dr. Price, a former Republican congressman from Georgia, in February sold the Innate Immunotherapeutics shares for about $320,000, earning at least $225,000, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal of his disclosures to Congress and an ethics disclosure report in April.Dr. Price\u2019s spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Some of his colleagues weren\u2019t so fortunate. Rep. Chris Collins, the firm\u2019s largest shareholder and a director of Innate Immunotherapeutics, suffered a paper loss of about $17 million on Tuesday, according to public filings of his stake in the company.Mr. Collins\u2019s total losses on Innate Immunotherapeutics are roughly $5 million, which was how much Mr. Collins initially invested in the company over the past 15 years, according to a person familiar with the company.Mr. Collins told Dr. Price about the company, Mr. Collins said in an interview earlier this year, leading to Dr. Price\u2019s investment and two private placement purchases. Dr. Price was one of fewer than 20 U.S. investors invited last year to buy discounted shares.\u201cFor those that invested in Innate including me, we all were sophisticated investors who were aware of the inherent risk,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cFor every successful drug, there are countless numbers that fail.\u00a0That\u2019s how today\u2019s system works.\u201dIn recent years, Innate Immuno Chief Executive       Simon Wilkinson       had made optimistic statements about the drug for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, the firm\u2019s only drug in development.On June 21, the company said in a news release the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had cleared its application for an investigational new drug. As part of his job, Dr. Price oversees the FDA. On Thursday, the company halted trading pending Tuesday\u2019s announcement.On a conference call Tuesday, Mr. Wilkinson told investors the drug had no meaningful or statistical difference from a placebo in a trial with 93 patients who have MS. \u201cFrom my perspective, these results were a shock, and not what we were expecting based on our previous clinical experience,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly it has been a very bad day at the office.\u201d A recording of the call is posted on the company\u2019s website.The company is reviewing the results but has no reason to think the results will change, he said.At least four other congressmen had invested in the company this year. Rep. Doug Lamborn (R., Colo.) purchased between $15,001-$50,000 \u201cin the open market, at fair market value, after all the media discussion about the company,\u201d said his press secretary, Jarred Rego, in April. On Tuesday, Mr. Rego declined to comment.Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R., Okla.) invested between $100,000 and $250,000 in the company. Mr. Mullin\u2019s press secretary didn\u2019t respond to emails or calls on Tuesday or in April after the investment first appeared on his disclosure form.Reps. Mike Conaway (R., Texas) and Billy Long (R., Mo.) have filed disclosure reports saying they held Innate Immunotherapeutics\u2019 shares.Mr. Long learned of Innate Immunotherapeutics in January when it came up during Mr. Price\u2019s nomination, Hannah Smith, his spokeswoman said in April. \u201cHe then researched what they do and eventually decided they would be a good addition to his portfolio,\u201d she said. Ms. Smith didn\u2019t respond to inquiries on Tuesday.Mr. Conaway\u2019s spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to inquiries in April or on Tuesday.None of the congressmen had filed a report saying they sold the stock, but they have a month to do so after each transaction.In a statement, Rep.

The question now is how much wind this will take out of its big-auto-maker customers.The likes of             Toyota                   and Honda say they have paid and provisioned a total of around $5 billion to cover potential losses as they recall cars and replace their air bags.The concern for investors is that they and other auto makers face an open-ended commitment to Takata that could prove yet more costly. The U.S. court ruling on Takata\u2019s bankruptcy on Tuesday has confirmed that its big customers, which also include Ford and General Motors, will have to step up to ensure Takata\u2019s U.S. units stay in business, at least until the bulk of the business is sold to a Chinese company for $1.6 billion, expected in the first quarter of next year.In truth, these companies face little option: They need to replace dysfunctional air bags to ensure their customers\u2019 safety. Finding alternative suppliers is harder than it sounds. To start with, it isn\u2019t clear there is enough capacity in the air-bag industry to make up for the Japanese company\u2019s demise.Meanwhile, Takata\u2019s position is still deteriorating. Its own suppliers are refusing to ship products to it and demanding cash on delivery. That is adding to Takata\u2019s manufacturing difficulties and its cash drain, which has dwindled by $31 million in the past year.Already, the pace of installing new air bags has been slow, even as the number of recalls rises: An estimated 54 million air bags still need to be replaced in the U.S., Takata\u2019s largest market by sales. Mercedes has substituted only 2% of its air bags, while even the more-advanced companies have replaced around 20% to 30%. All told, the industry could collectively face a further $10 billion in costs, brokerage Jefferies estimates.This all goes without mentioning the $850 million fine Takata must pay for claims to the U.S. Department of Justice by February and the fact that the deal to sell the business to Key Safety Systems Inc. isn\u2019t completed.Takata\u2019s unsecured yen bonds fell into default after trading down to 20 cents on the dollar earlier this week, a reflection of the markets\u2019 lack of expectation for payment of unsecured claims.

The soldiers carried in boxes of equipment, which opposition congressmen said was a prelude to a government takeover of the building ahead of next month\u2019s plans to rewrite the constitution.Opposition lawmakers tried to remain defiant, with       Julio Borges,        among the more prominent of Mr. Maduro\u2019s foes, telling reporters, \u201cNeither bullets, threats or attacks will throw us out of here.\u201dMeanwhile, the government-controlled court late Tuesday published a decision that gave investigative powers to the human-rights ombudsman, a close ally of the president. That potentially allows officials to usurp the powers of Attorney General       Luisa Ortega,        who had in recent weeks grown critical of the government and pledged to investigate corruption.Mr. Maduro focused on the helicopter incident when he spoke before a group of pro-government journalists in an event carried live on national television.\u201cIt could have caused a tragedy with several dozen dead and injured,\u201d said Mr. Maduro.Another senior government official, Information Minister       Ernesto Villegas,        accused a retired general who had once been loyal to the government,       Miguel Rodriguez Torres,        of helping to plan the attack.Mr. Villegas didn\u2019t provide evidence, and Mr. Rodriguez Torres couldn\u2019t be reached to comment. Mr. Rodriguez Torres had on Tuesday morning criticized the government in a press conference.The president\u2019s many opponents believed the helicopter incident could have been government-orchestrated to deflect from Mr. Maduro\u2019s plans to rewrite the constitution next month and his attempt to weaken the attorney general.\u201cThe helicopter is a diversion that takes attention away from the Supreme Court decision, and allows the court to go after the attorney general and eliminate her,\u201d said Cliver Alcala, a retired general and fierce critic of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.The plan for a new constitution, which has helped fuel deepening unrest, is highly unpopular as it would usurp what few legal avenues of dissent are left to the country\u2019s beleaguered opposition.About 80 people have died in three months of constant protests against the embattled president, who has been unable to stop an economic free fall that has seen the economy nearly collapse, with inflation rising to 700% while food and medicine have become scarce.Earlier in the day, Mr. Maduro threatened civil war if the opposition were to attempt to remove the government, suggesting violence even if the change came through elections.\u201cWe would never give up, and what couldn\u2019t be done with votes, we would do with weapons,\u201d he said at a rally.The president has called a July 30 vote for a special assembly with powers to redraft the constitution, which opponents say with do away with last vestiges of Venezuelan democracy. The opposition and ruling party dissidents such as Ms. Ortega, the attorney general, have vowed to boycott and fight the elections, which they say are unlawful.Appeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'Caracas In Chaos As Maduro Maneuvers.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 01:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelan-presidents-claims-of-helicopter-attack-contested-1498626430", "news_title": "Venezuelan President\u2019s Claims of Helicopter Attack Contested ", "keywords": "maduro opposition ,venezuela helicopter,venezuela maduro ,venezuela opposition,Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Senate GOP leaders postponed a health-care vote until after the July 4 recess after efforts stalled to win support from the nine Republican senators who now oppose the bill.The U.S. military prepared for a possible Syria strike after Washington said it had signs Assad may use chemical weapons again.Ex-Trump campaign chairman Manafort registered with the Justice Department as an agent of a foreign government for his Ukraine work.Trump\u2019s administration is moving to roll back an Obama rule aimed at protecting drinking water.Justice Gorsuch early on has lined up consistently with the Supreme Court\u2019s most conservative justices.Venezuela\u2019s Maduro said a helicopter dropped grenades on the nation\u2019s high court in a terror attack.

Morgan Chase        JPM 0.14%       & Co. and             General Electric Co.        GE 0.19%       are announcing\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that the industrial giant will help install new energy management and digital technologies for\u00a0about 4,500\u00a0branches at the nation\u2019s largest bank.The savings, according to\u00a0a bank official, could add up to\u00a0a couple of hundred million dollars\u00a0over the next decade.The changes are occurring as banks continue pressing to cut costs. Relatively low interest rates have pressured profits, while both trading and lending have hit weak spots in recent quarters.New York-based J.P. Morgan will use GE unit Current\u2019s energy-management system of sensors, software and lighting controls to reduce electric and gas consumption by 15% and water consumption from irrigation systems by 20% in 4,500 of the bank\u2019s roughly 5,300 branches.The bank is piloting the changes in 10 branches in the New York City area, with plans to\u00a0roll it out nationwide\u00a0in the second half of 2018, said David Owen, J.P. Morgan\u2019s chief administrative officer.While saving $20 million or so each year wouldn\u2019t put much of a dent in a company that projects expenses of $58 billion in 2017, it could help add momentum for branches at a time when they need to justify their costs as more customers turn to mobile banking apps. It is also designed as an environmentally friendly move that could appeal to some millennial customers and potential employees.Specific changes in store for the J.P. Morgan Chase branches: automating lights; using occupancy sensors in facilities; and remotely controlling heating, cooling and irrigation systems.That data will go into the bank\u2019s Network Operations Center, hosted in the cloud,\u00a0and help the bank use less lighting and water when it isn't needed,\u00a0Mr. Owen said.It is also likely to reduce maintenance expenses, since the bank can check if a building is burning more electricity than it should or check potential installation problems, such as whether a door or window isn\u2019t sealing properly.Customers are unlikely to notice many changes, though Mr. Owen said\u00a0problems like the outage of an air-conditioning unit could be spotted ahead of time, before employees and customers are inconvenienced.The move follows the bank\u2019s\u00a0partnership\u00a0last year\u00a0with GE to install LED lighting in 5,000 of its branches. Around half the installations have been done so far and the rest are expected to be completed by year-end.", "news_time": "2017-06-28 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-finds-the-newest-banking-fad-dark-corners-1498622460", "news_title": "J.P.

The unarmed African-American man was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Mr. Garner\u2019s death was ruled a homicide partly caused by the chokehold, a practice banned by NYPD policy.In the recording, Mr. Garner could be heard saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d after being slammed into the ground. Mr. Pantaleo ultimately wasn\u2019t indicted by a grand jury, though his killing of Mr. Garner drew national attention to the issue of police brutality and prompted calls for officers to wear body cameras.The CCRB concluded that 28% of the allegations of police interfering with civilian recordings were substantiated, meaning the organization found that the officer actively blocked or attempted to block the video recording. Only 6% of allegations were unfounded, meaning the officer didn\u2019t stop the recording, while just over 40% of allegations were unsubstantiated, meaning there was not enough evidence to show that the officer tried to block the recording.In 11% of cases, the CCRB found that lawful interference had taken place, resulting in the exoneration of the officer. A lawful interference occurs when the person recording is found to be putting themselves or others in danger or is interfering with police activity.The CCRB recommended that the NYPD add a section to its Patrol Guide that clarifies a civilian\u2019s rights to record and defines what constitutes \u201cinterference\u201d when dealing with a civilian\u2019s recording. It also recommended training officers on how to handle civilian video recording and how to interact with members of organizations dedicated to recording police activity.The department has moved to document police conduct by putting body cameras on officers. Officers in Washington Heights are wearing body cameras as part of a pilot program. An NYPD policy drafted earlier this year requires officers wearing cameras to activate the devices when making arrests, searching a home or interacting with potential suspects.Appeared in the June 28, 2017, print edition as 'More Video Used Against Officers.'", "news_time": "2017-06-28 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-complaints-against-nypd-officers-include-video-evidence-study-finds-1498622401", "news_title": "More Complaints Against NYPD Officers Include Video Evidence, Study Finds ", "keywords": "body cameras,dash cams,eric garner,new york city,nypd,police brutality,police officers,police violence,New York Police Department,political,general news,crime,legal action"}]
