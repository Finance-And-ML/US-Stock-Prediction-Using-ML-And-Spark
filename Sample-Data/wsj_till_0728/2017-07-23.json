Grab, which operates private-car, taxi, motorcycle and carpool bookings across seven countries in the region, intends to raise an additional $500 million from existing and new investors, the company said. The new investors weren\u2019t disclosed.The deal would value Grab at more than $6 billion, making it the region\u2019s most-valuable startup, according to a person familiar with the situation.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month on the fundraising round.Grab\u2019s cash injection adds to Uber\u2019s challenges as it pushes for global expansion. The San Francisco company is struggling with management challenges at home and strong competition from rivals overseas.Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick relinquished his role as chief executive last month after an investigation into sexual harassment and sexism at the company, although he remains a director.Grab, founded in 2012 by Harvard Business School classmates       Anthony Tan       and Tan Hooi Ling, will use the money to strengthen its market share and mobile-payments business, the company said.

Another passenger, also an adult male, later died at a hospital, officials said Sunday afternoon.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a human-trafficking crime here,\u201d San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said at a news conference.The driver of the big rig is in federal custody and will be charged Monday, said Richard Durbin Jr., the U.S. attorney for western Texas. James M. Bradley Jr., 60 years old, is being held in federal custody in connection with the incident, according to a statement from Mr. Durbin\u2019s office. The office didn\u2019t specify if Mr. Bradley was the driver. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Mr. Bradley had a lawyer.Alton Bradley of Land O\u2019 Lakes, Fla., who said he is Mr. Bradley\u2019s nephew, said his uncle has been a long-haul trucker for decades. His uncle used to visit once or twice a year, depending on his driving schedule, and the two would discuss what he was hauling. \u201cIt was nothing out of the ordinary, regular stuff you pick up from a vendor, a manufacturer, and drop off somewhere else,\u201d Alton Bradley said. He last saw his uncle seven or eight years ago.Brian Pyle,        the owner of Pyle Transportation, a trucking company based in Schaller, Iowa, said Mr. Bradley had been his employee on and off for about five years.Mr. Pyle said he had recently sent Mr. Bradley, who bought his own truck several months ago, down to Brownsville, Texas, to deliver an empty trailer to a business Mr. Pyle had sold the trailer to.\u201cHe was friendly. He seemed like the kind of guy who would give you the shirt off his back,\u201d Mr. Pyle said.Mr. Pyle said Mr. Bradley had originally worked for his company, which hauls meat and produce, as a driver. But he suffered from diabetes and had to quit earlier this year for several months to get his leg amputated. Mr. Pyle said Mr. Bradley returned to the company recently after getting fitted for a prosthetic leg and had since bought his own truck.Mr. Pyle said he\u2019d never had any issues with Mr. Bradley, and was stunned to learn what had happened. \u201cI\u2019m shocked\u2014just speechless,\u201d he said. He said he had spoken with him last Monday. This was Mr. Bradley\u2019s first trip since returning to the trucking company, Mr. Pyle said.The male occupant who died at the hospital was among 30 individuals who were taken to area hospitals after rescuers pulled them from the trailer, parked near a             Wal-Mart                   store, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman said.Many were initially in serious or critical condition, San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said Sunday. Paramedics reported that people had high heart rates and were hot to the touch, suffering from signs of heat stroke and dehydration, he said.\u201cThe truck was loaded with people,\u201d he said.A total of about 39 people were believed to be inside the truck, including at least two school-age children, when rescuers arrived, authorities said. Chief McManus said he didn\u2019t know the occupants\u2019 countries of origin.Police responded to the 18-wheeler after a man emerged from the vehicle and approached a store worker, asking for water. Inside the trailer, police and paramedics found eight people dead, and about 28 others among them, Chief Hood said.One passenger fled but was found Sunday morning in a nearby wooded area, prosecutors said.Passengers are likely to be turned over to ICE for questioning after they have been treated, Chief McManus said.Mr. Durbin, the region\u2019s top federal prosecutor, said the people in the trailer were \u201cvictims of ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the well-being of their fragile cargo.\u201d\u201cThese people were helpless in the hands of their transporters,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cImagine their suffering, trapped in a stifling trailer in 100-plus degree heat.\u201dThe trailer wasn\u2019t air-conditioned and rescuers saw no sign occupants had access to water.The Wal-Mart\u2019s surveillance camera shows that a number of vehicles had earlier arrived to pick up \u201ca lot\u201d of the people who were in the trailer and survived the trip, Chief McManus said. He said he didn\u2019t know where the truck began its journey.\u201cThis is not an isolated incident; this happens quite frequently,\u201d the police chief said, referring to human smuggling. \u201cIt happens late at night, under darkness.\u201dIn fiscal year 2016, the Homeland Security Investigations arm of ICE launched 2,110 human-smuggling investigations, yielding 1,522 criminal convictions, federal officials say. That same year the unit made 2,734 criminal arrests and about 3,000 administrative arrests linked to smuggling.In 2003, 19 foreign nationals died after being smuggled inside an insulated tractor trailer that was discovered abandoned at a truck stop in Victoria, Texas. Police found 17 bodies in and around the trailer, and two other occupants died at local hospitals. The driver is serving a prison sentence of nearly 34 years without possibility of parole.In April, a 61-year-old Michigan man was sentenced to nearly six years in prison after a federal jury in Texas convicted him of trying to smuggle 10 people into the U.S. inside a locked rental truck in 2016. All 10 survived.Earlier this month in Houston, police rescued 12 people, including a girl, from the hot cargo bay of a box truck after they had spent hours banging on the wall for help. Three people were charged with human smuggling, the local prosecutor said.\u2014Miguel Bustillo  and Jim Oberman  contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   The death toll from an apparent human smuggling crime rose to nine. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said there were 10 deaths. Also, at a news conference on the deaths of eight people in a sweltering tractor trailer, San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said, \u201cThe truck was loaded with people.\u201d An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed this quote to San Antonio Police Chief William McManus.

The attack, which left two Israeli police officers dead, led Israeli officials last week to introduce metal detectors at the site\u2019s entrances.Protests ensued around the Arab world over the security measure, and in Jerusalem and the West Bank, riots led to three Palestinian deaths. For many Arabs, the metal detectors were seen as giving Israel control over entry to a Muslim holy site.On Friday evening, a Palestinian stabbed three Israelis to death and injured a fourth in their home in the Halamish settlement. The attacker was shot and wounded.\u201cPresident Trump and his administration are closely following unfolding events in the region,\u201d the White House official said. \u201cThe United States utterly condemns the recent terrorist violence including the horrific attack Friday night that killed three people at their Shabbat dinner table in Halamish and sends condolences to the families of the innocent victims.\u201d\u201cWe are engaged in discussions with the relevant parties and are committed to finding a resolution to the ongoing security issues,\u201d the official said in a statement.Mr. Greenblatt will be coordinating with the State Department and with Mr. Kushner, the White House said.

That attack led Israeli authorities to close the Temple Mount to all Muslim men under the age of 50 during the following week\u2019s Friday prayers. The tension over the site then sparked violence across the city.\u201cThe checkpoints will stay,\u201d       Tzachi Hanegbi,        a minister in Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s       government, told Army Radio. \u201cThe government of Israel isn\u2019t willing to put up with acts of murder.\u201dJason Greenblatt, the U.S. envoy leading efforts to reopen peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, left for Israel Sunday night \u201cto support efforts to reduce tensions in the region,\u201d a senior administration official said.Waqf, the Islamic religious authority that administers the Temple Mount, has called on Muslims not to visit the site until the cameras are removed and accuses Israel of trying to take control of the area. Only Muslims are allowed to pray on the compound, but Jewish groups are lobbying for that right.Palestinian leader       Mahmoud Abbas       said on Friday that the Palestinian Authority will cut all ties with Israel until the issue is resolved. A Palestinian official on Sunday said the suspension included security cooperation, but offered no details on how ties would be severed.Attempts by the Palestinian Authority to cut ties with Israel would only damage that body\u2019s own security and economic interests, Israeli Defense Minister       Avigdor Lieberman       warned on Sunday.In governing parts of the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority is deeply intertwined with Israel, which transfers a large portion of the Authority\u2019s monthly revenue in taxes and other duties.Security services from both sides work closely together and thousands of Palestinians cross to Israel from the West Bank each day for work, making a permanent break in ties unrealistic.The latest confrontation at the Temple Mount strikes at the heart of a longstanding dispute over who holds ultimate sovereignty over it.Israel captured the area from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, but allowed Waqf, a Jordanian religious authority, to continue to administer the site. Palestinians, meanwhile, want the compound as part of the capital of a future independent state.\u201cWe oppose all means Israel implements at the entrance to the Al Aqsa Mosque, including metal detectors,\u201d Waqf said on Sunday, referring to the mosque that stands atop the Temple Mount. It asked Jordan, the Palestinian Authority and other Arab nations to lobby Israel to back down from its additional security measures.The quartet of diplomatic representatives on Israeli-Palestinian peace, including the United Nations, European Union, U.S. and Russia, also called on all sides to refrain from provocative actions and to de-escalate tensions.Israeli security forces on Friday clashed with thousands of Palestinians protesting the metal detectors, arguing that they don\u2019t provide additional security and undermine the shrine\u2019s holiness. Three Palestinians were killed, Palestinian authorities said.The metal detectors are a symbol of wider Palestinian grievances over a lack of movement toward statehood, and fears Israel is attempting to change longstanding agreements over accessibility to the Temple Mount, said       Mitchell Barak,        a political analyst at Jerusalem-based Keevoon Global Research.\u201cPalestinians think that Israel is trying to change the status quo,\u201d said Mr. Barak, who has worked with Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cIsrael is exercising its sovereignty and sending a message [to Palestinians] that you have to walk through our metal detectors.\u201dMeanwhile, Jordan\u2019s domestic security agency said two Jordanians were killed and an Israeli was wounded by gunfire on Sunday in a residential building in the heavily fortified Israeli Embassy compound in the capital Amman, the Associated Press reported. The agency said that before the shooting, Jordanians had entered the building for carpentry work. One of the Jordanians killed was a physician at the scene, it said. The Israeli Foreign Ministry had no comment.Also on Friday, a Palestinian assailant mounted a bloody stabbing attack on an Israeli family in a West Bank settlement in response to the dispute over the Temple Mount, according to Israeli authorities and a Facebook post by the attacker that detailed his motives. He stabbed a father and his two adult children as they ate dinner, killing all three, Israeli authorities said.Mr. Netanyahu on Sunday said authorities would demolish the home of the assailant and take action against Palestinians who incited violence or praised such attacks.\u2014Eli Stokols  contributed to this article.Write to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Israel Boosts Security at Jerusalem Shrine.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-installs-security-cameras-at-temple-mount-1500819778", "keywords": ["israel,jerusalem,old city,palestine,temple mount,violence,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,international relations,politics,religion,risk news,military action"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 21:18:00", "news_title": "Grand Jury Indicts U.S. Soldier on Charges of Attempting to Aid ISIS", "content": "HONOLULU\u2014A federal grand jury in Hawaii indicted a U.S. soldier on Friday for attempting to provide material support to Islamic State.Army Sgt. 1st Class       Ikaika Kang       was arrested by an FBI SWAT team on July 8.

Demonstrators held candles and sang Poland\u2019s national anthem in a bid to stop a law that would send the entire high court into retirement and allow the justice minister to replace them temporarily with judges he could fire at any moment.\u201cThis has become trendy. You can see a lot of young people here,\u201d said       Emil Pawlowski,        a protester who stood in the same Warsaw square where two weeks ago President       Donald Trump       visited and praised Poland\u2019s leaders. \u201cThis is dangerous for the current government.\u201dThe ruling Law and Justice party tops opinion surveys.Still, the protests reflect wider-than-expected opposition to the law. Businesses, universities, and hundreds of top lawyers have written to Mr. Duda, asking him to veto the legislation, which they say would give a handful of ruling-party officials full control over the judiciary.The U.S. State Department has voiced the same concerns, a criticism Poland\u2019s foreign ministry said came as a surprise after Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. A tweet from Sen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.), denouncing the Polish legislation\u2014one of his first after announcing he has brain cancer\u2014 also made headlines here.Those objections appeared to have had some impact. On Saturday, Mr. Duda\u2019s spokesman said there were flaws in the bill, which he didn\u2019t specify. There are also legal questions over whether the president could sign the law, as Poland\u2019s two-chamber Parliament appears to have accidentally passed two drafts of the same law, with conflicting provisions. Mr. Duda has previously said he would sign the law.\u201cWe will not give in to pressure,\u201d Prime Minister       Beata Szyd\u0142o       said on state television on Friday. \u201cWe will not be intimidated by Polish and foreign defenders of the interests of the elite.\u201dThe Supreme Court law has made the country of 38 million a test case for how freely a European nation can defy international pressure and pursue a democracy with fewer checks and balances. The European Union has threatened to formally censure Poland for eroding democratic values.Those threats haven\u2019t deterred the ruling party, which says the judiciary is led by elites and former communists who need to be more accountable to voters. Two years ago, the party won 38% in a legislative election, enough to gain an absolute majority in Parliament.On state media, its leaders have said the protesters are paid by foreign agents who want to weaken the government and allow the country to be overrun with Muslims.Hungarian Prime Minister       Viktor Orban       pledged on Saturday to support Warsaw, vowing to veto any EU sanctions.\u201cThe inquisition offensive against Poland can never succeed,\u201d he said. Some analysts said the Polish protests had the potential to inspire copycat movements in populist-governed states like Hungary.\u201cThere is something in the air,\u201d said       Eva Balogh,        a retired professor of Central European history at Yale University. \u201cI am pretty sure that Mr. Viktor Orban is very worried about what is happening in Poland, and to Poland.\u201dWrite to Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Protests Escalate in Poland.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/protests-against-plan-to-dismiss-polish-supreme-court-escalate-1500851632", "keywords": ["andrzej duda,poland,Andrzej Duda,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 19:05:00", "news_title": "Canadian Wildfires Choke Lumber Supply to U.S. Home Builders ", "content": "Wildfires in Canada are pushing up the price of lumber, threatening the supply to U.S. home builders.Lumber futures have soared in July as blazes spread across the province of British Columbia, leaving many U.S. wholesalers short-handed. Lumber dealers ran down their inventories this year as a trade spat between the administration of President Donald Trump and Canadian officials sparked wild price swings. Then Canada\u2019s wildfires, a threat every summer, turned out to be the hardest on the lumber industry in more than a decade.Now home builders in the U.S., which gets around a third of its lumber from Canada, fear prices might climb even higher as wholesalers try to restock amid the price surge. British Columbia produces nearly half of all Canadian lumber, according to Statistics Canada.\u201cPeople need wood now,\u201d said       Paul Harder,        a timber trader at wholesaler Dakeryn Industries in North Vancouver, which sells to U.S. lumber yards. \u201cLittle lumber is being offered out there.\u201dLumber futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an indicator of price expectations for the months ahead, rose above $400 per 1,000 board feet in mid-July. That was near a 12-year high reached in April before the Trump administration accused Canada of unfairly subsidizing its forestry industry and started slapping tariffs as high as 30% on some timber imports to the U.S. Canadian officials deny the allegationsThe tariffs, which are preliminary and could be rolled back this year, add an estimated $1,700 to the price of a typical home, said the National Association of Home Builders. Average new, single family-home prices rose to a record $406,400 in May, according to the Commerce Department.A fifth of U.S. home builders reported a shortage of framing lumber in May, according to a survey by the association and             Wells Fargo.Confidence among home builders fell to an eight-month low in July amid concerns over rising lumber costs, the association said last week.\u201cYou can\u2019t budget for unforeseen lumber costs,\u201d said       Brett Boyce,        owner of Split Rock Fine Homes in St. George, Utah, and president of the state\u2019s home builders\u2019 association. He said the cost of lumber for recent jobs has risen about 20%. \u201cIt does end up getting passed along to the consumer,\u201d he said.David Goodwin Jr.      , a home builder in Memphis, Tenn., has already raised prices about 5% since the lumber tariffs took effect. He said he worries the wildfires could stoke further lumber price increases.A stronger Canadian dollar also has weighed on lumber shipments. The currency has gained nearly 10% against the U.S. dollar since May. Now U.S. home builders say Canada\u2019s raging wildfires are threatening to push prices even higher at the peak of the summer construction season.\u201cA lot of guys had their hands in their pockets waiting for some lower prices in August,\u201d said       Brian Leonard,        a lumber analyst at the Chicago Board of Trade. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect storm.\u201dNot all are seeing the impact yet.       Alan Laing,        executive vice president of home building operations for             Taylor Morrison Inc.,       said it is \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for the Arizona-based home builder, which operates in eight states and had 2016 revenue of $3.6 billion. The prices Taylor Morrison obtains from lumber distributors is a 90-day blended average that doesn\u2019t take into account the recent increase seen on the futures market, he said.\u201cWe expect pricing to be flat over the next two to three months,\u201d he said. Additionally, Mr. Laing said he hasn\u2019t heard from suppliers about a potential shortage of lumber, although if wildfires continue, that could lead to an increase in prices of oriented strand board, a type of particle board lumber produced in British Columbia that is used for roof and wall sheeting.Canadian officials said Sunday that some 150 fires were still burning in British Columbia, where about 30,000 people have been evacuated.More than a half-dozen lumber mills, which produce about 14% of the province\u2019s timber and 3% of North American output, according to industry newsletter Random Lengths, have closed.

WebMD had a market value of about $2 billion Friday after running up on hopes of a sale.Reuters reported earlier Sunday that the company was nearing a deal with KKR.WebMD was founded in the late 1990s by       Jeffrey Arnold,        who became a billionaire at age 29 when the company merged with Healtheon Corp. in 1999.In addition to its namesake website, featuring a symptom checker and glossary of medical terms, the company operates physician-focused\u00a0Medscape.com, among other services.The expected takeover comes as uncertainty surrounding health-care policy and drug pricing has damped demand for pharmaceutical marketing such as advertising on WebMD\u2019s websites. Executives noted that backdrop in February, as the company forecast slowing 2017 revenue and said it would explore a sale.The shares were trading at just over $50 when WebMD said it would consider a sale. The stock notched a record close of $66.98 in May 2016 but is down nearly 20% since then and closed at $55.19 Friday.Private-equity firms have long seen the company as a target. In 2012, WebMD scrapped an earlier effort to sell itself, which came on the heels of billionaire investor       Carl Icahn       taking a stake in the company and arguing it was undervalued.In March, activist hedge fund firm Blue Harbour Group LP disclosed an 8.99% stake in WebMD.

Over the weekend, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said, its ministers have held a series of \u201cintensive consultations\u201d about the challenges for an output-cutting deal the 14-nation cartel struck last year with Russia and other big producers.The agreement was supposed to take almost 1.8 million barrels of crude oil off the global market and drain an oversupply that has weighed prices down for three years and sent a shock through the economies of oil-producing economies. But prices have remained stubbornly low as the glut persists. Brent, the international benchmark, fell 2.5%, to $48.06 on Friday because of doubts about OPEC\u2019s ability to turn around the market.Saudi Arabian energy minister       Khalid al-Falih       cut short his vacation to come to St. Petersburg for a committee meeting he sometimes skips because of the gathering\u2019s sudden \u201cstrategic importance\u201d and \u201cthe high expectations of the times,\u201d said OPEC Secretary General       Mohammad Barkindo.Mr. Falih has been calling OPEC oil officials all weekend, said a person close to the minister, describing him as \u201cvery nervous.\u201d Mr. Falih declined to speak with reporters. A Saudi oil-ministry official didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Falih met his Russian counterpart,       Alexander Novak,        on Sunday. Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader of OPEC, while Russia is the world\u2019s top producer and leader of a faction of 10 non-OPEC producers that pledged to cut output.The two men will preside over a gathering of several OPEC and non-OPEC producers Monday designed to shore up support for their efforts to limit global oil output. Among the topics, Mr. Novak said, will be production from Libya and Nigeria. The two OPEC members, which were exempted from last year\u2019s deal and have recently raised output.\u201cI think that as soon as these countries reach a stable production level, they must join other responsible producers and make their contribution to the measures aiming to rebalance the market,\u201d Mr. Novak said, according to TASS, the Russian state news agency.Libyan and Nigerian officials have signaled a willingness to limit their production once it stabilizes, but the details are being negotiated.An OPEC official said Iraqi production would also be discussed, as the cartel member\u2019s output has remained much higher than its agreed upon levels.OPEC officials and analysts cautioned against expecting the cartel and its allies to take major action on Monday. It is a routine committee meeting with only handful of the 24 countries involved.Another reason to expect little action on Monday is that OPEC is still weighing how to deal with U.S. producers, which remain largely outside of the cartel\u2019s control.Shale drillers\u2014which work on shorter-term projects than traditional oil producers\u2014took advantage quickly when oil prices briefly rose last year after the OPEC deal, sending more crude into global supply. They also have learned to drill at lower prices, and U.S. production has maintained its upward swing even as prices have been depressed this year.OPEC members have repeatedly ruled out making deeper production cuts. While that action would likely raise prices, it would probably also allow shale drillers to ramp up output even more, reducing OPEC market share and eventually killing any rally.\u201cMarket dynamics have been challenging,\u201d Mr. Barkindo said. \u201cThey have been almost challenging established economic theory.\u201dSaudi Arabia\u2019s goal this week is to \u201cconvince the other members that by sticking to the deal all OPEC producers will benefit from higher revenues,\u201d said       Giovanni Staunovo,        commodity analyst at the Swiss bank UBS.Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, two of OPEC\u2019s largest producers, haven\u2019t been meeting their output-cut pledges, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said in a report last week, making them \u201cmaterial drags on overall compliance.\u201d Saudi Arabia has picked up the slack, cutting more than pledged, but the kingdom in recent months has been pumping more to meet higher summer demand.Ecuador\u2019s oil minister recently said his country had no plans to stick to its output-cut pledge because the country needed the revenue. Ecuador is a small producer, but its oil minister\u2019s unusual public stance drew a phone call from Mr. Falih, who got the country to issue a statement reiterating its support for the output deal.Mr. Barkindo said Monday\u2019s meeting could result in recommendations for OPEC and its allies to consider in the future. He said overall compliance with the deal since January had been \u201cexcellent.\u201d\u201cThe rebalancing process may be going at a slower pace than we earlier projected but it\u2019s on course.

Banking groups have said their members follow the guidelines, but Washington and Wall Street have wrangled for years over whether they need to be locked in with formal rules.Last week, regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped efforts to craft those tougher provisions from their published agendas. Those proposals included longer deferment periods for bonuses and longer periods of time during which the payouts are subject to potential claw backs.An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the changed agenda. But Republican lawmakers and regulatory officials have long complained that Dodd-Frank included many measures unrelated to the financial crisis that spurred it passage.Barney Frank,        the former Democratic congressman who co-sponsored the landmark legislation, said he was unhappy but not surprised that regulators under the Trump administration are halting work on the rules. Because of GOP majorities in Congress and a Republican president in the White House, he says,\u00a0the agencies \u201cwill be able to get away with much of this.\u201dIn theory, a regulatory pull-back now could prompt banks to resume some pre-crisis practices, such as cash bonuses that are free from multi-year vesting periods or dropping provisions that claw back pay for bad behavior.But big banks already have made moves to rein in pay, pressured by shareholders seeking higher dividends and stock buybacks and as they work under higher capital requirements that have pressured profitability and squeezed the amount of money available for compensation.\u201cAt this point, restrictions on comp may be superfluous,\u201d said Guy Moszkowski, a veteran banking analyst and managing partner at Autonomous Research. \u201cNone of these firms want to pay people more than they have to.\u201dThe average bonus paid in New York City by securities firms was $138,200 in 2016, down 28% from its 2006 peak, according to a report by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.A senior trader who earned $2 million in total compensation prior to the crisis would be making about $1.2 million today, according to       Michael Karp,        chief executive of Wall Street recruiting firm Options Group.High pay for traders and bankers has long been an issue, especially when Wall Street rebounded in 2009 due in part to $245 billion in government aid to banks.\u201cI did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Obama said that year. \u00a0\"You guys are drawing down $10, $20 million bonuses after America went through the worst economic year that it\u2019s gone through in decades.\u201dUnder that pressure, Wall Street reduced pay and deferred more of it so that employees\u2019 actions could be more accurately gauged over a longer time period.Some bank boards have also tightened executive pay for top executives.       Lloyd Blankfein,        chief executive of             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,       was compensated $22 million for his work in 2016, about one-third of his $68.5 million pay package for 2007.\u00a0            J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co.\u2019s chief,       James Dimon,        also had his overall decline to $28 million from $30 million over that timeframe.Dodd-Frank supporters argued that the pre-crisis banking culture rewarded swinging for the fences without regard for risk. When traders entered insurance-like contracts that generated instant revenue, they kept big cash bonuses\u2014even if the trade blew up later and cost the bank billions. The incentive compensation restrictions in Dodd-Frank were designed to show there are consequences of making bad trading or management decisions.\u201cThat\u2019s a serious issue that goes beyond whether these guys make too much money,\u201d said Mr. Frank.Trading desks also produced many outsize gains for the banks. Individual traders would take a share of the winnings, sometimes raking in tens of millions. One oil trader, Andrew Hall, famously earned a roughly $100 million bonus at             Citigroup                   in 2008 after a run of profitable years.Today, however, those desks are mainly shut down, and the swashbucklers who ran them have departed, largely for hedge funds. The Volcker Rule, adopted as part of Dodd-Frank, bars deposit-taking banks from proprietary trading, or making bets on the bank\u2019s own behalf with borrowed or customer money.Now, traders remaining at banks must complete paperwork attesting that when they do take bets, it facilitates or anticipate the needs of a client.Accordingly, the revenue for banks\u2019 trading has shrunk from about $205 billion in the pre-crisis era, to about $160 billion in 2016, according to Morgan Stanley and consulting firm Oliver Wyman.Still, Dodd-Frank called for bank regulators to pass a rule preventing incentive-pay structures that encouraged excessive risk-taking. Last year, Mr. Obama personally urged regulators to finish the rule before his term ended. In April 2016, the six agencies involved delivered a new proposal on incentive pay.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, whose members include the largest broker-dealers, argued the rule was unnecessary, saying existing guidelines and industry practices sufficiently regulated pay practices and allowed a tailored approach for different banks.The rule wasn\u2019t finalized before President Donald Trump took office in January.The Federal Reserve still has the rule on its near-term agenda, but the SEC and two other bank regulators took it off. For the rule to pass, Dodd-Frank called for multiple regulators to jointly adopt the same rule.Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com and Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Bank Pay Quietly Shrinks.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-outlasts-congress-on-banker-pay-but-still-loses-1500847919", "keywords": ["bank capital requirements,banks regulators,securities and exchange commission,wall street compensation,wall street pay,Andrew Hall,Guy Moszkowski,Thomas DiNapoli,Donald Trump,regulation,government policy,management,corporate,industrial news,executive pay,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 18:07:00", "news_title": "Senate Republicans Unsure of What Health-Care Measure They Will Vote On", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Republicans are expected to vote as early as Tuesday to begin debate on their sweeping health-care legislation\u2014but they don\u2019t know yet what measure they will be voting on.Some senators said Majority Leader       Mitch McConnell       (R., Ky.) has told them they would know before the vote whether they would be asked to allow debate on some version of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or legislation that would repeal the ACA with a two-year expiration date.GOP leaders\u2019 current strategy is to lean heavily on lawmakers to at least vote to allow debate on the bill, in the hopes that amendments and other tweaks could yield an agreement.But the plan carries some risk. If the \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d fails, it would mark a defeat for President       Donald Trump       and congressional Republicans, and could end their current efforts to overhaul the ACA, also called Obamacare, a seven-year Republican campaign promise.There has been little evidence that senators who opposed the latest version of the bill earlier this month have reversed course.Sen.       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.), a leading conservative, dismissed the Republican bill Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union as a \u201cporkfest\u201d that bails out insurers. He said he would vote to begin debate as long as there would be an opportunity to vote on a repeal measure.Mr. McConnell\u2019s challenge is that with a narrow 52-48 majority, he can afford to lose no more than two Republican senators, with Vice President       Mike Pence       breaking a 50-50 tie if necessary. Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) announced recently he has brain cancer, and the timing of his return to Congress remains uncertain, making the math even more precarious.Mr. McCain tweeted on Friday that he would \u201csupport whatever health-care plan\u201d Arizona Gov.       Doug Ducey,        a Republican, endorses. Mr. Ducey criticized a version of the GOP health plan in June for not doing enough to help his state\u2019s Medicaid population.Republican leaders are urgently trying to win back defectors among the conservative and centrist wings of their party. Negotiations with centrists like       Shelley Moore Capito       of West Virginia, for example, are focusing largely on possible changes to soften the impact of the bill\u2019s Medicaid cuts, but so far none of the holdouts have announced a change of heart.Sen.       Bob Corker       (R., Tenn.), who supports opening debate, said recently he was concerned about Republican leaders\u2019 moves to appease the reluctant senators.\u201cIt\u2019s feeling like a bazaar, like\u2026. we\u2019re throwing money in a lot of different directions but potentially not moving in a place that\u2019s coherent,\u201d Mr. Corker told reporters recently.Sen.       Susan Collins       (R., Maine) said on Sunday on             CBS\u2019s       Face the Nation that senators had no idea what they would be voting on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good approach to facing legislation that affects millions of people and one-sixth of our economy,\u201d she said, calling for hearings on the bill.Mr. Trump, urging Republicans to unify, tweeted Saturday that \u201cThe Republican Senators must step up to the plate and, after 7 years, vote to Repeal and Replace.\u201dThe president is traveling to West Virginia on Monday with Ms. Capito, but the audience is 40,000 Boy Scouts and it is unclear if he will talk about health care. Republicans say their effort, which aims to cut back on the ACA\u2019s insurance regulations and significantly cut the Medicaid program, would lower premiums and give consumers more choice.Democrats say it would leave many more Americans uninsured. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that under the GOP bill, about 22 million fewer people would have coverage by 2026 relative to the current law, and a repeal bill would leave an estimated 32 million fewer people insured.Democrats are criticizing both the process and the content of the Republican effort, including the fact that no female senators were included in an initial GOP Senate working group, though Mr. McConnell later broadened the conversation to include all 52 Senate Republicans. Three female GOP senators\u2014Ms. Collins, Ms. Capito and       Lisa Murkowski       of Alaska\u2014have since emerged as strong opponents of the repeal-only option.\u201cIt was a pretty stupid thing to just put men in that room. That likely comes with consequences,\u201d said Sen.       Chris Murphy       (D., Conn.).Mr. Murphy noted that the women senators\u2019 resistance matched their constituents\u2019 concerns. \u201cLisa, Susan and Shelley would be your natural opposition to this kind of bill, given the states they come from,\u201d he said.Other GOP women senators noted that not all of them were opposing the procedural motion.\u201cThree out of five. Two of us aren\u2019t,\u201d said Sen. Deb Fischer (R., Neb.), referring to herself and Sen.

He now says that he will build the wall first and figure how to get the money from Mexico later.He understands that he won the presidency partly by making outrageous statements that kept him constantly in the news. But now that the serious business of negotiation on trade is beginning, it appears that much of the craziness has been set aside.Mexico and Canada have agreed to return to the Nafta negotiating table, and most of the objectives outlined in the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s summary, released last week, are aimed not at destroying the 24-year-old pact but modernizing it. In many cases the U.S. is asking to open markets further on a reciprocal basis.One objective is freer trade in agricultural products, which suggests that Canada\u2019s protected dairy and poultry markets will be on the table. The document also says the U.S. will aim for greater ease at the borders by \u201cstreamlining\u201d customs procedures. A specific goal is to raise the value of goods that can enter duty-free in express-mail shipping to $800 from $50. The USTR doesn\u2019t make a big point of it, but this mail would presumably include products made in China.Unfortunately some items on the Trump wish list would take the region backward economically.It\u2019s hardly surprising that the administration has made it a priority to eliminate trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. It has the same wrongheaded obsession globally. But as the Journal explained in a March 10 editorial, \u201cHow to Think About the Trade Deficit,\u201d a current-account deficit\u2014which includes trade\u2014doesn\u2019t matter because it means there is a capital-account surplus. The dollars Americans spend on foreign-produced goods and services eventually must return to the U.S., usually via investments in U.S. assets.Trade deficits with Mexico and Canada are even less relevant. In the introduction to its summary, the USTR claims that \u201ctrade deficits have exploded.\u201d Yet the trade deficit with Nafta partners is less than 13% of the total U.S. trade deficit, while Nafta represents 30% of total U.S. trade. Canada and Mexico are the largest export markets for the U.S., and the trade deficits are nowhere proportional. It is also worth noting that the U.S. has had a surplus in services with Mexico averaging about $9 billion a year over the past three years.On the goods side\u2014despite all the griping about deficits with Mexico and Canada\u2014continental free trade makes U.S. exports more attractive globally. By putting production facilities in all three Nafta countries, American auto manufacturers, for example, can turn out cars and trucks that compete on price and quality all over the world.This reduces the overall U.S. trade deficit. All things being equal, the deficit would go down even more if all markets were further opened to U.S. exports. It follows that the ideal U.S. policy for an administration concerned about trade deficits would be to work to reduce all barriers to trade.In a world of increasingly interconnected commerce supported by free-trade agreements, American protectionists have come to rely heavily on antidumping and countervailing duties. Under Nafta, when exporters are alleged to be selling unfairly\u2014leaning on government subsidies or pricing a product below market to destroy competitors\u2014any of the three countries can apply duties as a remedy.But under Nafta\u2019s Chapter 19, exporters can appeal those duties to an international arbitration panel. The USTR says it wants to eliminate Chapter 19 and instead send disputes to domestic courts. In the U.S. that would be the Court of International Trade, where the Trump administration and its supporters undoubtedly feel American companies could expect a more favorable outcome than at a Nafta panel.Yet this would also mean that when Canada and Mexico slap antidumping duties on American products, exporters will have to go to domestic courts in those countries. The result is likely to be rising protectionism in all three markets and sand in the gears of the integrated North American economy.This can only increase divisions, beyond economics, among the three countries at a time when a strong North American alliance is crucial to U.S. leadership in the hemisphere. Mexico has adopted a welcome human-rights policy by taking a strong position against the Venezuelan dictatorship.

To some degree, that forecast is coming true: Tech giants are working with doctors and hospitals on highly sophisticated devices\u2014automated radiology, supercomputer-based oncology, fitness-tracker-based analytics\u2014to monitor the sick, provide better automated care, and keep people out of hospitals in the first place.But it turns out the biggest gains from mobile medicine will come from deploying it in poor countries across Africa and Asia. In the Third World, mobile health-care tools are a necessity, not a luxury, because treating people depends on diagnosing them at home or wherever they happen to be.All over Africa and Asia there is an underreported boom in portable diagnostic devices taking place, with uncounted new startups emerging to deliver solutions that are both low-cost and scalable. In India, public-sector initiatives such as Accredited Social Health Activist and private groups like Lal Path Labs have started using mobile-phone-centered diagnostic devices, delivered by foot, bicycle and scooter, to connect doctors and patients at temporary testing centers in remote villages with self-employed certified operators.In the process they are gathering enormous amounts of information on patients and their health. Soon the volume of this data may dwarf the hospital records in the West\u2014and it will be even more valuable for evaluating disease because it focuses on identifying illness in patients via mobile phones before they experience severe symptoms.It is difficult to overstate the size of the opportunity for mobile medicine. China, due in part to its poor environmental conditions, has an estimated 700 million people with chronic diseases, and more than three million die prematurely every year, according to the World Health Organization. According to a study by the Cardiological Society of India, the average age for the onset of cardiac illness there is 30\u2014which has led the government of India to classify heart disease as an epidemic. Africa has a half-billion people suffering from various illnesses associated with extreme poverty, such as tuberculosis and gastroenteritis.Leaders in these regions are eager not only to provide health care, but also to discover better methods for delivering it. That\u2019s where the smartphone comes in, since it is already part of daily life in these regions. Last year 60% of global sales revenue for smartphones came from Asia and Africa, and because phone prices are discounted there compared with the West, the actual number of units sold is even greater than the dollar figures suggest.As central as a smartphone is to modern American life, it may be even more so in poor countries. Phones are not only the center of communication, they are used to make payments and run small businesses. Adding devices and applications that provide basic tools for monitoring the user\u2019s health is the obvious next step. This iterative strategy will be a much easier than launching the sophisticated devices Silicon Valley is dreaming up.One type of mobile device that is likely to appear first in the Far East and be widely adopted there is the digital stethoscope. This device is able to detect changes in pitch and soon will be able to detect asthma in children, pneumonia in the elderly, and, in conjunction with low-cost portable electrocardiographs, cardiopulmonary disease.An additional advantage is that this part of the world\u2014particularly India and Africa\u2014has limited regulation, which makes it much easier to launch these kinds of health-care tools. In India and much of Africa, there are few government drug agencies or big insurance companies to throw up barriers.Companies that make medical devices and their accompanying smartphone apps could establish themselves almost overnight. Then, once they have built a large, profitable base of users, they could consider jumping through the legal and regulatory hoops to bring the technology to developed countries. That sequence has worked well for other technology firms. WhatsApp tested its original application in India and quickly attracted more than 160 million active users there.In the end, enormous gains will come from scale. Imagine what could happen once these companies have billions of users on multiple continents. Their algorithms could sift through data on millions upon millions of patients, looking for ways to predict and prevent disease. It\u2019ll be medical artificial intelligence.No doubt Silicon Valley also will come up with elegant mobile medical tools, but only on the heels of more basic ones rolled out abroad. That means entrepreneurs in Bangalore and Beijing will have an early lead.

Ring, ring. The sound was of a machine, not a machine imitating another machine. Phones were physical, big, in different colors and styles. But all were simple, built with pieces human eyes could surmise. You held them like objects with weight.People spilled their guts on them, but they held back too. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cNever mind.\u201d People talked it out, turned it over on the phone. They could cry and it was real, not represented in text or icons. There were answering machines after a while. \u201cPlease leave a message.\u201d \u201cHi.

It was personal. I remember as a child listening to late-night calls my father had with my grandmother. I could only hear his side, of course, but she was telling tales that became famous in our family, myths in our minds. I believe they were so resonant because they were honed via that solitary line of communication.I remember as a teen talking to girls and first boyfriends. \u201cHe likes you.\u201d \u201cDid you hear?\u201d \u201cOh my god.\u201d This was before acronyms and liquid crystal displays, ambient light sensors and touch-screens. There was only sound. You could say \u201cno\u201d and it was a certain kind of no; a \u201cyes\u201d was a certain kind of a yes, too. Listeners understood because they\u2019d, we\u2019d, heard it.It\u2019s not all bad these days.

For entrepreneur Sarah Dillard, it\u2019s to be found when she\u2019s hiking. Tim Hall, a cycling coach, grabs some of it while gazing out at his bird feeder over coffee every morning. The pastor       Jimmy Bartz       encounters it while fly fishing.What they are discovering, as Raymond M. Kethledge and       Michael S. Erwin       report in \u201cLead Yourself First,\u201d is solitude, a vitally necessary but all too scarce commodity for organizational leaders. It\u2019s scarce because, even more than the rest of us, leaders get bombarded 24/7 by attention-demanding memos, tweets, texts, emails, phone calls, videoconferences and hallway button-holings. It\u2019s necessary because only with some alone-time can leaders hope to gain a \u201csense of control\u201d over all that incoming information, as communications officer       Jaya Vadlamudi       tells the authors. Only by herself, she says, can she hope to \u201cwhittle\u201d such stimuli down to the essentials and reach clarity. Or as the Schwab executive Peter Crawford puts it: Solitude makes it possible to engage in the mental equivalent of \u201cstripping away all the cookies on a computer. Once they\u2019re cleared, my mind works better.\u201dAccording to Campbell\u2019s Mr. Conant, solitude is crucial, too, because it allows a leader to get \u201creconnected with [his] values.\u201d Solitude, others say, gives a leader the chance to \u201cpercolate\u201d and \u201cmarinate\u201d in his own \u201cfeelings\u201d and to \u201cstep out of events\u201d and locate the \u201csacred space\u201d where he can reflect on \u201cwhat\u2019s going on inside\u201d himself, thus attaining the moral and emotional conviction necessary to act. Various methods of \u201cself-dialogue\u201d help in this process. Schwab\u2019s Mr. Crawford uses his solitary time to write \u201cmemos to himself.\u201d Co-author Michael Erwin devotes his long runs to \u201cengag[ing] in a lot of self-talk\u201d: It\u2019s \u201ccheaper than therapy,\u201d he adds. The authors cite       Henry David Thoreau,        wandering alone at Walden Pond, as a model for all of this reflective, restorative solitude.By Raymond M. Kethledge and Michael S. Erwin  Bloomsbury, 214 pages, $27\u201cLead Yourself First\u201d makes a compelling argument for the integral relationship between solitude and leadership\u2014except for one thing. In his \u201cWalden\u201d chapter on solitude, Thoreau doesn\u2019t spend much time rhapsodizing about meandering through nature alone and unbothered by others, as the book\u2019s CEOs do. Instead, he rhapsodizes about remaining inside his house, trapped there by the pouring rain, while feeling \u201cnever alone\u201d but rather constantly in the presence of \u201ca great deal of company\u201d and engaging in long imaginary conversations with, for example, a previous owner and a lusty woman. Thoreau used solitude not to engage in a dialogue with himself but to enter into dialogue with others.And here is where \u201cLead Yourself First\u201d gets truly, if perhaps not always intentionally, interesting. Interspersed among its testimonials to contemporary organizational leaders and their uses of solitude are short chapters on famous leaders\u2014Lawrence of Arabia, for instance, and       Aung San Suu Kyi,        the Burmese dissident and future government minister. Such figures, the authors suggest, found solitude essential in much the same way as the organizational chiefs do. But in fact there are some important differences.For one thing, key moments of solitude did not fall upon great leaders at the times they determined. They didn\u2019t carve out 90 minutes alone every day by asking their assistants to \u201cstructure [it] in\u201d to their daily schedule, as Endgame CEO Nate Fick does, or take time away from their hectic schedules to wander the great outdoors, as more than one of Messrs. Kethledge and Erwin\u2019s subjects do.Instead solitude came unbidden, dictated by events. Think of Ms. Aung San\u2019s long periods of house arrest. Or the 10-day spell of dysentery that confined T.E. Lawrence to a tent. Far from taking that time to step outside events and reflect on his values, Lawrence used solitude to zero in on something pragmatic: seizing control of events by cutting Turkish rail lines in Arabia. Even though such leaders might have been confined to a physical space, they did not spend much time there exploring their own mental spaces, as far as we know.Nor, often, did they spend their \u201csolitude\u201d alone. Sometimes others were literally present. The authors recount how       Dwight Eisenhower       stared out the window into the pelting rain for several spellbinding minutes, in the company of his subordinates, before deciding to give the order for D-Day. In other cases, great leaders mentally populated the space around them with imagined others, as Thoreau did.       Martin Luther King Jr.      , in the solitude of his own kitchen on a crucial January night in Montgomery in 1956, felt keenly, he later recalled, that he was \u201cnever alone.\u201dLincoln, the authors report, used solitude to write a letter to Gen.       George Meade       chastising him for failing to pursue Lee after the victory at Gettysburg\u2014but never sent it. Instead, Lincoln in effect began an inner dialogue with Meade and so came to appreciate the burdens Meade\u2019s soldiers would have to bear in destroying Lee\u2019s army. Lincoln, alone, did not whittle down the information available to gain control over it. Instead he steeped himself in the positions of others to fully understand them.Certainly the everyday leaders in \u201cLead Yourself First\u201d are to be admired. Among the figures presented in the book none is more inspiring than Tommy Caldwell, a mountain climber who\u2014after accidentally dropping his nattering cellphone thousands of feet into a chasm\u2014found the quiet he needed to focus on helping his less experienced mate climb Yosemite\u2019s Dawn Wall. And       Joey Reiman,        the founder of BrightHouse, a consulting firm that advises companies on how to cure \u201csociety\u2019s ills,\u201d committed himself to that goal after a long hospital stay following a near-fatal car accident.The respect they command is itself no accident. Their experiences\u2014in which solitude came on unplanned and moved them to look outward to others\u2014are the closest to those of the great leaders the book discusses. Thoreau had it right.Mr. Stark is the author of \u201cThe Consolations of Mortality: Making Sense of Death.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-leaders-need-solitude-1500845494", "keywords": ["book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews,food,beverages,tobacco,food preserving,speciality foods,consumer goods,food products"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 17:30:00", "news_title": "Britain Is Committed to Brexit and Free Trade", "content": "The principles of free trade have underpinned the institutions, rules and alliances that rebuilt the postwar world. They facilitated the fall of Soviet communism. They ushered in 70 years of global prosperity, raising the living standards of hundreds of millions of people. As the United Kingdom looks ahead to a new era of trade and a future outside the European Union, we\u2019ll be strengthening ties around the world\u2014especially with our top trading partner and greatest ally, the U.S.The British government has set up working groups and high-level dialogues in 10 countries that are key trade partners. Our goal is to explore the best ways of improving our trade and investment relationships. On Monday, I will visit my American counterpart, U.S. Trade Representative       Robert Lighthizer,        for the first meeting of the U.S.-U.K. trade and investment working group. We have two main aims. First, to give businesses on both sides of the Atlantic certainty and confidence. Second, to provide commercial continuity as the U.K. charts a course outside the EU.The U.K. is prohibited from signing any formal free-trade agreement while we retain EU membership, but we are laying the groundwork for a potential deal with our closest international partners, identifying areas where we could broaden cooperation and remove barriers to trade.American politicians and business leaders sometimes ask me whether the U.K.\u2019s recent general election has affected our approach to Brexit, or whether there is any chance the U.K. might change its mind and stay in the EU. No. The government\u2019s approach has not changed. The plan to leave the EU that we originally set out is in our national interest. Brexit is going ahead. The democratic choice has been made.In the June election, more than 80% of voters backed one of the parties that supports Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. The Conservative Party, through our agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party, has secured a legislative majority to provide stable government, uphold the democratic will of the British people, and deliver Brexit.I believe this offers an unprecedented opportunity for the U.K. If we want to protect jobs and prosperity and watch British businesses expand, we need to engage with the overseas markets that hold the greatest potential. The EU itself estimates that 90% of global growth in the next decade will come from outside Europe. As one of the world\u2019s largest economies, the U.K. has the chance to work with old and new partners to build a truly global Britain at the heart of international trade.The strength of our trade and investment relationship with the U.S. is clear. Exports to the U.K. last year totaled $555 million from Alabama alone, and $3.5 billion from Washington state. Such exports supported 1,400 jobs in Alaska and 53,000 in Texas, which I will visit at the end of this week. Together the U.S. and U.K. have around $1 trillion invested in each other\u2019s economies, and this strong trading relationship supports more than one million jobs in both countries.The fundamentals of the U.K. economy are strong, providing a solid platform on which to build new trading links. We have reduced the deficit by nearly 75% and cut taxes for millions of working people, and the unemployment rate remains low. The U.K. was the second-fastest-growing economy in the Group of Seven last year. A PricewaterhouseCoopersreport from February projects that Britain will hold the G-7 growth title until 2050, outstripping Germany, France and Italy.The U.K. has long been one of the best places in the world to invest, with regulatory stability, a strong rule of law, and a low-tax, high-skilled economy. So it\u2019s no surprise that Britain has attracted a range of businesses, from Google and             Facebook                   to             Pfizer.I am committed to securing the best possible global trading framework for the U.K. It is a source of great personal pride to lead the Department for International Trade, tasked with upholding Britain\u2019s centuries-long tradition of advocating free trade and commerce. In that spirit, I look forward to working together with our American allies to deepen a relationship based upon not only our shared values of freedom and democracy, but our shared history, culture and economic success.At times the U.K. and the U.S. can seem very different, yet we are nations built upon a common foundation.

While legislation could help, all that really is needed for the marketplaces to succeed is for the       Trump       administration to do no harm. This means continuing to implement the law without actively undermining it.The health-care marketplaces are stabilizing on their own now that insurers have made a one-time adjustment to bring premiums in line with claims costs. In 2014, when the marketplaces first opened for business, insurance companies generally underpriced their offerings. Since then states like Arizona, which had some of the lowest prices to start, have seen the largest premium increases. States like Ohio, where initial offerings were more accurately priced, have seen more-moderate increases. Overall, premiums in 2017 are within 1% of the projections made by the Congressional Budget Office in 2009.President Trump and other critics argue the marketplaces are entering a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d\u2014that is, a vicious circle of rising premiums and an increasingly sicker pool of enrollees. But nothing remotely close to that has happened, largely because more than 80% of marketplace enrollees receive a subsidy that covers premium increases, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Enrollment changes have been about the same, on average, in states with large premium increases and states with flat or declining premiums. This follows several years in which the risk pool has remained stable or even improved, as proven by claims costs, young adults\u2019 share of marketplace enrollment, and risk scores.Several insurers have withdrawn from some markets\u2014or the marketplaces entirely\u2014but there remains a powerful incentive for insurers to stay or return. The amount insurance companies spend on health costs relative to premium revenue, known as the medical-loss ratio, has fallen sharply in 2017, according to a recent analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. This suggests insurers are becoming more financially secure. The return to sustainable pricing means more insurers will want to enter the marketplaces, expanding competition and choice for consumers.Congress should have a simple test before considering any reforms to the current system. At a minimum, the changes shouldn\u2019t increase the number of uninsured or the budget deficit, and they shouldn\u2019t make health insurance pricier for broad groups of Americans.Some sensible reforms have already been offered. Republican Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine has supported establishing a system that would reimburse health insurers for large losses from very sick enrollees. House Democrats have suggested targeted subsidy increases to increase affordability. A public option in parts of the country without sufficient competition would also help. I recommend strengthening the individual mandate by increasing the penalty for going without coverage, though neither party seems likely to consider the idea. While even the less controversial proposals may not be viable in Congress, they aren\u2019t the difference between the marketplaces surviving or dying.Contrary to the president\u2019s apocalyptic rhetoric\u2014or even the fears of some Affordable Care Act supporters\u2014the law is holding up. How exactly can Mr. Trump do no harm? The administration should ensure that insurance companies continue to be reimbursed for the cost-sharing subsidies they provide for households with incomes up to 250% of the federal poverty line, which is about $60,000 for a family of four. The president should also order his subordinates to continue enforcing the individual mandate and to avoid making large, abrupt changes to the marketplaces.The \u201cdo no harm\u201d principle extends beyond the individual market, where about 1 in 6 Americans get their health care, according to the Census Bureau. To cut cost growth and improve quality, the administration will have to use other tools\u2014many of them bipartisan\u2014that have been created by Congress in recent years. These include delivery-system reforms in Medicare, which shift to payment models that reimburse providers based on outcomes and quality rather than inputs and quantity. A Republican Congress under the leadership of Speaker       John Boehner       already expanded these reforms after they were originally passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. The \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d which encourages insurance companies not to offer overly expensive care, should also stay. Neither of these policies requires congressional action. The administration simply has to implement the law as written.In \u201c      King Lear,       \u201d the Duke of Albany warned that in \u201cstriving to better, oft we mar what\u2019s well.\u201d When it comes to health-care reform, not heeding the Bard\u2019s words could lead to a real-life tragedy.Mr. Furman, a professor of practice at the Harvard Kennedy School, was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, 2013-17.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-wont-end-obamacare-so-heres-how-to-mend-it-1500845348", "keywords": [" congress, exchanges, fix, health care, insurance, marketplaces, mend,obamacare, repeal and replace,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,commentaries,opinions,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 17:28:00", "news_title": "If You\u2019re Arrested Abroad, the U.S. May Not Bail You Out", "content": "I represent two Americans,       Siamak Namazi       and his father, Baquer, being held in deplorable conditions in Iran\u2019s Evin Prison. Last October they were sentenced to 10 years on sham charges of \u201ccollaboration with a hostile government,\u201d namely the U.S. In a statement Friday, the White House demanded their freedom: \u201cPresident Trump is prepared to impose new and serious consequences on Iran unless all unjustly imprisoned American citizens are released and returned.\u201d In June the administration arranged for       Otto Warmbier       to be brought home after nearly 18 months in a North Korean camp. He died shortly after returning to the U.S.Americans need to appreciate they are highly vulnerable to arbitrary detention abroad\u2014and not just in countries like Iran and North Korea. I say this from experience, as a lawyer who has represented not only the Namazis but also U.S. citizens wrongfully imprisoned in such countries as China, Cuba, Myanmar and Nicaragua. Each year more than 70 million Americans travel abroad. Several thousand are arrested annually. The State Department estimates more than 3,000 are imprisoned, some 100 of whom, two officials told me on condition of anonymity, are hostages of rogue states and terrorist groups.Many Americans believe if they get into trouble the U.S. government will rescue them. In most cases it won\u2019t. Those who are detained typically get a list of local lawyers and visits from consular staff every one to three months. Buried on its website, the State Department explicitly advises it \u201ccannot get U.S. citizens out of jail.\u201d Still, more can be done to help Americans imprisoned abroad.First, Mr. Trump should direct the State Department to evaluate individually the case of every imprisoned American to determine privately whether he is likely to have been arbitrarily detained. This need not be a complex legal evaluation, but rather a simple application of international law to the facts of each case.This review is critical. Many of the imprisoned did break local laws, and the U.S. Privacy Act prohibits government agencies from releasing information that might enable human-rights groups or the media to conduct independent evaluations. That\u2019s why the State Department must determine internally which Americans are unfairly imprisoned and then provide diplomatic and political support to push for their freedom.Second, Congress should require, every three months, that the State Department provide lawmakers a private list of Americans believed to be imprisoned wrongly abroad, including suggested steps to assist them. In opposing such a bill previously, the department argued in a memo to Congress: \u201cThe idea that we would distinguish among U.S. citizens as more or less \u2018deserving\u2019 of our support contradicts the fact that all U.S. citizens deserve our best efforts.\u201d Yes, Americans deserve consular support without distinction, but those who are wrongly detained merit special attention. Lawmakers should encourage the State Department to provide it. They should not, however, prescribe or require specific action, because these cases require specialized support based on the facts of each case.Third, the government needs an integrated approach. In 2015 President       Obama       issued a directive that created a special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, a position Mr. Trump should fill soon. But the administration also needs to identify and assist other wrongly detained Americans. It needs to enhance deterrence, to go beyond saying it has a \u201cno concessions\u201d policy, and to consider coercive measures such as suspending foreign aid and imposing targeted sanctions against governments, organizations and individuals responsible for holding U.S. citizens unfairly.Fourth, the State Department should do a better job educating Americans as to the dangers of traveling abroad. That wouldn\u2019t help dual nationals like the Namazis, visiting family or friends. But a warning could help others avoid trouble. Every passport should come with a letter emphasizing the government\u2019s limited ability to recover wrongfully imprisoned citizens, listing countries that have taken American hostages, and noting that U.S. citizens traveling abroad are wholly outside the protection of the Constitution and must follow local laws.Even with these measures, securing the release of wrongfully imprisoned Americans will remain difficult. But perhaps high-profile hostage cases like those of the Namazis and Warmbier will focus the government on fulfilling one of its most basic duties: protecting its citizens when they most desperately need help.Mr. Genser is founder of Freedom Now.Appeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-youre-arrested-abroad-the-u-s-may-not-bail-you-out-1500845301", "keywords": [" abroad, imprisoned, iran, north korea, otto warmbier,siamak nimazi, state department, travel,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,state department,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 17:27:00", "news_title": "Force Congress\u2019s Hand on Health Care", "content": "If President       Trump       is serious about repealing ObamaCare\u2014about delivering a better policy with more choice and lower costs\u2014there\u2019s a simple move he could make that wouldn\u2019t require congressional approval. It would align the interests of lawmakers and their staffers with the interests of voters.Congress is essentially unaffected by the high costs of the ObamaCare exchanges because of a special exemption crafted under the Obama administration. The Affordable Care Act required members of Congress and their employees to participate in the health-insurance exchanges it established. They should have lost the generous coverage they had in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program and instead bought one of the government-mandated options offered on the ACA exchanges.In late 2012, staffers and members figured out what was about to happen and begged the Obama administration for relief. Just as Congress was going into its August recess in 2013, the Office of Personnel Management ratified the fiction that the House and Senate each have fewer than 50 employees, and thus qualify as \u201csmall businesses.\u201d That enabled OPM to establish a system of special subsidies and exemptions, sparing Congress the embarrassment of a self-serving vote.Many staffers are exempted and allowed to remain on their old insurance plans. Members of Congress and their designated \u201cofficial office\u201d staff are insured through the District of Columbia\u2019s small business exchange\u2014but they receive a one-of-a-kind subsidy from their employer (taxpayers) of up to $12,000, or about 70% of their premiums.All that would be illegal for anyone else. In fact, it\u2019s illegal for Congress too. But since it was established administratively, it can be ended the same way. The president should announce that he is instructing OPM to end the exemption and subsidies for Congress.This is smart politics. One poll found 94% of voters opposed the special deal for Congress. It would also lead to smart policy: Any continued failure to reform health care means members of Congress and their staff would suffer under the current system. If the president does this, he\u2019d have huge negotiating leverage. He would align the interests of the ruling class with those of his voters, forcing Congress to act.

If so it isn\u2019t obvious, and its recent decisions suggest that the White House may be willing to accommodate the Russian and Iranian goal of propping up       Bashar Assad       for the long term.Last week the Administration disclosed that it has stopped assisting the anti-Assad Sunni Arab fighters whom the CIA has trained, equipped and funded since 2013. U.S. Special Operations Command chief Gen.       Raymond Thomas       told the Aspen Security Forum Friday that the decision to pull the plug was \u201cbased on an assessment of the nature of the program and what we are trying to accomplish and the viability of it going forward.\u201dThat might make sense if anyone knew what the U.S. is trying to accomplish beyond ousting Islamic State from Raqqa in northern Syria. In that fight the Pentagon has resisted Russia and Iran by arming the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces and shooting down the Syria aircraft threatening them. Mr. Trump also launched cruise missiles to punish Mr. Assad after the strongman used chemical weapons.The muddle is what the U.S. wants in Syria after the looming defeat of Islamic State. On that score the Trump Administration seems to want to find some agreement with Russia to stabilize Syria even if that means entrenching Mr. Assad and the Russian and Iranian military presence.Cutting off the Sunni Free Syrian Army has long been a Russian and Iranian goal. FSA fighters in southern Syria have helped to contain the more radical Sunni opposition formerly known as the Nusra Front and they\u2019ve fought Islamic State, but they also want to depose Mr. Assad. Not all of the Sunni rebels are as moderate as we\u2019d like, but they aren\u2019t al Qaeda or Islamic State. The arms cutoff caught the rebels by surprise and will make our allies in the region further doubt American reliability.This follows the deal Mr. Trump struck at the G-20 meeting with       Vladimir Putin       for a cease-fire in southern Syria near its border with Israel and Jordan. Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       hailed it as a potential precedent for other parts of Syria, and Administration sources advertised that Israel and Jordan were on board.But we later learned that Israel is far more skeptical. Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu       told a recent cabinet meeting that \u201cIsrael will welcome a genuine cease-fire in Syria, but this cease-fire must not enable the establishment of a military presence by Iran and its proxies in Syria in general and in southern Syria in particular.\u201dYet by this point any territory controlled by Mr. Assad will come with Iranian military tentacles. Iran\u2019s Hezbollah footsoldiers from Lebanon helped rescue Mr. Assad\u2019s military, and they\u2019d love to open another frontline against the Jewish state.President Trump and Mr. Tillerson may want to negotiate a diplomatic settlement with Mr. Putin on Syria, and no doubt the Russian is pitching his \u201ccommon front\u201d line against radical Islamists. But CIA Director       Mike Pompeo       told the Aspen forum on Friday that Russia has done little fighting against Islamic State. Mr. Putin also has no incentive to give ground in Syria while his side is winning.Russia and Iran know what they want in Syria: a reunified country under Mr. Assad\u2019s control. Iran will then get another Arab city\u2014Damascus\u2014under its dominion. It will have another base from which to undermine U.S. allies in Jordan and attack Israel when the next war breaks out. Russia wants to show the world that its allies always win while keeping its air base and a Mediterranean port.None of this is in the U.S. interest. The only way to reach an acceptable diplomatic solution is if Iran and Russia feel they are paying too large a price for their Syrian sojourn. This means more support for Mr. Assad\u2019s enemies, not cutting them off without notice. And it means building up a Middle East coalition willing to fight Islamic State and resist Iran. The U.S. should also consider enforcing \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria for anti-Assad forces.It\u2019s hard to imagine a stable Syria as long as Mr. Assad is in power. But if he stays, then the U.S. goal should be a divided country with safe areas for Sunnis and the Kurds who have helped liberate Raqqa. Then we can perhaps tolerate an Assad government that presides over a rump Syria dominated by Alawites. But none of that will happen if the U.S. abandons its allies to the Russia-Assad-Iran axis. And if abandoning Syria to Iran is the policy, then at least own up to it in public so everyone knows the score.Appeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-syria-muddle-1500845200", "keywords": ["Bashar Assad,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 17:25:00", "news_title": "Randi Weingarten\u2019s \u2018Racism\u2019 Rant", "content": "Betsy DeVos       must be doing something right.

It\u2019s that citizens are beginning to see that the public money the unions increasingly demand is more likely to go into pensions than the classroom. And access to excellent schools increasingly depends on a good zip code.Ms. Weingarten tries to taint the push for choice by tracing it to attempts in some parts of the country to evade the integration demanded by Brown v. Board of Education. There\u2019s a reason Ms. Weingarten spends most of her time on the bad old days. This is because it\u2019s much harder to defend the academic resegregation of today.Before last year\u2019s anniversary of Brown, for example, the Government Accountability Office released a study showing resegregation is on the rise, with more and more of America\u2019s poor black and Latino children in schools where they are the majority. Many of these are failing schools. Yet as she made clear in her speech, Ms. Weingarten and her union will fight to their dying breath to keep these children there rather than give them the opportunity of a better education through a charter public school or a voucher for a private or parochial school.We hope Secretary DeVos takes away from Ms. Weingarten\u2019s speech the message that so brittle is the teachers union monopoly that today it fears her even talking about choice.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/randi-weingartens-racism-rant-1500845156", "keywords": [" american federation of teachers, betsy devos, charter schools, education department,randi weingarten, school choice, teachers union, vouchers,Randi Weingarten,political,general news,education,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 17:24:00", "news_title": "Westchester Beats Obama", "content": "Westchester County Chief Executive       Rob Astorino       spent seven years fighting Obama-era Department of Housing and Urban Development accusations that his county\u2019s zoning laws are racist. Now HUD has conceded that the suburban New Yorker was right all along.In a one-paragraph memo sent to Westchester recently, HUD Regional Director       Jay Golden       accepted the county\u2019s latest report demonstrating that local zoning laws are race-neutral. Westchester was required to produce this \u201canalysis of impediments\u201d to housing as part of a 2009 legal settlement between Mr. Astorino\u2019s Democratic predecessor,       Andrew Spano,        and a liberal activist group.Mr. Astorino called HUD\u2019s memo a \u201cvindication,\u201d and it is\u2014not least because Westchester demonstrated as early as 2010 that the county didn\u2019t have racially exclusionary zoning practices. Westchester\u2019s residents live where they want and can afford to live. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses (the most recent available), the county\u2019s African-American and Hispanic populations rose 56%.The Obama Administration had a larger social and political agenda, which was to use federal anti-discrimination law as a battering ram to rewrite local zoning laws. Westchester would be the model for the rest of the country, and as a Republican Mr. Astorino was an ideal foil to portray as a racist and then point to as a precedent to force racial housing quotas on neighborhoods across America.As part of the settlement implementation, the agency deemed standard zoning, such as building heights or sewer placement to protect drinking water, as \u201crestrictive practices\u201d that the feds wanted to change. Westchester balked, recognizing the move as a federal takeover of local policy. The agency also ignored that Mr. Astorino exceeded the 2009 settlement\u2019s mandate to facilitate the construction of 750 housing units in 31 mostly white communities over seven years.Mr. Astorino fought back in court, producing 11 reports about the county\u2019s zoning practices. The agency responded by withholding $23.4 million in development money meant for Westchester\u2019s poorest communities over four years. New York Governor       Andrew Cuomo       used the dispute to portray the Republican as hostile to minorities when Mr. Astorino ran against the Democrat in 2014.Now Mr. Astorino looks like a hero to Westchester residents who have already forked out $81.6 million for land acquisition and construction costs for the new housing, plus the $172 million contributed by state and federal taxpayers.The misuse of federal regulatory enforcement to impose its liberal policy preferences was one of the worst excesses of the Obama Administration.

Dont\u00e9 Hickman, the recent spurt of violence in his church\u2019s East Baltimore neighborhood\u2014where six people have been killed since April\u2014is disheartening.\u201cWe thought we ended the fires that were burning, but those fires have turned into gunfire,\u201d he said, referring to riots after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray from injuries the 25-year-old man sustained in police custody.While Chicago gets more attention as being the center of urban crime in the U.S., Baltimore has long had a higher rate of homicide, and near-daily killings in 2017 have produced a nearly 20% increase in homicides from a year ago. With 193 homicides in a city of 615,000 people, Baltimore is on track for its highest per capita homicide rate on record and one of the highest in the U.S. in years.Other cities like New Orleans and Philadelphia are also contending with double-digit percentage surges in homicides. In Charlotte, N.C., homicides are up about 70%. After soaring last year, killings in Chicago are running 5% higher.\u201cWe still see homicide numbers that are well beyond what they were even four years ago in a number of our cities,\u201d said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents police chiefs from the nation\u2019s largest cities. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to go back to the days of the \u201990s with the levels of violence we had.\u201dThis year is the third in a row with elevated violent-crime levels in a number of U.S. cities, though not all have experienced consistently high murder counts and violent crime nationwide remains well below 1990s levels, said University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist Richard Rosenfeld. Both New York and Los Angeles have fewer homicides than Baltimore despite having several times its population.\u201cBaltimore has always been in the top tier of cities when it comes to lethal violence, but the surge especially this year is quite worrisome,\u201d he said. \u201cBaltimore is an extreme example of what I think is a broader problem.\u201dThe spree in Baltimore, which police say is fueled partly by gang warfare over drug turf, has sparked a tense debate among officials about how to tamp down the violence. Maryland Gov.       Larry Hogan,        who deployed National Guard troops to Baltimore to quell the April 2015 riots, has had pointed words for police, prosecutors and judges.\u201cWe\u2019re not doing as many arrests as we used to, and the ones that are getting arrested are not being prosecuted by the state\u2019s attorney,\u201d the Republican governor said in a recent radio interview. \u201cThe ones the prosecutors do take, the court system is not giving them the time that they should get\u2014they\u2019re letting them back on the streets to commit crimes again.\u201dBaltimore\u2019s chief prosecutor, State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, a Democrat, defended her office\u2019s record. She said prosecutors work closely with police in her office\u2019s gun-violence enforcement division and seek the strongest sentences possible in cases involving violence.Police Commissioner Kevin Davis, echoed by Mayor Catherine Pugh, has called on judges to give tougher sentences for gun crimes. The police department analyzed 605 gun-related convictions since the beginning of 2016 and found 56% of defendants had more than half their prison sentence suspended\u2014meaning they wouldn\u2019t have to serve that time if they meet probation requirements.The original sentences in the 339 cases averaged six years. Many of the convictions were for possessing a handgun without a state-issued license or carry permit, or for being a felon illegally possessing a firearm.\u201cThey\u2019re emboldened because they\u2019re not being held accountable for the crimes they commit,\u201d Mr. Davis said of gun offenders.A spokesman for the judiciary didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the analysis but said sentences are guided by many factors, including appeals court rulings and the Constitution.Mayor Pugh, a Democrat who took office in December, is pushing for a mandatory one-year sentence for illegal handgun possession within 100 yards of a school, church, park, public building or other public place of assembly\u2014a description that would cover much of the city. The proposal has drawn criticism from some City Council members who question whether it would deter criminals.Meanwhile, gun arrests in Baltimore are down roughly 30% from last year. Mr. Davis points to his decision to dismantle a centralized gun unit after seven officers were federally charged with racketeering.\u201cThe simple fact is we\u2019re not arresting people with guns, we don\u2019t have as many gun arrests,\u201d said City Councilman Brandon Scott.Gene Ryan, president of the local Fraternal Order of Police union, said one factor is hesitancy by officers who remain disillusioned by the prosecution of their six colleagues who were criminally charged in Mr. Gray\u2019s death. None of the six were convicted. Mr. Gray didn\u2019t have a gun when he was arrested for alleged illegal knife possession.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly in the officers\u2019 minds: Could I wind up being charged and being put in jail for doing my job?\u201d Mr. Ryan said.He also said police are short-staffed, with less time for proactive policing. The department had about 2,500 sworn officers in late 2016, down from nearly 3,000 in 2012.Overall arrests in Baltimore are down by about one-third since 2015, a trend that emerged after the six officers were charged and has continued into 2017.Daniel Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Bloomberg School of Public Health who works closely with the Baltimore Police Department, said the public expects police to be \u201cmiracle workers.\u201d\u201cYou have a police force that is responding with fewer resources, less community trust and an epidemic of opioid addiction, and all of that is sort of landing in their lap,\u201d he said.Hanging over the debate is a court-enforced process to overhaul the Baltimore Police Department. The city and federal government agreed to a consent decree in January after a scathing Justice Department report alleged longstanding unconstitutional practices. An independent monitor hasn\u2019t yet been chosen to manage the overhaul, which a federal judge will oversee.For Mr. Hickman of Southern Baptist Church, guns are only part of the problem. \u201cIf the underlying issue is fear, and poverty, then we need to provide safety and we need to provide economic empowerment,\u201d he said.Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/baltimore-homicide-rate-has-officials-pointing-fingers-1500807605", "keywords": ["political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,murder,manslaughter,criminal enterprises,risk news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 16:12:00", "news_title": "Thor, Justice League Battle It Out for \u2018Likes\u2019 at Comic-Con ", "content": "SAN DIEGO\u2014The Justice League and Thor were locked in a tight battle for fan attention Sunday as Comic-Con International wrapped up here.People online were discussing \u201cJustice League,\u201d from             Time Warner Inc.\u2019s        TWX 1.84%       Warner Bros., and \u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d from             Walt Disney Co.\u2019s        DIS 0.49%       Marvel Studios, more than any other movies or television shows hyped at the world\u2019s biggest pop-culture convention, a four-day event that started Thursday.Both companies debuted new trailers and brought their films\u2019 stars in front of packed crowds in a hall at the San Diego Convention Center that holds 6,500 people, many of whom camped out overnight to snag a seat.\u201cJustice League,\u201d whose cast includes       Ben Affleck       as Batman,       Gal Gadot       as Wonder Woman, and       Jason Momoa       from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as Aquaman, had racked up 10.3 million social-media engagements, including likes and shares, by midday Sunday, according to research company ListenFirst Media.\u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d which stars       Chris Hemsworth       in the title role and       Mark Ruffalo       as the Hulk, garnered 8.8 million.However, Marvel\u2019s panel was held Saturday evening, while Warner\u2019s was Saturday morning, giving \u201cJustice League\u201d more time to grab fans\u2019 attention. \u201cThor\u201d was catching up in social-media numbers by Sunday and could ultimately end up No. 1, said a ListenFirst spokeswoman.The two movies will be released in November, so their competition for fan attention presages what could be one of the year\u2019 most brutal box-office battles.The studios both emphasized humor alongside action in promoting their films.

In recent years, the event has become even more important as a springboard for generating excitement on social media. Many new trailers and other materials debut at Comic-Con and are then quickly released online.This year, some of most popular experiences of Comic-Con weren\u2019t at the actual convention but in downtown San Diego, where networks and studios set up elaborate and immersive showcases for fans. The most popular, with lines exceeding three hours, was a virtual reality game and recreated city block from Alcon Entertainment\u2019s upcoming \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d But the sequel, which was also part of the Comic-Con presentation of its distributor, Warner Bros., was only the fifth most talked-about movie online, according to ListenFirst, with 1.9 million engagements.Write to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thor-justice-league-battle-it-out-for-likes-at-comic-con-1500840728", "keywords": [" blade runner,comic-con, game of thrones, hulk,justice league,ragnarok, superheroes, thor, warner bros,wonder woman,Time Warner,TWX,Walt Disney,DIS,Ben Affleck,Chris Hemsworth,Jason Momoa,Mark Ruffalo,Gal Gadot,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,online service providers,media,social media platforms,tools,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 15:00:00", "news_title": "Global Economy Week Ahead: U.K., U.S. GDP and Federal Reserve Meeting", "content": "The last week of July will see preliminary second-quarter gross-domestic-product figures for the U.K. and U.S. On the central banking front, the Federal Reserve will meet, with a policy statement scheduled for release on Wednesday.Monday: A survey of purchasing managers at businesses across the eurozone is expected to show that the currency area\u2019s economy continued to grow at a robust pace at the start of the third quarter.

But either way, he feels his show has a powerful and relevant story to tell.\u201cA Wall Apart\u201d is about three brothers living between East and West Berlin during the Berlin Wall era of the \u201860s through the \u201880s. The idea for the show came well before President       Donald Trump\u2019s       talk of a border wall separating Mexico and the United States, so Mr. Russell doesn\u2019t claim that was part of the inspiration.But now that the musical is being readied for its debut, the timeliness is hard to ignore, say those involved with the production. \u201cThe story feels incredibly resonant right now,\u201d said NYMF Producing Artistic Director       Rachel Sussman.The back story behind \u201cA Wall Apart\u201d is also quite the tale, one that involves creative types well beyond the New York theater community.Sam Goldstein,        a neuropsychologist with a second career as a screenwriter, largely spearheaded the development of the show. With his writing partner       Craig Clyde,        he had been looking to create the book for a musical about a historical event. As he said, \u201cNo. 1 on my list was the Berlin Wall.\u201dWhat led him to Mr. Russell? The two knew each other through a musical connection\u2014Mr. Goldstein has also played in rock bands\u2014and they both live in Utah. So, an artistic partnership soon evolved, with work on the musical starting in 2015.Mr. Russell says the songs came quickly to him during the show\u2019s gestation, adding that he especially liked the fact the musical allowed him to step out of his musical comfort zone.\u201cI found it very exciting to write grungy, raw guitar-driven songs,\u201d he said. \u201cAir Supply couldn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe goal is to eventually take \u201cA Wall Apart,\u201d which was developed in partnership with NewYorkRep, a theater company in the city, to a bigger stage, with Broadway remaining a goal. Mr. Goldstein says about $200,000 has been invested in the show to date, though he declined to reveal who is putting up the money.In the meantime, Mr. Russell is featuring some songs from the show at Air Supply concerts, which means \u201cA Wall Apart\u201d might already be finding a sizable audience. The rock group does about 130 dates a year.Mr. Russell adds that he isn\u2019t quite ready to give up his day job, despite his renewed footing in the musical-theater world.\u201cPerformers love to perform,\u201d he said.Write to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/another-rock-star-hopes-to-crack-the-code-for-theatrical-success-1500836199", "keywords": ["air supply,a wall apart,berlin wall,broadway,musical festival,new york musical festival,theatre row,Acorn Theatre,Graham Russell,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,theater"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 14:37:00", "news_title": "Sag Harbor Residents Try Preservation Push to Thwart \u2018Mega-Mansions\u2019", "content": "SAG HARBOR, N.Y.\u2014As       Ren\u00e9e Simons       drives through a patch of the Hamptons that has drawn black families for generations, she points with pride at modest homes that once hosted such luminaries as singer       Lena Horne       and poet       Langston Hughes.But Ms. Simons shakes her head when she sees construction equipment.

He helped marshal the subsequent spate of state litigation and then the talks that led to a $246 billion settlement.Now Mr. Moore is a private attorney encouraging states to sue pharmaceutical companies, alleging they helped spark an addiction crisis by misrepresenting the benefits and addiction risks of opioid painkillers.Mr. Moore pressed Mississippi and Ohio to sue drugmakers and is helping them with the suits they have since filed. The affable 65-year-old is tapping coalition-building skills he honed in the tobacco litigation to urge other states to sue, too. Recently two additional states, Missouri and Oklahoma, filed suits.\u201cWhen he\u2019s motivated, you don\u2019t want to be on the other side,\u201d said       James Tierney,        a former Maine attorney general who later worked with Mr. Moore during the tobacco wars.Mr. Moore is among many tort lawyers flocking to help government bodies seek damages from makers of opioid painkillers. More than a dozen cities and counties are suing, in addition to the four states, assisted by outside attorneys who include       Paul Hanly Jr.       of Alton, Ill.-based Simmons Hanly Conroy LLC and       Linda Singer       and       Joe Rice       of Motley Rice LLC, based in Mount Pleasant, S.C.Like Mr. Moore, Mr. Rice has strong ties to the tobacco litigation, having been outside counsel to two dozen states and a lead negotiator in the settlement talks. Mr. Rice said he expects attorneys helping with opioid litigation to stay in close touch with each other, just as in the tobacco suits. In many cases they stand to win up to 25% of settlements or judgments.Government bodies\u2019 use of outside lawyers to sue for damages is criticized by the suits\u2019 targets and by some conservative voices in the legal profession, who say the states are improperly outsourcing law-enforcement powers to firms that have a profit motive.In New Hampshire, where the state hired an outside law firm to help investigate opioid marketing and potentially pursue litigation, the targeted companies filed a court challenge to the firm\u2019s involvement, saying the contingent-fee arrangement \u201ctainted\u201d the investigation. The state\u2019s supreme court last month rejected that challenge, allowing the law firm to keep working.Attorneys general who use outside lawyers say a contingent-fee arrangement can help them pursue worthwhile litigation they haven\u2019t the resources to mount alone. In most such arrangements, outside law firms bear the cost of the litigation and are paid only if it succeeds.More than 300,000 Americans have died of opioid overdoses since the late 1990s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It performed best in the U.K., where its $12.4 million opening was bigger than even Mr. Nolan\u2019s \u201cInception,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, which opened to $9 million there and $62.8 million in the U.S. in 2010.\u201cDunkirk\u201d also performed particularly well in South Korea, opening to $10.3 million. \u201cDunkirk\u201d has yet to open in a few major markets, including China, where it is set to make its debut on Sept. 1.The well-reviewed \u201cGirls Trip\u201d had the biggest opening for any comedy this year, relieving Hollywood anxiety that a recent string of flops indicated audiences were losing interest in going to theaters to laugh.With an average audience grade of A+ according to market-research firm CinemaScore, compared with an A- for \u201cDunkirk,\u201d the raunchy R-rated \u201cGirls Trip\u201d is likely to benefit from excellent word-of-mouth in the coming weeks. According to exit polls, 79% of the audience for the comedy, which stars four women, was female.With a budget of $180 million, \u201cValerian\u201d represented a big bet by France\u2019s EuropaCorp that it could compete with the event movies coming out of Hollywood this summer.

Then, on the 13th hole, a bad round\u2014filled with head shakes and pull-aways from simple 3-foot putts\u2014went to the precipice of epic-horrendous after Spieth sliced his tee shot so far right of the fairway, so far over the high, fescue-covered sand dune that he took a drop in an area where club manufacturers set up their mobile shops since it was hard to fathom anyone having to hit a ball there.While Kuchar had a potential birdie putt, Spieth was taking a penalty stroke for an unplayable lie and was going to fall behind here, and 15 months after blowing a five-shot lead on his epic-horrendous back nine at Augusta, it was happening all over again.\u201cAs you can imagine thoughts come in from the last major when I was leading on a Sunday,\u201d said Spieth, who thankfully never does a very good job of hiding his frailties.And how could those thoughts not be there? Spieth can talk Texan and swagger, but inside he is all northeastern neurotic, struggling to sleep the night before these final rounds, grabbing his head with both hands when things don\u2019t go his way and yelling at his balls to go right or left or bite or drop, as if that might help.There is no need to watch Spieth\u2019s ball when he is playing. Just watch him. He\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on. For a dozen years, Tiger Woods was a superhuman golfing robot, rarely flinching with a lead, closing tournaments with computer-like precision. Spieth is the opposite of that. Spieth is us.\u201cOnce I lost my lead completely and we were tied I felt the nerves go away until I got the lead again and they were back,\u201d Spieth said.So choose your clich\u00e9 for him on the 13th:Sometimes you have to hit rock-bottom before you can begin to crawl out?The only way to overcome the fear of the tiger is to invite it into your living room and start petting it?They all work. Spieth was done. So how about this one, from that reluctant Nobel laureate Bob Dylan: \u201cWhen you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.\u201dBecause, there behind a maintenance trailer and a sand dune, having to swing 3-iron blind at a green 230 yards over the hills and far away, Spieth started playing free for the first time all day. His ball sailed high and nestled in the first cut, a half-dozen yards below the green. A chip and a knee-knocking 8-foot, bogey-saving putt later, Spieth was one-shot back, but feeling alive.After three and a half-rounds at the top of this oldest major, becoming the hunter instead of the hunted had liberated him. That\u2019s when he went about slaying that Augusta demon, at least for today, fighting like mad not to be the guy who always coughs up major leads on Sunday. Jordan Spieth was this close to becoming THAT guy, and then he wasn\u2019t. Turns out rock bottom can be a magic place.A six-iron from the tee on 14 that nearly fell for an ace. Birdie. All tied up. He stalked a blasted drive on 15\u2014always a good sign\u2014then drained a nearly 50-foot eagle putt, and headed to 16 with a one-shot lead after Kuchar\u2019s birdie.The 16th brought a 25-footer for birdie for a two-shot lead, and the 17th a chip to 6 feet. Then, after Kuchar put the pressure on with a 15-footer for birdie there, Spieth dropped his nail-in-the-coffin 6-foot birdie putt. Even he wasn\u2019t going to blow a two-shot lead on the last.Finally, Spieth had this, out in 37, home in 32, the scariest, most roller-coastery, 1-under 69 this place has ever seen. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t make it a little more boring,\u201d he said when it was done.The win gives Spieth his third major championship before the age of 24. Only Jack Nicklaus has done that.For Kuchar, who is 39-years-old, the loss was crushing, especially after knowing how ugly things looked for Spieth on the 13th. The only consolation was Kuchar played holes 14 through 17 in 2-under, but lost to someone who rose from the dust to play them in five-under,\u201cWe knew he was in a great deal of trouble,\u201d an emotional Kuchar said after the round. \u201cImpressive stuff.\u201dAfter the miracle shot from the wilderness, Spieth apologized to Kuchar for the delay, bumping fists with a player beloved and hugely respected in the pro golf locker room. Then golf shots resumed, including that massive Spieth bogey-saver from just beyond safe range. And then it was off to those final five holes, where Spieth\u2019s destiny was headed in one of two very different directions.On the way caddie Michael Greller told Spieth the bogey putt on the 13th had created a momentum shift\u2014in their favor. He might have been the only one of the tens of thousands at Royal Birkdale thinking that at that moment.\u201cI was so confident and the wheels had kind of come off,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cSo how do we get back on track to salvage this round?

The play centers on a fictional relationship between the conservative lion and a self-described \u201cflaming liberal\u201d law clerk, whom Justice Scalia hires to keep his debating skills sharp.The law clerk comes to grow fond of Justice Scalia even as she dislikes many of his views. The clerk also comes to detest rigid liberal and conservative fault lines that can dominate debate in the U.S.\u201cI love this play and the idea behind it that people with very different views on important things can genuinely like each other,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said during a question-and-answer session after the show.The 84-year-old Justice Ginsburg said she and Justice Scalia, who died last year, found common ground more often than most people realize, even as they jousted fiercely on hot-button constitutional cases.The justice also spoke longingly of the days when nominations to the Supreme Court didn\u2019t spark the all-out partisan combat that defines the process now, noting her own 96-3 Senate confirmation vote in 1993 and Justice Scalia\u2019s 98-0 vote in 1986.Justice Ginsburg fondly singled out Sen.       Orrin Hatch,        the Utah Republican, saying he was her biggest supporter in the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time of her nomination. The senator, she said, still invites her to speak to Utah audiences, which she will do later this month.\u201cMy hope is in my lifetime we will get back to the way it was,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said.Any such shift would be a challenge in the current political environment. Many Democrats voiced deep objections to President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to succeed Justice Scalia, which came after President       Barack Obama\u2019s       nominee for the vacancy, Judge Merrick Garland, was blocked from the court after the Senate Republicans declined to consider the nomination.Justice Ginsburg thrust herself directly into the heated political debate last summer when she publicly criticized Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign and suggested he would be bad for the Supreme Court and the nation, remarks she later said she regretted.The justice made no mention of the president Saturday night, though current events clearly hung over the discussion. Justice Ginsburg said she was optimistic about the nation \u201cover the long haul\u201d and she cited the pendulum swing of U.S. politics, which she said was as much a symbol of America as the bald eagle.When the pendulum swings too far in one direction, \u201cyou can look forward to it moving back,\u201d she said.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Ginsburg Reflects On Tenor Of Debate.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ruth-bader-ginsburg-yearns-for-less-partisan-political-climate-1500831018", "keywords": ["ginsburg,partisanship,play,scalia,supreme court,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Antonin Scalia,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 13:30:00", "news_title": "How Chris Froome and Team Sky Overwhelmed the Tour de France", "content": "PARIS\u2014Hints that Tour de France champion Chris Froome might be human after all seemed to be everywhere this summer. For the first time in his career, he lost the yellow jersey mid-race and had to win it back. He faltered badly in the Pyrenees. And when he crossed the finish line here on Sunday, he hadn\u2019t taken a single stage victory.He had won the whole race, of course, because he beat his rivals by nearly a minute overall. This, he said, was the closest-fought Tour of his career. A cagey battle until the end.But in Froome\u2019s era of dominance, this year represented something more. It was the perfect distillation of how Froome\u2019s Team Sky takes over the Tour de France. He and his cohort don\u2019t need stage wins, only relentless consistency and cold, calculated pragmatism.\u201cGiven the course that we had this year, it was always the tactic to ride a three-week race,\u201d said Froome, 32. \u201cBasically not to go out there one day with the aim of trying to blow the race apart and smash it for a stage win.\u201dThey chipped away when they could and limited damage when they had to. The result was that over the 21 stages, Sky held the general classification leader\u2019s yellow jersey on 19 days\u2014first on Geraint Thomas\u2019s shoulders and then Froome\u2019s.\u201cEvery single day, it was everything about the GC,\u201d said Sky domestique Micha\u0142 Kwiatkowski. \u201cNot really about winning the stage or chasing the green jersey or chasing mountain points or being in the breaks. We had just one goal.\u201dThis has not been an easy year for Sky to go after that goal. Allegations of impropriety surrounding the team\u2019s use of \u201ctherapeutic use exemptions\u201d\u2014which permit the use of banned substances for legitimate medical purposes\u2014landed manager Dave Brailsford in parliamentary committee hearings in the UK. Sky has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but the outfit\u2019s image suffered in a sport that had to strip its last superteam,       Lance Armstrong\u2019s       U.S. Postal Service, of seven Tour titles.\u201cI haven\u2019t any involvement in those and my focus was very much on getting ready for the Tour,\u201d Froome said.In assembling its squad around him, Sky used its time-tested recipe, even if the ingredients changed. Over his four Tour triumphs Froome has relied on a succession of luxury domestiques, who were every bit as strong as he was in decisive moments. For the first title in 2013, Froome had Australian Richie Porte on his wing.In 2015, Froome again leaned on Porte and his mountain shepherd, Wout Poels, who dragged him up the Alpe d\u2019Huez on the Tour\u2019s penultimate day. (Porte later left to be a leader at BMC and was expected to challenge Froome this year until he crashed on a descent.) Then in 2016, Froome was delivered to Paris by Poels and Thomas.This year, Sky put two of the most accomplished three-week riders in the world at his side for the key mountain stages: Mikel Landa and Michal Kwiatkowski. That alone would be enough to make the rest of cycling green with envy. But Sky runs so deep that it can even use other riders to protect Froome\u2019s protectors early in the race.\u201cSo many guys helped me to help Chris,\u201d said Kwiatkowski, who dug so deep in the Alps last week that he had to stop for a break.Their very presence is often enough to dissuade opponents from taking a shot at Froome. The men who finished this Tour second and third\u2014Cannondale-Drapac\u2019s Rigoberto Uran and AG2R La Mondiale\u2019s Romain Bardet\u2014were able to shadow Froome during the last mountain stages in the Alps, but had no teammates of their own to cooperate with. Froome, meanwhile, was always flanked by at least one bodyguard ready to chase down an offensive.Bardet and Uran never had a shot to get away.\u201cWhen you have a team like Sky pulling him up, what are you going to do? Keep attacking?\u201d said the American three-time champion Greg LeMond.The steep slopes of France\u2019s mountain ranges is where domestiques\u2019 work is most obvious, but Froome\u2019s squad manages most stages from the very start. On flat roads, Sky\u2019s Luke Rowe and Christian Knees drive the peloton and monitor early breakaways. If the riders trying to escape the pack pose a threat to their leader, they reel them back to the pack. But if they\u2019re harmless to Froome\u2019s overall chances, they are free to knock themselves out.Like nightclub bouncers, \u201cthey decide,\u201d Cannondale-Drapac rider Dylan van Baarle said.Everyone on the team knows his role to perfection\u2014they are cycling\u2019s offensive linemen grinding for their quarterback. Which is why Sky pays them handsomely out of the biggest budget in the sport, widely reported to exceed $40 million. (The less well-off teams in the top tier of cycling, operate on roughly a third of that.)But keeping everyone happy can be a challenge. Many of Froome\u2019s lieutenants are powerful enough to be leaders on other teams. Landa, in particular, could have run away from him at several points in the mountains. That he never committed full-on mutiny put Landa in fourth place overall and missed the podium by just one second.He has already been clear that he will not return to the Tour as a No. 2 rider.\u201cHe\u2019s got the engine to ride with the best in the world and he\u2019s certainly capable of coming back to contest the overall victory,\u201d Froome said of Landa.Froome took care of business when he was alone in the time-trials, too, in Stage 1 in D\u00fcsseldorf and Stage 20 in Marseille, putting time into all of his general-classification rivals. But everywhere else, in every crucial stretch of road, Froome\u2019s white-jerseyed, yellow-helmeted protectors were laying the groundwork for a fifth Team Sky Tour win in six years.\u201cThey have the best riders,\u201d van Baarle said. \u201cSo it\u2019s normal that they are everywhere.\u201dWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Team Sky Overwhelms the Tour.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-chris-froome-and-team-sky-overwhelmed-the-tour-de-france-1500831000", "keywords": ["bikes,chris froome,cycling,froome,froome four wins,froome tour,team sky,tour de france,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 13:21:00", "news_title": "Markets Risk Shock If No Brexit Deal Is Struck", "content": "When it comes to European crises, the markets have learned that it is always wise to bet on a deal. But Brexit may be different.Other than a sharp devaluation in sterling in the immediate aftermath of last year\u2019s referendum, markets have remained remarkably steady through a year of political turmoil.Yet Britain will quit the EU in March 2019 whether there is a deal or not\u2014and the market may be underestimating the risk of a deal not being reached in time.True, since Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s botched election gamble in June, London has made a series of compromises which have allowed the two sides to make some incremental progress through two rounds of negotiations on the path to a negotiated divorce.Crucially, the U.K. government has finally accepted there is no chance the U.K. can negotiate both this divorce agreement and a new free-trade agreement with the EU in the 20 months before the U.K. leaves the EU.The cabinet now agrees there will need to be a lengthy transition period beyond March 2019 when the relationship with the EU is likely to remain for practical purposes largely unchanged. Even so, it would be a mistake to read too much into this collision with reality. If one nettle has been grasped, thornier obstacles to a deal remain.Some of these concern the details of the divorce deal itself, not least the vexed questions of the exit bill that the U.K. must pay to settle its outstanding obligations to the EU and how to protect the rights of EU and U.K. expats after Brexit.But the biggest obstacle concerns the U.K.\u2019s inability to spell out in any detail what kind of post-Brexit relationship with the EU that it is seeking. Without clarity on this, there can be no deal.Boiled down, the U.K.\u2019s dilemma lies in choosing whether post-Brexit Britain should be a rule-taker or rule-maker.Does the U.K. want a \u201cdeep and special partnership with the EU,\u201d as Mrs. May claims, in which case it will need to remain closely bound by EU rules over which it will no longer have any say, while continuing to pay into the EU budget and allowing EU citizens preferential rights to work in the U.K.?Or is the U.K.\u2019s priority to \u201ctake back control of our borders, our money and our laws,\u201d as Mrs. May also claims, which would mean a more detached relationship?The rule-taker option would minimize the economic disruption of Brexit but would leave the country vulnerable to future changes in EU rules and would reduce the U.K.\u2019s scope to seek its own independent trade deals\u2014a political priority for Brexiters.The rule-maker option would give the U.K. more control, but at the expense of potentially severe medium-term disruption as new barriers to trade with the EU forced businesses to re-engineer supply chains and the government was obliged to establish a multitude of new regulators, agencies and international agreements. This approach would also lead to the reintroduction of a hard border in Ireland, which both sides want to avoid.In public, the government has yet to acknowledge this dilemma exists. Officially, it is still hoping to achieve a \u201chave your cake and eat it\u201d Brexit in which the U.K. maintains frictionless trade with the EU while restricting EU migration and securing its own bilateral trade deals.But privately, Downing Street admits this is impossible\u2014and that it needs to set out its choice soon if the Brexit process is to remain on track. Its problem is that while it could accept the U.K. being a rule-taker in some sectors, such as chemicals\u2014and could even contemplate indirect jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice via an alternative supranational dispute resolution mechanism such as the European Free Trade Association court\u2014it couldn't accept the U.K. being a rule-taker in sectors such as financial services. Yet the EU has rejected such \u201ccherry-picking.\u201dIf there is no easy way forward, could Brexit be reversed instead? That looks difficult, too, not least because the opposition Labour Party is split three ways. Some would welcome a second referendum, but the party\u2019s hard-left leadership sees in Brexit an opportunity to advance a socialist agenda impossible under EU rules, and erstwhile pro-Europeans who represent traditional working-class constituencies that backed Brexit now believe the priority must be to limit EU migration.Even opponents of Brexit agree that there would be no point in holding a second referendum without a clear shift in public opinion combined with evidence that the EU was willing to offer a fresh deal on migration. As things stand, neither of those conditions look like being met.That leaves the U.K. in a dark place. The market is clearly right to believe that a deal is still the rational outcome. But what if the deeply divided U.K. political system, faced with no good options, is no longer capable of rational decision-making?Write to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/markets-risk-shock-if-no-brexit-deal-is-struck-1500830461", "keywords": ["brexit, eu, european union, labour party, migration, trade fre trade,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 13:13:00", "news_title": "It\u2019s a Vasectomy Party!

Neither man could drive afterward, but their wives were remarkably supportive.Mr. Ferretti, 36 years old, and Mr. Lopez, 44, had enjoyed themselves under the supervision of a doctor for what some are calling a brosectomy\u2014a vasectomy with friends in a cushy setting of couches, snacks, big-screen TV, and in some clinics, top-shelf liquor.\u201cWe thought it was going to be painful,\u201d said Mr. Lopez, who described the procedure as feeling like the sting of a rubber band. \u201cAfter that, we were just laughing, I guess it\u2019s from the alcohol, but we had such a great time.\u201dHundreds of thousands of American men get vasectomies each year, according to the American Urological Association. Typically, the procedures cost about $500. But gregarious types willing to spend a few thousand dollars are getting the procedure done together at clinics that look more like club lounges.\u201cWe felt that if it looks sterile, like a doctor\u2019s office, then guys wouldn\u2019t feel as comfortable,\u201d said       Shane Geib,        the urologist who snipped Messrs. Ferretti and Lopez. Leather sofas, TVs and wood paneling at Dr. Geib\u2019s Obsidian Men\u2019s Health in Tysons Corner, Va., help put patients at ease, he said.Urologist       Paul Turek,        who has clinics in Beverly Hills, Calif., and San Francisco, said group vasectomies are a growing trend. When a group arrives, he closes the office to accommodate the men comfortably.A limousine recently delivered a group of biotech employees from the same firm, he said. With jazz playing in the background, \u201cI move like the wind,\u201d Dr. Turek said, finishing each man after a song or two, about eight minutes.Vasectomies are considered a permanent form of birth control, although they can be reversed.\u00a0Dr. Turek said his patients include fathers as well as single men who freeze their sperm before their vasectomy to retain \u201cownership over contraception.\u201dHaving vasectomies together provides comfort in numbers, Dr. Turek said. One group, friends since college, had vasectomies together, and they \u201ctook fewer pain pills, felt better faster and returned to work earlier than the average, go-it-alone-out-on-the-plank, tube-tied patient,\u201d he wrote on his blog last year.Urologist       Ernest Sussman,        of Las Vegas Vasectomy in Nevada, said pairs of men arrive together for the procedure a few times a year, usually visitors attending business conferences or watching sporting events together.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a fraternity mentality, where one guy says they may do it,\u201d Dr. Sussman said, piquing the interest of \u201cthe other guys who\u2019ve been contemplating it. All of a sudden they have the energy or courage.\u201dMessrs. Ferretti and Lopez got good and relaxed before their recent procedure, according to their video of the afternoon posted on YouTube.After the short operation, the two friends retired to the recovery room in bathrobes and slippers, where they ordered a steak dinner and relaxed for a couple of hours watching TV and \u201claughing it up,\u201d said Mr. Ferretti, who lives in Englewood, N.J.Doctors allow patients to go home the same day, although they can\u2019t drive themselves if they have taken strong pain pills or alcohol.Other clinics advertise on radio and social media that the benefits of vasectomies reach beyond family planning. The pitch: Doctor\u2019s orders are a perfect excuse to watch the NCAA basketball tournament in its entirety.\u201cReady for some wife-approved couch time?

It offers a vasectomy package that includes a Utah Jazz basketball ticket giveaway, goody bags and basketball-shaped ice packs. This year, its surgeons performed more than three times as many vasectomies in March compared with the average number done in the other months through May, according to the health center\u2019s internal marketing data.A U.S. survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found most women who rely on vasectomies for birth control have as many children as they or their partner want.

The first requirement is getting re-elected.

Rand Paul,        Dean Heller and       Susan Collins       for their implicit support of ObamaCare by their explicit rejection of health-care reform as it is currently proposed.

Of course this also applies to diesel vehicles,\u201d BMW said in a written statement.The comments come after Volkswagen, Germany\u2019s largest car maker, alerted European antitrust authorities about a year ago to discussions between itself and its main German rivals, a person familiar with the situation said.\u201cThe European Commission and the Bundeskartellamt have received information on this matter, which is currently being assessed by the Commission,\u201d a European Commission representative said in a written statement. \u201cIt is premature at this stage to speculate further.\u201dA spokesman for Germany\u2019s federal cartel office on Sunday declined to comment further on the commission\u2019s investigation into anticompetitive behavior by the participants. The office said it had been looking into possible steel-price fixing by car makers and suppliers since last summer.Shares in the affected German companies fell Friday after German newsweekly Der Spiegel first reported the news. Shares in Volkswagen were down nearly 5% during the session in Frankfurt, eventually closing 3.6% lower. Shares in BMW closed 2.6% lower, while         Daimler AG       fell 2.1% after partially recouping early losses.The decision by VW to lift the veil on behavior it thinks could have been illegal was part of an effort by management to review past practices and invite closer scrutiny by authorities after a diesel emissions-cheating scandal engulfed the company, the person familiar with the matter said.The German car maker\u2019s new management, installed after the diesel scandal, discovered documents during a German antitrust investigation into steel-price fixing in 2016 that it thought might constitute collusion by companies including Volkswagen, BMW, Porsche, Audi and Daimler.In a letter sent to the European Commission in mid-2016, Volkswagen provided details of years of discussions between car makers to find common positions on technologies including the diesel-emissions systems at the center of the emissions-cheating scandal, said the person familiar with the matter, who is a high-ranking auto-industry executive.The revelation comes at an awkward time for German\u2014and European\u2014manufacturers that face accusations that the diesel-powered cars that have become ubiquitous on European roads emit far more toxic fumes than advertised. Volkswagen has been fined in the U.S. after admitting to installing cheating software on its cars that cut the level of harmful emissions that environmental tests can detect. Other car makers have recalled millions of cars for their engines to be fixed after they were shown to emit more dangerous chemicals than they should.It is standard practice in industry for manufacturers to work together to agree on technical standards for new technology. In the case of diesel, auto makers established standards for emissions-control systems that regulated certain aspects, including fluid used to neutralize nitrogen-oxide emissions, the size of tanks containing the fluid, and other details.\u201cWe meet every month to discuss a wide range of issues important to the industry and unify positions with the government. Where do these discussions cross the line into antitrust territory?\u201d said another auto-industry executive.That was the question that Volkswagen\u2019s legal experts raised in 2016. Under scrutiny after the diesel scandal, Volkswagen decided to let antitrust authorities make the determination. By offering itself as a whistleblower, VW could also be hoping for leniency in the event that European Union regulators rule against the German car industry.Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to rigging nearly 11 million diesel engines world-wide to cheat emissions tests and pleaded guilty in 2016 to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and U.S. consumers.The company agreed to pay more than $22 billion in fines, penalties and compensation for consumers.By blowing the whistle on cartels and cooperating in investigations, some companies that had engaged into anticompetitive behavior have managed to obtain substantial penalty reductions, and sometimes complete exemptions, in recent years.Germany\u2019s antitrust authority launched a witness leniency program in 2000, offering companies reduced fines if they report themselves for potential cartel violations.

By contrast from 1990 through last year, tuition grew an average 6% a year, more than double the rate of inflation. In that time, the average annual cost for a four-year private college, including living expenses, rose 161% to about $27,500, according to the College Board.Some schools are offering more discounts and cutting prices.Abundant supply is running up against demand constraints. The number of two-year and four-year colleges increased 33% between 1990 and 2012 to 4,726, Education Department data show.\u00a0But college enrollment is down more than 4% from a peak in 2010, partly because a healthy job market means fewer people are going back to school to learn new skills.Longer-running economic and demographic shifts also are at play. Lower birthrates and the aging of baby boomer children have reduced the pool of traditional college-age Americans. The number of new high-school graduates grew 18% between 2000 and 2010 but only 2% in the first seven years of this decade, Education Department data show.Another factor: Congress last increased the maximum amount undergraduates could borrow from the government in 2008. Some economists have concluded schools raise prices along with increases in federal financial aid. A clampdown on aid, in turn, could limit the ability of schools to charge more.Some of these trends may persist. The number of high-school\u00a0graduates is projected to remain flat through 2023, according to an analysis by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. White graduates, the most likely among races to attend college, are expected to decline over this period.\u201cThe competition is bigger now than it has been, and I think we have more informed consumers,\u201d said Sarah Kottich, chief financial officer at College of Saint Mary in Omaha, Neb.The small private women\u2019s college cut out-of-pocket tuition 10% for the coming year, to an average $14,600 after aid,\u00a0its\u00a0first reduction in at least two decades. Officials made the move after analyzing research from             SLM Corp.\u2019s       Sallie Mae, a private student lender, showing high prices are a major factor for students when they eliminate schools from their searches, Ms. Kottich said.Moody\u2019s Investors Service projects shifting consumer behavior will restrain pricing for years. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we will return anytime soon to some of the double-digit increases we saw postrecession,\u201d Moody\u2019s analyst Susan Fitzgerald said.But other factors could keep cost pressures rising.       George Pernsteiner,        head of State Higher Education Executive Officers, a trade group that tracks state funding for schools, notes that many states are on track to experience budget crunches as the population ages and health-care and public pension costs rise. That could squeeze public support for schools.Moreover, the number of schools is declining in response to oversupply, particularly among for-profit schools, a trend that could reduce competition and increase pricing leverage for schools that remain open.For now, the shakeout is hitting private schools hardest. For-profit trade schools and many private nonprofit colleges are under pressure to justify high prices, particularly because some graduates are failing to land high-paying jobs. The broad decline in undergraduate enrollment since 2010 has been concentrated mostly among small nonprofit colleges, for-profit trade schools and public community colleges, federal data show.Public four-year colleges, which teach the majority of bachelor\u2019s candidates in the nation and tend to be cheaper than private schools, are benefiting from increases in direct state funding as tax revenues improve. That has eased schools\u2019 need to raise prices on students. During the recession, the reverse occurred. States cut funding to plug budget gaps and colleges raised tuition to offset the cuts.State officials have also pressured schools, through legislation and public speeches, to rein in prices, and they are admitting more international students to boost revenues.The average cost of attending the University of Washington in Seattle fell two years ago, in part due to state legislative mandates to ease tuition. Average tuition and living expenses stood at $10,100, after scholarships and grants, in 2015, down 3% from two years earlier. A school spokeswoman said one factor was that more students were living at home to avoid room-and-board payments.College remains a daunting expense for many households. Moreover, because tuition levels were high to begin with, even small percentage increases can translate into large dollar amounts. Most undergraduates take on student loans, and graduate owing an average $30,000, according to the nonprofit advocacy group the Institute for College Access & Success.The sharp rise in tuition and student debt in the past generation stoked concerns that college became out of reach for many families. A Federal Reserve survey released in\u00a0May\u00a0showed 37% of Americans age 30 and younger who hadn\u2019t attended college said it was it because it was too expensive. About 43% of those who attended but dropped out pointed to the cost.Two-thirds of private colleges that experienced enrollment declines over the past three years pointed to price sensitivity among prospective students as an important factor, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers. The group said discounting, or the practice of schools offering scholarships and other forms of aid to reduce tuition, reached a record this year.Izzi Moraschi, 19 years old, said she chose Rosemont College, a small private college near Philadelphia, after seeing a flier advertising a sharp tuition reduction. She wanted to reduce the burden on her parents.Combined, she and her parents took out $15,800 in federal loans to cover her first year\u2019s tuition. \u201cIt was just really important for me that I was able to make it so that my parents wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything out of pocket,\u201d said Ms. Moraschi, now a sophomore, who said she plans to pay back her parents\u2019 portion of the loan.Sharon Hirsh, Rosemont\u2019s president, said her school reduced tuition to ease concerns of middle-income students, who seem more willing to choose public schools to save money.\u201cWe are surrounded by private institutions that are openly talking about right-sizing,\u201d Ms. Hirsh said. \u201cFamilies have gotten to a point where they cannot consider a private institution with a high price.\u201dWrite to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Colleges Pull Back Tuition\u2019s Long Rise.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-reversal-colleges-rein-in-tuition-1500822001", "keywords": ["college education,college tuition,higher education,the outlook,marketing,markets,pricing,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,political,general news,education,private education,school,university,college,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 11:01:00", "news_title": "Xi\u2019s Sign-Off Deals Blow to China Inc.\u2019s Global Spending Spree", "content": "BEIJING\u2014China\u2019s government reined in one of its brashest conglomerates with the approval of President       Xi Jinping,        according to people with knowledge of the action\u2014a mark that the broader government clampdown on large private companies comes right from the top of China\u2019s leadership.The measures, with President Xi\u2019s previously unreported approval last month, bar state-owned banks from making new loans to property giant Dalian Wanda Group to help fuel its foreign expansion.The cutoff in bank financing for the company\u2019s foreign investments highlights Beijing\u2019s changing view of a series of Wanda\u2019s recent overseas acquisitions as irrational and overpriced, these people say.Targeted along with Wanda are HNA Group Co., Anbang Insurance Group and             Fosun International Ltd.        0656 0.69%      \u2014which had reputations for well-cultivated political ties.\u201cIt feels like an avalanche,\u201d said Jingzhou Tao, a lawyer at Dechert LLP in Beijing, who does mergers and acquisitions work.\u00a0\u201cThis is sending a shock wave through the business community.\u201dSince 2015, the four companies completed a combined $55 billion in overseas acquisitions\u2014or 18% of Chinese companies\u2019 total. In recent days, Wanda\u2019s billionaire founder Wang Jianlin has been shrinking his empire by selling off assets and paying back the company\u2019s bank loans.Beijing for years encouraged Chinese companies to scour the globe for deals. Now it is reining in some of its highest-profile private entrepreneurs in what officials say is growing unease with their high leverage and growing influence. The measures serve as a stern warning for other big companies that loaded up on debt to buy overseas assets, officials and analysts say.Mr. Xi acted after China\u2019s cabinet set the government machinery in gear by directing financial regulators, the economic planning agency and other bureaucracies to take a hard look at foreign acquisitions, once seen as a means for China to showcase its economic might, these people said.Chinese banking regulators last month ordered banks to scrutinize loans to Anbang and other highfliers including airlines-and-hotels conglomerate HNA Group, which has pulled back on overseas investments.Officials at Wanda and at Anbang declined to comment. HNA said in a statement it continues to take a \u201cdisciplined approach\u201d to identifying \u201cstrategic acquisitions across our core areas of focus.\u201dOfficials at Fosun said the firm has \u201coverseas funds and other stable financing channels,\u201d including a fund of around U.S. $1 billion to invest, but emphasized it \u201cfully respects the government regulations both in China and overseas markets.\u201d Fosun has a listed unit in Hong Kong, and its strategy to invest in health care and technology \u201cadheres to China\u2019s global investment strategy,\u201d said a spokesman,       Chen Bo.Going forward, some believe China\u2019s private companies will have trouble getting capital, which would help shift financial clout further in favor of big state-owned enterprises.Beijing\u2019s sterner line comes as big private businesses and others have been amassing capital and influence that challenge the authoritarian Chinese leadership\u2019s firm hold on the economy.Its grip has been tested over a bumpy few years. After a 2015 stock market meltdown and a botched government rescue, a gush of money flowed out of the country looking for better returns. That in turn put pressure on China\u2019s tightly controlled yuan and foreign-exchange reserves, both seen by Beijing as barometers of confidence in the economy.The latest scrutiny is a watershed moment in the Communist government\u2019s relations with a private sector it has never been comfortable with. Though some senior leaders, particularly Premier       Li Keqiang,        are urging a new culture of startups and small businesses, Mr. Xi has promoted plans to make already-large state enterprises larger and strengthen their sway over the economy.Chinese firms completed $187 billion in outbound deals last year, according to Dealogic, as private companies snapped up trophy properties, soccer clubs and hotels, while Chinese with means bought homes and pushed up real-estate prices from Texas to Sydney.The private sector\u2019s share of overseas spending shot up from barely above zero about a decade ago to nearly half of China\u2019s total overseas investments in 2016, before slipping back to 36.9% in the first half of 2017, according to Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute.Amid the rush of investments, Beijing burned through nearly a trillion dollars in foreign-exchange reserves trying to steady the yuan. That ultimately led government regulators to clamp controls on money exiting the country and to scrutinize all proposed major offshore investments.\u201cThose companies have borrowed a lot to fund their deals overseas, and that means risks to Chinese banks if the deals go bad,\u201d a Chinese official involved in policy-making said.The official said China is acutely aware that as Japan rose to economic prominence in the 1980s, its companies splurged on American real estate and other trophy assets, resulting in losses that cascaded through Japan\u2019s banking sector.Mr. Tao, the Beijing lawyer, says the government\u2019s new aggressive posture is driven in large measure by a need for control. \u201cState-owned assets, whether in China or abroad, are still state assets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when private entrepreneurs take their money out, it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s no longer something that China can benefit from or the Chinese government can get a handle on.\u201dNot all cross-border investment is out of favor. Beijing wants companies to support initiatives such as Mr. Xi\u2019s signature \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, which is intended to draw China\u2019s neighbors into Beijing\u2019s economic orbit through transit hubs and industrial parks. Investments are being approved for industrial robots and other advanced technology to facilitate the country\u2019s ambition to move up the value chain.An early sign of government discomfort with overseas spending was Anbang\u2019s unsuccessful $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. in 2016. Authorities expressed displeasure with the bold move, believing that Anbang had offered too much, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.Anbang, which had appeared unstoppable in 2014 when it struck a $2 billion deal to buy the U.S. Waldorf Astoria hotel, fell deeper in trouble. This past June, special government investigators looking into economic crimes detained Anbang\u2019s chairman, Wu Xiaohui, who hasn\u2019t appeared in public since.In the case of Wanda, regulators acted in the belief the company overpaid in efforts to expand beyond shopping centers and hotels and into entertainment, according to the people with knowledge of the action.Its largest such acquisition was of Legendary Entertainment, the Hollywood producer and financier behind films including \u201cJurassic World\u201d and \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Wanda spent $3.5 billion to buy Legendary in 2016; In Hollywood, industry insiders widely believed the company paid too much. Legendary said this week that it is well-capitalized, operating normally and able to fund its film and television productions.\u2014Wayne Ma, Grace Zhu and Liyan Qi contributed to this article.Write to Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.com and Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'China\u2019s Crackdown on Wanda Blessed by Xi.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-latest-clampdown-on-overseas-investing-has-president-xis-approval-1500802203", "keywords": ["acquisitions,china ,china government,chinese economy,crackdown,finance,foreign investment,international,Dalian Wanda Group,dalian wanda,Fosun International,0656.HK,HK:0656,HNA Group,Dechert,Anbang Insurance Group,Jingzhou Tao, Wang Jianlin,regulation,government policy,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 11:00:00", "news_title": "Cloud Wars at the Right Price ", "content": "The cloud is an expensive business to operate in, so it helps when the cloud seemingly sells itself.The second quarter may turn out to be one of those times.

For financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic, it is an event that comes with consequences.In May 2013, then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress the central bank later that year might begin tapering its asset purchases\u2014remarks that sent Treasury yields sharply higher, and ultimately forced the Fed to push back its plans. The ECB is keen not to relive the so-called taper tantrum. Following its meeting on Thursday, President       Mario Draghi       took care to not lay out any sort of timetable for when the central bank will start reducing purchases.But, as with the Fed in 2013, an improving economy is putting the ECB on the path to eventually ending its bond purchases and, if nothing goes badly awry, tightening. Throughout that process, even as its benchmark interest rate remains stuck at zero, financial markets will need to undergo a substantial adjustment.One way to gauge how big the adjustment needs to be is to look at the ECB \u201cshadow rate\u201c constructed by economists Jing Cynthia Wu and Fan Dora Xia. Calculated with the rates on longer-dated credit instruments, this gauges where the ECB\u2019s benchmark rate might be if it could be set meaningfully below zero. It is, in effect, a measure of how stimulative the ECB\u2019s unconventional monetary policy is. At minus 5.1% as of last month, the ECB shadow rate is deeply negative.The lowest the comparable U.S. shadow rate reached was minus 3% in mid-2014, when the Fed was in the midst of tapering. From there it climbed, reaching the zero level in November 2015\u2014the month before the Fed raised rates for the first time. It was a period when the yield on 10-year Treasurys remained low, not least because bond purchases by other central banks were draining the supply of long-term government bonds available to investors.But it was also a period that coincided with a sharply stronger dollar. In effect, adjustments that in the past, when global markets weren\u2019t as integrated, might have flowed through into higher long-term rates showed up in exchange rates instead. Ultimately, the dollar\u2019s strength caused problems. In early 2016, for example, worries emerged that emerging-market debtors wouldn\u2019t be able to repay dollar-denominated loans.As European credit markets adjust for an eventual ECB tightening, and as the ECB shadow rate rises, the euro may rise sharply against other currencies, including the dollar. In contrast to what happened during the Fed\u2019s shadow rate rise, long-term bond yields also could move higher since there will be one less central bank draining supply. The world that investors find themselves in will look a lot different than the one they are in now.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Shining Light on \u2018Shadow Rate\u2019.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-markets-could-come-out-of-the-shadows-1500818400", "keywords": ["ecb policy,ecb rate decisions,european central bank rates,European Central Bank,Federal Reserve,Fan Dora Xia,Jing Cynthia Wu,Ben Bernanke,Mario Draghi,monetary policy,central bank intervention,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 09:00:00", "news_title": "Real Yields Pull Back as Investors Rethink Growth Prospects ", "content": "Inflation-adjusted bond yields are falling again, highlighting investors\u2019 doubts about the U.S. economy\u2019s growth prospects.The yield on the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, or TIPS, pulled back to 0.483% Friday, down from 0.530% Thursday and a recent high of 0.646% on July 7. Yields fall when bond prices rise.The 10-year TIPS yield is one popular measure of so-called real yields, or the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note minus the rate of inflation.Real yields are important because they reflect investors\u2019 actual purchasing power from their bond investments.At the moment, lower real yields reflect several factors, including a run of underwhelming economic data and the unraveling of postelection bets that Trump administration policies would boost growth and inflation.One concern for investors is that a rise in real yields would raise borrowing costs, increasing the debt burden of consumers and businesses. That could further crimp the prospects for economic growth, which could make major central banks cautious in shifting toward reduced monetary stimulus.ECB President Mario Draghi on June 27 signaled that the central bank might start winding down its bond buying program as the eurozone\u2019s economy improves, which kick-started a selloff in the global government bond market. But on Thursday, Mr. Draghi appeared to be less hawkish, signaling instead that inflation isn\u2019t showing convincing signs of picking up.After initially dismissing signs of tepid inflation as transitory, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in congressional testimony earlier this month that the central bank could reassess its pace of interest rate increases if inflation remains stuck below its 2% annual target.\u201cLower real yields, if sustained, imply lower growth potential for an economy,\u2019\u2019 said       Donald Ellenberger,        head of multisector strategies at             Federated Investors.       \u201cThe hopes of fiscal stimulus in 2017 are becoming more remote, inflation is moving away from the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and Yellen told us earlier this month that the Fed\u2019s policy rate wasn\u2019t too far away from neutral.\u201dLong-term borrowing costs retreated as bond yields declined. The yield on the 30-year fixed rate mortgage average fell to 3.96% for the week that ended Thursday, from 4.03% a week earlier, according to data from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.The moves in real yields have coincided with swings in other interest-rate sensitive investments. As real yields rose during the recent selloff, prices of gold and silver fell. A rise in real yields increases the relative attractiveness of bonds over the metals, which don\u2019t offer regular interest payments. Metal prices have risen in recent sessions as real yields have slipped.Meanwhile, the average yield on U.S. junk bonds also ticked up as real yields climbed, and retreated as bonds rallied recently. U.S. bond funds and exchange-traded funds focusing on U.S. junk bonds have suffered weekly net outflows in four of the past five weeks, according to data from fund tracker Lipper.Some investors don\u2019t expect a big selloff in the junk bond market.\u201cWe are moving away from extremely accommodative monetary policy,\u2019\u2019 said       Ron Sanchez,        chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co.

One market, however, has been a notable exception to this trend: China.Investors have been rushing out of the country\u2019s domestically listed technology companies in droves. The tech-heavy ChiNext Price Index, the main gauge of a Shenzhen-based board established in 2009 to showcase China\u2019s small-capitalization companies, is among the worst performing benchmarks globally in 2017, having plunged 14%.Instead, investors have been plowing money into some of China\u2019s largest, often government-backed companies. The SSE 50 Index, which tracks the 50 most valuable companies listed in Shanghai, has surged 15% this year to its highest level since July 2015, while a gauge of the top 200 listed state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, in China has risen 13%.This divergence between sectors is likely to persist, traders and analysts said. Measures by Chinese regulators to cool speculation in local markets favor relatively safe, state-backed company stocks, they said. The inclusion of about 200 large Chinese companies in index provider             MSCI Inc.\u2019s       main benchmarks could also draw more funds to those shares.Moreover, Chinese President       Xi Jinping       has made the overhaul of SOEs and the creation of large-scale \u201cnational champion\u201d companies that can compete globally a policy priority.The shift in investor appetite has helped stabilize China\u2019s stock markets after a tumultuous couple of years. Shanghai\u2019s main benchmark index, dominated by large state-owned companies, is up 3% this year. Nine of China\u2019s 10 biggest listed companies have risen more than 15%, led by             Ping An Insurance                   (Group) Co., the country\u2019s largest insurer by market value, and state-owned             China Merchants Bank Co.However, some market observers said they fear the concentration of investment flows into large state-owned companies risks propping up areas of China\u2019s so-called old economy such as big banks, resources and heavy industry, which already have easy access to funding. State-owned companies absorb around half of all bank credit in China, according to the International Monetary Fund. Meanwhile, capital is being drained from privately owned companies in faster-growing sectors that should be core to the country\u2019s economic development.\u201cWe are seeing a fundamental shift in political priorities away from encouraging financial innovation to guarding against systemic risks,\u201d said Jacky Zhang, an analyst at BOC International. \u201cRisk appetite across all types of investors has decreased dramatically\u2026Institutions are huddling together in a handful of stocks regardless of their actual growth potential.\u201dTo be sure, China\u2019s most valuable tech companies have benefited from this year\u2019s global boom, but they are listed only outside mainland China. E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has soared 73% on the New York Stock Exchange so far this year, while Hong Kong-listedTencent Holdings Ltd.       has jumped 57% year to date.The drop in mainland China\u2019s tech stocks has been linked to Beijing\u2019s clampdown on speculative investment fueled by heavy borrowing. China\u2019s central bank has raised several main money-market interest rates multiple times this year, and ordered banks to cut back on selling highly leveraged investment products.Much of the money borrowed to bet on stocks had previously flowed into small-cap companies listed in Shenzhen, China\u2019s second-largest stock market.\u201cOne popular saying in the startup circle in 2015-2016 was that floating shares on the ChiNext was the next best thing to printing your own money,\u201d said Wendy Liu, head of China equity research at Nomura.According to exchange data, ChiNext-listed companies, more than half of which are in the tech or telecommunications sectors, still on average trade at around 47 times their earnings\u2014a measure commonly used by investors to assess a stock\u2019s value. That is far below the 140 times earnings at which they traded at the height of the 2015 bull market, but high when compared with Nasdaq-listed stocks, which on average trade at around 26 times.A flood of new companies coming to market has further undermined stock prices. China\u2019s stock-market regulator greenlighted 225 initial public offerings in the first half of 2017, more than double the number a year ago.However, tech companies have also suffered weak earnings and corporate scandals. Four of the 10 largest companies on the ChiNext board have warned of declines in their first-half earnings, according to Wind Information Co.Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp., ChiNext\u2019s third-biggest stock, is struggling to repay debts after Jia Yueting, the billionaire founder of its unlisted parent, LeEco Holdings, acknowledged in November that LeEco had overreached by expanding from streaming video into electric cars and smartphones, leading to a cash crunch.In April, Leshi suspended trading in its shares, saying it was reviewing possible restructuring strategies. Last week, the video subsidiary said its stock would remain halted for up to three more months. Before the shares were suspended, they had tumbled 40% since November.Shares of Shanghai Amarsoft Information & Technology Co., another once-highflying stock, have plunged by 90% since 2015, when regulators opened an investigation into the software developer for suspected collusion with brokers to issue misleading reports about the company. The following year, Amarsoft said it was fined for violations of the law. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\u201cThere is a painful soul-searching among investors over what has supported the lofty valuations of most ChiNext stocks,\u201d said Deng Wenyuan, an analyst at             Soochow Securities.Andrew Liu, a 42-year-old retail investor in Shenzhen who owns stock valued at nearly $300,000, said that blue-chip companies in the resources sector currently account for at least 60% of his portfolio\u2014a reversal from his strategy of favoring small-cap stocks in 2015, when they made up 80% of his portfolio.\u201cThe LeEco problem was a huge psychological blow to investors and remains to be settled,\u201d said Mr. Liu. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky to go bottom-fishing on ChiNext now.\u2014Yifan XieAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'China Tech Shares Falter.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/heres-the-one-market-where-tech-stocks-arent-in-charge-1500814804", "keywords": [" alibaba, china, chinese, equities, profit, regulators, shanghai, shares, shenzhen, stocks, tech boom,tech companies, tencent,Leshi Internet Information & Technology,LeEco Holdings,Shanghai Amarsoft Information & Technology,Tencent Holdings,HK:0700,Alibaba Group Holding,BABA,Jacky Zhang,Wendy Liu,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,stock trading disruptions,stock trading halts,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,routine market,financial news,legal services,business,consumer services,online service providers,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 08:00:00", "news_title": "In Cyberwarfare, Everyone Is a Combatant", "content": "This is already a banner year for hacks, breaches and cyberwarfare, but the past week was exceptional.South Carolina reported hackers attempted to access the state\u2019s voter-registration system 150,000 times on Election Day last November\u2014part of what former Homeland Security Secretary       Jeh Johnson       alleges is a 21-state attack perpetrated by Russia. And U.S. intelligence officials alleged that agents working for the United Arab Emirates planted false information in Qatari news outlets and social media, leading to sanctions and a rift with Qatar\u2019s allies. Meanwhile, Lloyd\u2019s of London declared that the takedown of a significant cloud service could lead to monetary damages on par with those of Hurricane Katrina.Threats to the real world from the cyberworld are worse than ever, and the situation continues to deteriorate. A new kind of war is upon us, one characterized by coercion rather than the use of force, says former State Department official James Lewis, a cybersecurity specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Businesses and individuals now are directly affected in ways that were impossible in the first Cold War. In another age, the threat of nuclear annihilation loomed over everyone\u2019s heads, but the cloak-and-dagger doings of global powers remained distinct from the day-to-day operations of businesses. Now, they are hopelessly entangled. The often unfathomable priorities of terrorists, cybercriminals and state-affiliated hackers only make things worse.The current climate of cyberattacks is \u201ccrazy,\u201d says       Christopher Ahlberg       of Recorded Future, a private intelligence firm that specializes in cyberthreats. \u201cIt\u2019s like a science-fiction book. If you told anybody 10 years ago about what\u2019s going on now, they wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dIn the first Cold War, the U.S., China and the Soviet Union fought proxy wars rather than confront one another directly. In Cold War 2.0, we still have those\u2014Syria and whatever is brewing in North Korea come to mind\u2014but much of the proxy fighting now happens online.The result is significant collateral damage for businesses that aren\u2019t even a party to the conflicts, says       Corey Thomas,        chief executive of cybersecurity firm Rapid 7. Recent ransomware attacks that some analysts attribute to Russia might have been aimed at Ukraine but resulted in the shutdown of computer systems at businesses and governments around the world. Russia has denied involvement in these attacks. Botnets made of internet-connected devices, stitched together by an unknown hacker for unknown reasons, caused countless internet services and websites to become unavailable in October 2016.The U.S. has, notably, contributed to the situation. The Stuxnet computer worm, in development by what analysts believe was a joint U.S. and Israeli team since at least 2005, physically damaged Iran\u2019s nuclear-enrichment plant in 2009. Stuxnet was discovered a year later. In 2012, U.S. Air Force General       Michael Hayden      lamented that its use had legitimized sophisticated cyberattacks that do physical damage. Its source code can now be downloaded, studied\u2014and reused.You can think of cyberweapons as akin to biological weapons. They often spread beyond their original targets, and once they are stolen or used, their DNA\u2014the underlying code\u2014can be endlessly repurposed. Exploits stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency have subsequently been used in attacks such as WannaCry, which hit businesses in the U.S. and around the world.             Microsofthas made this point and called for a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention.\u201dAttacks on businesses and individuals are often quite deliberate, says       Milena Rodban,        a geopolitical risk consultant who helps companies practice for cyberattacks and other crises. That\u2019s because, more than ever, companies hold information that could be leveraged in a cyberwar.\u201cThe information that Amazon is holding\u201d\u2014for example, data from financial institutions and government agencies stored on Amazon\u2019s cloud\u2014\u201ccould give someone a clear path into something really terrible that could upset national security,\u201d Ms. Rodban says.As a result, she adds, anyone who thinks about how to protect national security in the cyber arena must expand their definition of a national-security asset. While U.S. Cyber Command might be tasked with defending government assets, it must also consider how it will cope with the takedown of a major cloud-service provider, which in some ways is no less important than, say, the power grid.Fixing this vulnerability could mean a great many things, from increased cooperation between government and private enterprise, to a broader role for U.S. Cyber Command in protecting U.S. businesses. The head of Cyber Command has said that government will need access to private firms\u2019 networks if it is to help them defend against threats. The Trump administration is considering an Obama-era proposal to split Cyber Command from the NSA, so its offensive capability can be kept apart from the NSA\u2019s mandate to gather intelligence.In the first Cold War, the doctrine of mutually assured destruction kept nuclear-armed states from using their weapons. In the same way, China, the U.S. and Russia are held back from taking out critical infrastructure in each others\u2019 countries, a capability experts widely believe all three have. (Look at attempts by Russian hackers to do just that in Ukraine.)\u201cWhat\u2019s happened over the past year or two is nation-state capabilities have gotten into the hands of criminals,\u201d says Mr. Ahlberg. \u201cThe bad guys picking up on these tool sets are not holding back.\u201dAt their most dire, experts claim it is only a matter of time before America is hit by a \u201cCyber 9/11.\u201d Terrorists haven\u2019t yet shut down our power grid, but how long until that capability leaks into the hands of actors who aren\u2019t restrained by the threat of retaliation? \u201cIt\u2019s like a suicide bomber,\u201d says Ms. Rodban. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to believe this could happen on the cyber level.\u201dWrite to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'In Today\u2019s Cyberwar, Everyone Is a Target.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-cyberwarfare-makes-cold-wars-hotter-1500811201", "keywords": ["attacks,cyber,cyberattacks,cyberhacking,cybersecurity,cyberwar,cyberwarfare,hacking,it,malware,ransomware,security,warfare,worm,Corey Thomas,Milena Rodban,Christopher Ahlberg,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,cybercrime,risk news,military action"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 07:00:00", "news_title": "Trump Request for Voter Details Rattles States ", "content": "State election officials often fly under the radar, and many prefer it that way.Now they are being thrust into the spotlight by an unusual records request from President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election-integrity commission, along with an intensifying debate over cybersecurity.And, on both fronts, tensions have arisen with federal authorities.U.S. and state officials both say they want fair and accessible elections. But state officials described frustrations as the two sides debate the best way to cooperate.\u201cThese federal efforts are causing a lot of alarm at the state level, particularly for chief election officials,\u201d said Kay Stimson, a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan National Association of Secretaries of State. \u201cIt\u2019s bipartisan,\u201d she added.On July 19, the election-integrity commission, formally known as the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, held its first meeting in Washington, D.C. The panel\u2019s chairman is Vice President       Mike Pence      .Mr. Trump has claimed that voter fraud was the reason Democrat       Hillary Clinton       won the popular vote in the 2016 election. Independent experts say no evidence supports that claim.Last month, before the panel\u2019s meeting in Washington, state officials of both parties criticized its request for voters\u2019 personal information, to the extent permitted by state law, sent in a letter to all 50 states by commission vice chairman Kris Kobach.Several states said their laws prevented them from providing all the requested information and expressed concerns about privacy and data-sharing. Others said they viewed the request as potential federal interference in what they say is a state matter. Some said that they thought the panel was unwarranted because experts say there isn\u2019t evidence of widespread voter fraud.\u201cThey can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mississippi is a great state to launch from,\u201d said Delbert Hosemann, Mississippi Secretary of State and a Republican.Since then, the commission has asked states to wait on submitting the voter records until U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington issues a ruling in a lawsuit filed by a privacy advocacy group over the panel\u2019s request.At a meeting of the commission last week, Mr. Trump questioned states\u2019 decisions to hold back information. \u201cIf any state does not want to share this information, one has to wonder what they are worried about, and I asked the vice president, I asked the commission, what are they worried about?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s something, there always is.\u201dThe commission asked only for information that is in many cases already publicly available and isn\u2019t trying to violate voters\u2019 privacy, said Bill Gardner, New Hampshire Secretary of State and a Democrat, who also is a member on the panel.Tensions between federal and state authorities are also evident as Washington attempts to help the states guard their election infrastructure against cyberattacks.Also recently, Department of Homeland Security official Jeanette Manfra said evidence suggests hackers may have targeted election computer systems in several states during the 2016 election, causing alarm in state capitals and Washington about the voting process.Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on July 19 that states that refuse federal cybersecurity help for their election systems are \u201cnuts.\u201d\u201cAll of the input I get from all of the states are, \u2018We don\u2019t want you involved in our election process,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Kelly said, in remarks at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.He added, \u201cI think they\u2019re nuts if they don\u2019t [seek federal help]. But if they don\u2019t want it\u2014the help\u2014they don\u2019t have to ask.\u201dDHS began offering cybersecurity assistance to state and local officials last August, as U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies detected potential hacking attempts against election systems.By the November election, 33 states and 36 cities and counties had used DHS tools or sought advice from the agency,       Jeh Johnson,        the former secretary of homeland security, told the House Intelligence Committee last month.In January, Mr. Johnson formally designated election systems \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d which federal officials said would help DHS place a higher priority on election-security efforts. But state election officials said it wasn\u2019t clear how the designation would help them. Several state officials said they are worried states would provide information to DHS but might not get timely intelligence about potential threats in return.\u201cThere is certainly some tension,\u201d said Edgardo Cort\u00e9s, commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections. \u201cThis is new for everyone, so it\u2019s going to take some time for everyone to work well together.\u201dTre Hargett, Tennessee\u2019s secretary of state, said that Mr. Kelly \u201cmade clear the door was open for states to ask for assistance.\u201d\u201cSecretary Kelly made clear the door was open for states to ask for assistance,\u201d said Mr. Hargett, a Republican. \u201cOffering assistance to states is a much welcome change from the opaque manner in which elections systems were designated as critical infrastructure by the Department of Homeland Security, with little guidance or notice to election officials.\u201dState officials met with federal representatives earlier this month at a conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State in Indianapolis. An acting deputy undersecretary at DHS, Robert Kolasky, said the agency was working to answer questions about organizing a \u201ccoordinating council\u201d for information-sharing and whether some state officials would be eligible for security clearances to view classified threat information.Mr. Kolasky, who attended the meeting in Indianapolis, said things hadn\u2019t always gone smoothly as the federal government becomes more active in guarding against hacking in election systems, but said relations are improving.\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with the characterization of growing pains, but I think we\u2019re on the right track to make real progress in the next couple months,\u201d he said.Appeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Federal Push on Elections Riles States.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tensions-arise-between-states-election-integrity-panel-1500807602", "keywords": [" cybersecurity,elections, fair elections, state and federal elections,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,department of homeland security,executive branch,national,presidential elections"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 07:00:00", "news_title": "Battle Is On Over Government\u2019s Version of Yelp for Banks ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A government complaint database popular with consumers has become the latest battleground for efforts to curb the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s authority.The public database run by the bureau draws thousands of complaints about companies each week. But businesses say it spreads unverified negative information about them. Now the Trump administration wants to make the information private, saying the information isn\u2019t sufficiently verified by the government. Critics say the move would weaken a tool for consumers and businesses to resolve disagreements.Since its launch in 2011, the complaint-filing system has grown rapidly, becoming a leading online deposit of consumer complaints on financial products and services. Consumers so far have submitted 1.2 million complaints\u2014of which more than 800,000 are publicly searchable\u2014on issues such as mortgages, credit reporting and debt collection. That total is far more than the 30,000 cases handled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u2019s complaint portal, which also opened in 2011.The CFPB says 97% of consumers receive a response within 15 days of filing a complaint. Consumers sometimes report on social media and elsewhere that the process can quickly resolve outstanding disagreements with financial firms.Financial companies have long criticized the database as a bureaucratic function that harms their reputations. Responding to calls from industry groups, the Treasury Department in June recommended restricting access to the data to federal and state regulators.\u201cOne of the most frequent criticisms of the database is that, because it does not verify complaints or provide sufficient context regarding the related market and industry practices, it subjects companies to unwarranted reputational risk,\u201d the Treasury Department said in its June report on financial regulation.Consumer advocates and some financial-services experts oppose the idea, saying that the portal\u2019s public nature is what gives it teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s the             Yelp                   of financial services. Why would you want to eliminate that?\u201d said       Aaron Klein,        policy director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings Institution.Banks disagree. \u201cPublic disclosure of unverified consumer complaints does nothing to help people make informed and responsible financial decisions,\u201d said       Virginia O\u2019Neill,        senior vice president at the Center for Regulatory Compliance at the American Bankers Association. \u201cThe bureau has failed to address the significant problems in the accuracy, integrity and usefulness of the information reported in the database.\u201dThe dispute highlights areas of friction as the Trump administration and other Republicans consider rolling back rules put in place after the financial crisis. Those pushing for loosened rules say removing onerous and costly requirements would encourage more lending and economic growth. Opponents say such changes would bring back reckless behavior that caused the financial crisis.Consumers can use the database to evaluate financial products and identify companies that are prone to receiving complaints. Users also can opt to post anonymous descriptions of their experiences. The CFPB is looking at allowing consumers to provide feedback about the company\u2019s response, a plan fiercely opposed by industry. The CFPB confirms the consumer has had business relations with the company, but it doesn\u2019t verify the complaint itself.The database accepts small and large complaints, and some consumers report that turning to the CFPB spurs a lingering problem to resolution.John Lukach,        a 25-year-old St. Paul, Minn., social worker, said he was having difficulty making payments in 2015 on $120,000 in undergraduate and graduate degree loans, which consumed more than 80% of his monthly income after rent. He said he contacted customer service at student-loan servicer             Navient Corp.       to reduce a $730 a month private student loan payments \u201cprobably four to five times.\u201dHe was offered a temporary reduction for one of two loans but that later resulted in a higher monthly bill. \u201cI was at my wit\u2019s end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was out of control.\u201d After filing a complaint with the CFPB, he said Navient called two days later and offered several repayment options. \u201cIt was totally because of the CFPB database. It puts their feet to the fire.\u201dNavient CEO       Jack Remondi       said in a recent blog post that consumer feedback at the CFPB\u2019s portal was an \u201cimportant tool in helping us improve the way we work with borrowers,\u201d adding the company has responded to all complaints lodged there since it was launched in 2011. Mr. Remondi pointed out that a large number of complaints were related to disagreements over loan terms set when the loan was made.A Navient spokeswoman said customer privacy rules don\u2019t allow the company to comment on a customer without permission.Consultants, including accounting firms Ernst & Young Global Ltd. and Deloitte LLP, have started to provide services by using the database. The consultants offer companies advice on complaint records and that of their competitors, and advise on how to avoid potential enforcement actions from regulators based on complaint data.The CFPB says the database helps it determine stances in bank supervision and enforcement matters.According to PerformLine Inc., which analyzes regulatory data, companies that have received more than 10,000 complaints through the CFPB face a 64% chance of being fined by the regulator, compared with 7% for those with fewer than 2,000 complaints.             Wells Fargo                   & Co., for instance, had received 45,710 complaints ahead of a $185 million government fine in 2016 for engaging in illegal sales practices.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment.Write to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.comAppeared in the July 24, 2017, print edition as 'Consumer Complaint Database Draws Ire.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/muting-a-consumer-megaphone-1500807604", "keywords": [" banks,cfpb, complaint,consumer advocates, consumer financial protection bureau,database, financial product, regulation,trump, trump administration,u.s. regulators,Navient,NAVI,Wells Fargo,WFC,WFCL,Yelp,YELP,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,telecommunication services,integrated communications providers"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-23 07:00:00", "news_title": "China Races Ahead in Indian Ocean While India and Japan Take Baby Steps", "content": "BAY OF BENGAL\u2014Japan recently dispatched the largest warship it has built since World War II to a naval exercise here to signal its heightened commitment, alongside India and the U.S., to counter China\u2019s expanding ambitions in the Indian Ocean.The problem, however, is that Japan\u2019s growing cooperation with India is moving slowly and tentatively, while China has moved by leaps and bounds in developing vital ports and facilities in other countries around the Indian Ocean in recent years.Japan\u2019s relationship with India has become increasingly important in the effort to contain China amid uncertainty in both countries over the extent of the U.S. military\u2019s commitment to region.Japan, an island nation that relies heavily on seaborne trade and free sea lanes, has been beefing up its maritime defense forces and trying to forge stronger security ties with India through offers to build vital infrastructure and sell it amphibious aircraft and other military equipment.Japanese officials have expressed growing concern that tensions in the South and East China Seas could spread to the Indian Ocean, jeopardizing the country\u2019s important trade links with fast-growing nations in Africa, as well as with Middle Eastern countries that supply Japan with around 90% of its crude-oil needs.But cooperating with India has proved incremental and challenging. This month, the U.S., Japan and India held their annual Malabar joint naval exercises, involving subs, destroyers and jet fighters. Hailed as one the effort\u2019s most celebrated achievements was the successful sale and transfer of small amounts of fuel by the Indian navy to a Japanese ship.The fuel sale was a \u201cvery historic event\u201d that demonstrated increased trust between the countries, said Rear Adm.       Yoshihiro Goka,        Japan\u2019s commander for the exercises, speaking with The Wall Street Journal aboard the USS Nimitz.U.S. officials said they also purchased fuel from India\u2019s navy, the first use of a logistics-sharing agreement signed last August with India that marked a major shift away from India\u2019s decades of military neutrality toward the U.S.\u201cWe are increasingly operating at further ranges from our own shores, and our integral logistics are quite stretched,\u201d said Rear Adm.

Foresea Life Insurance chairman       Yao Zhenhua       was in February barred from working in the insurance industry for 10 years.During a major conference last week, China\u2019s President       Xi Jinping       urged the financial sector to better serve the real economy and ward off systemic risks.\u2014Yifan Xie", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-regulator-tells-insurers-to-keep-their-noses-clean-1500794400", "keywords": ["china insurance,Liang Tao,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,insurance,financial services"]}]
