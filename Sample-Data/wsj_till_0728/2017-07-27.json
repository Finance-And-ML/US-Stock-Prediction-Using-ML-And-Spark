Ms. Inada denied any coverup but acknowledged on Friday that she had handled the matter poorly.The Ministry of Defense initially said the document had been lost, but a copy later emerged. It was one of several cases during Ms. Inada\u2019s short term when she had to reverse course on earlier statements.Ms. Inada had suggested that the nation\u2019s military forces wanted voters to choose the ruling party in Tokyo assembly elections earlier this month\u2014a statement that was widely criticized as a violation of the military\u2019s traditional neutrality in politics. She later withdrew the comment, and the party suffered a heavy defeat in the election.Mr. Abe has also been hurt by accusations, which he denies, that his government helped a longtime Abe friend open a veterinary school.The debate over the South Sudan mission highlighted the sensitivity of military issues in Japan. Mr. Abe has proposed revising the nation\u2019s constitution, which prohibits the use of force to settle international disputes, and pushed through a law in September 2015 that enabled Japanese forces to cooperate more closely with U.S. allies outside of Japanese territory.The U.N. keeps about 12,000 troops in a peacekeeping operation in South Sudan, which became engulfed in conflict in 2013 after gaining independence in 2011. Japan at one point contributed about 330 engineers before pulling out in May.The question of whether Japanese forces had been ensnared in fighting in the country in July 2016 occupied much of Parliament\u2019s attention in the spring of this year when the document mentioning \u201ccombat\u201d emerged.Ms. Inada\u2019s resignation came a day after opposition leader Renho of the Democratic Party said she was stepping down. The twin resignations marked a setback for high-level political representation by women in Japan. Only around 10% of members of Japan\u2019s parliament are women, compared with a global average of about 23%, according to data compiled by the World Bank.The departure of Renho, who goes by a single name, showed that despite his troubles, Mr. Abe is likely to hold on to power for now because the leading national opposition force has also failed to capture voters\u2019 support. Renho\u2019s party also did badly in the Tokyo vote, while a local party led by Gov. Yuriko Koike captured the most seats.Write to Peter Landers at peter.landers@wsj.com and Matina Stevis at matina.stevis@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Japan\u2019s Defense Minister Resigns.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-defense-minister-resigns-in-blow-to-abe-1501210493", "keywords": ["japan, japan defense minister, resign, resignation, shinzo abe, tomomoi inada,Shinzo Abe,Tomomi Inada,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 22:15:00", "news_title": "Corrections & Amplifications", "content": "Plug Power Inc. sells fuel cells that can be used to power forklifts and other warehouse vehicles.

SpaceX\u2019s previous valuation was set in 2015 at $12 billion when Google parent             Alphabet Inc.       and mutual-fund company Fidelity Investments invested $1 billion.A SpaceX spokesman declined to comment. The             New York Times                   reported news of the fundraising Thursday.With some $10 billion in launch business on its books, including contracts from the Pentagon and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, SpaceX has set the pace for the budding commercial space industry. But in addition to its swift growth and lofty exploration ambitions\u2014including a manned flyby of the moon as early as next year\u2014much of the company\u2019s growth starting in the next few years is predicated on swiftly launching a separate, multibillion-dollar satellite-communication business.The valuation markup is a sign investors believe that SpaceX is on the path to meeting Mr. Musk\u2019s ambitious financial forecasts laid out in 2016.The company told investors last year that its satellite-internet business, still in development, would generate more than $30 billion of revenue by 2025, over six times as much as the launch business, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.The latest financing round would follow seven months of reliable launches and a marked increase in the cadence of SpaceX\u2019s missions. SpaceX has rebounded from launch delays stemming from explosions of a pair of Falcon 9 rockets in 2015 and 2016 as it tries to reassure commercial and U.S. government customers that it is safely ramping up its launch tempo.So far this year, SpaceX has launched 10 rockets, surpassing its previous record of eight in 2016. By year-end, some company officials envision launches occurring roughly every two weeks.Internal company documents from 2016 projected an average of one launch a week by 2019, or five times as many as its primary U.S. and European rivals.SpaceX needs to boost the cadence of launches, not only to deliver payloads for customers, but also to launch the proposed constellation of more than 4,000 communication satellites that would provide internet service.Last year, SpaceX projected the constellation would produce more than $15 billion in operating income by 2025. Another internal projections pegged the number of global subscribers above 40 million at that juncture. Indeed, deploying all the anticipated satellites would require roughly 180 separate rocket launches through 2025, according to the internal documents.In the latest funding round, SpaceX issued new stock at a price of $135 per share, a 74% increase over the price investors paid for shares in the company\u2019s last funding round in January 2015.Investors in the latest round secured a guarantee they would be paid back the amount of their investment before other earlier investors in the event SpaceX sells itself or is forced to liquidate. Such a provision, known as a senior liquidation preference, is a sweetener for investors that can encourage them to pay a bit more for their shares.Write to Rolfe Winkler at rolfe.winkler@wsj.com and Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'SpaceX Raises $350 Million, Lifting Valuation to $21 Billion.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rocket-maker-spacexs-valuation-soars-to-21-billion-1501199444", "keywords": ["elon musk,satellite,spacex,valuation,vc nm,SpaceX,Fidelity Investments,Alphabet Inc.

When that program was launched\u2014followed by a similar link between Hong Kong and Shenzhen that started late last year\u2014many expected it to herald a flood of money into mainland Chinese stock markets.Instead, so-called southbound flows have been more prominent, particularly with Hong Kong\u2019s market booming: The city\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng Index has risen 23% so far this year. The MSCI China Index, a gauge of Chinese companies listed abroad\u2014mostly in Hong Kong and New York\u2014is up 32%. By contrast, mainland markets have been lackluster, with the Shanghai Composite Index, up just 4.7% and the Shenzhen market down 5.2%.As money flows out of China and into Hong Kong, it is getting more expensive to trade stocks popular with Chinese investors, said       Rahul Chadha,        co-chief investment officer at Mirae Asset Global Investments.\u201cOne has seen huge amount of interest on the southbound side, and that\u2019s come from the fact that the [mainland] market hasn\u2019t gone anywhere this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is how markets or stocks get frothy.\u201dInterest from mainland investors in Chinese companies that aren\u2019t listed at home has helped push up the valuations of companies like             Tencent Holdings,       Mr. Chadha said. The tech giant\u2019s shares have consistently traded at or above 25 times expected earnings since the Stock Connect trading link was launched, using a measure commonly used by investors to value companies.Precise data on trading flows through the Stock Connect aren\u2019t available. However, data tracked by the             Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing                   indicate the scale of Chinese ownership of the city\u2019s stock market.Chinese buyers had purchased more than 10% of the issued share capital of 45 Hong Kong-listed companies at the end of June through the Stock Connect trading link, exchange data show.Global investors haven't shown the same enthusiasm for China: Foreigners using the Stock Connect own more than 10% of only five Chinese companies at the same point.In all, Chinese investors using the Stock Connect own 4.7% of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of large-cap Chinese companies with listings in the city, according to an analysis of exchange data.Market participants say investment flows from the mainland are a big factor driving the Hong Kong market\u2019s momentum, even if Chinese ownership of Hong Kong\u2019s market is still in single figures.\u201cWhilst the impact on the market overall is relatively small, the impact on specific stocks from Chinese investors can be more marked,\u201d said       Kevin Anderson,        head of investments for Asia-Pacific at State Street Global Advisors.Take             Sunac China Holdings Ltd.      , a Hong Kong-listed real-estate developer that recently purchased $6.5 billion of hotel and theme-park assets from Dalian Wanda Group. Mainland Chinese investors buying via the Stock Connect now collectively own around 24% of its shares, which have more than tripled in value since the start of the year. Or             China Southern Airlines Co.      , which is up more than 50% year to date. Mainland investors now control 20% of its share capital.As Hong Kong stocks rally, analysts have pointed to signs of increased amounts of borrowed money in the city\u2019s markets, known as margin financing.Margin loans rose 18% to 171.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$21.98 billion) at the end of 2016 compared with the year earlier, according to the latest available data from the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong. Such lending is 54% higher than at the end of 2014, when the Stock Connect launched.Investors often use borrowed money to amplify returns in a rising market. However, these loans become painful for investors to repay if the market turns, and result in margin calls if stocks fall below a certain level and the loans are called in.Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-investors-are-fueling-hong-kongs-stock-market-rally-1501203176", "keywords": [" chinese investors,hang seng index,hong kong exchange,hong kong market, hong kong stock market, stock connect,political,general news,real estate,property,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,main stock market commentary,stock market commentary"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 20:51:00", "news_title": "Trump Remark Stings Upstate New York, Sparks Debate", "content": "New York officials have sought to help people in ailing upstate counties by offering jobs programs or tax cuts.President       Donald Trump       this week suggested another plan for residents there: Leave.\u201cWhen you have an area that just isn\u2019t working like upper New York state\u2026you can leave, it\u2019s OK, don\u2019t worry about your house,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal\u00a0on Tuesday.His remarks have sparked a debate among New York officials and residents over whether moving out is a solution.\u2018When you have an area that just isn\u2019t working like upper New York state\u2026you can leave, it\u2019s OK, don\u2019t worry about your house.\u2019State\u00a0lawmakers in both parties who have been trying to stanch New York\u2019s population decline and revive the upstate economy pushed back.

Charges include conspiring to divert more than $1.2 million from accounts set up by the auto maker\u2019s joint training center with the UAW to buy designer clothing, jewelry, airfare and other items, according to documents filed by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.Federal prosecutors also charged Mr. Iacobelli, 57, with criminal violations for allegedly using more than $1 million in training-center funds for personal benefit, including the purchase of a $350,000 Ferrari, $37,500 ink pens, and $100,000 in home improvements.An attorney for Mr. Iacobelli declined to comment.

It negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the three companies on a quadrennial basis and the union is working to assure members and the public those talks were not swayed by bribes or personal favors.Mr. Iacobelli, a longtime labor-relations executive at Fiat Chrysler, was the company\u2019s lead negotiator for bargaining with the union for many years. Mr. Holiefield was once a fixture in Detroit, playing a key leadership role as domestic car companies recovered from the financial crisis.Fiat Chrysler CEO       Sergio Marchionne       told employees Thursday that the alleged misconduct was not \u201cknown nor sanctioned by FCA US\u201d and Mr. Iacobelli and others involved were \u201cimmediately separated\u201d from the company when it learned of the activities in June 2015, according to a memo obtained by The Wall Street Journal.The federal indictment lands at a sensitive time for the UAW, which is trying to organize factory workers at             Nissan Motor Co.\u2019s       auto plant in Mississippi and has a critical unionization vote scheduled for next week.Fiat Chrysler is also under federal scrutiny for its sales-reporting practices and alleged emissions violations on diesel engines.The indictment said other employees \u201cacting in the interest of employer FCA\u201d were involved in the alleged conspiracy along with Mr. Iacobelli, and said other \u201csenior UAW officials\u201d benefited from the prohibited payments and gifts.The company said it is cooperating with federal prosecutors on the UAW-related probe and \u201cintends to pursue all legal remedies\u201d against any other \u201cculpable\u201d individuals.Mr. Marchionne said the alleged conduct \u201chad nothing whatsoever to do with the collective bargaining process.\u201dThe misconduct allegedly began in 2009, the same year Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy under the control of Mr. Marchionne, and continued through 2014, federal prosecutors charge.

Iacobelli and Holiefield were the union and company\u2019s top bargainers leading negotiations at the time.The court filings alleges that Mr. Iacobelli and another Fiat Chrysler employee conspired to siphon money from accounts belonging to the UAW-Chrysler National Training Center to pay off Mr. Holiefield and other UAW officials, routing the money through a nonprofit charity and photography business established by Mr. Morgan to conceal the payments.The gifts and payments included airfare for Mr. Holiefield and his wife to fly around the U.S., a $262,219 payment for the couple\u2019s suburban Detroit home and a four-night stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel at a cost of $3,100 per night, federal prosecutors allege.Prosecutors also allege that Mr. Iacobelli worked with others at FCA to create a liberal spending policy for training-center credit cards to keep senior UAW officials \u201cfat, dumb and happy.\u201dUAW President       Dennis Williams,        in a statement, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the allegations and that the UAW has \u201czero tolerance for corruption or wrongdoing of this kind at any level.\u201dWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Chester Dawson at chester.dawson@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uaw-removes-narrow-universe-of-people-amid-training-fund-allegations-1501193830", "keywords": [" al iacobelli, fca, fca us, fiat, fiat chrysler automobiles, general holiefield, monica morgan,uaw, united auto workers,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,FCA.MI,FCAU,UAW,FCA US,corporate crime,legal action,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,labor disputes,cars,political,general news,crime,general labor issues,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 20:34:00", "news_title": "Senators Move to Block Trump From Ousting Attorney General Jeff Sessions", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Republicans on Thursday moved to block every path President       Donald Trump       might try to use to fire and replace Attorney General       Jeff Session      s, a step they worry would disrupt the independence of the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Sending the most powerful signal yet that Mr. Trump should back away from such action, the senators said they would try to thwart him through legislation, control of the calendar and the chamber\u2019s parliamentary rules.And, unlike in the health-care and tax debates, Democratic senators are aligning with them in an effort designed not only to protect Mr. Sessions, but also to shield the work being done by special prosecutor       Robert Mueller,        who was appointed by the Justice Department to examine Moscow\u2019s actions last year and whether the Trump campaign colluded with it. Russia and the president have denied any collusion.The chamber voted 98-2 Thursday night on legislation that would impose new sanctions on Russia in response to its election meddling. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t said whether he would sign the legislation, which includes a provision that would block him from lifting the sanctions unilaterally, which prior presidents have had the power to do.White House Press Secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders,        asked Thursday to allay Republican lawmakers\u2019 concerns about the president firing Mr. Sessions, reiterated her comments from a day earlier that the president was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Mr. Sessions. The president in tweets has also called his onetime ally \u201cweak.\u201dIn an interview with Fox News on Thursday, Mr. Sessions called the criticism \u201ckind of hurtful\u201d but said he was committed to stay on the job. \u201cHe has had a lot of criticisms, and he\u2019s steadfastly determined to get his job done, and he wants all of us to do our jobs, and that\u2019s what I intend to do,\u201d he said.In the interview with Fox\u2019s Tucker Carlson, which aired Thursday evening, Mr. Sessions said that he would leave if asked to by Mr. Trump, and that he thought he made the \u201cright decision\u201d in removing himself from the Russia investigation.\u201cI understand his feelings about it, because this has been a big distraction for him,\u201d Mr. Sessions said when asked about his recusal. \u201cI am confident I made the right decision, the decision that is consistent for the rule of law,\u201d he added.Lawmakers are concerned that if Mr. Trump fires Mr. Sessions\u2014who recused himself from the Moscow probe because he was a leading surrogate for the Trump campaign and had an undisclosed meeting with the Russian ambassador\u2014the president would then replace him with someone willing to fire Mr. Mueller.Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) told reporters Thursday that he would introduce a bill next week that would curtail the power of the president to fire a special counsel under some circumstances without approval from a federal judge. Democrats are expected to sign onto the legislation, including Sen.       Cory Booker       (D., N.J.), who is working with Mr. Graham to craft it.According to a January report from the U.S. intelligence agencies, Russia\u2019s interference was directed from the highest levels of its government. Its tactics included infiltrating and leaking information from party committees and political strategists; and disseminating through social media and other outlets negative stories about Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton       and positive ones about Mr. Trump, the report said.The legislation will say that \u201ca special counsel cannot be fired when they were impaneled to investigate the president or his team, unless you have judicial review of the firing,\u201d Mr. Graham said. He said the bill would apply to Mr. Trump and future presidents.\u201cWe need a check and balance here,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who as a member of the House in the 1990s helped manage impeachment proceedings against President       Bill Clinton       over perjury and obstruction-of-justice allegations. Mr. Clinton was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.Mr. Trump cannot directly remove Mr. Mueller, and Justice Department regulations require any firing to be for \u201cmisconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause.\u201d But the president could ask the leadership at the Justice Department to terminate Mr. Mueller.\u201cIf Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay,\u201d said Mr. Graham. \u201cAny effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.\u201d Mr. Graham said Mr. Trump was proposing \u201cturning democracy upside down\u201d by subverting the independence of the Justice Department.Other lawmakers also warned Mr. Trump against firing Mr. Sessions and trying to use his power to make a recess appointment in Congress\u2019 August break. The Senate has frequently held \u201cpro forma\u201d sessions in recent years in part to block the White House from making such appointments. The Senate is expected to hold \u201cpro forma\u201d sessions to block any move.\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of making a recess appointment to push out the attorney general, forget about it,\u201d said Sen.       Ben Sasse       (R., Neb.).In 2012, former President       Barack Obama       made several temporary appointments during brief Senate breaks, in an effort to overcome Republican resistance to his nominees. The Supreme Court later ruled he exceeded his constitutional authority.The Senate also could deny Mr. Trump the ability to replace Mr. Sessions permanently, because a pick must be approved by the Senate.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, tweeted this week that the committee\u2019s schedule for the year was already set and \u201cno way\u201d included room to consider an attorney-general nomination.There were a few signs on Thursday of a possible reduction in tensions between the Department of Justice and the White House.It was the first day this week that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t publicly criticize his attorney general on Twitter or elsewhere. Earlier this week, he described Mr. Sessions as \u201cbeleaguered\u201d and suggested he wasn\u2019t taking a tough enough stance against illegal leaks.On Wednesday evening, Justice Department spokeswoman       Sarah Isgur Flores       issued a statement decrying the \u201castonishing increase in the number of leaks of classified national security information.\u201dMs. Flores said the department agreed with White House communications director       Anthony Scaramucci      \u2014referred to as just \u201cAnthony\u201d in the statement\u2014that the leaks were \u201cundermining the ability of our government to function,\u201d and vowed to \u201caggressively pursue leak cases wherever they may lead.\u201dThursday\u2019s White House press briefing featured       Robert Hur,        principal associate deputy attorney general, praising Mr. Sessions\u2019 efforts to combat gang violence.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Senators Move To Block Trump Ousting Sessions.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-move-to-block-trump-from-ousting-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-1501197597", "keywords": ["donald trump,jeff sessions,lindsey graham,robert mueller,russia,senate republicans,Jeff Session,Robert Mueller,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 20:31:00", "news_title": "House Provides Assurance to GOP Senators on \u2018Skinny Repeal\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A Senate vote on a slimmed-down repeal of the Affordable Care Act stretched into the early hours of Friday as GOP leaders continued discussions with lawmakers on the chamber\u2019s floor.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) introduced the text of the so-called skinny-repeal bill shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday after 11th-hour talks with House Republican leaders.In a tumultuous day on Capitol Hill, Republican senators made an unexpected demand: They would only agree to pass the bare-bones bill if House Republicans pledged not to accept it, but instead begin negotiations between the two chambers.House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) responded late Thursday with a cautious statement saying the House would be willing to negotiate, but it took a second phone call to ease the lingering concerns of a handful of GOP senators.\u201cIf moving forward requires a conference committee, that is something the House is willing to do,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement signaling frustration with the Senate Republicans\u2019 difficulty in coalescing around a health bill.The bill's introduction capped weeks of internal debate over how to dismantle and replace the 2010 health-care law, often called Obamacare, after a series of broader proposals failed earlier this week to secure the 50 votes needed to pass.But many GOP senators said earlier Thursday that they would vote to pass the skinny repeal only if they received assurances that the House wouldn\u2019t immediately take it up and would instead start talks between the two chambers. Those talks would be a way to shape legislation that could attract 50 Republican senators\u2014an effort that has failed to date\u2014as well as a majority in the House.Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) and three other senators called a press conference late Thursday to say they would vote for the skinny bill only if they received assurances the House wouldn\u2019t take it up without changes.\u201cThe skinny bill as policy is a disaster,\u201d Mr. Graham said.But he agreed to support the bill after Mr. Ryan told a group of senators, \u201c\u2018Why would we want to own a bill that increases premiums and doesn\u2019t fix Obamacare?\u201d\u2019 Mr. Graham recounted.Mr. Graham said the four senators had made their stance public because of growing concerns that the House would simply take up that bill and pass it. Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of three dozen conservatives, told Mr. Graham in a phone call Thursday that there was a movement in the House to do just that, the senator said.In his statement, Mr. Ryan agreed to go to conference, but he sought to insulate the House if the two chambers can\u2019t strike a viable compromise by forcing the Senate to vote first on it.\u201cThe House remains committed to finding a solution and working with our Senate colleagues, but the burden remains on the Senate to demonstrate that it is capable of passing something that keeps our promise, as the House has already done,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cWe expect the Senate to act first on whatever the conference committee produces.\u201dWith a 52-48 majority, Senate Republicans can lose no more than two GOP votes, even with Vice President       Mike Pence       potentially breaking a 50-50 tie. If the skinny repeal bill were to fail, it was unclear what paths would remain for GOP leaders, since other Republican proposals failed on the Senate floor this week.Democrats sharply criticized the GOP legislative process as irresponsible and dangerous.\u201cWe\u2019re in the Twilight Zone of legislating on a major, major piece of legislation,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.). \u201cThis day is not going to be a shining moment in the U.S. Senate.\u201dThe skinny repeal would undo the ACA\u2019s requirement that most people purchase health insurance or pay a penalty, and it would suspend enforcement through 2025 of a related requirement that most employers offer coverage. An unpopular tax on medical devices would be delayed through 2020, and funding would also be rescinded for a $1 billion public health program run through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The bill would also bar federal funding to Planned Parenthood Federation of America and other family planning clinics that perform elective abortions for a year, transferring $422 million instead to community health centers that don\u2019t offer the procedure. It would temporarily double the amount of money people can deposit in health-savings accounts.The bill also attempts to expand the use of ACA state waivers to get rid of some insurance regulations, such as a requirement that health plans cover mental health services and maternity care, though lawmakers are limited by budget rules in how much flexibility they can write into the legislation. Republicans blame the ACA\u2019s regulations for inflating the cost of insurance premiums.The bill\u2019s limited scope left many Senate Republicans anxious that if the House were to simply approve the skinny repeal bill, sending it to President       Donald Trump\u2019s       desk, they would fall far short of their goal to dramatically overhaul the health-care system.\u201cThe skinny repeal bill in the Senate doesn\u2019t even come close to honoring our promise of repealing Obamacare,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.).Health insurers warned this week of the danger of ending the requirement that individuals buy insurance. If younger, healthier people aren\u2019t prodded to buy insurance, offsetting the costs of less-well individuals, costs would rise and premiums would jump, they fear.On Thursday morning, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry\u2019s largest trade group, sent a letter to Mr. McConnell opposing skinny repeal.AHIP\u2019s president,       Marilyn Tavenner,        wrote that her group opposes any bill that repeals the individual coverage requirement without an adequate replacement while also failing to include funding to stabilize the insurance markets.House Freedom Caucus members balked at the bill coming straight to the House floor. The conservative group of about three dozen lawmakers helped pull the House health-care bill to the right.\u201cThe House bill was skinny enough,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Labrador (R., Idaho)Earlier Thursday, some House Republicans hadn\u2019t ruled out the idea of passing the Senate bill. Negotiations between the two chambers would likely be difficult, and it isn\u2019t clear they could produce a compromise that could pass both chambers. Centrist Republicans in the Senate have opposed steep cuts to federal Medicaid funding, while the House bill passed only after being pulled in a more conservative direction.House Republicans are scheduled to meet Friday morning to discuss whether to go to conference with the Senate or whether to simply pass whatever has cleared the Senate, said Rep.

She declined to say whether the president has confidence in his chief of staff.\u201cIf the president doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll make that decision,\u201d she said, adding that the reason for apparent conflicts between Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides is that \u201cthis is a White House that has lot of different perspectives, because the president hires the very best people.\u201dMr. Scaramucci indicated to The Wall Street Journal that he has spoken to Mr. Trump about his differences with Mr. Priebus. Asked in a text message Thursday morning when he would make his case to the president, Mr. Scaramucci responded: \u201cI spoke to him twice today.\u201dA New Yorker interview with Mr. Scaramucci published late Thursday afternoon was set to escalate tensions.In the interview, conducted late Wednesday, Mr. Scaramucci accused Mr. Priebus of leaking information about him. He called Mr. Priebus a \u201cparanoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac\u201d and said he wanted to \u201cf\u2014ing kill all the leakers.\u201dMr. Scaramucci also suggested White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was prioritizing his own image over that of the president. \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own c\u2014,\u201d he said, according to the New Yorker. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the f\u2014ing strength of the president. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\u201dIn a tweet following the New Yorker article\u2019s publication, Mr. Scaramucci said: \u201cI sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump\u2019s agenda.\u201dMessrs. Priebus and Bannon didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment on the New Yorker article, nor did the White House press office.Mr. Scaramucci reignited talk of a White House split with a tweet he made late Wednesday about a purported leak. When some people took the tweet to mean he was blaming Mr. Priebus, he deleted it and posted a new one: \u201cWrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks.\u201d\u201cIf Reince wants to explain that he\u2019s not a leaker, let him do that,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said on CNN Thursday. \u201cBut let me tell you about myself. I\u2019m a straight shooter and I\u2019ll go right to the heart of the matter.\u201dMr.\u00a0Scaramucci has said one of his top priorities was to stop staff from leaking to the news media. He has already forced out one press aide and has warned he would fire staff who leak.In a Wall Street Journal interview earlier this week, Mr. Trump said he was concerned primarily about intelligence leaks, and not leaks on White House palace intrigue, \u201cwhere they\u2019re fighting over who loves me the most.\u201dAsked in the interview if any more staff changes were planned in the immediate future, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201dFormer House Speaker       Newt Gingrich,        an administration ally who speaks often with the president, criticized Mr. Scaramucci in a radio interview Thursday with conservative host Laura Ingraham.\u201cI would say right now that he\u2019s being more pugnacious than effective,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally unhelpful to have someone going around starting family fights in public.\u201dAllies of Mr. Scaramucci defended him. Bryan Lanza, who served as deputy communications director on the Trump campaign but didn\u2019t enter the White House, said, \u201cAnthony is a colorful guy.

Joseph Dunford,        chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there would be no changes in the treatment of transgender troops until Mr. Trump issues further guidance on the matter.\u201cThere will be no modifications to the current policy until the president\u2019s direction has been received by the secretary of Defense and the secretary has issued implementation guidance,\u201d Gen. Dunford\u2019s memo said. \u201cIn the meantime, we will continue to treat all our personnel with respect.\u201dA spokeswoman for Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis,        Dana White, issued a statement later Thursday echoing Gen. Dunford\u2019s instruction. \u201cWe will provide detailed guidance to the Department in the near future for how this policy change will be implemented,\u201d Ms. White said.White House press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       declined to provide further details about the shift in policy. \u201cThe White House will work with the Department of Defense and all of the relevant parties to make sure that we fully implement this policy moving forward,\u201d she said at a news briefing. She didn\u2019t answer a question about the Pentagon\u2019s statement that it was awaiting guidance from the White House before implementing any change in policy.Ms. Sanders also didn\u2019t provide a timeline for when the White House or Pentagon might implement such a policy shift. \u201cI believe they\u2019re going to start moving on it quickly,\u201d she said, although it wasn\u2019t clear whether she was referring to the White House or the Pentagon.Gen. Dunford\u2019s instructions to avoid any changes in military practice follows a day of confusion at the Pentagon and in units around the world over how to interpret Mr. Trump\u2019s decree on Twitter regarding transgender troops.In a series of tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the government \u201cwill not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.\u201d He cited the need for focusing the military on \u201cdecisive and overwhelming victory\u201d and said it couldn\u2019t afford the costs and disruption of having transgender service members.The Pentagon decided last year to eliminate a ban on openly serving transgender troops currently in the military, a move that came after it lifted a ban on gays and opened combat jobs to women. Mr. Mattis in June delayed the start of recruiting transgender troops pending further study.Pentagon officials were taken by surprise by Mr. Trump\u2019s message on Twitter, an official familiar with the matter said Wednesday, and it was unclear the extent to which Mr. Mattis was consulted on the decision. The White House said Mr. Mattis was told of the change after Mr. Trump made his decision.The Pentagon\u2019s press office said Wednesday evening the department wasn\u2019t issuing guidance to subordinate units until it received clarification from the White House.\u00a0Gen. Dunford\u2019s announcement Thursday reiterated that message as a formal direction to commanders from the top officer in the military.Ms. Sanders said Wednesday the policy had yet to be formed and would be hammered out with the Defense Department likely taking the lead.\u201cThe Department of Defense and the White House will have to work together on as implementation takes place,\u201d she told reporters Wednesday.Elsewhere in the military community, the Department of Veterans Affairs also said it hasn\u2019t changed course with its policies.\u201cVA\u2019s policy has not changed,\u201d said spokesman Curt Cashour. \u201cWe provide care, benefits and other VA services to all veterans, including transgender veterans.\u201d He didn\u2019t say whether VA Secretary       David Shulkin       had been consulted on Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.Eric Fanning, who was secretary of the Army under former President       Barack Obama,        said the department\u2019s current transgender policy was instituted after months of deliberation.\u201cNo policy has ever been dictated this way,\u201d said Mr. Fanning, who was the first openly gay secretary of a U.S. military service. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to call it policy.

Prosecutors allege that he lied to the investors in the hedge fund, then used cash and stock from Retrophin to cover the losses.Mr. Shkreli, who is also facing civil charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a $65 million lawsuit filed by Retrophin, has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. Mr. Brafman is expected to finish his summation Friday morning, and the government will deliver a rebuttal. The jury will then begin deliberating.In a comment posted on his             Facebook                   page shortly after court adjourned for the day, Mr. Shkreli said: \u201cMy case is a silly witch hunt perpetuated by self-serving prosecutors. Thankfully my amazing attorney sent them back to junior varsity where they belong. Drain the swamp. Drain the sewer that is the DOJ. MAGA.\u201dIn a roughly four-hour summation, Assistant U.S. Attorney       Alixandra Smith       detailed four overlapping schemes, piecing together two-dozen witnesses and dozens of exhibits, from the five-week trial.From 2009 to 2011, as Mr. Shkreli courted investors for MSMB Capital, Ms. Smith said, he told them he had at least $30 million under investment in the fund, and described a track record of success in hedge funds.In fact, Ms. Smith said, the fund never had more than $3 million, and at times was just a couple hundred dollars. After a disastrous trade in February 2011 wiped out all his investors\u2019 money, MSMB Capital ceased trading activity altogether, and had no money in its account, said Ms. Smith.But Mr. Shkreli didn\u2019t tell his investors about the loss, to whom he continued to send performance reports suggesting they were making impressive returns, Ms. Smith said. Instead, he started raising money for MSMB Healthcare, using some of the funds to pay an angry MSMB Capital investor and putting more than $2 million into his new company, Retrophin.MSMB Healthcare, Ms. Smith said, \u201cbasically existed to funnel money to Retrophin.\u201dIn September 2012, Mr. Shkreli told investors he was shutting down both funds. Ms. Smith described the following months as frantic, as Mr. Shkreli\u2014working with a lawyer from Retrophin\u2014transferred shares of Retrophin among employees and MSMB investors to satisfy redemption demands.\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to take responsibility for what he did,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t want to pay them back himself.\u201d After taking Retrophin public through a reverse merger, Mr. Shkreli engineered settlements and consulting agreements between Retrophin and investors from the MSMB funds, Ms. Smith said, without Retrophin board\u2019s approval.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers didn\u2019t call any witnesses in the trial. But during his summation, Mr. Brafman said the cross-examinations of government witnesses\u2014which Ms. Smith, he said, had \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d in her closing remarks\u2014were critical to \u201cfill out the narrative.\u201dMuch of Mr. Brafman\u2019s summation focused on the investors in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s hedge funds and Retrophin board members who had testified for the government, on several occasions describing aspects of their testimony as \u201crich people b.s.\u201dMr. Shkreli had no obligation to repay his investors, Mr. Brafman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re committing a fraud, you don\u2019t care about making people whole,\u201d Mr. Brafman said. \u201cEverything he did is inconsistent with bad faith.\u201dAll of the investors eventually made their money back and in fact made a profit off the sale of Retrophin shares, Mr. Brafman pointed out. As an aside, Mr. Brafman observed, he puzzled that some investors seemed not to be able to recall how much money they had made, sometimes offering estimates that varied by several hundred thousand dollars.\u201cRich people know exactly how much money they have, exactly how much money they make\u201d Mr. Brafman said, to laughter in the packed courtroom. \u201cThat\u2019s how they became rich.\u201d", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecution-in-martin-shkreli-case-makes-final-push-1501200412", "keywords": ["martin shkreli ,martin shkreli trial,pharma bro,pharma bro trial,Retrophin,RTRX,Facebook,FB,Securities and Exchange Commission,Martin Shkreli,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,fraud,biotechnology,pharmaceuticals,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,health care,life sciences,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 20:02:00", "news_title": "Republicans Set Terms of Debate of Bill Funding Trump\u2019s Border Wall ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014House Republicans passed legislation on Thursday funding President       Donald Trump\u2019s       promised wall along the southwest border, having set the terms of the debate to let members avoid having to vote directly on the proposal.The measure passed 235-192. Five Democrats voted for the bill, with the support of 230 Republicans.Mr. Trump made the border wall a central campaign promise, while vowing Mexico would pay for its construction. Many Republicans support the idea, but most Democrats are opposed and some in the GOP also have misgivings.Hoping to deliver Mr. Trump a victory, Republican leaders plucked the $1.6 billion in funds to begin the wall\u2019s construction from the Homeland Security spending bill and\u00a0added it to\u00a0a popular bill funding the military, veterans and other matters.Several GOP aides said leaders were concerned that a straightforward vote on the wall itself would fail. To avoid that, they employed a maneuver by which the wall funding was automatically added to the larger defense bill after a vote setting rules for debate on the measure. That vote passed 230-196\u00a0on Thursday, mostly along party lines.In addition, the House Rules Committee barred consideration of any amendments related to border security or the wall.The maneuvering over the border wall followed another controversy that threatened to bring down the military-spending bill, this one over transgender service members. That matter was defused after Mr. Trump declared on Wednesday, via his Twitter account, that he would bar transgender Americans from the military. No amendments on this subject were permitted either.On the House floor, Republicans said the existing border fencing was working to stem illegal immigration and that additional barriers would continue to improve security.\u201cIf immigrants are crossing this border illegally, then so are drug traffickers, smugglers and human traffickers,\u201d said Rep.       John Carter       (R., Texas).Rep.       Louise Slaughter       (D., N.Y.) and other Democrats countered by pointing to Mr. Trump\u2019s oft-repeated promise that Mexico would fund the project. Ms. Slaughter said the proposal came with \u201cnary a peso from Mexico.\u201d\u201cOur nation does not barricade itself away from the rest of the world,\u201d she said.The proposed $1.6 billion for next year would pay for a total of about 74 miles of new or replacement barriers, for an average cost of about $21 million per mile. That includes 32 miles of new border wall and 28 miles of a new levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, and 14 miles of replacement secondary fencing in San Diego.The underlying bill includes $658 billion for military training and equipment; $37.6 billion for energy and water infrastructure and nuclear-weapons-programs security; and nearly $89 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bill would also increase funding for the Capitol Police, to $422.5 million.The addition of border-wall funding complicates the path forward in the Senate, where Republicans need 60 votes to clear most legislation but control only 52 seats. Senate Democrats have said they wouldn\u2019t support the wall funding.That is on top of another, broader problem besetting the measure. Democrats are worried that Republicans will try to relax\u00a0military-spending\u00a0curbs imposed by a 2011 budget law without ensuring equal treatment for nonmilitary spending. Without an agreement to treat both types of spending equally, Senate Democrats have warned they would vote against military spending legislation.In the House, the spending bill also\u00a0overcame the threat of a\u00a0revolt from some House conservatives over a separate issue.Two weeks ago, an amendment to ban spending on gender-reassignment surgery for transgender service members failed on the House floor, and GOP leaders told proponents that a second vote wasn\u2019t likely to turn out differently. Proponents asked leadership if there was some other way for Congress to force a policy change and were told no.Some conservatives then threatened to oppose the military spending bill unless the White\u00a0House promised that the military wouldn\u2019t\u00a0use tax dollars for these procedures, a House Republican aide said Thursday.Conservatives in both the House Freedom Caucus and the Republican Study Committee lobbied the White House, holding conversations with policy staff and \u201cat the highest levels,\u201d one aide said. Two other aides said that Mr. Trump was concerned that the spending bill\u2014including money for the border wall\u2014could fail if he didn\u2019t act on the transgender issue.The conservatives didn\u2019t request an outright ban on transgender people serving in the military\u2014only a guarantee taxpayer funds wouldn\u2019t pay for gender-reassignment surgery. They were surprised by Mr. Trump\u2019s Wednesday morning announcement, which reversed an Obama-era change. Pentagon officials said they, too, were surprised.News that the transgender issue had become caught up with the border wall was upsetting to at least one House Democrat.\u201cTrump is kicking transgender men and women out of our armed services to make sure he can get money to build his stupid, irresponsible, unnecessary wall,\u201d said Rep.       Ruben Gallego       (D., Ariz.).A White House spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, White House spokeswoman       Sarah Huckabee Sanders       said Mr. Trump made the decision after consultation with his national security team and because he believed that service of transgender people \u201cerodes military readiness and unit cohesion.\u201d\u2014Ben Kesling and Kate Davidson contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Measure Aims to Fund Border Wall.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-open-debate-on-bill-funding-trumps-border-wall-1501179291", "keywords": ["border wall,house leaders,house republicans,legislation,mexico, transgender military service, transgender people ,Department of Veterans Affairs,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:58:00", "news_title": "Iran Test-Launches Rocket Designed to Carry Satellites ", "content": "Iran successfully test-launched a rocket designed to carry satellites into space on Thursday, official media reported, a move that could further inflame tensions with the U.S. as Congress passes new sanctions on the country.The test-launch of the rocket, called the Simorgh, or \u201cPhoenix\u201d in Persian, took place at the official opening of a space center around 140 miles east of Tehran, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The Simorgh can carry satellites weighing up to 250 kilograms into low-earth orbit, it said.In Washington, State Department spokeswoman       Heather Nauert       said the U.S. considers the launch to be in violation of the spirit of a landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between world powers and Iran.She also said it violates a United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the deal, a complaint the U.S. has lodged with respect to other Iranian missile tests. The U.N. resolution in question doesn\u2019t specifically bar missile testing but calls on Iran not to undertake such activities.U.S. military officials said Thursday that there was no indication that any satellite had been successfully deployed or that the rocket had reached space.Capt. Brian Maguire, a spokesman for US Strategic Command, said the military tracks more than 24,000 objects in space that are bigger than a softball and that there was \u201cnothing new to add\u201d to the list on Thursday.While Iran\u2019s satellite launches aren\u2019t part of its ballistic missile program, some of the country\u2019s critics in the West see satellite-carrying rockets as abetting missile development and contrary to the spirit of international agreements. Many of the technologies used in satellite launches have applications in long-range missiles.The U.S. sees the move as a \u201cprovocative action\u201d and as \u201ccontinued missile development,\u201d Ms. Nauert said.In an interview earlier this week with The Wall Street Journal, President       Donald Trump       said he doesn\u2019t expect to find Iran to be in compliance with the nuclear deal when a periodic administration review is due in October, and said he would overrule his aides, including Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson,        to declare Iran noncompliant.\u201cLook, I have a lot of respect for Rex and his people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to say they comply. It\u2019s a lot easier. But it\u2019s the wrong thing. They don\u2019t comply.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s view is at sharp odds with that of officials from the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog and European allies, who have repeatedly concluded Iran is complying with the 2015 agreement.The rocket launch came as the House on Tuesday passed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia, North Korea and Iran by a vote of 419 to three.If the bill is passed by the Senate with a veto-proof majority, as expected, it would put new restrictions on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.The Trump administration has already sanctioned dozens of Iran-related entities and individuals over the ballistic missile program since taking office in January, most recently last week.Iranian leaders see the moves as U.S. attempts to undermine 2015\u2019s landmark nuclear deal with six world powers, a foreign-policy priority of the Obama administration under which Iran received relief from international sanctions in exchange for curbs on its disputed nuclear program.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi on Wednesday called the sanctions passed in the House this week \u201cillegal and insulting,\u201d according to IRNA, adding that they put the nuclear deal\u2019s implementation at risk despite Iran\u2019s adherence to its provisions.The nuclear deal made no mention of missiles or satellites, but a United Nations Security Council resolution that helped enact it \u201ccalled upon\u201d Iran not to undertake any activity relating to the development of ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads.Iran test-launched ballistic missiles before and after the deal took effect. Iranian officials have asserted that the program doesn\u2019t violate the deal because the missiles aren\u2019t designed to carry nuclear payloads, and have vowed to push forward with the program.\u2014Dion Nissenbaum and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iran-test-launches-rocket-designed-to-carry-satellites-1501177285", "keywords": ["iran,iran nuclear,iran sanctions,u.s.-iran,United Nations Security Council,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,nuclear weapons programs,sciences,humanities,space exploration,travel,weapons programs,space transport,aerospace,defense,industrial goods,transportation,logistics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:58:00", "news_title": "GOP Lawmakers, White House Outline Tax Plan ", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Top congressional Republicans and the Trump administration abandoned a controversial House GOP plan to tax imports and exempt exports from taxes, as they announced tax policy principles that resolved few other crucial issues.Border adjustment, as the proposal was known, was a central part of the strategy House Speaker       Paul Ryan       outlined last year. Its goal was to generate $1 trillion in revenue over a decade to help pay for corporate-tax cuts and to prevent companies from shifting profits to low-tax foreign countries. The idea had been politically imperiled for months amid objections from retailers and Republican senators.The final blow came Thursday, in a broad statement of principles released by party leaders to build Republican unity on tax policy and create momentum for advancing legislation this fall.The statement emphasized a common goal of reducing individual and corporate rates and individual tax rates \u201cas much as possible.\u201d It also called for faster writeoffs for capital expenses, an idea meant to promote investment, though it stopped short of a House Republican proposal for immediate writeoffs.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.The shared principles in effect represent a starting point for the approaching debate. Party leaders\u2019 willingness to release a framework is also a sign of their confidence in getting a bill written and passed.Still, Thursday\u2019s statement left critical questions unanswered, such as how much individual and corporate rates would be cut, and avoided addressing many of the tough trade-offs Republicans would need to make to achieve substantial reductions in tax rates, such as what deductions to eliminate.Taken together, it included less detail than President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign plan, the House GOP\u2019s June 2016 blueprint or the one-page White House offering in April.\u201cThis was a clear gate that we just went through with the White House and the senate,\u201d said Rep.       Kevin Brady       (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, whose panel will write the first version of the bill. \u201cIt just signals another big step we have to take.\u201dAn additional unknown remains how much revenue Republicans expect to generate with a new tax plan, making it unclear whether a tax overhaul will add to the deficit or leave it unchanged. The statement emphasizes permanent tax changes, which provide a fiscal constraint because congressional rules they are using won\u2019t allow bigger deficits after a decade.\u201cThis tax reform has to move us toward a balanced budget, not away from it,\u201d Mr. Brady said.The document released Thursday stems from meetings held by the so-called Big Six: Mr. Ryan, Mr. Brady, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), Senate Finance Chairman       Orrin Hatch       (R., Utah), Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       and White House economic-policy chief       Gary Cohn.\u201cWe are confident that a shared vision for tax reform exists, and are prepared for the two committees to take the lead and begin producing legislation for the president to sign,\u201d the statement said.The statement says Mr. Trump \u201cfully supports these principles and is committed to this approach.\u201d\u201cHey, every step forward is progress, right?\u201d said Rep. Pat Tiberi (R., Ohio), a senior Ways and Means member. \u201cThis is about everybody trying to be closer to coming together.\u201dAs top negotiators sell the plan publicly, the pressure turns up on members of the tax writing committees who will turn principles into detailed legislation. They can draw from years of past studies and the bill that former Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp wrote in 2014.\u201cThere\u2019s still much work to be done to actually having a real statute that the Ways and Means committee can actually mark up,\u201d said GOP tax lobbyist Kenneth Kies. \u201cIt is a must-do piece of legislation if they want to do well in the midterm elections. To me, it\u2019s real simple. It\u2019s going to get done one way or the other.\u201dBorder adjustment\u2019s end was months in the making and Messrs. Ryan and Brady finally conceded Thursday, agreeing to language to \u201cset this policy aside\u201d in the name of unity.\u201cI\u2019m proud of that idea,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cNonetheless, we had as full a debate as you can have on a new tax idea and we simply didn\u2019t make the case. I simply didn\u2019t make the case.\u201dThey pursued border adjustment for two reasons: One is that it could have raised $1 trillion to pay for lower tax rates. The second is that by taxing based on the location of consumption, it could have prevented companies from shifting profits abroad. They had been reluctant to back down without a Plan B. Thursday\u2019s statement said, without offering detail, that there is a \u201cviable approach for ensuring a level playing field\u201d without border adjustment.\u201cThis is a very public declaration that the key elements of the [House] blueprint are dead,\u201d said Harold Hancock, a former GOP Ways and Means tax aide now at McGuireWoods LLP. \u201cThis has become a broaden-the-base, lower-the-rate exercise, and [will] not create a whole new tax regime for the United States.\u201dOne idea in play builds off a proposal Mr. Hatch has been working on for years, letting companies deduct all or part of their dividends. Mr. Brady said a \u201cbroad range\u201d of ideas was under discussion.Republicans face political and procedural constraints. They are trying to pass the tax plan using the special fast-track rules known as reconciliation, which is filled with trap doors and special rules.That means they must adopt a budget first. House Republicans are divided over their budget and senators haven\u2019t released their version yet.Republicans will have narrow margins because Democrats are extremely unlikely to provide any votes for a bill that sharply lowers tax rates on high-income households and corporations.\u201cIf Republicans continue this partisan process, they are doomed to repeat the same mistakes they have made trying to upend our health-care system,\u201d said Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.In the House, Republicans from New York and New Jersey are already balking at the GOP plan to repeal the deduction for state and local taxes. And any three senators could band together to force changes because Republicans have just a 52-48 majority.\u201cBig complicated tax bills do take a while,\u201d Mr. Kies said. \u201cWe\u2019re at the top of the first inning.\u201dWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'GOP Tax Plan Drops Levy on Imports.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-lawmakers-outline-tax-plan-1501180779", "keywords": ["border adjustment,gop tax plan,tax overhaul,tax policy,trump taxes,trump tax plan,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,lower house,treasury department"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:52:00", "news_title": "Insurers Say Senate \u2018Skinny\u2019 Health Bill Would Push Up Premiums", "content": "Senate Republicans\u2019 effort to pass a health overhaul has become a white-knuckle ride for health insurers that leaves them in a tough spot regardless of the outcome.The two biggest insurance industry groups, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, both came out strongly against a bare-bones, so-called \u201cskinny\u201d health repeal bill that would kill the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement for individuals to have insurance, without adding provisions to steady the existing health-law marketplaces. They believe that the ACA\u2019s mandate is important to keeping young, healthy enrollees in the fold, and their loss would push up rates and destabilize the exchanges.But beyond the \u201cskinny\u201d bill, insurers say there still is work to be done to provide security and stability for the individual market. With deadlines looming for them to make decisions about pricing and participation in the ACA exchanges for 2018, they still have no guarantee that the federal government will continue making payments that reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income ACA enrollees. Without those cost-sharing payments\u2014which are also not included in the Senate\u2019s narrow repeal bill\u2014insurers say that premiums will be far higher, and more companies may simply pull out.Insurers have also been hoping that Republican legislation would include funding aimed at blunting their costs for covering the sickest consumers, possibly through reinsurance. That is not in the Senate\u2019s \u201cskinny\u201d bill, but the industry hopes stabilization money, along with the cost-sharing payments, could be added if legislation moves forward in negotiations with the House, or included in separate legislation.If a \u201cskinny\u201d bill repealing the mandate became law, without the cost-sharing payments or stabilization funding, it would be a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d said\u00a0Gary Cohen, a vice president at Blue Shield of California. \u201cIf you said, what can I do to make premiums go higher, and create disincentives for healthy people to buy insurance, this is what you would do.\u201dBut, he said, even if Congress passes nothing, the lack of guarantee on the cost-sharing payments would still likely push up rates.And if the Senate passes a limited bill and there is a conference process with the House, \u201cit seems unlikely we\u2019d know what world we\u2019re operating in until September,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s way too late for us to make changes\u201d to rates for next year. So the insurer would have to move forward with premiums that assume the federal cost-sharing payments wouldn\u2019t be made, he said.Insurers face mid-August deadlines for setting 2018 rates. \u201cIt\u2019s uncertainty squared,\u201d said Tom Policelli, chief executive of nonprofit insurer Minuteman Health, who says the ACA itself created volatility for the individual insurance markets, which efforts to repeal it have now increased. \u201cAs a rational company, the only thing you can do is raise premiums or exit.\u201dSome insurers already have assumed in their filings that the individual mandate won\u2019t be enforced next year and that the cost-sharing payments won\u2019t be made, but others may scramble to update their requests, boosting 2018 rates further.Anthem                  \u00a0Inc.\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that if it doesn\u2019t quickly get more certainty about the future of the exchanges, it will likely further pull back its planned participation for next year. Chief Executive       Joseph R. Swedish       said that without greater clarity, particularly around the cost-sharing payments, \u201cwe will need to revise our rate filings to further narrow our level of participation.\u201d He added that the insurer may make decisions \u201cin a relatively short period of time\u201d and in September at the latest.Anthem, which has already disclosed plans to leave three of the 14 state exchanges where it offers plans, also said that if the cost-sharing payments are killed, it will need to seek rate increases of around 18% to 20% on exchange plans. The insurer said those increases would come on top of significant increases it is already seeking, which it said were 20% or more.The impact of losing the individual mandate and the cost-sharing payments would likely vary, depending on insurers\u2019 markets and actuarial assumptions. The Congressional Budget Office has previously estimated that the loss of the mandate could push up premiums for individual plans by 20%. Oliver Wyman, a consulting\u00a0unit of\u00a0\u00a0Marsh & McLennan, has projected that premiums might be roughly 9% higher if the mandate weren\u2019t enforced, while the loss of the cost-sharing payments might mean an 11% to 20% boost.In some rate filings that have already become public, insurers offered different estimates. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina said that of its 22.9% proposed increase for 2018, 14.1 percentage points were from assumed loss of the cost-sharing payments. BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee said that of its 21% boost, about 14 percentage points were tied to the lack of cost-sharing payments and 7 percentage points to the loss of enforcement of the mandate.Insurers and other health-care companies say the worry is that such significant rate increases might create a cascading effect, as more healthy people leave the market, pushing rates up even more in the future for the shrinking pool of increasingly unhealthy enrollees. Actuaries say this effect might be blunted if the ACA\u2019s premium subsidies remain in effect, since those protect many consumers from bearing the full brunt of rate increases.In a letter to Senate Democratic and Republican leaders, AHIP said that dumping the coverage mandate without other measures to preserve the marketplaces will lead to a situation where \u201cpremiums will rise rapidly, few or no affordable coverage options will be available, and more people will be uninsured.\u201dThe Blue Cross group called for stabilization efforts, a mechanism to prod healthy people to have coverage and the cost-sharing payments, and said \u201cany final legislation must include these crucial elements to avoid steep premium increases and diminished choices that would make coverage unaffordable and inaccessible.\u201dWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurers-say-senate-health-bill-doesnt-go-far-enough-premiums-will-still-rise-1501199190", "keywords": ["Blue Cross Blue Shield Association,America's Health Insurance Plans,Anthem,ANTM,Marsh & McLennan,MMC,Gary Cohen,Tom Policelli,Joseph R.

The same measure passed the House on Tuesday on a 419-3 vote. Senators interrupted a contentious debate Thursday over repealing the Affordable Care Act to vote on the sanctions.President       Donald Trump       hasn\u2019t said whether he would sign the measure, and administration officials have said the bill may infringe on presidential authority. Mr. Trump also has expressed skepticism about U.S. intelligence findings that Russia interfered in the election.But the White House said Thursday it would examine the final legislation before Mr. Trump decides whether to sign it.\u201cThe president and the administration support sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea,\u201d said White House press secretary       Sarah Huckabee Sanders.       \u201cWe continue to support strong sanctions against those three countries, and we\u2019re going to wait and see what that final legislation looks like and make a decision at that point.\u201dSen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.), the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman who returned to Washington this week after a diagnosis of brain cancer, said the bill\u2019s enactment was important.\u201cIn the last eight months, what price has Russia paid for attacking American democracy?\u201d Mr. McCain asked on the Senate floor. \u201cVery little. This legislation would begin to change it.\u201dThe provision that has concerned the White House would require the president to consult with Congress before relaxing any sanctions against Moscow or restoring Russia\u2019s control over diplomatic compounds in the U.S. that had been seized by the Obama administration as part of U.S. reprisals for the alleged election interference.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he hasn\u2019t decided whether he would sign the legislation into law. The bill can become law without the president\u2019s signature if it goes unsigned for 10 days.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen [the provisions] yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen them in final form.\u201dSens. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and       Rand Paul       (R., Ky.) voted against the sanctions bill.One key senator said Mr. Trump should sign the bill into law.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do, we hope he\u2019ll sign it,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cIf he vetoes it, he\u2019s showing Russia he doesn\u2019t really want a stronger hand.\u201dShould the bill become law, the president would have to notify Congress if he wants to lift sanctions on Moscow. Congress then would have 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to stop the president. Should Mr. Trump veto that resolution, Congress would have 10 days to override the veto.The legislation represents a political challenge for the president, coming as congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller are investigating Russia\u2019s actions last year in a probe that also is seeking to determine whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Mr. Trump and Russian officials have denied any collusion.A U.S. intelligence assessment in January concluded that the Russian interference was directed from the highest levels of its government. Its tactics included hacking state election systems; infiltrating and leaking information from party committees and political strategists; and using social media and other outlets to disseminate negative stories about Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton       and positive messages about Mr. Trump.The sanctions bill followed a winding path to passage. The Russia-Iran portion was approved by the Senate in June, but was held up by the House parliamentarian over constitutional questions. Negotiations between House and Senate leaders produced a new bill last week, combining a House-passed North Korea sanctions measure with revised Iran and Russia provisions.The compromise legislation would tighten restrictions on the extension of credit to Russian entities and mandate sanctions on those deemed to be undermining cybersecurity as well as those engaging in significant transactions involving the Russian defense and intelligence sectors.It would allow some joint energy ventures to go ahead, but would sanction new projects and joint ventures in which a sanctioned Russian person or entity holds a stake of 33% or more.The bill maintains a provision that says the president may impose penalties on firms backing a high-profile Russian pipeline project, but stops short of mandating penalties.That provision has upset Europeans because it poses a potential risk to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Gazprom project backed by a consortium of five European companies, to transport gas from Russia to Europe through the Baltic Sea.After European countries, including Germany and Austria, protested, lawmakers added a stipulation that the president may impose sanctions, but \u201cin coordination with allies of the United States.\u201dU.S. energy companies had lobbied Congress against the bill, citing their concern over an earlier version that included measures to block partnerships with Russian individuals or companies, which they said could scuttle any U.S. business partnership that involved Russian entities.The legislation also imposes new sanctions on Iran\u2019s ballistic-missile program and the Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps, and attempts to squeeze the cash available to North Korea for its nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.Russian President       Vladimir Putin,        speaking Thursday at a news conference in Finland, denounced the new sanctions as illegal, according to his comments carried by Russian news agencies. How Moscow responds would depend on the government\u2019s assessment of the legislation, Mr. Putin said.\u201cWe will have to respond at a certain point,\u201d he said, according to Russian news agencies. \u201cIt is impossible to constantly tolerate indecent behavior towards our country.\u201dWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Senate Votes 98-2 for Sanctions on Russia.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-sanctions-bill-clears-the-senate-with-bipartisan-vote-1501195135", "keywords": [" congress,election, house,russia,russia sanctions, senate, vote, white house,political,general news,society,community,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,welfare,social services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:46:00", "news_title": "New York City Taxpayers Shoulder Bulk of MTA Funding     ", "content": "The squabble between New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       and New York City Mayor       Bill de Blasio       about who should fork over more money to fix the city\u2019s ailing subway system is likely to change little for New York City taxpayers.In the end, budget experts say city taxpayers shoulder much of the financial burden.Those taxpayers contribute the largest chunk of funding to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees the subway system so critical to making the city and its economy run.\u201cThe city money that goes towards the MTA is generated off New York City taxpayers, and the state money is generated off the New York City taxpayer,\u201d said       Nick Sifuentes,        deputy director of transit-advocacy group the Riders Alliance.As a range of problems plague the aging system, New Yorkers have heard a lot of talk from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio, two Democrats.Mr. Cuomo contends the state has raised its contribution to the MTA to the highest levels in years. Mr. de Blasio says the city already pays more than its fair share and has accused Mr. Cuomo of raiding MTA funds for projects unrelated to the normal maintenance of the subways.A Wall Street Journal analysis of the MTA\u2019s roughly $15.7 billion operating budget for 2017 shows that New York City residents and businesses are paying more than $5 billion annually to the agency through monies collected by both the state and city.As for funding for the remainder of the MTA\u2019s budget, $6.3 billion is financed by fares, and $1.9 billion by tolls.Another $2.5 billion comes from state funds, including those collected from taxpayers in the surrounding suburbs such as Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties, which are heavily dependent on the MTA.Jamison Dague,        director of infrastructure studies at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group that studies the MTA, estimated New York City residents and businesses pay about two-thirds of the taxes and subsidies in the MTA budget.The city directly contributes about $1.8 billion in funds annually directly to the transit agency, according to city and MTA data.The city estimates it also spends another $400 million on indirect services through the New York Police Department, which patrols the subways.The city\u2019s taxpayers, however, contribute additional billions through a dizzying brew of more than a dozen state and local taxes and fees, from a payroll tax to a petroleum-business tax, a mortgage-recording tax and more.Most of those funds are collected by the state, which in turn distributes them to the MTA.\u00a0The state\u2019s roughly $4.9 billion direct contribution to the MTA largely was made up of these taxes.The MTA\u2019s roughly $32 billion capital plan receives about $8.5 billion in state funds, $7.6 billion in federal funds and $2.5 billion from New York City.\u00a0Mr. Cuomo said last month he would contribute an additional $1 billion in state money to the plan.As subway delays and infrastructure problems mount, Messrs. Cuomo and de Blasio remain at a stalemate about who should pay for the $836 million plan to stabilize the system. MTA Chairman       Joseph Lhota,        who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo last month, has called on the mayor to split the cost with the state. Mr. de Blasio has refused, saying the MTA has the funds it needs and has mismanaged its money. He reiterates that the responsibility for the system lies solely with Mr. Cuomo.The mayor also called on Mr. Cuomo to replace the $456 million in MTA operating funds he redirected elsewhere since 2011. Cuomo officials say the request is absurd because it disregards the billions more the state has put toward the agency in recent years.\u2014Mike Vilensky and  Melanie Grayce West contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Bulk of MTA Funding Falls to City Taxpayers.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-taxpayers-shoulder-bulk-of-mta-funding-1501199205", "keywords": ["mta,mta funding,new york city tranist,subway funding,subways,Bill de Blasio,Joseph Lhota,Andrew Cuomo,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:46:00", "news_title": "Wall Street Needs You to Borrow Against Your Stock", "content": "Wall Street brokerages have been selling billions of dollars in loans backed by stocks and bonds, a trend that yields lucrative fees for the firms but poses risks for borrowers.While banks don\u2019t always report these loans in the same way, these securities-backed loans total at least $100 billion for the biggest brokerages\u2014up exponentially since the financial crisis\u2014with several billions of dollars of additional debt held at smaller brokerages, banking analysts estimate.Executives at             Morgan Stanley        MS 0.54%       earlier this month highlighted these loans to individuals as a big growth area and revenue driver, saying the loans helped expand the bank\u2019s overall wealth lending by about $3.5 billion, or 6%, in the second quarter.

TWTR -3.73%       shares sank 14% on Thursday after the company reported no meaningful increase in users since getting a bump from the U.S. presidential election, stressing the challenges the social-media company faces in reviving growth.The number of people using Twitter monthly remained at 328 million from the first quarter to the second quarter and was up only 5% from a year earlier, the company said in reporting its latest earnings. In the first quarter, Twitter added 9 million monthly users, as activity picked up following the election of       Donald Trump       as president.The U.S. was a weak spot for the company, Twitter operating chief       Anthony Noto       said in a conference call with analysts. Twitter\u2019s number of monthly users in the U.S. declined by 2 million during the latest quarter to 68 million.\u201cIt\u2019s clear the boost to user growth and engagement from Trump\u2019s election was a one-time deal,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at the research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.Prior to the election bump, Twitter had been adding 5 million or fewer users each quarter for nearly two years. Analysts had anticipated a return to the norm in the second quarter, with fewer than a million users joining in, according to FactSet.In the face of skimpy user growth, Twitter has been pushing Wall Street to focus on daily engagement as a more likely avenue for reviving revenue, which fell in the second quarter.Daily active users were up 12%, the third straight quarter of double-digit increases from a year earlier. The company doesn\u2019t disclose the base number of people.Mr. Noto said there is plenty of room to drive daily-user growth even if the monthly-users tally stays flat, but suggested Twitter faces tougher comparisons after eight quarters of strong numbers. The latest rate was down from a 14% increase in the first quarter.Since the start of the year, Twitter has lost more than eight executives. On the call, Twitter Chief Executive       Jack Dorsey       said he spends most of his time recruiting. \u201cWe are looking for more engineering and product leadership throughout the company,\u201d he said.Revenue slid 5% to $574 million, the second time it has declined since the company went public.

Twitter said it doesn\u2019t expect revenue growth to pick up in the second half of 2017.One bright spot was engagement around live video, a crucial piece of Twitter\u2019s strategy. In the second quarter, Twitter streamed more than 1,200 hours of live video, with 55 million unique viewers tuning in, up from 45 million from the preceding quarter. The company recently announced a range of streaming deals with companies including BuzzFeed and MLB Advanced Media. Twitter said video remains its largest and fastest-growing ad format.In a research note ahead of the earnings report, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Shyam Patil said for the first time in a long time he is starting to hear positive feedback from advertisers about Twitter, specifically around video ads.Twitter, which has posted losses every quarter since going public in November 2013, said its second-quarter loss widened to $116 million from $107 million a year earlier. The results included a $55 million charge related to its investment in SoundCloud Ltd.Excluding certain expenses such as stock-based compensation, Twitter said it earned 8 cents a share. The company said it altered how it calculates income taxes in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance; otherwise the earnings figure would have been 12 cents a share.Analysts had expected Twitter to report $536.6 million in revenue and 5 cents a share in adjusted profit, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Some of them said it is the best available option and that they are advocating it in discussions with Toshiba or creditors. They said a bankruptcy filing by Toshiba, the core of an industrial conglomerate, could free it of burdens that include lingering liabilities from the March bankruptcy of its Westinghouse Electric Co. nuclear unit in the U.S.Toshiba\u2019s chief executive,       Satoshi Tsunakawa,        said at a recent news conference that seeking debt relief through the courts isn\u2019t an option. A Toshiba spokesman reiterated this week that the company has \u201cno specific plan\u201d to seek bankruptcy protection.A person familiar with deliberations at one of Toshiba\u2019s main lenders compared the conglomerate to a hole that might have treasure at the bottom but also lurking snakes. Bankruptcy, this person said, could kill any snakes and let the lenders access the treasure.A filing would be among the largest in Japan\u2019s history and carry drawbacks including possible political backlash in the U.S. Toshiba has committed $3.68 billion to nuclear-plant operator             Southern                   Co. to cover its Westinghouse-related obligations from an unfinished project in Georgia. On Thursday, it reached a deal with             Scana Corp.       and a partner to pay $2.17 billion to cover obligations on a second half-completed U.S. nuclear project Westinghouse was building, in South Carolina.Japanese government officials and Toshiba executives are aware of those drawbacks and may be deterred from a bankruptcy filing, people involved in the discussions said.Toshiba in June estimated that its liabilities exceeded assets by more than $5 billion as of March 31. That followed its warning in April that it had \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about being able to continue as a going concern because of losses connected to Westinghouse.Toshiba has said it plans to recover financial health by selling its memory-chip business, which has been booming recently thanks to demand for chips in smartphones and servers. On June 21, Toshiba designated a consortium led by a Japanese government-backed investment fund as the preferred bidder for the unit.But the sale talks have bogged down since The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the consortium\u2019s bid could include an equity stake for         SK Hynix               Inc. of South Korea. A role for SK Hynix could raise antitrust issues and contradict the government\u2019s stance that Toshiba\u2019s technology shouldn\u2019t fall into foreign rivals\u2019 hands. Also, Toshiba\u2019s joint-venture partner in the chip business, Western Digital Corp.        WDC 0.04%      , has filed suit in California to block the sale, arguing that its joint-venture contract with Toshiba gives it veto power over any sale. Toshiba, which rejects that interpretation, is contesting the suit; a hearing is scheduled for Friday in San Francisco.The stalemate and Toshiba\u2019s long battle with its auditors\u2014who have refused to approve financial statements this year\u2014are eroding trust among creditors. Japan\u2019s three largest banks have taken reserves for a portion of their Toshiba loans, according to bank officials.Japan has far fewer bankruptcies annually than the U.S., especially among major corporations, in part because of the stigma attached to failure.Nonetheless, people involved in the discussions described Toshiba as a classic case of a company burdened by obligations with large and uncertain costs that could be lessened under bankruptcy protection. Those obligations include a multibillion-dollar 20-year contract involving liquefied natural gas in the U.S.One person directly involved in a portion of the Toshiba recovery plan said \u201ceveryone thinks\u201d bankruptcy has to be looked at\u2014but it is difficult to say so publicly.Two other people familiar with deliberations at one of Toshiba\u2019s main lenders said that even if the memory-chip sale were completed, the company would still be likely to run short of funds.The Toshiba spokesman rejected that view, saying that if the company can sell its chip unit in line with current expectations, \u201cWe believe we will be able to secure sufficient funds.\u201dMitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities credit analyst Nobuhiko Ambiru wrote in a July 12 report, \u201cWe cannot entirely rule out the possibility that financial institutions will retreat from their supportive position and [Toshiba\u2019s] ability to raise funds will be severely impacted, propelling a decision to seek a workout through the courts.\u201dStill, Mr. Ambiru said he expects Toshiba\u2019s lenders to continue their support for now. Since it has thousands of suppliers, any halt in payments by Toshiba could have broader economic effects.There are other potential downsides to a filing for bankruptcy protection.Southern Co., the U.S. utility for which Westinghouse has been building two nuclear reactors, is counting on the $3.68 billion Toshiba pledged. A Southern spokesman said, \u201cWe continue to monitor Toshiba\u2019s financial position.\u201d The company says it is reviewing whether to go ahead with the reactors.A Japanese government official said a Toshiba bankruptcy is an option but not a leading choice because of fears Japan would be criticized for breaking its promises over U.S. nuclear projects.Several people also expressed fears about possible delays at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant because Toshiba\u2019s technology is needed to clean up reactors that suffered meltdowns after Japan\u2019s 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\u2014Russell Gold contributed to this article.Write to Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com, Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com and Peter Landers at peter.landers@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Toshiba\u2019s Creditors Urge Bankruptcy.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toshiba-bankruptcy-filing-pushed-by-some-involved-in-workout-1501152999", "keywords": ["restructuring,toshiba,toshiba bankruptcy,toshiba chip sale,toshiba lawsuit,toshiba restructuring,toshiba workout,Toshiba,6502.TO,Westinghouse Electric,SK Hynix,KR:000660,Western Digital,WDC,Southern,SO,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,health,living,lifestyle,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,technical services,business,consumer services,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:32:00", "news_title": "Amazon\u2019s Expansion Costs Take a Toll as Profit Falls 77%", "content": "Amazon.com Inc.

The company also poured funds into hiring engineers to work on its artificial intelligence Alexa service as well as warehouse workers.\u201cWe are continuing to invest in businesses that will achieve four goals...Customers love them, they can grow to be large, they have strong financial returns and they are durable and can last for decades,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a media call. \u201cThat is, in essence, our investment philosophy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s 25% sales growth comes at the expense of traditional retailers, which are struggling with declining foot traffic and the shift of consumer spending online. At a time when Amazon is investing heavily and expanding, other retailers are saddled with high debt loads and falling sales, forcing them to close stores and cut jobs\u2014and extending Amazon\u2019s advantage.\u201cAmazon is a great disrupter in traditional retail,\u201d said Trip Miller, founder and managing partner at Amazon investor Gullane Capital LLC. \u201cEveryone is pivoting and trying to change their game to deal with Amazon. I would hate to be the competition in anything they get involved in.\u201dAmazon\u2019s stock price was down 2.3% in after-hour trading as the company missed profit and guidance expectations, a tempered reaction given that other retail stocks often drop in the double digits when Amazon makes a move to compete in the same market. Amazon shares, which finished Thursday at $1,046, were up about 39% year-to-date at the close.High expectations for Amazon temporarily made founder and Chief Executive       Jeff Bezos      the world\u2019s richest person on Thursday. Amazon\u2019s stock hit a record in the morning ahead of the results, edging Mr. Bezos in front of             Microsoft Corp.       founder       Bill Gates,        before closing down. According to Forbes, which tracks a list of billionaires, Mr. Bezos reached a net worth of $90.6 billion as the market opened.Amazon is now making a big push into brick-and-mortar, something expected to further hurt traditional retail competitors. Last month, Amazon announced a $13.7 billion including debt acquisition of             Whole Foods Market Inc.,       immediately catapulting it into a major player in brick-and-mortar retail and grocery. Whole Foods reported Wednesday that comparable sales fell again in its latest quarter, a trend it has promised to reverse by September.Adding Whole Foods \u201cwill be a big boost for us as we expand our offerings in consumables and grocery,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said.The shift from shopping in-store to online has left many powerful brands unable to ignore Amazon, increasing the retailer\u2019s dominance. Fifty-five percent of product searches now start at Amazon, according to personalization platform company BloomReach, compared with 28% on search engines. In recent weeks, Amazon has become an official seller for             Nike Inc.       and             Sears Holding Corp.\u2019s       Kenmore brand of appliances.Amazon has claimed more than 40 cents out of every dollar spent online over the past year, according to receipt tracker Slice Intelligence, which has an online shopping panel of more than 5 million.             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       in comparison, claimed about 1.7% of online spending over the same period.Amazon is now the second-largest apparel seller behind Wal-Mart after taking market share from             Target Corp.       and several department stores, according to a research note published by             Morgan Stanley                   in April.But the company\u2019s outsize retail muscle is raising concerns about its growing size and influence. Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods has prompted roughly a dozen members of Congress to call for a close review of the deal. The Consumer Watchdog group is lobbying the Federal Trade Commission to block it on allegations that Amazon\u2019s pricing discounts are misleading, assertions Amazon has called \u201cflat out wrong.\u201dMr. Olsavsky said Amazon isn\u2019t as dominant as it may appear. \u201cThe businesses we\u2019re in are all very large market segments, with lots of very serious competition,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said. \u201cGenerally the number one thing that we\u2019ll do at all times is align ourselves with customers and continue to invent on their behalf.\u201dDepartment stores are expected to post a 12% decline in earnings when they report in coming weeks, according to FactSet, while apparel retailers are forecast to see profits drop 8.5%.Amazon said it will continue to spend heavily on its growth, signaling a period of lower profit. That is particularly the case in the third quarter, Mr. Olsavsky said, because Amazon bulks up on warehouse staff and delivery capacity ahead of the all-important holiday season. Amazon said its operating income could swing to a loss in the next quarter.One of the bigger costs for the quarter will come from hiring new employees, part of its pledge to hire 130,000 U.S. workers through mid-2018. The company said on Wednesday it plans to host a giant job fair next week to hire for its 50,000 current U.S. warehouse openings. Amazon said Thursday that its global workforce rose by more than 31,000 in the second quarter to 382,400.The company may also have to pay its new warehouse hires more thanks to a tight labor market in many logistics hubs as retailers and delivery companies compete for the same small pool of workers.Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing division continues to be the engine behind the retail giant\u2019s profits. Amazon Web Services\u2019 operating income of $916 million topped total operating income for the entire company, which hit $628 million in the period. Even so, AWS, which competes against Microsoft and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google, marked the fifth consecutive quarter of declining operating income growth, which gained 28%.\u2014Jay Greene contributed to this article.Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Amazon\u2019s Expansion Costs Take a Toll.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-revenue-rises-25-on-retail-dominance-1501187486", "keywords": ["alexa,amazon,book sellers,delivery services,drones,kenmore appliances,retailers,Amazon.com,AMZN,Target,TGT,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,Jeff Bezos,Brian Olsavsky,Trip Miller,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,capacity,facilities,labor,personnel,automation,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,recruitment,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,online service providers,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:23:00", "news_title": "Macau Developer Found Guilty in U.N. Bribery Case ", "content": "A federal jury in Manhattan on Thursday found Macau billionaire Ng Lap Seng guilty of bribing Caribbean diplomats to the United Nations, capping a sprawling case that highlighted Chinese business ambitions at the international body and alleged corruption among representatives at the international tribunal.The jury\u2019s verdict, after less than one day of deliberation, marked a victory for prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney\u2019s office, who in 2015 charged six people in alleged bribery and money-laundering schemes involving Chinese businesspeople, ambassadors from developing countries and U.N.-affiliated nonprofits.Mr. Ng, 69 years old, was the lone remaining defendant in the case; others either had pleaded guilty or died. Mr. Ng was convicted on all seven criminal counts, including bribery, money laundering, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and tax fraud.Mr. Ng looked at the jury without emotion as the verdict was read. A few minutes later, his lawyer placed his hand on Mr. Ng\u2019s arm, as if to comfort him. At sentencing, he faces up to 65 years in prison, according to the government.\u200bThe judge immediately modified Mr. Ng\u2019s conditions of confinement to bar him from leaving his Manhattan apartment without special permission. Mr. Ng, who had been released on $50 million bail, has been under house arrest for the past two years.His lawyer,       Tai Park,        declined to comment on the verdict.Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Ng, a \u200breal-estate casino magnate, paid more than a million dollars in bribes to ambassadors to the U.N. from Antigua and Barbuda and the Dominican Republic to secure the organization\u2019s support for a sprawling, multibillion-dollar convention center, hotel and commercial complex Mr. Ng hoped to build in Macau.\u201cIn his unbridled pursuit of even greater personal fortune, billionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations,\u201d acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said in a statement.Mr. Ng\u2019s lawyers argued that he didn\u2019t commit any crimes, arguing that the payments were legal donations to support U.N. representatives and to promote the interests of developing-world countries.The five-week trial featured testimony from current and former U.N. officials and employees at a media company Mr. Ng founded, through which some of the bribes were alleged to have been funneled.The government\u2019s star witness was       Francis Lorenzo,        the former deputy permanent representative to the U.N. from the Dominican Republic, who in March 2016 pleaded guilty to tax fraud and accepting more than $1 million in payments from Mr. Ng. The defense argued that Mr. Lorenzo and others cheated Mr. Ng and misused his money.Mr. Ng was also charged with funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to       John Ashe,        the former ambassador to the U.N. from Antigua and Barbuda and former president of the U.N. General Assembly.Mr. Ashe had pleaded not guilty to tax charges related to the case\u2014he was accused of accepting more than $1.3 million in bribes from several Chinese businessmen, in exchange for advancing their interests at the U.N. He died in June 2016 in what Westchester County officials said was a weightlifting accident at his home.Prosecutors said that Messrs. Lorenzo and Ashe used their positions to secure letters of support from the U.N. for Mr. Ng\u2019s proposed Macau center, including one endorsement letter that was circulated to the entire General Assembly.Two foundation executives pleaded guilty last year to funneling money from other Chinese businesspeople to Mr. Ashe. Mr. Ng\u2019s former assistant,       Jeff Yin,        pleaded guilty to a tax fraud charge in April but didn\u2019t admit to any part in the bribery scheme in which he also had been charged.Messrs. Ng and Yin were arrested in September 2015 and charged with lying to U.S. customs officials. Several weeks later, Manhattan federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint outlining the alleged U.N. bribery scheme.While his defense lawyers sought to portray Mr. Ng as a philanthropist building a convention center for the U.N. in China, prosecutors said that Mr. Ng hoped his Macau project, to be built in part on a man-made island, would cement his legacy and bring in tremendous personal revenue.Mr. Ng is a member of the Chinese government\u2019s top advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference. \u200bA representative for the Chinese embassy in Washington didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The defense had argued that the case intruded into the U.N.\u2019s internal affairs and was motivated by U.S. government concern about Chinese influence in the developing world, charges prosecutors denied.At the time of the 2015 arrests, federal authorities said the charges were part of a broader probe of possible corruption at the U.N. In announcing the charges, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: \u201cWe will be asking, is bribery business as usual at the U.N.?\u201dThe U.N. denied that was the case, and said the organization would launch an internal investigation into the U.N.\u2019s relationship with Mr. Ng and his business and the Global Sustainability Foundation, another U.N.-affiliated organization unrelated to Mr. Ng whose executives pleaded guilty to bribing Mr. Ashe.Representatives for the U.N. didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Write to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/macau-developer-found-guilty-in-u-n-bribery-case-1501195859", "keywords": ["bribery case,macau,ng lap seng,united nations,United Nations,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,international relations,money laundering,financial crime,fraud,politics,machinery,textile machinery manufacturing,industrial goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:16:00", "news_title": "Tax Reform Principles", "content": "The \u2018Big Six\u201d GOP tax negotiators released a statement of principles Thursday, and the main news is the death of the House border-adjustment tax. A favorite idea of Speaker       Paul Ryan,        the BAT was savaged by retailers who feared they\u2019d pay more for imports. The problem is that the BAT would have raised as much as $1 trillion to pay for lower tax rates, so its defeat raises a new obstacle to reform.This shows that tax reform may be even harder to pull off than repealing ObamaCare given how politicians have laced the tax code with subsidies and carve-outs. Interests clawing to keep their favors usually defeat the public interest in lower rates. But the potential payoff in faster growth and rising incomes is still worth the political effort, so give Congress and President       Trump       credit for setting the goal of a signing ceremony this year.As the debate begins, this is a good moment to offer some principles to judge how reform is faring:\u2022 The growth priority. After 12 years of a lackluster economy, or worse, tax reform\u2019s overriding goal should be to lift annual GDP to 3% or more. The current expansion is into its ninth year and showing signs of age. Europe has grown faster than the U.S. for some time. The Trump bump in financial markets hasn\u2019t been matched in the real economy.Amid a labor shortage and sluggish incomes, a capital spending surge is crucial to give the expansion a second wind. This is where tax reform must focus. This means lowering tax rates on business and individuals to spur risk-taking and investment.In particular it means cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate low enough to compete with the rest of the world and return $2 trillion in capital that U.S. companies have stashed overseas. A corporate rate much higher than 20% won\u2019t do the job. The evidence of economic research is overwhelming that cuts in corporate tax rates flow to workers in higher wages.The political opposition will come from Democrats and many Republicans who view tax reform mainly as a populist lever to redistribute income. They include White House aide       Steve Bannon,        who wants to raise tax rates on the affluent, and conservatives like       Mike Lee       on Capitol Hill who think taxes should serve social policy. The risk is that they will steal money for tax credits that do nothing for growth and could be used to reduce rates.\u2022 Make cuts immediate. One temptation in every reform debate is to phase-in tax cuts to fit inside Congress\u2019s 10-year budget-deficit box. That is a growth killer as investors delay decisions to wait for lower rates.       George W. Bush       made that mistake with his 2001 tax cut, which was a growth bust. He corrected it by making his 2003 cuts immediate, and the faster growth that followed saved his re-election.\u2022 Permanence. Businesses invest with a long tail, and they will scuttle some projects if they think lower rates go poof after five or 10 years. Mr. Bush made this mistake in 2003 and       Barack Obama       took advantage in 2013.Thursday\u2019s joint GOP statement says the goal \u201cplaces a priority on permanence,\u201d which is progress. Some provisions, such as business expensing, could end after five years without doing too much harm. But tax rates should be fixed in law so future Congresses will have a harder time changing them.\u2022 Reform, not merely a tax cut. One reason tax reform spurs growth is by reducing subsidies so capital can flow where it gets the highest return. This efficiency increases productivity, which increases wages. But this means stripping out as much chaff as possible in the tax code like subsidies for electric cars, real estate or racetracks.Ending these subsidies also helps pay for lower rates. But the GOP has already agreed not to change the mortgage-interest or charitable deductions, and now the trillion-dollar BAT is dead. Reformers will have to fight that much harder to end the big-dollar deductions for state and local taxes and for interest on business borrowing.If that becomes too difficult, the temptation will be to abandon reform and default to the lowest-common political denominator of a simple tax cut. This would be better than nothing, but it won\u2019t boost capital investment or the economy nearly as much in the medium- or long-run.\u2022 The deficit-neutral trap. The budget outline now moving through the House promises a balanced budget in 10 years including tax reform. That may be necessary to pass the outline but it could be the death of tax reform if it locks the GOP into the fiscal prison of budget \u201cscores\u201d by the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax Committee.Speaker Ryan has worked for years to get those bureaucracies to better account for rising tax revenues that flow from faster growth, but they still use models that underestimate the growth impact of tax cuts on capital and marginal rates.Republicans need to find an exit from the deficit-neutral trap. Perhaps that means taking a revenue score from Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis, rather than Joint Tax. Balanced-budget fetishists might keep in mind that       Ronald Reagan\u2019s       1981 tax cuts would never have happened had Congress not tolerated deficits. Faster growth caused revenues to boom and the deficit eventually fell.With ObamaCare repeal foundering, Republicans can\u2019t afford another \u201cskinny\u201d reform that fails to deliver on Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to raise growth and wages. Tax reform will determine whether this Congress was worth electing.Appeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tax-reform-principles-1501197393", "keywords": ["government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 19:11:00", "news_title": "Vale Doesn\u2019t Expect Samarco Venture With BHP to Restart This Year ", "content": "RIO DE JANEIRO\u2014Brazilian mining giant             Vale SA        VALE 3.36%       said Thursday its Samarco joint venture with             BHP Billiton Ltd.        BHP 1.36%       is no longer expected to resume operations this year after a catastrophic dam disaster in 2015.Samarco has stumbled through the complex process of obtaining licenses to restart its iron-ore operation in southeast Brazil following the rupture of its Fund\u00e3o tailings dam in November 2015, Vale said in a press release.

This is the second time this fiscal year that the company has lowered its earnings guidance. The company also said it expects revenue growth for the year to come in at the low end of its previous forecast of 8% to 10%. Starbucks shares fell nearly 6% in after-hours trading.The company\u2019s growth has really slowed in its largest U.S. market in the past year and the company has cited a number of reasons ranging from customers turned off by congestion at the mobile order pickup area to economic uncertainty.Chief Executive       Kevin Johnson       described the Thursday results in an interview as \u201cvery strong, given the retail disruption that\u2019s unfolding.\u201dStarbucks reiterated on Thursday that declining mall traffic has been hurting brick-and-mortar retailers as consumers have shifted their spending online. Starbucks said it is closing all 379 of its Teavana mall-based stores, which was part of the reason it missed earnings expectations, as it had to take charges from the closures.The company reported earnings of 47 cents per share, down 7.8% from a year ago, and below analyst expectations of 55 cents per share. Excluding one-time items, it earned 55 cents per share.The company also missed expectations for global same-store sales, which were dragged down by its China Asia Pacific business where stores in Japan have been underperforming, Mr. Johnson said. China was the bright spot of the quarter, posting same-store sales growth of 7%.The company on Thursday said it is spending $1.3 billion to buy the 50% stake of the business in East China that it doesn\u2019t already own from a joint venture partner there, or 1,300 stores.

Instead, they must now pull over, park what they were doing and deal with what is charitably being called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpolicy announcement\u201d on transgender people serving in the U.S. military.

That said, the fact is that the       Obama       Administration in 2016 lifted the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military and made plans for their recruitment.In June Secretary Mattis announced that the recruitment piece of this policy would be delayed until next January pending further study. As to that, Gen. Dunford released a statement post-tweet Thursday that there would be no modifications to current policy \u201cuntil the President\u2019s direction has been received.\u201d As we went to press, no such \u201cdirection\u201d had come from the White House.Issuing a major Pentagon policy change, via             Twitter,       before anything resembling the details of that policy exists, as happened with the initial travel ban, is awful management.

INTC 0.37%       reported a surge in quarterly profit and raised its earnings forecast in a show of strength amid growing attacks from rivals in its core businesses.Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier in the three months through July 1 to $14.8 billion, driven partly by strength in its divisions selling chips for personal computers and industrial-strength servers, the Santa Clara, Calif., company said Thursday.Intel\u2019s shares were up nearly 1% in after-hours trading\u2014after initially surging more sharply\u2014as the company increased its estimates for full-year revenue and earnings per share.Intel held 93% of the roughly $31 billion global market for the calculating engines in PCs and approached 100% share of the $16.5 billion world-wide market for server processors last year, according to Mercury Research. That leaves it almost no room to grow.The company has been spending heavily to spur growth in new areas, and some of those investments are beginning to pay off.\u201cWe are executing well to our strategy to transform from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices,\u201d Intel Chief Executive       Brian Krzanich       said Thursday on a conference call.Total profit in the latest period rose by more than 110% from the same quarter last year, when Intel recorded a large restructuring charge. Excluding the restructuring charge, profit rose 23%. Intel said it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $3 a share on $61.3 billion in revenue. It previously expected earnings of $2.85 a share on $60 billion in revenue.Intel\u2019s server chips face rising competition from             Nvidia Corp.\u2019s       graphics processors, which have proven especially efficient in some artificial tasks.Intel has said it would introduce its own AI-focused Nervana chips later in the year.Advanced Micro Devices Inc.       in June launched a direct assault on Intel\u2019s server chips. Its Epyc line is aimed squarely at the lower half of Intel\u2019s data-center offerings, which accounted for roughly 80% of its 2016 server-chip sales, according to Bernstein Research. Epyc hit the market too late to be reflected in either chip maker\u2019s second-quarter results.Intel fired back in July with an upgraded line of server chips called the Xeon Scalable Platform intended to one-up AMD\u2019s performance.Challenging Intel\u2019s stronghold in PCs, AMD debuted its Ryzen desktop chips in March, giving Intel its first full quarter of serious competition in that market in years, and has said it expects to introduce laptop units later this year.Intel responded in late May with an upgraded line of PC processors it calls Core X claiming superior performance but generally maintaining higher prices. It has said it would launch a new laptop chip later this year manufactured using a next-generation fabrication process.Revenue at Intel\u2019s unit responsible for PC chips rose 12% from the prior-year quarter. Personal computer sales have been in a persistent decline as consumer spending shifts to mobile devices, though Intel\u2019s ability to drive sales of higher-priced chips has compensated somewhat. That unit saw an 8% increase in average prices and a 3% increase in volume.Revenue in the division that sells server processors, a market central to the chip giant\u2019s future, rose 8.6%. Intel Chief Financial Officer       Bob Swan       attributed the growth to sales to cloud providers and network providers. Sales to corporate customers declined 11% in the quarter and will fall at a rate in the high single digits this year, he said\u2014 faster than the company\u2019s previous estimate.Intel reaffirmed its expectation that data-center revenue would grow in high single digits for the full year, after revising its guidance downward from double digits earlier. The company aims to use its server-chip business to drive further revenue from related products such as data storage.Intel is in the process of buying Israeli car-camera pioneer             Mobileye                   NV for $15.3 billion. The company expects the deal to close in the third quarter, it said on Thursday, earlier than its previous estimates.Opportunities in memory, automotive, mobile, and the Internet of Things will amount to a total market of $220 billion by 2021, Intel has said.In all for the quarter, Intel reported profit of $2.8 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The latest earnings figure translated to 58 cents a share, or 72 cents a share on an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring charges and certain items arising from acquisitions.

K. consumers\u2019 mood soured again unexpectedly in July, a survey published Friday showed, with the headline index falling to the level last seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote as Britons grew uneasy about the country\u2019s economic situation.The long-running barometer of consumer confidence, conducted by market researcher GfK U.K. Ltd for the European Union\u2019s executive, slipped by two points following a five-point drop the previous month, and stood at minus 12.The decline in sentiment\u2014driven largely by a sharp drop in confidence in the U.K.\u2019s economy, over the past year as well as the year ahead\u2014surprised analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal, who had expected no change against the June reading.The survey saw a small bounce in consumer views of personal finance looking ahead\u2014the only measure that was up compared with the previous month.\u201cAll bets must now be on a further drift downwards in confidence,\u201d said Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK.Consumer resilience helped the largely domestic-driven U.K. economy to weather the initial post-referendum uncertainty and grow at a healthy clip last year.But accelerating inflation, spurred by the pound\u2019s post-referendum depreciation, has recently outpaced growth in Britons\u2019 wages, squeezing their wallets. This caused shoppers to pare back spending, and resulted in the economy slowing sharply in the first quarter.Growth remained subdued in the second quarter, as a modest revival in consumer spending offset shrinking industrial production, a sign that a hoped-for shift toward export-led growth remains elusive.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-consumer-confidence-falls-again-1501196460", "keywords": ["brexit,consumer spending,u.k. economy,u.k. shopping,economic performance,indicators,consumer sentiment,economic news,surveys,polls"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 18:44:00", "news_title": "\u2018Reasonable Grounds\u2019 to Suspect Corporate Manslaughter in London Fire, Police Say ", "content": "LONDON\u2014Police investigating the deadly blaze at Grenfell Tower said there were grounds to suspect the local council that oversaw the building\u2019s management may have committed corporate manslaughter, according to a letter sent to residents Thursday.Police said they notified the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Kensington and the Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, which managed the building, that after an initial assessment, there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect the organizations. Police said they would interview officials from both organizations in relation to the potential offense once all the relevant facts had been gathered.London\u2019s Metropolitan Police is investigating the cause and spread of the fire at Grenfell Tower last month, in which at least 80 people were killed. The blaze at the 24-story apartment block in West London started in a refrigerator-freezer before it rapidly spread across the building.In a statement released Thursday, police said the criminal investigation would be complex, far reaching and would take \u201ca considerable time to complete.\u201d\u201cAlongside the recovery operation in Grenfell Tower to find, recover and identify all those that died, we are conducting one of the largest criminal investigations outside of counter terrorism operations,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe have seized a huge amount of material and taken a large number of witness statements.\u201dCorporate manslaughter is an offense under the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007, which went into effect in 2008, and prosecutions have in the past resulted in fines for corporations found guilty. In the wake of the 2009 fire at Lakanal House in Camberwell, London, in which six people died, Southwark Council wasn\u2019t charge with corporate manslaughter even though the council knew about the fire safety risks in the building and didn\u2019t address them.Charges have been brought under the act at least 20 times since its introduction. Fines have ranged from \u00a350,000 (about $65,000) to \u00a3700,000, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. In 2015, crane- rental firm Baldwins Crane Hire was fined \u00a3700,000 after an employee was killed in a crash. An investigation found that the crane\u2019s brakes were damaged and only provided limited braking force.Residents said they had raised fire safety concerns in the past but that their concerns had been ignored. During a refurbishment of the high-rise last year, contractors installed a widely used cladding\u2014material often used to make a building more energy-efficient or improve its outward appearance\u2014on the exterior of the building. The cladding consisted of an aluminum shell and a flammable plastic filling.While U.K. officials have said the material didn\u2019t meet building standards for towers taller than six stories, British building industry experts and the British company that supplied the material to Grenfell Tower contractors said the material complies with regulations.The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Elizabeth Campbell, head of the council, has said the borough supports the investigation and will cooperate however it can.About a hundred residents gathered outside Grenfell Tower for a vigil Thursday evening to remember the victims.

PG 0.59%       sparred with activist investor       Nelson Peltz       on Thursday, with the two sides debating whether the company\u2019s latest results prove a turnaround is taking hold.P&G executives argued the company\u2019s higher profit and sales showed progress on multiyear efforts to cut costs and refocus on its biggest brands, building their case against Mr. Peltz\u2019s demand for a board seat.But soon after Thursday\u2019s report, Mr. Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management issued a statement saying the maker of Tide, Crest and Gillette continues to lose market share and is saddled with \u201cexcessive costs and bureaucracy.\u201dIn an interview, P&G Chief Executive       David Taylor       said he would listen to Mr. Peltz but there was no reason to revisit the company\u2019s strategy or give the activist a board seat. \u201cI want to stay focused on delivering the plan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have done a tremendous amount of work\u2014redoing it is not needed.\u201dMr. Peltz \u201chasn\u2019t offered incremental thoughts that we haven\u2019t considered,\u201d Mr. Taylor said, \u201cand there\u2019s a history of establishing a shadow management team which we believe firmly would derail the work that is already delivering improvement.\u201dMr. Taylor said Mr. Peltz had offered to have Trian researchers do additional analysis on the company, something the CEO considered unnecessary.             DuPont Co.      , which won a proxy fight against Mr. Peltz in 2015, had accused Trian of seeking to establish a \u201cshadow management\u201d team focused on short-term results.Trian called Mr. Taylor\u2019s comment \u201crecycled public relations rhetoric. The real issues that must be addressed are P&G\u2019s deteriorating market share and excessive cost and bureaucracy.\u201dTrian said P&G\u2019s improved profit margins and earnings in the latest quarter \u201ccame as a result of reducing advertising, specifically digital, a tactic we believe will damage the value of the company\u2019s brands if continued in the long term.\u201dP&G said organic sales increased 2% for the quarter and full year ended June 30. The closely watched metric, which strips out currency moves, acquisitions and divestitures, remains well below prerecession levels and lags behind some rivals. P&G forecast growth of 2% to 3% next year.Shares of P&G rose 1.6% to $90.68 Thursday. The shares are up about 7% this year compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 11% rise.Trian is arguing that P&G remains bogged down by bureaucracy and failed to capitalize on a recently completed five-year, $10 billion cost-cutting plan. P&G last year launched a second $10 billion savings plan and Mr. Peltz said giving him a seat on the board will help ensure that money is well-spent.On Thursday, Mr. Taylor said men\u2019s razors in the U.S. and diapers in China will be two major areas of focus as P&G, which has dropped hundreds of brands in recent years, looks to use its smaller size to win back share in key markets. Mr. Taylor said that turning around the Gillette razor brand, which has ceded market share in recent years to cheaper online upstarts, is P&G\u2019s biggest challenge.In the final quarter of the company\u2019s fiscal year, P&G reported a profit of $2.2 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.96 billion, or 69 cents a share, a year ago.Total revenue fell 0.1% in the quarter to $16.07 billion, and slipped 0.4% in the full year. The revenue figures were depressed by currency swings, since P&G generates much of its sales outside the U.S.Organic sales of beauty products and fabric and home-care products both rose 5% in the quarter. Still, concerns remain about the company\u2019s grooming and health-care lines, where organic sales fell 1% each. Customers have increasingly turned to online sellers for things such as razors and over-the-counter medications.P&G fared better than some rivals in the most recent quarter.             Colgate-Palmolive Co.\u2019s       organic sales for the quarter were flat and             Kimberly-Clark                   saw a 1% decline.             Unilever                   PLC reported a 3% organic sales increase, a decline from 4.7% growth a year ago.One analyst questioned whether heavy discounting by P&G is in part responsible for the sluggish market. \u201cYou are taking prices down more and raising prices less than competitors,\u201d Bernstein analyst Ali Dibaj said on the call with executives.P&G\u2019s Mr. Moeller said discounting by retailers has contributed to lower pricing on consumer goods. \u201cThe ultimate price consumers pay is at the discretion of retail partners and that\u2019s at their sole discretion,\u201d he said.\u2014Cara Lombardo contributed to this article.Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Procter & Gamble, Peltz Spar on Results.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/procter-gamble-struggles-to-see-revenue-growth-1501158720", "keywords": ["consumer products,earnings,nelson peltz,profit,proxy fight,sales, trian,Procter & Gamble,PG,Trian Fund Management,Nelson Peltz,financial performance,sales figures,management,management moves,shareholder activism,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,cosmetics,toiletries,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,consumer goods,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities,personal care products,appliances"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 18:27:00", "news_title": "U.S. Targets Bitcoin Exchange, Alleging It Facilitated Crime", "content": "U.S. law-enforcement authorities took aim at one of the world\u2019s largest digital-currency exchanges this week in an anti-money-laundering operation that spanned two continents and sent a warning to other virtual-money platforms the U.S. says may be facilitating crime.The Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network late Wednesday levied a record $110 million fine against BTC-e and a $12 million penalty against Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national who the U.S. says is the beneficial owner of the Seychelles-based company that manages BTC-e. The fines followed the arrest of Mr. Vinnik in Greece on Tuesday at the request of U.S. authorities under a 21-count indictment brought by the Justice Department in a Northern California district court.BTC-e, which is based in Bulgaria but regulated under the laws of Cyprus, allowed its users to trade bitcoin with high levels of anonymity. U.S. authorities allege that insufficient internal oversight at the firm facilitated computer hacking, fraud, identity theft, public corruption and drug trafficking in transactions that totaled more than $4 billion.\u201cWe will hold accountable foreign-located money transmitters, including virtual-currency exchangers, that do business in the United States when they willfully violate U.S. anti-money-laundering laws,\u201d said Jamal El-Hindi, FinCEN acting director.Neither Mr. Vinnik nor BTC-e could immediately be reached for comment. The website for BTC-e said it was offline for unscheduled maintenance and wouldn\u2019t be back in service for five to 10 days.The joint operation was coordinated with more than a half-dozen U.S. agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service.Mr. Vinnik, whose U.S. warrant was issued under seal in January, was arrested and detained by Greek law enforcement Tuesday under money-laundering charges. Greek police told the Associated Press they seized electronic equipment from his hotel room, and the officers that arrested Mr. Vinnik at a hotel grabbed his mobile phone before he could lock it.The Justice Department said that while cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin provide legitimate new financial channels for commerce, the anonymity of the BTC-e digital-currency exchange facilitated money-laundering and illicit finance for a world-wide network of criminal activity. The only requirements to register an account were a username, password and email address.\u201cJust as new computer technologies continue to change the way we engage each other and experience the world, so too will criminals subvert these new technologies to serve their own nefarious purposes,\u201d said Brian Stretch, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California.According to the indictment, which was approved in January and unsealed Wednesday, the company operated as a criminal business venture designed to launder money from a host of illegal enterprises. Among those activities, authorities pointed to the laundering of digital currency from the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange that once handled most of the world\u2019s bitcoin transactions but shut down after it was hacked in 2014. Authorities say the firm also received a portion of criminal proceeds from CryptoWall, one of the world\u2019s largest ransomware schemes.The Justice Department said that, unlike other several digital platforms that have anti-money laundering programs in place to combat illicit finance, BTC-e failed to implement sufficient protocols. BTC-e wasn\u2019t registered as a money-services business with Treasury, as required by law, despite doing substantial business in the U.S., according to the Justice Department. BTC-e users \u201copenly and explicitly discussed conducting criminal activity\u201d through the website\u2019s internal messaging systems, Treasury said.\u201cThe takedown of this large virtual-currency exchange should send a strong message to cybercriminals and other unregulated exchanges across the globe,\u201d said Don Fort, chief of the IRS\u2019s Criminal Investigation team.The BTC-e effort follows the shutdown of AlphaBay, an online marketplace that sold illegal goods anonymously on the so-called Dark Web.U.S. officials forced the shuttering of another digital-currency platform, Liberty Reserve, in 2013 after charging its founders with laundering more than $6 billion in ill-gotten gains.Bitcoin experts say the latest action shows the U.S. can reach beyond its borders.\u201cIf you are doing something illegal, even if you are outside the U.S., if you have customers in the U.S., then regulators can go after you,\u201d said Nick Tomaino, a venture investor at Runa Capital and a cryptocurrency blogger.The Justice Department noted in its indictment that BTC-e was using servers in the U.S. for many of its transactions.Many bitcoin experts had wondered how the company had operated for so long given long-running and public concerns about the alleged criminal aspect of BTC-e. But the sealed indictment and Mr. Vinnik\u2019s detainment in Greece indicate that U.S. authorities were waiting to snare the BTC-e executive when he visited a country ready to cooperate with the U.S.Bitcoin prices showed little reaction to the fines and arrest of Mr. Vinnik. Experts say that is because of the growing legitimacy of digital currency and acknowledgment by authorities that there are both lawful and illegal uses of the virtual coin.\u201cBTC-e was a relic of the first age of these bitcoin companies,\u201d Mr. Tomaino said. Several other exchanges have well-respected founders who have relationships with regulators and have established accountability programs meant to root out illicit finance, he added.\u2014Yuliya Chernova contributed to this article.Write to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com and Samuel Rubenfeld at samuel.rubenfeld@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-targets-bitcoin-exchange-alleging-it-facilitated-crime-1501194444", "keywords": ["bitcoin,cryptocurrencies,cybercrimes,fincen,internet crime,law enforcement news,legal news,money laundering,virtual currencies,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,banking,credit,financial services,financial technology,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 18:18:00", "news_title": "Rail Regulator Tells CSX to Fix Service Problems ", "content": "A freight railroad regulator called on             CSX Corp.

Sales for the June quarter jumped 25% to $38 billion, satisfying Wall Street\u2019s expectations of consistent double-digit growth. But Amazon\u2019s bottom line took a hit, with operating income sliding 51% to $628 million and missing analysts\u2019 $1 billion target. The company also projects a significant decline in operating income in the current quarter.Amazon\u2019s share price had risen 6% since it announced its surprise acquisition of             Whole Foods Market                   last month\u2014well ahead of the             Nasdaq\u2019s       3.5% gain. That nearly $40 billion in additional market value represents a vote of confidence in Amazon\u2019s ability to succeed in groceries on top of dominating much of the nonfood-retail and corporate-technology markets.Thursday\u2019s results should at least give investors a reminder of the price of that ambition. Amazon typically has followed periods of earnings expansion with stepped-up investing. The second quarter was no exception. Capital expenditures surged 46% year over year to $2.5 billion, while property and equipment acquired under capital leases nearly doubled to $2.7 billion. This brings the company\u2019s total capital investment for the quarter to a record $5.2 billion.Amazon has been ramping up spending on fulfillment and shipping capacity to keep up with massive growth in sales packaged and shipped by Amazon. It also has been bolstering its digital video offerings, improving the capabilities of its Echo device and investing in its cloud business.In fact, Amazon\u2019s capital investment in the quarter was more than the combined total of             Microsoft                   and Google parent             Alphabet,       its chief cloud-computing rivals.

Many of the delegates who voted for him now bitterly regret their role in his ascendance.Mr. Zuma was elected president in 2009, and soon he began to seize personal control of important state institutions by appointing loyalists to lead them. Those under his control include the National Prosecuting Authority, Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (better known as the \u201cHawks,\u201d South Africa\u2019s version of the FBI), the intelligence services, and possibly even the new Public Protector, or state ombudsman.These institutions are now routinely abused to harass Mr. Zuma\u2019s opponents and protect his corrupt friends and allies. Parliament has all too often been an uncritical rubber stamp for his policies. Legislators have failed to exercise proper oversight to prevent corrupt practices.The erosion of these institutions\u2019 independence has released a flood of corruption. Media accounts, along with a report from the former Public Protector, show that the three Gupta brothers, Indian-born business magnates, have played a brazen role in this process. They are closely associated with Mr. Zuma and have allegedly, according to thousands of leaked emails, siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars from state contracts, such as a recent locomotive deal, and redirected millions to finance the lavish wedding of one of their nephews. (The Guptas have denied wrongdoing.)The ANC\u2019s policy of \u201ccadre deployment,\u201d its euphemism for appointing party loyalists to key posts despite their lack of skills and experience, also has weakened government departments and debilitated state-owned enterprises. Since 2007, South Africa\u2019s government has abrogated bilateral investment treaties with 13 European Union countries. It has adopted a new Mining Charter that would ratchet up requirements for black shareholding and management, though the policy is now shelved by legal challenges from the mining industry. The Zuma government is adopting legislation to limit land holdings and prohibit foreign ownership of agricultural property. Mr. Zuma has threatened to expropriate white-owned farms without compensation to accelerate land reform.These actions, together with Mr. Zuma\u2019s decisions to fire two competent and principled finance ministers, have led to recession and discouraged critically needed investment. South Africa\u2019s bond ratings have been downgraded to junk.Finally, the Zuma government is undermining the racial reconciliation that       Nelson Mandela       worked so hard to establish after 1994. It has adopted an openly hostile attitude toward whites, whom it routinely characterizes as \u201ccolonialists\u201d and then blames for its own failures. The ANC is creating a hostile racial climate to justify a \u201cRadical Economic Transformation\u201d aimed at further restricting white ownership, management and employment in the private sector.All this will be discussed at the ANC\u2019s next national conference, in December. There are two principal candidates to succeed Mr. Zuma, who will be stepping down as the ANC\u2019s president after two terms. The first is Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, his preferred candidate and former wife. The second is the informal candidate of Mr. Zuma\u2019s opponents, Deputy President       Cyril Ramaphosa,        a multimillionaire former businessman and trade unionist. Whoever leads the ANC will succeed Mr. Zuma as South Africa\u2019s president if the party wins the next election in 2019.Inevitably, the ANC will find it difficult to accommodate its divergent factions. Some delegates will want to turn left and follow the South African Communist Party down the road to socialism. Others would prefer to remain on the gravy train of self-enrichment and racial entitlement. Still others want the ANC to return to the constitution and the vision of its founding fathers. Such a split could lead to a new political arrangement, in which South Africans might come together on the basis of shared values and policies, rather than on race.The good news is that the courts, civil society and media are still free and remain vociferous opponents of abuse and corruption. South Africans of all races are increasingly angered by the incompetence and exploitation of the ruling elite. There is a good chance that in future elections they will make their voices heard.South Africa would then be in a good position to achieve its enormous potential. My country has the world\u2019s largest mineral reserves, a strong financial sector and a sophisticated industrial base\u2014and it is at the gateway to Africa, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing markets.A great deal is at stake. Failure would be devastating across the southern part of the continent. It would have a chilling effect on efforts to solve conflicts elsewhere through peaceful negotiations and solemn agreements. Success, on the other hand, could open South Africa\u2014and the rest of Africa\u2014to First World prosperity and stability. That would be fitting validation for the great nonracial accord concluded with Nelson Mandela and other national leaders 23 years ago.Mr. de Klerk was president of South Africa, 1989-94.

The left was salivating at the prospect of watching two Trump insiders being grilled about Russian \u201ccollusion\u201d under the klieg lights.Yet Democrats now have meekly and noiselessly retreated, agreeing to let both men speak to the committee in private. Why would they so suddenly be willing to let go of this moment of political opportunity?Fusion GPS. That\u2019s the oppo-research outfit behind the infamous and discredited \u201cTrump dossier,\u201d ginned up by a former British spook. Fusion co-founder       Glenn Simpson       also was supposed to testify at the Grassley hearing, where he might have been asked in public to reveal who hired him to put together the hit job on Mr. Trump, which was based largely on anonymous Russian sources. Turns out Democrats are willing to give up just about anything\u2014including their Manafort moment\u2014to protect Mr. Simpson from having to answer that question.What if, all this time, Washington and the media have had the Russia collusion story backward? What if it wasn\u2019t the Trump campaign playing footsie with the       Vladimir Putin       regime, but Democrats? The more we learn about Fusion, the more this seems a possibility.We know Fusion is a for-hire political outfit, paid to dig up dirt on targets. This column first outed Fusion in 2012, detailing its efforts to tar a       Mitt Romney       donor. At the time Fusion insisted that the donor was \u201ca legitimate subject of public records research.\u201dMr. Grassley\u2019s call for testimony has uncovered more such stories.       Thor Halvorssen,        a prominent human-rights activist, has submitted sworn testimony outlining a Fusion attempt to undercut his investigation of Venezuelan corruption. Mr. Halvorssen claims Fusion \u201cdevised smear campaigns, prepared dossiers containing false information,\u201d and \u201ccarefully placed slanderous news items\u201d to malign him and his activity.William Browder,        a banker who has worked to expose Mr. Putin\u2019s crimes, testified to the Grassley committee on Thursday that he was the target of a similar campaign, saying that Fusion \u201cspread false information\u201d about him and his efforts. Fusion has admitted it was hired by a law firm representing a Russian company called Prevezon.Prevezon employed one of the Russian operators who were at Trump Tower last year. The other Russian who attended that meeting,       Rinat Akhmetshin,        is a former Soviet counterintelligence officer. He has acknowledged in court documents that he makes his career out of opposition research, the same work Fusion does. And that he\u2019s often hired by Kremlin-connected Russians to smear opponents.We know that at the exact time Fusion was working with the Russians, the firm had also hired a former British spy,       Christopher Steele,        to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump. Mr. Steele compiled his material, according to his memos, based on allegations from unnamed Kremlin insiders and other Russians. Many of the claims sound eerily similar to the sort of \u201coppo\u201d Mr. Akhmetshin peddled.We know that Mr. Simpson is tight with Democrats. His current attorney,       Joshua Levy,        used to work in Congress as counsel to no less than Chuck Schumer. We know from a Grassley letter that Fusion has in the past sheltered its clients\u2019 true identities by filtering money through law firms or shell companies (Bean LLC and Kernel LLC).Word is Mr. Simpson has made clear he will appear for a voluntary committee interview only if he is not specifically asked who hired him to dig dirt on Mr. Trump. Democrats are going to the mat for him over that demand. Those on the Judiciary Committee pointedly did not sign letters in which Mr. Grassley demanded that Fusion reveal who hired it.Here\u2019s a thought: What if it was the Democratic National Committee or       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       campaign? What if that money flowed from a political entity on the left, to a private law firm, to Fusion, to a British spook, and then to Russian sources? Moreover, what if those Kremlin-tied sources already knew about this dirt-digging, tipped off by Mr. Akhmetshin? What if they specifically made up claims to dupe Mr. Steele, to trick him into writing this dossier?Fusion GPS, in an email, said that it \u201cdid not spread false information about William Browder.\u201d The firm said it is cooperating with Congress and that \u201cthe president and his allies are desperately trying to smear Fusion GPS because it investigated Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\u201dIf the Russian intention was to sow chaos in the American political system, few things could have been more effective than that dossier, which ramped up an FBI investigation and sparked congressional probes and a special counsel, deeply wounding the president. This is all to Mr. Putin\u2019s benefit, and the question is whether Russia engineered it.If Special Counsel       Robert Mueller,        Democrats and the media really want answers about Russian meddling, this is a far deeper well than the so-far scant case against Mr. Trump. If they refuse to dive into the story, we\u2019ll know that the truth about Russia and the election was never what they were after.Write to kim@wsj.com.Appeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-paid-for-the-trump-dossier-1501193386", "keywords": [" clinton, collusion, democrat,fusion gps, judiciary committee, russia, trump,Donald Trump Jr,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 18:09:00", "news_title": "Al Gore\u2019s Climate Sequel Misses a Few Inconvenient Facts", "content": "They say the sequel is always worse than the original, but       Al Gore\u2019s       first film set the bar pretty low. Eleven years ago, \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d hyped global warming by relying more on scare tactics than science. This weekend Mr. Gore is back with \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.\u201d If the trailer is any indication, it promises to be more of the same.The former vice president has a poor record. Over the past 11 years Mr. Gore has suggested that global warming had caused an increase in tornadoes, that Mount Kilimanjaro\u2019s glacier would disappear by 2016, and that the Arctic summers could be ice-free as soon as 2014. These predictions and claims all proved wrong.\u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d promoted the frightening narrative that higher temperatures mean more extreme weather, especially hurricanes. The movie poster showed a hurricane emerging from a smokestack. Mr. Gore appears to double down on this by declaring in the new film\u2019s trailer: \u201cStorms get stronger and more destructive. Watch the water splash off the city. This is global warming.\u201dThis is misleading. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2014in its Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2013\u2014found \u201clow confidence\u201d of increased hurricane activity to date because of global warming. Storms are causing more damage, but primarily because more wealthy people choose to live on the coast, not because of rising temperatures.Even if tropical storms strengthen by 2100, their relative cost likely will decrease. In a 2012 article for the journal Nature Climate Change, researchers showed that hurricane damage now costs 0.04% of global gross domestic product. If climate change makes hurricanes stronger, absolute costs will double by 2100. But the world will also be much wealthier and less vulnerable, so the total damage is estimated at only 0.02% of global GDP.In the trailer, Mr. Gore addresses \u201cthe most criticized scene\u201d of his previous documentary, which suggested that \u201cthe combination of sea-level rise and storm surge would flood the 9/11 Memorial site.\u201d Then viewers are shown footage of Manhattan taking on water in 2012 after superstorm Sandy, apparently vindicating Mr. Gore\u2019s claims. Never mind that what he actually predicted was flooding caused by melting ice in Greenland.More important is that Mr. Gore\u2019s prescriptions\u2014for New York and the globe\u2014won\u2019t work. He claims the answer to warming lies in agreements to cut carbon that would cost trillions of dollars. That would not have stopped Sandy. What New York really needs is better infrastructure: sea walls, storm doors for the subway, porous pavement. These fixes could cost around $100 million a year, a bargain compared with the price of international climate treaties.Mr. Gore helped negotiate the first major global agreement on climate, the Kyoto Protocol. It did nothing to reduce emissions (and therefore to rein in temperatures), according to a March 2017 article in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management. Undaunted, Mr. Gore still endorses the same solution, and the new documentary depicts him roaming the halls of the Paris climate conference.By 2030 the Paris climate accord will cost the world up to $2 trillion a year, mostly in lost economic growth, according to the best peer-reviewed energy-economic models. It will remain that expensive for the rest of the century. This would make it the most expensive treaty in history.And for what? Just ahead of the Paris conference, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change estimated that if every country fulfills every promised Paris carbon cut between 2016 and 2030, carbon dioxide emissions will drop by only 60 gigatons over that time frame. To keep the temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, the world must reduce such emissions nearly 6,000 gigatons over this century, according to the IPCC. A \u201csuccessful\u201d Paris agreement wouldn\u2019t even come close to solving the problem.Mr. Gore argues that the Paris approach pushes nations and businesses toward green energy. Perhaps, but the global economy is far from ready to replace fossil fuels with solar and wind. The International Energy Agency, in its 2016 World Energy Outlook, found that 0.6% of the world\u2019s energy is supplied by solar and wind. Even with the Paris accord fully implemented, that number would rise only to 3% in a quarter-century.In part because of activists like Mr. Gore, the world remains focused on subsidizing inefficient, unreliable technology, rather than investing in research to push down the price of green energy. Real progress in Paris could be found on the sidelines, where philanthropist       Bill Gates       and others, including political leaders, agreed to increase spending on research and development. This is an important start, but much more funding is needed.Mr. Gore declares in his new film that \u201cit is right to save humanity.\u201d No argument here.

Horizontal directional drilling\u2014known in oil-and-gas parlance as \u201cHDD\u201d\u2014made the fracking revolution possible. But an unexpected early adopter near this California border town is a drug cartel.The kingpin Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman Loera is being held in a hardened Manhattan jail cell, but nobody does cross-border digging better than his Sinaloa Cartel. The drug lord escaped from prison in 2015 after a crew tunneled to retrieve him. Soon all-but-undetectable boreholes may whisk cylindrical containers across the border from Mexico, wall or no wall.Last year, while doing work linked to the modernization of the Calexico border crossing, my firm\u2019s research department, sifting through property records and interviewing buyers and sellers, stumbled onto what\u2019s believed to be the first real-estate purchased in the U.S. expressly to mask the exit of a drug tunnel.The site had already been raided and its owner arrested. A house had been built around a hole leading to a 32-foot vertical shaft and then the main tunnel. It was an engineering marvel, with rails and lighting, running 415 yards across the border to the back of a restaurant in Mexicali.The feds have discovered more than 80 cross-border smuggling tunnels since 2006. Most have been man-sized, but those may soon be obsolete. A used directional-drilling rig\u2014say, the Vermeer Navigator D10x15 or the Ditch Witch JT25\u2014can be bought online starting at about $100,000. The low cost could \u201cdemocratize\u201d drug tunneling and render obsolete the antidrug mission of a Trump-esque wall.The technology requires almost no manual labor. A rig can drill a tube, from 8 to 80 inches in diameter, for a mile horizontally, \u201cgeo-steered\u201d to hit a precise target. The driller can monitor his progress in real time while the system automatically lays pipe behind the drill head.In Calexico, seven trafficking operations involving HDD rigs have been discovered since 2008, sometimes when the drill bits hit city infrastructure, as Jason Kersten reported for GQ in 2014. He explains that in 2011 the Calexico Fire Department responded to a report of a foul odor from a motorcycle shop. A hazmat team broke inside and found a Ditch Witch JT8020\u2014one of the so-called maxi-rigs. Smugglers had planned on drilling underneath a canal to reach Mexico.Ground-scanning radar may be able to help uncover such plots, but the technology has not kept pace. San Diego\u2019s Tunnel Task Force reportedly uses its units only rarely. \u201cThe tunnel task force has experimented with ground-penetrating radar devices,\u201d a reporter for the Voice of San Diego wrote last month, \u201cbut rocky soil and a web of interconnecting sewage systems that run through the area interfere.\u201dThe reality is that there may not be a ready solution to fight these illicit subterranean activities.

Almost immediately the matter of who would be celebrated at this memorial in the Bronx became a matter of public interest and vigorous street-corner debate. Today hardly anyone goes there. Instead, the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., is the one that provokes heated arguments as to who deserves and who does not deserve to be enshrined among baseball\u2019s greatest. Outfielder       Tim Raines,        for instance, would not be joining       Jeff Bagwell       and       Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez       at this weekend\u2019s induction ceremonies without years of campaigning by advocates quoting advanced statistics.Jay Jaffe,        a pioneering statistical analyst, has long promulgated his own player-ranking system called JAWS, which claims to measure the worthiness of individual players for inclusion in the Hall of Fame. His new book is boldly titled \u201cThe Cooperstown Casebook: Who\u2019s in the Baseball Hall of Fame, Who Should Be In, and Who Should Pack Their Plaques.\u201d Not everyone will agree with his selections.Among right fielders, for example, those who deserve induction include       Larry Walker       (of the Expos and Rockies), for whom he makes a strong and extended case, arguing against those who believe Mr. Walker\u2019s offensive record benefits unfairly from Colorado\u2019s thin atmosphere. Dwight Evans of Red Sox fame also deserves further consideration, as does the Twins\u2019       Tony Oliva.       \u201cThe most dubious honorees\u201d among right fielders are       Ross Youngs,        who played for the New York Giants in 1917-26, and       Tommy McCarthy,        who played mostly in Boston and St. Louis from 1884 to 1896.In terms of starting pitchers, Mr. Jaffe is not kind to Hall of Famers Catfish Hunter,       Lefty Gomez,       Rube Marquard       or the man he calls \u201cthe bottom of the barrel among enshrined starters,\u201d one Jesse \u201cPop\u201d Haines, who threw his last pitch for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1937. He argues passionately for the inclusion of       Mike Mussina       (Orioles and Yankees) and       Curt Schilling       (Orioles, Astros, Phillies, Diamondbacks and Red Sox). Mr. Jaffe clearly does not like Mr. Schilling as a person but shows that his performance on the field leaves little doubt that he belongs in Cooperstown. Finally, Mr. Jaffe names the top three starting pitchers of all time\u2014      Walter Johnson,       Cy Young       and       Roger Clemens,        the last of whom sportswriters have refused to vote into the Hall due to speculations about performance-enhancing drugs.By Jay Jaffe  Thomas Dunne, 446 pages, $25.99To understand how Mr. Jaffe reaches these conclusions, readers must first try to understand JAWS\u2014the Jaffe WAR Score\u2014and to do so one must first understand WAR, the acronym embedded in Mr. Jaffe\u2019s acronym, which stands for Wins Above Replacement. (For the purposes of calculation, a replacement-level player at a position\u2014whatever theoretical bench-rider a team would have to substitute if a player got injured\u2014produces zero wins.) At the recent All-Star break, for instance, Yankee slugger Aaron Judge led the majors with a WAR of 5.2, followed by Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer at 5.0.Got all that? Didn\u2019t think so. From their inception in the past decade, complicated formulas like those determining WAR have eluded the ability of the average fan to compute on his own, let alone comprehend. Clearly the higher that one\u2019s WAR is, the better. But can you really compare pitchers and batters using the same metric? JAWS, like WAR, also makes no attempt to account for postseason play, awards won and historical importance.Mr. Jaffe is a clear and clever writer who does an excellent job of putting statistics into play and explaining how his own metric evolved as a tool for Hall of Fame voting. (Indeed, many Hall of Fame voters now point to JAWS ratings when explaining their votes.) The statistical portion of the book, however, will appear somewhere on a scale of daunting to dull to many readers. Fortunately, Mr. Jaffe is far more than a skilled sabermetrician, which he shows when he gets down to the specific cases of men whose election to the Hall of Fame has been either denied or delayed. His chapter on third basemen, for example, dwells on the career of       Ron Santo,        who despite obviously worthy credentials wasn\u2019t elected until 2011, 37 years after the end of his career and a year after he died. In Mr. Jaffe\u2019s final ranking, Santo ends up in seventh place at his position, somewhere between       George Brett       and       Brooks Robinson.Mr. Jaffe warns us at the beginning of the book that as much as he personally admires Sandy Koufax, the JAWS system shows him no mercy: Mr. Koufax places No. 87 among all starting pitchers and in the lowest quartile of the starting pitchers now in Cooperstown. The author admits that this ranking alone may cause some readers to become very upset and politely asks those who break the book\u2019s binding by throwing it against the wall to consider buying a new copy. He ends his Koufax entry by adding that, despite his poor JAWS score, \u201cif you needed one pitcher to win one game, prime Koufax would get strong consideration.\u201dIn his most provocative sections of \u201cThe Cooperstown Casebook,\u201d Mr. Jaffe rails against past injustices.       Larry Doby,        the first African-American to play in the American League, was turned down in 1967; an additional 31 years had to pass before he was elected by the veterans committee, five years before his death. After recounting this travesty, Mr. Jaffe adds a one-word sentence, in which a term unsuitable for this forum is inserted between \u201cun\u201d and \u201cbelievable.\u201d For a man of numbers, Mr. Jaffe can sound a lot like the guy at the other end of the bar. But that\u2019s why his book is so much fun to read, whatever one might think about our ability to precisely measure baseball greatness.Mr. Dickson is the author, most recently, of \u201cLeo Durocher: Baseball\u2019s Prodigal Son.\u201dAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Who Belongs In the Hall?.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-get-to-cooperstown-1501193302", "keywords": ["book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,sports,routine general news,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 18:08:00", "news_title": "Why Not a Day of Rest From Politics?", "content": "For the past decade I have attended a Protestant church near my home. Every Sunday I am surrounded by loving friends and acquaintances. I rejoice in the good news of the Gospel. I ponder how to live a better life. I petition God for my family and friends, asking for good health, prosperity and wisdom. I pray that the light of love will shine into dark hearts.Yet I do all this knowing that my church is effectively a political adversary. I am a Republican. The Episcopal Church, like many mainline Protestant denominations, supports a \u201csocial justice\u201d agenda that reads as if it were pulled straight from the Democratic National Committee platform.I know I\u2019m not alone. Mainline Protestants are about evenly divided politically, according to a 2014 Pew Forum poll. Forty-four percent support or lean toward Republicans, and 40% support or lean toward Democrats. Yet you wouldn\u2019t know this by reading these churches\u2019 statements on public policy.The advocacy arms of the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church have urged legislators to oppose any attempt to rein in ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \u201cAs you may know,\u201d the Episcopal Church\u2019s director of government relations wrote in a March letter to Congress, \u201cour Church upholds affordable and effective health care for every American, backs Medicaid as an essential program for low-income families, and supports adequate government funding for research and medical care for women\u2019s health.\u201dIn states with partisan voter registration, nearly 60% of some Mainline Protestant denominations\u2019 pastors are listed as Democrats, according to an academic study released in June. Left-of-center religious leaders are also more high-profile than ever, since       Donald Trump\u2019s       victory compelled many of them to increase their focus on anti-Republican activism. After decades of evangelical conservative influence on the Republican Party, the Christian left wants to leave its mark on congregations and the Democratic Party.Instead, I offer a plea to all religious leaders, on the left and right: If you\u2019re considering involving your churches in political debates, please don\u2019t. Don\u2019t actively work against those sitting in your pews who agree with Christ\u2019s message but disagree about using government programs to advance it. Instead, focus on the individual acts of mercy that matter most.I realize that church leaders face a conundrum. If they truly believe they see injustice in the world, and if it happens to be sponsored by an opposing political party, they reasonably could believe they have a religious obligation to fight it. Why would they stand by while millions of people are being hurt? Moreover, the list of brave Christians who stood up to an unjust state spans centuries and continents, from       Thomas Becket       to       Martin Luther King Jr.Many of today\u2019s clerical approaches to public policy seem inspired by       Dietrich Bonhoeffer,        the anti-Nazi Lutheran pastor. Millions of Germans either supported       Hitler       or remained silent. That collective sin darkens the 20th century, a constant reminder that failing to act can be as repugnant as endorsing evil. Bonhoeffer felt driven by his Christian faith to aid the resistance. For this he was imprisoned and ultimately executed in 1945.Bonhoeffer\u2019s witness surely must energize today\u2019s pastors, who believe Christ calls them not to remain silent but to fight injustice. To that impulse, I say huzzah. The faithful are indeed meant to help the poor and those who have been treated unfairly\u2014and I\u2019ll admit to wishing I could do more in this regard.Yet when it comes to the confiscatory and regulatory power of the state, my answer to the what-would-Jesus-do question gets complicated. Would he want me to force my fellow citizens, on penalty of jail time, to give up more of their earnings to fund programs I personally like? Would he want me to jeopardize their security and happiness to support policies I happen to think are compassionate? Or does he call me to act without manipulating the heavy hand of government to impose my will on others?I don\u2019t always know the answers to these questions. Sometimes I wonder, with a smile, what might happen if Jesus appeared in the flesh and disagreed with the policy statements on many churches\u2019 websites. If he quietly suggested that we, as individuals, should focus more on personal charity and community involvement than on political advocacy for government programs, would religious leaders think him not \u201cChristian\u201d enough? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d forgive them for the snub.Ms. Sternberg is the author of \u201cFall from Grace,\u201d forthcoming from Bancroft in September.Appeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-not-a-day-of-rest-from-politics-1501193333", "keywords": [" conservative,episcopal, liberal, lutheran, mainline protestant, religion,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,religion,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 18:07:00", "news_title": "The Democrats\u2019 Biggest Problem Is Cultural", "content": "Six months into the       Trump       presidency, congressional Democrats have begun to frame an alternative agenda. Recognizing their abandonment in 2016 by so-called working-class voters, they have unveiled a handful of spending and tax-policy benefits targeted to that constituency.A much larger, comprehensive policy package is needed. Beyond that, Democrats need to recognize a profound voter shift that has been under way since 1968 and is centered on cultural issues.Three statements in recent years illustrate why former Democratic voters have abandoned their party. First,       Barack Obama\u2019s       2008 campaign remark that small-town Americans \u201ccling to guns and religion.\u201d Second,       Michelle Obama\u2019s       statement, also in 2008, that \u201cfor the first time in my adult lifetime I am proud of my country.\u201d Third,       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       2016 characterization of Trump supporters as \u201cdeplorables\u201d: \u201cThey are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.\u201dNone of these statements had anything to do with national security or economics. They revealed a mind-set that many voters find offensive\u2014a huge cultural chasm that cannot be bridged by offering voters economic goodies.The Democratic voter exodus began in 1968 when millions of traditional blue-collar and middle-income voters moved to Republican       Richard Nixon       or third-party candidate       George Wallace,        a Democratic former governor of Alabama. Alienated by street and campus riots and disorder, these voters bought into the Nixon/Wallace law-and-order themes. Some also were attracted to their message that Great Society programs had overreached.As Vice President       Hubert Humphrey\u2019s       assistant, I stood with him on election night when we learned that he had lost both Ohio and New Jersey, and the national election, because old-style Democrats had defected in those key states. I recalled visiting Democratic Rep.       Pete Rodino\u2019s       campaign headquarters weeks earlier in New Jersey and seeing posters of Rodino and Wallace but none of HumphreyThe shift, and the margin of Democratic loss, became far more dramatic in 1972. I was policy and platform director for       George McGovern\u2019s       campaign. Our organizers and convention delegates were mostly from the generation that had come of age during the 1968 protests. They opposed the Vietnam War. But they were mostly interested in cultural and lifestyle issues\u2014\u201cacid, amnesty and abortion,\u201d as Republicans called them, picking up a line that turned out to have originated with McGovern\u2019s first running mate, Sen.       Thomas Eagleton.       Those Democrats gave short shrift to jobs, economic growth, public safety and other traditional voter concerns.Their successors in the party have continued to focus on cultural issues with limited appeal. Their focus on political correctness and conformity has left an impression on traditional Democrats that their party leaders care more about transgender bathroom access than employment, the cost of living, education or public safety. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d reference struck home with these voters.The Democrats\u2019 post-1972 evolution also has turned upside down the party\u2019s approaches to racial and economic justice. The Great Society approach was to enact laws, such as the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts, removing legal obstacles to justice. Medicare and Medicaid provided a health-care safety net to the elderly and poor. Job training, early education, nutrition, health and other War on Poverty programs were provided to the poor and only incidentally benefited minorities disproportionately. They were designed to help lift disadvantaged Americans to an equal place at the starting line\u2014never to guarantee equality at the finish line. We also talked of \u201cequal law enforcement,\u201d which would protect citizens in minority neighborhoods while at the same time assuring race-blind treatment of offenders and suspects.Decades later, urban black communities in particular are in crisis. School dropout and incarceration rates, high black-on-black murder and other crime rates, births out of wedlock far outnumbering intact families, pervasive drug dealing and use, and a disgraceful poverty rate should shame all of us.The answer to this crisis does not lie in cries of black victimization by police or other authorities. It lies instead with tangible, practical programs like those we launched in the 1960s. We purposely sought bipartisan sponsorship in Congress and enlisted labor, business, academic and other support in society more broadly. We did it that way because we believed we were all in it together and had to address priorities together. Most Americans today would agree this is the way to go, but their leaders are offering mainly partisanship and polarization.Political scientist       V.O. Key       famously observed that \u201cthe voters are not fools.\u201d Millions of them, including traditional Democrats, driven by anger and frustration, abandoned their political roots last November to make Donald Trump president. Many probably sensed that chaos and fumbling would follow. By their lights, it was an acceptable price to pay to rid themselves of leaders who had forgotten them.Congressional Democrats are right to begin construction of an alternative agenda. But as they do so, they must recognize that most Americans are not racist, sexist, ignorant or opposed to alternative lifestyles. Most largely accept the cultural and social changes of the past half-century. To recapture traditional Democratic voters, and attract new ones, Democrats must learn empathy for those who believe they are being mocked for working hard, going to church, serving in the military, and trying to instill moral standards in their children.Back in the day we spoke admiringly of officeholders and candidates who were \u201cfor the people.\u201d Those same people now must come to feel again that there are Democrats who understand them, their values and their aspirations and do not view them as cultural inferiors to be manipulated in campaign years.

It\u2019s not that he is inexperienced, crude, an outsider. It is that he is weak and sniveling. It is that he undermines himself almost daily by ignoring traditional norms and forms of American masculinity.He\u2019s not strong and self-controlled, not cool and tough, not low-key and determined; he\u2019s whiny, weepy and self-pitying. He throws himself, sobbing, on the body politic. He\u2019s a drama queen. It was once said, sarcastically, of George H.W. Bush that he reminded everyone of her first husband. Trump must remind people of their first wife. Actually his wife, Melania, is tougher than he is with her stoicism and grace, her self-discipline and desire to show the world respect by presenting herself with dignity.Half the president\u2019s tweets show utter weakness. They are plaintive, shrill little cries, usually just after dawn. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their president.\u201d The brutes. Actually they\u2019ve been laboring to be loyal to him since Inauguration Day. \u201cThe Republicans never discuss how good their health care bill is.\u201d True, but neither does       Mr. Trump,        who seems unsure of its content. In just the past two weeks, of the press, he complained: \u201cEvery story/opinion, even if should be positive, is bad!\u201d Journalists produce \u201chighly slanted & even fraudulent reporting.\u201d They are \u201cDISTORTING DEMOCRACY.\u201d They \u201cfabricate the facts.\u201dIt\u2019s all whimpering accusation and finger-pointing: Nobody\u2019s nice to me. Why don\u2019t they appreciate me?His public brutalizing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions isn\u2019t strong, cool and deadly; it\u2019s limp, lame and blubbery. \u201cSessions has taken a VERY weak position on       Hillary Clinton       crimes,\u201d he tweeted this week. Talk about projection.He told the Journal\u2019s Michael C. Bender he is disappointed in Mr. Sessions and doesn\u2019t feel any particular loyalty toward him. \u201cHe was a senator, he looks at 40,000 people and he probably says, \u2018What do I have to lose?\u2019 And he endorsed me. So it\u2019s not like a great loyal thing about the endorsement.\u201d Actually, Mr. Sessions supported him early and put his personal credibility on the line. In Politico, John J. Pitney Jr. of Claremont McKenna College writes: \u201cLoyalty is about strength. It is about sticking with a person, a cause, an idea or a country even when it is costly, difficult or unpopular.\u201d A strong man does that. A weak one would unleash his resentments and derive sadistic pleasure from their unleashing.The way American men used to like seeing themselves, the template they most admired, was the strong silent type celebrated in classic mid-20th century films\u2014Gary Cooper, John Wayne, Henry Fonda. In time the style shifted, and we wound up with the nervous and chattery. More than a decade ago the producer and writer David Chase had his Tony Soprano mourn the disappearance of the old style: \u201cWhat they didn\u2019t know is once they got Gary Cooper in touch with his feelings they wouldn\u2019t be able to shut him up!\u201d The new style was more like that of Woody Allen. His characters couldn\u2019t stop talking about their emotions, their resentments and needs. They were self-justifying as they acted out their cowardice and anger.But he was a comic. It was funny. He wasn\u2019t putting it out as a new template for maleness. Donald Trump now is like an unfunny Woody Allen.Who needs a template for how to be a man? A lot of boys and young men, who\u2019ve grown up in a culture confused about what men are and do. Who teaches them the real dignity and meaning of being a man? Mostly good fathers and teachers. Luckily Mr. Trump this week addressed the Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia, where he represented to them masculinity and the moral life.\u201cWho the hell wants to speak about politics when I\u2019m in front of the Boy Scouts, right?\u201d But he overcame his natural reticence. We should change how we refer to Washington, he said: \u201cWe ought to change it from the word \u2018swamp\u2019 to perhaps \u2018cesspool\u2019 or perhaps to the word \u2018sewer.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Washington is not nice to him and is full of bad people. \u201cAs the Scout Law says, \u2018A Scout is trustworthy, loyal\u2014we could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that.\u201d He then told them the apparently tragic story of a man who was once successful. \u201cAnd in the end he failed, and he failed badly.\u201dWhy should he inspire them, show personal height, weight and dignity, support our frail institutions? He has needs and wants\u2014he is angry!\u2014which supersede pesky, long-term objectives. Why put the amorphous hopes of the audience ahead of his own, more urgent needs?His inability\u2014not his refusal, but his inability\u2014to embrace the public and rhetorical role of the presidency consistently and constructively is weak.\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to act presidential but that\u2019s not gonna get it done,\u201d Mr. Trump said the other night at a rally in Youngstown, Ohio. That is the opposite of the truth. The truth, six months in, is that he is not presidential and is not getting it done. His mad, blubbery petulance isn\u2019t working for him but against him. If he were presidential he\u2019d be getting it done\u2014building momentum, gaining support. He\u2019d be over 50%, not under 40%. He\u2019d have health care, and more.We close with the observation that it\u2019s all nonstop drama and queen-for-a-day inside this hothouse of a White House. Staffers speak in their common yet somehow colorful language of their wants, their complaints. The new communications chief,       Anthony Scaramucci,        who in his debut came across as affable and in control of himself, went on CNN Thursday to show he\u2019ll fit right in. He\u2019s surrounded by \u201cnefarious, backstabbing\u201d leakers. \u201cThe fish stinks from the head down. But I can tell you two fish that don\u2019t stink, and that\u2019s me and the president.\u201d He\u2019s strong and well connected: \u201cI\u2019ve got buddies of mine in the FBI\u201d; \u201c      Sean Hannity       is one of my closest friends.\u201d He is constantly with the president, at dinner, on the phone, in the sauna snapping towels. I made that up. \u201cThe president and I would like to tell everybody we have a very, very good idea of who the leakers are.\u201d Chief of Staff Reince Priebus better watch it. There are people in the White House who \u201cthink it is their job to save America from this president, okay?\u201d So they leak. But we know who they are.He seemed to think this diarrheic diatribe was professional, the kind of thing the big boys do with their media bros. But he came across as just another drama queen for this warring, riven, incontinent White House. As Scaramucci spoke, the historian Joshua Zeitz observed wonderingly, on Twitter: \u201cIt\u2019s Team of Rivals but for morons.\u201dIt is. And it stinks from the top.Meanwhile the whole world is watching, a world that contains predators.

The tale of Esther (Nehassaiu deGannes), an illiterate turn-of-the-century black seamstress who suffers grievously when she falls in love with the wrong man, it unfolds in       Daniela Varon\u2019s       Shakespeare & Company revival with an unadorned simplicity that reminded me of a silent movie when I saw \u201cIntimate Apparel\u201d off Broadway 13 years ago. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that the dialogue is in any way lacking, for it is, as always with Ms. Nottage, plain-spoken and pungent (\u201cHe was too proper to like anything colored\u201d).

Whatever the reason, an Ayckbourn revival is always worth traveling to see, and Barrington Stage Company\u2019s production of \u201cTaking Steps,\u201d which had a brief Broadway run in 1991 but doesn\u2019t seem to have received any major American stagings since then, is a joyous romp from curtain to curtain.Taking StepsBarrington Stage Company, Boyd-Quinson Mainstage, 30 Union St., Pittsfield, Mass.  $15-$62, 413-236-8888, closes Aug. 13\u201cTaking Steps,\u201d like \u201cBedroom Farce\u201d and \u201cThe Norman Conquests\u201d before it, is one of Mr. Ayckbourn\u2019s scenically conceptual plays. The initiating premise is that the action takes place in a rundown three-story country house that is allegedly haunted and was once a Victorian brothel\u2014except that there aren\u2019t any stairs. Instead, the three floors are all on the same level, and the actors mime clambering up and down the steps that connect them. Unusually for Mr. Ayckbourn, \u201cTaking Steps\u201d is a purely comic farce (six doors, six characters) with no dire emotional undertones. Like all classic farces, it hinges on the humiliation of a pompous ass, a manufacturer of buckets (      Richard Hollis      ) whose ditsy wife (      Claire Brownell      ) decides to leave him at the exact moment that he decides to buy the country house in question. The resulting craziness is screwed up into successively higher keys by the arrival of the wife\u2019s boring brother (      Luke Smith      ); the bucket magnate\u2019s klutzy, inarticulate lawyer (      Carson Elrod      ); the loud-mouthed owner of the house (      Matthew Greer      ); and the brother\u2019s miserable fianc\u00e9e (      Helen Cespedes      ).\u201cTaking Steps\u201d was written to be performed in the round, and any attempt to mount it on a proscenium stage, as Barrington Stage is doing, must account for this inescapable fact. Enter       Sam Buntrock,        the director, whose solution to the problem, arrived at in collaboration with       Jason Sherwood       and       David Weiner,        respectively the set and lighting designers, is to interlock the three playing areas instead of placing them side by side on the stage, using lighting cues to signal where the characters are at any given moment, the same way it\u2019s done in the round. You\u2019ll have no trouble keeping up with their demented doings, and Mr. Buntrock is splendidly adept at the hair-trigger timing necessary to keep a farce in motion. Mr. Elrod takes top marks as the bumbling lawyer who\u2026but I\u2019d probably better stop right there. It\u2019s enough to say that certain of Mr. Ayckbourn\u2019s characters end up in bed with certain other characters, and that some of them\u2014but not all\u2014get what they want.

But his argument is misleading and based on an inaccurate reading of the bill.Much of Mr. Ischinger\u2019s ire is directed at a provision authorizing sanctions against companies that invest in Russian energy pipelines. But that provision is discretionary, meaning it doesn\u2019t require new sanctions on anybody. It\u2019s hardly a reason to reject the bill.Mr. Ischinger also criticizes a provision that extends current sanctions on Russian offshore oil ventures to projects in which any Russian company is involved. He claims this provision endangers Shah Deniz, a gas field in Azerbaijan. This is false, as the sanctions target oil projects specifically. In fact, the provision smartly closes a loophole that could allow Russia to copy advanced drilling techniques from U.S. firms.Most misleading, Mr. Ischinger asserts the bill would undermine trans-Atlantic unity on Russia sanctions, arguing that Washington should negotiate new sanctions multilaterally. As one of the negotiators of existing U.S.-EU sanctions, I\u2019m sympathetic to this argument. But it\u2019s a pipe dream that the Kremlin-friendly Trump administration would collaborate with Brussels to impose new sanctions on Russia. Moreover, the EU isn\u2019t exactly clamoring for new Russia sanctions either. Far from risking trans-Atlantic unity, the bill protects it by ensuring Mr. Trump can\u2019t capriciously lift sanctions.A strong response to Russia is in the interest of America and Europe. This bill is just that.Edward FishmanWashingtonMr. Fishman was on the team that negotiated U.S.-EU sanctions in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.As a former U.S. diplomat with strong ties to Europe, I concur with Wolfgang Ischinger\u2019s plea for trans-Atlantic unity in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine.However, the proposed U.S. sanctions bill is not the \u201cTrojan horse\u201d portrayed in German media, or by longtime opponents of European sanctions toward Russia. The bill\u2019s main objective is to codify existing sanctions into law, not to penalize Europe\u2019s energy companies. The vast majority of the additional measures\u2014including the energy sections\u2014are discretionary and will not be applied automatically, should the bill be signed into law.There is a wider point for Europe to consider. The conflict in eastern Ukraine is escalating. Russian-backed forces are continuing their daily rocket and artillery attacks and civilian casualties are rising substantially. Europe\u2019s response has been the continuation of a status quo that is not delivering. Unity is important, but above all it must have a purpose: to end a war prolonged by Russia and its proxies. This will only be made possible when we change Moscow\u2019s calculus by raising the costs of aggression and increasing our own leverage by creating new incentives to deliver a cease-fire and restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over its occupied eastern territories.The U.S. sanctions bill could have been drafted more judiciously. However, German and Austrian ministers\u2019 outright rejection of it is not acting in the spirit of maintaining unity either. Instead, we should engage in a trans-Atlantic dialogue to ensure that this bill will encourage Russia to change its behavior toward its European neighbors, without long-term damage to European or American companies.Amb.

HLT 0.26%       and is trying to buy an investment firm from White House communications director       Anthony Scaramucci      ?The answer, it turns out, is a work in progress.Closely held HNA\u2019s biggest shareholder, disclosed in a document released earlier this week, is a New York nonprofit that the group established in December and located in HNA\u2019s office building in Midtown Manhattan. That organization, Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation, has yet to commence operations, decide on what charitable causes to contribute to or work out details of how it will be funded, according to people familiar with the matter.The HNA shares in question\u2014a nearly 30% stake valued at tens of billions of dollars\u2014have yet to be transferred to the foundation, the people said. HNA is learning as it goes: Executives recently held discussions with another big U.S. foundation to understand how it was being run, the people said.HNA\u2019s disclosure of a big, new owner leaves many questions about the group unanswered, especially concerning the provenance of the 30% stake. The shares had been held offshore by two private investors unrelated to HNA who donated them to the foundation, people familiar with the matter said.The birth of Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation also reflects an opaque Chinese acquirer\u2019s struggle to conform to Western rules. Many of China\u2019s most aggressive and entrepreneurial companies are closely held and disclose little information about their operations, ownership or funding. That has hurt them as they have rushed to expand overseas in recent years, with regulators, bankers and lawmakers in numerous countries questioning a wide variety of issues, including potential ties to the Chinese government and whether investments abroad were merely ways of moving private wealth out of China.HNA, which has $146 billion in assets and gets half of its revenue from outside China, has encountered challenges at home and abroad. It has been one of the country\u2019s most aggressive overseas investors, whose $25 billion in announced deals since the beginning of 2016 include stakes in         Deutsche Bank               AG, Hilton Worldwide Holdings and the yet-to-close purchase of a stake in hedge-fund investment firm SkyBridge Capital from Mr. Scaramucci.A few months ago, however, Chinese regulators started probing the group\u2019s high debt levels. In the U.S., regulators didn\u2019t approve HNA\u2019s proposed stake in a Los Angeles-based in-flight entertainment equipment maker by a deadline set by the two companies, and the deal collapsed this week.If the foundation gets off the ground this year, as people close to HNA say it should, it will have to disclose more about its funding, activities and holdings than most of the sprawling conglomerate, which is largely composed of private entities, including hotels and airlines.Hainan Cihang incorporated in New York, meaning it will have to follow the state\u2019s strict rules for nonprofits. It has applied for tax-exempt status as a U.S. private foundation, according to a person familiar with the application, which means it must disclose how much its holdings\u2014including HNA\u2019s shares\u2014are worth. That value is difficult to ascertain because HNA\u2019s limited disclosure obscures which of its units\u2019 debts and assets are considered part of the group balance sheet and how much money the units make.The foundation also will be bound by rules requiring roughly 5% of its net assets be disbursed for charitable purposes each year.To operate in New York, Hainan Cihang is required to register with New York Attorney General\u2019s Charities Bureau, but it has yet to do so. On Thursday, the Charities Bureau sent Hainan Cihang a letter asking it to submit its paperwork to the agency within 20 days.HNA wanted a New York center for its charitable operations both for the tax benefits and proximity to companies it has acquired and in which it has stakes, according to people familiar with the group\u2019s strategy.Scrutiny around taxes has heightened in China, prompting companies to clean up their various overseas holdings, tax specialists say.One example of a donation that may eventually come from the New York foundation is a previously announced $25 million pledge to Harvard University, according to people familiar with the matter and a six-volume book published by HNA earlier this year.While the foundation will mostly be funded by HNA\u2019s own money, it may eventually get funding from other companies or individuals, one of the people said.Three top HNA executives are listed as the foundation\u2019s initial directors: Group Chief Executive       Adam Tan      ;       Guang Yang,        the New York-based head of HNA\u2019s finance arm; and       Guoqing Chen,        HNA Chairman Chen Feng\u2019s brother, according to documents reviewed by the Journal. People involved in running the nonprofit won\u2019t benefit from its net earnings, according to an April filing viewed by The Wall Street Journal.HNA views the New York foundation as the international arm of a seven-year old foundation, which is HNA\u2019s second-biggest shareholder with a 23% stake and located in the group\u2019s home base of Hainan Province.\u2014Jenny W.

PG 0.59%       said that its move to cut more than $100 million in digital marketing spend in the June quarter had little impact on its business, proving that those digital ads were largely ineffective.Almost all of the consumer product giant\u2019s advertising cuts in the period came from digital, finance chief       Jon Moeller       said on its earnings call Thursday. The company targeted ads that could wind up on sites with fake traffic from software known as \u201cbots,\u201d or those with objectionable content.\u201cWhat it reflected was a choice to cut spending from a digital standpoint where it was ineffective, where either we were serving bots as opposed to human beings or where the placement of ads was not facilitating the equity of our brands,\u201d he said.Chief Executive       David Taylor       said in an interview that the digital spending cuts are part of a bigger push by the company to more quickly halt spending on items -- from ad campaigns to product development programs -- that aren\u2019t working.\u201cWe got some data that said either it was in a bad place or it was not effective,\u201d Mr. Taylor said of the digital cuts. \u201cAnd we shut it down and said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to follow a formula of how much you spend or share of voice. We want every dollar to add value for the consumer or add value for our stakeholders.\u201dAfter cutting back on certain digital ads, \u201cwe didn\u2019t see a reduction in the growth rate,\u201d said Mr. Moeller during the call. \u201cWhat that tells me is that the spending we cut was largely ineffective.\u201dP&G also said it reduced overhead, agency fee and ad-production costs in the quarter.P&G, whose brands include Bounty, Crest, Tide and Pampers, spent $2.45 billion on U.S. advertising, not including spending on some digital platforms, according to Kantar Media. Long the biggest advertiser in the world, its pronouncements on trends in ad spending are watched closely.The company about a year ago said that it would move away from ads on Facebook that target specific consumers, after finding that ultra-niche targeting compromises reach and has limited effectiveness. P&G indicated it wouldn\u2019t pull back on overall             Facebook                   spending.It\u2019s unclear whether P&G has shifted more spending to other media, including television, as it tweaks its digital spending approach. TV networks have been making an aggressive case that marketers have over-allocated budgets to the dark alleys of digital, and should move ad money back into TV.The cuts echo marketing executives\u2019 mounting concerns around the efficacy of digital advertising and the growing perception that they are wasting money on digital ads that never reach their intended audience.P&G, which is facing a proxy fight with activist investor       Nelson Peltz,        reported 2% increase in organic revenue in the quarter and full year ended June 30. The company posted a higher profit in the most recent quarter despite a slump in consumer spending.Mr. Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management LP criticized P&G\u2019s cutback on digital spending. P&G\u2019s improved earnings \u201ccame as a result of reducing advertising, specifically digital, a tactic we believe will damage the value of the company\u2019s brands if continued in the long term,\u201d the firm said in a statement.It\u2019s unclear what impact the digital cuts have on P&G\u2019s overall marketing spend.P&G said it\u2019s committed to advertising that delivers tangible results for its brands.Personal care brand Always, for example, saw \u201ca significant increase\u201d in awareness and equity scores since its \u201cLike a Girl\u201d campaign launched a few years ago, said Mr. Taylor on the call. The campaign shed a light on gender bias, challenging what it meant to do something \u201clike a girl.\u201dMr. Taylor on the call talked about the importance of \u201chaving a superior product\u201d that has \u201ca point of view\u201d as more consumers use social media to share their opinions.Always is among the many brands that have taken on a larger social cause or purpose in their marketing in recent years.P&G is among the packaged-goods giants tweaking their marketing spending and strategy as they face larger business challenges. Rival Unilever is also undergoing a marketing reorganization, including drastically cutting the number of agencies it works with.Spending cuts are hurting the ad agencies that rely on business from the big consumer-goods spenders.

Mr. Scaramucci is already revamping the communications team as he tries to crack down on leaks to the media and establish himself as a center of power to rival Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s chief of staff.Mr. Harvey was the senior analyst working for Gen.       David Petraeus       when he commanded U.S. forces in Iraq. He was part of a close network of experts and advisers who echoed Gen. Petraeus\u2019s views on counter insurgency, which were central to the       George W.

Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s       novel, unfinished at his death in 1940. It\u2019s much better than that. After the first two hours, in fact, the echoes of Fitzgerald\u2019s book grow ever dimmer as this powerhouse of a drama series rolls on with a voice all its own, its riveting picture not only of 1930s Hollywood but of America and Europe, too. It manages to wed all that to romance of a high order and also a low kind\u2014this is a drama that pays exquisitely close attention to the matter of moguls and the women who serve them\u2014and to scathing satire strikingly free of anything cartoonish. Which is why the film\u2019s chief mogul,       Pat Brady       (a matchless       Kelsey Grammer      ), who clearly considers the available sex to be part of his job benefits, and who is, as well, capable of any brutality in order to keep his business afloat, is, nonetheless, a tremendously appealing character.The Last TycoonFriday, AmazonHe can be softhearted\u2014he hands money to the homeless at the Hooverville set up near his studio, while hating them for being there. But he\u2019s prepared as well to accommodate the Nazis, who have strict prohibitions against anything in a Hollywood film that the Reich finds offensive. Any picture, for instance, in which a non-Jew is married to a Jew\u2014a violation of the Nazi racial laws. That\u2019s in addition to the requirement that all the studio\u2019s Jews employed in Germany be fired. The demands are presented to Brady by a Reich representative, Dr. Gyssling, who carries a briefcase adorned with a shiny swastika and who is, in fact, based on an actual special consul from Germany in the \u201930s. The Reich agent in the film has no trouble persuading studio heads to agree. Germany, Brady points out, is the second-largest world market for Hollywood.Taking all this in is Brady\u2019s supremely talented young producer,       Monroe Stahr       (      Matt Bomer      ), who is, unlike his boss, exquisite looking\u2014positively aglow with decency. Also, unlike Brady, he\u2019s Jewish. Not that anyone would know from his name, which he changed in the interest of his career. He\u2019d scarcely known his hardworking father, he confides, regretfully, several episodes on in a scene vibrant with contained emotion\u2014a tone in which Mr. Bomer is wondrously skilled.His character, Monroe, is a moralist, but a kind everyone can love and does. Monroe leads an immensely complicated life. In mourning for his beloved actress wife, who died in a fire, he finds solace, briefly, in an affair with Rose (      Rosemarie De Witt      ), wife of his boss, a man with whom he has an even more complicated relationship. Ms. De Witt is stellar as Rose, heartbreakingly and cuttingly to the point about her need to continue the affair. Monroe wants out\u2014everything about this violates his sense of propriety. Rose, like numerous others around him, is in love with Monroe, who is everything her husband is not\u2014her husband being, as she informs him one night, in a biting summation, a man who takes sexual advantage of women who work for him, doesn\u2019t mind impoverishing his employees, and traffics with Nazis.The sumptuous period detail here will invite comparisons to \u201cMadmen,\u201d but there\u2019s infinitely more in this re-creation of an era than its fidelity to the look of things\u2014though that look is, always, inescapably captivating, whether it\u2019s of people hoping for a career in pictures, or of those, like the regally beautiful       Margo Taft       (      Jennifer Beals      ), who already have one.

Speaking as someone in his 40s, let me confirm that 40 isn\u2019t that decrepit. It\u2019s barely halfway to dead! Brady is undoubtedly special, and football is a dangerous game, but all around us, there are miraculous 40-year-olds who can still put on both shoes in the morning, who can download a podcast, who can make an emergency turkey sandwich at 2 a.m. and not wake the entire family.There are even a few who can explain Snapchat.Age is purely a number\u2014the clich\u00e9 has never been more true! Today I know butt-kicking 80-something men and women, 70-something triathletes, 60-something runners, and a whole bunch of CrossFit-sculpted 50-somethings you don\u2019t want to get trapped in a conversation about CrossFit with. The one and only Kirk Douglas is now 100, and I am certain I would lose an arm-wrestling match to 100-year-old Kirk Douglas.Did you see those recent photos of buffed-out Amazon kingpin       Jeff Bezos      ? Mr. Prime is in his prime: At 53, and now the world\u2019s richest person, Bezos is completely jacked, a total biceps gun show with free two-day delivery. (I probably would still favor Warren Buffett in an arm-wrestling match, because who bets against Warren Buffett?)Business thankfully doesn\u2019t (always) kick its aging to the curb, but sports has a weird time wrapping its brain around the older athlete. We see a guy like Roger Federer capturing Wimbledon again, and we hail it as a clock-defying miracle, as if Wilford Brimley won a Grand Slam.Federer is 35! Thirty-five is a sweet spot of life. If you gave an ordinary person the ability to permanently lock into a certain age, 35 would be a top choice. You\u2019re old enough to have accomplished a few things, and you\u2019re young enough to not frighten everyone when you take off your shirt at the beach.(I\u2019m confident no one would pick being 25. Twenty-five is the pits. You\u2019re insecure, underpaid and probably still sleeping on a smelly futon. Plus all the older people in the office despise you, because in you, they see their own demise. I know I feel that way about the 25-year-olds at the Journal. They can all go work at Instagram, or Cold Stone Creamery, as far as I\u2019m concerned.)None of this is meant to knock Brady. He\u2019s exceptional, and has been for his entire career: the late draft pick turned back-up turned sudden superstar who has ascended the football mountaintop. He leads an enviable life of fame, success, money, love, family, and mumbly conversations with Bill Belichick.And, generously, he wants to share his secrets. As Brady has gotten older, he\u2019s begun to style himself as an anti-aging guru, selling dietary supplements and fitness doodads and even magic space pajamas that cost as much as a plane ticket to Chicago. Brady\u2019s morphing into a fusion of George Clooney and Jack LaLanne. I\u2019m confident that in 50 years, we\u2019re going to turn on the television (or whatever television is\u2014television\u2019s probably going to be gone in two years) and see a 90-year-old Tom Brady yanking on resistance bands and yelling at us all to get to the gym.

It\u2019s true that as you get older, your body changes, and you probably need to take it easy on the peanut butter pretzels. If you drink sugary cocktails, you\u2019re going to wake up feeling like an elephant is sitting on your head. You\u2019re going to read a lot of articles about Bitcoin and Ethereum and be completely confused.Meanwhile, you have weird, obsolete old person habits. You have a DVD player. You can navigate a car\u2014a stick-shift!\u2014without checking Google Maps. You leave and listen to voice mails. You care about cable news. You\u2019re reading this in newsprint.And you start to lose your fashion sense. One of the most popular articles the Journal has published lately offered style advice for men over 40. Apparently, once a man turns 40, picking out clothes starts to resemble juggling nuclear fuel rods.

A firebrand populist who scorned Wall Street, Mrs. Kirchner largely banned the sale of dollars and made Argentina\u2019s currency market one of the most tightly controlled in the world.Under Mrs. Kirchner, Argentines ditched the peso in droves, drained about $24 billion in currency reserves from the central bank and conducted much of their business in a vast underground foreign exchange market. The prospect of her return\u2014even as a legislator\u2014is unnerving investors who worry she and her allies could prevent President       Mauricio Macri,        her market-friendly successor, from continuing to overhaul Argentina\u2019s economy.\u201cCristina represents an extended reign of populism in Argentina. She pushed policies that were clearly not pro market, including defaulting on Argentina\u2019s debt,\u201d said Gabriel Zelpo, an analyst at research firm Elypsis. \u201cIf she does well she could create problems for Macri\u2019s government. Investors don\u2019t want that.\u201dSeveral polls show Mrs. Kirchner leading Mr. Macri\u2019s Senate candidate in Argentina\u2019s largest province, Buenos Aires, where she is running for office. Given the nature of the race, she is virtually guaranteed to win a Senate seat, even if she doesn\u2019t outpoll Mr. Macri\u2019s candidate, Esteban Bullrich.A recent survey by Elypsis gave Mrs. Kirchner about 30% of the vote, slightly ahead of Mr. Bullrich.The poll puts another candidate, Sergio Massa, in a distant third place. Mr. Massa, a former cabinet chief for Mrs. Kirchner, has at times been both an ally and an opponent of Mr. Macri\u2019s efforts to push legislation through Congress.Mrs. Kirchner, who has been indicted in several corruption, money laundering or fraud cases, is deeply unpopular outside the province of Buenos Aires. But she commands loyal support from part of the Peronist political movement founded by Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n in the 1940s.Mrs. Kirchner will perform well in the provincial election but the allegations make her unlikely to win a national election if she runs for president in 2019, analysts say.\u201cCristina just has to win by one vote for her election to be considered a victory,\u201d said Pablo Knopoff, director of Isonomia, another pollster.The race, which is seen as a showdown between Mrs. Kirchner and Mr. Macri, is a leading topic of conversation at dinner tables across Argentina. And many average Argentines are now asking aloud if it is a good time to protect their savings by buying dollars.With a decadeslong history of inflation and currency devaluations, Argentines\u2019 focus on the peso\u2019s value is similar to the way Americans view the price of gasoline. Concern about the peso is already leading some businesses to raise prices out of fear that their own operating costs could go up.\u201cWhenever the peso weakens, prices rise, especially for protein products like those we import from the U.S.,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Lopez, 33 years old, who owns a food and dietary supplements store. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019ll have to raise prices.\u201dMarcos Pe\u00f1a, President Macri\u2019s cabinet chief, said Thursday \u201cthere is no reason to worry\u201d about the peso. He said Mr. Macri\u2019s economic plan is working and that having a floating exchange rate is part of a normal economy.Still, Elypsis is forecasting that Argentina\u2019s inflation rate will likely total 2.2% in July, almost double that of June, and will hit 23% for all of 2017, in part because of a weaker peso. Argentina\u2019s central bank has an inflation target of 17% for 2017.The peso\u2019s slide also follows a June 20 decision by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index not to upgrade Argentina from its so-called frontier market status. The MSCI said it is unclear if Mr. Macri\u2019s policies will last or be reversed.\u201dA weaker peso is welcome news for farmers and others who sell their goods abroad. Argentina\u2019s automotive industry, which ships most of its vehicle exports to Brazil, may now find it easier to increase sales because sticker prices will be lower when measured in dollars.Analysts also say a Kirchner victory in October\u2019s election would not necessarily hurt Mr. Macri\u2019s economic agenda. Mr. Macri\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Change\u201d coalition is expected to gain seats in many rural provinces, potentially increasing his sway in Congress.\u201cIn our view, one of the most important things is that even if Cristina comes in first, the risk of that outlook changing a lot seems a bit exaggerated,\u201d Mr. Zelpo said.Write to Taos Turner at taos.turner@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/argentina-peso-falls-reflecting-concerns-about-potential-cristina-kirchner-comeback-1501189725", "keywords": ["argentina, argentina peso, argentine peso, cristina kirchner, dollar, forex, mauricio macri,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 17:08:00", "news_title": "Wal-Mart de Mexico Net Profit Rises on Higher Sales, Lower Costs ", "content": "MEXICO CITY\u2014Mexico\u2019s biggest retailer,             Wal-Mart de Mexico SA        WMMVY -1.30%      B, said Thursday that its net profit increased 15% in the second quarter as higher sales combined with lower costs and expenses.Walmex, as the unit of Arkansas-based             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Today, it is down to four.This has created a strange dynamic for the group, which can swing wildly when the stock price of one or two of the companies changes.That was on display this week, after             Verizon Communications Inc.       and             AT&T Inc.       reported quarterly earnings. The S&P 500 telecom sector climbed 5.2% Thursday, led by a jump in Verizon, which rose $3.41, or 7.7%, to $47.81. On Wednesday, the group rose 3%, boosted by a rally in AT&T. It was the sector\u2019s biggest two-day move since 2008.The question now awaiting investors is: Will the sector disappear entirely?Telecom\u2019s influence on the broader S&P 500 has waned over the years because of rampant consolidation, leaving it the next obvious choice for a makeover, investors and analysts say. Telecom, which is made up of Verizon, AT&T,             CenturyLink Inc.       and             Level 3 Communications Inc.,       is the smallest of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors.\u201cRight now, when you look at what telecom is doing, it\u2019s usually just one of four stocks moving,\u201d said       Art Hogan,        chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. \u201cIt makes a great deal of sense to look at the sector.\u201dA wave of possible changes to the S&P 500\u2019s classifications could overhaul the group and reshuffle billions of dollars in index-tracking funds that stay aligned with the makeup of the S&P 500. S&P Dow Jones Indices and fellow index provider             MSCI Inc.       said this month that they are considering rolling out a new sector, the communication-services sector, that would fold telecom stocks in with select media, entertainment, consumer-internet and digital-services stocks.Telecom was 2.1% of the S&P 500\u2019s overall market capitalization as of the end of June, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, down from 8.7% in 1990.Over that time, giants like the former SBC Communications bought Ameritech Corp. and AT&T Corp. before rebranding itself as AT&T, while GTE Corp. merged with Bell Atlantic and renamed itself Verizon Communications. More recently, CenturyLink has been preparing to complete its purchase of Level 3 Communications, a move that would further reduce the number of stocks in the telecom sector.Much of the deal activity in the telecom sector reflects the pressures the industry has faced. The sector \u201cis changing as landlines disappear, smartphones become more affordable and internet connections become increasingly important,\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said in a statement explaining their rationale for the proposal. \u201cCompanies in the sector are adapting by diversifying into internet services, cable, media content and other areas by consolidating with other companies.\u201dThe flagging telecom sector could get a boost if the two index providers decide to move some internet-focused companies out of the existing consumer-discretionary and information-technology sectors.Many such stocks have rallied this year as investors bet on fast-expanding firms. Shares of             Facebook Inc.       are up 48% this year, while             eBay Inc.       is up 22% and Google parent             Alphabet Inc.       has risen 20%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 telecom sector has shed 8.3%.Investors, asset managers and analysts have said that the telecom sector is too narrowly defined and that it was due for a review, said       David Blitzer,        head of index policy and governance at S&P Dow Jones Indices. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any exchange-traded funds that exclusively track the telecom sector, Mr. Blitzer said.Instead, funds like Vanguard Telecommunications Services ETF,             iShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF                   and             SPDR S&P Telecom ETF                   track a broader and larger group of stocks, including companies like             U.S. Cellular Corp.       and             Boingo Wireless Inc.       that don\u2019t belong to the telecom sector.Still, there are no guarantees of what companies, if any, will be incorporated into a new communication-services sector. S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI are still weighing whether companies that focus on search engines, social media and mobile messaging, as well as web hosting and web-design services, should be folded into the sector, they said. The two index providers are soliciting feedback on the proposal from members of the investment community until Sept. 29. If they decide to move forward, they would announce the changes by November and roll them out sometime in 2018, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said.Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Telecoms: Market\u2019s Endangered Species Telecom Sector Is at Risk of Extinction.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/telecom-companies-the-markets-endangered-species-1501160400", "keywords": ["s&p 500,s&p 500 telecoms,telcoms,telecom sector,telecom stocks,Boingo Wireless,WIFI,CenturyLink,CTL,eBay,EBAY,Alphabet Inc.

But a closer look at what is driving the rally shows that the eight-year bull market may be nearing its end.The current earnings season makes it clear that investors are paying up for companies that are generating strong growth in earnings and revenues and ignoring or selling stocks where growth is anything less than stellar. In the past, that was a sign that the stock market rally, and the economic expansion, were in their final stages.The quest for growth is epitomized by the stock gains in             Amazon.com,        AMZN -2.78%       Apple, Google parent Alphabet and             Facebook.

That puts a premium on companies that are able to keep generating growth. Indeed, in the latter stages of the both the bull market that ended in 2007 and the one that ended in 2000, growth stocks outperformed.A similar dynamic may be in place now. At this stage in the current earnings season, it looks as if profits at companies in the S&P 500 rose 9.9% in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, down from a gain of 15.3% in the first quarter. And by one measure\u2014domestic after-tax profits as a share of gross domestic product\u2014U.S. profit margins peaked over two years ago.Investors have become ruthless with companies that aren\u2019t growing fast enough. On Thursday, Whirlpool fell 6.3% and             F5 Networks                   fell 7.2% after their growth rates failed to satisfy investors.Even if we are in the last stage of the economic cycle, it is impossible to know how long that stage will last.

AAPL -0.50%       suddenly faces new pressure to build factories in the U.S., something it hasn\u2019t done for years and has shown no signs of wanting to do.Mr. Trump\u2019s       statement that Apple plans to build three big plants in the U.S. has rekindled scrutiny of the company\u2019s policy of outsourcing of almost all of its manufacturing to contractor factories overseas\u2014mainly in China.Mr. Trump had needled the iPhone maker over that issue during the 2016 presidential campaign. He had said little about it publicly since taking office, however, until an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal, in which he said Apple Chief Executive       Tim Cook       had told him the company planned to build the plants in the U.S.The pressure threatened to grow on Apple with the announcement Wednesday by the head of             Foxconn Technology                   Group, Apple\u2019s largest contract manufacturer, that it plans to invest $10 billion in a display-panel factory in Wisconsin. Foxconn made the announcement at a White House ceremony with Mr. Trump. A senior White House official told reporters the plant wasn\u2019t among the three potential Apple facilities to which the president had referred.The White House didn\u2019t respond Thursday to requests for additional comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. Apple has declined to comment.The episode is the latest example of the complex relations between the White House, which is pushing to rebuild U.S. manufacturing, and corporate America, which for years has been adding more jobs overseas. The tension has put companies such as Carrier Corp. and             Ford Motor Co.       in Mr. Trump\u2019s crosshairs, though the White House also has proposed policies welcomed by many companies, including proposed cuts to corporate taxes.Carrier, which faced criticism from Mr. Trump over a plan to shift production to Mexico, said in November it would keep about half the jobs in Indiana that it had planned for Mexico. Ford, which drew Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism over plans to shift compact-car manufacturing to a new plant in Mexico, said in January it would cancel the plant and allocate $700 million in savings to create jobs at a Michigan plant. Last month, it said it would produce compact cars for the U.S. in China.Apple today has only one plant of its own\u2014in Cork, Ireland. Its contract manufacturers operate two small U.S. plants, in Austin, Texas and Fremont, Calif. Those facilities have never grown beyond their narrow role making Apple\u2019s Mac Pro computer, a niche product that sells for $3,000 or more.At least initially, the Austin plant was hampered by worker friction, inexperienced managers and quality-assurance issues, said Alan Hanrahan, a former Apple manufacturing supervisor who was flown to work at the Texas site from Apple\u2019s Irish facility.Supply-chain experts and analysts say the prospect of Apple building one plant in the U.S.\u2014much less three\u2014is highly unlikely. Apple has built a sophisticated supply chain in China because that is where component suppliers are located, and manufacturing workers are abundant there. Shipping iPhone or iPad materials to the U.S. for production would cut into Apple\u2019s profit margins, observers say.\u201cYou don\u2019t go from small facilities for a Mac to three plants,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with the technology firm Creative Strategies.Apple last opened manufacturing facilities for computers in the 1990s with plants in Fountain, Colo. and Elk Grove, Calif. It shut down its last U.S. manufacturing line in 2004, laying off 235 full-time workers in Elk Grove.Mr. Cook, who is as reserved and tight-lipped as the president is freewheeling and outspoken, has sought to engage the administration on manufacturing and other issues. He met privately with Mr. Trump in December and dined in January with administration advisers Ivanka Trump the president\u2019s daughter, and       Jared Kushner,        his son-in-law.Apple announced a $1 billion fund in May to put money into advanced manufacturing in the U.S. It later invested $200 million in a             Corning Inc.       glass-making plant in Harrodsburg, Ky. Apple has said it supports about two million jobs in the U.S., including its own 80,000 U.S. employees and those of suppliers, app developers and entrepreneurs.Asked in a May interview about shifting product assembly\u2014the final stage of production\u2014to the U.S., Mr. Cook indicated it was unlikely.The Texas and California facilities were announced in 2012, when Apple previously faced political pressure over its reliance on overseas manufacturing. Apple then trumpeted a $100 million investment to make Mac Pro its first \u201cAssembled in the USA\u201d products in years. The project, led by contract manufacturers Flex Ltd.\u2019s             Flextronics                   and             Quanta Computer Inc.,       was viewed as a test of American manufacturing\u2019s competitiveness.Almost immediately, Apple ran into challenges at the Flextronics plant in Austin, Mr. Hanrahan said.More than 80% of the workers were contract employees paid minimum wage for eight-hour workdays, Mr. Hanrahan said. When their shift ended or they fulfilled their 36-hour workweek, many walked off the job, he said\u2014even if the line were still running. \u201cYou could walk away to get a cup of coffee and come back and 10 or 20 people could be gone,\u201d Mr. Hanrahan said. \u201cThe line would stop. People would just be standing.\u201dAbout 60% to 70% of the Mac Pro computers coming off the production line initially didn\u2019t meet quality standards and were scrapped, Mr. Hanrahan and another former employee said. He said the percentage of products that could be used eventually improved.After about a year, former line workers said, Flextronics began laying people off. Chamita Griffin, who worked there at the time, said the company laid off 50 quality-assurance technicians and about 500 people on the assembly line.\u201cThey got it to where they didn\u2019t need us anymore,\u201d said Jacob McCombs, who said he earned valuable experience at the Flextronics plant.Flextronics declined to comment. It continues to operate the Austin plant producing Mac Pro computers.Quanta didn\u2019t respond to request for comment on its California operation.Apple hasn\u2019t updated the Mac Pro product line since its introduction but said earlier this year that it is working on a new version of the product.Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Apple Put on Spot Over Factories.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-comments-on-u-s-factoriesmakes-it-awkward-for-apple-1501187622", "keywords": ["apple's irish facilities,apple's offshore manufacturing ,apple contractors,apple strategy,iphone,iphone assembly,iphone factories,three big apple plants,trump and apple,u.s manufacuring,Apple,AAPL,Carrier,Mr. Trump,Tim Cook,Alan Hanrahan,Carolina Milanesi,Donald Trump,plans,strategy,capacity,facilities,contracts,orders,corporate,industrial news,outsourcing,computers,consumer electronics,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 16:37:00", "news_title": "Mnuchin: Volcker Rule, \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Set for Changes", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Trump administration is working with bank regulators to roll back postcrisis rules, Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said Thursday, namely the Volcker rule and the system of determining which financial firms are considered \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201dTestifying before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Mnuchin said he is set to discuss potential regulatory relief moves on Friday at a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of federal financial regulators that he chairs. The meeting is likely to focus on streamlining the Volcker rule barring banks from certain types of trading.\u201cThe biggest problem with the Volcker rule is its complexity and regulatory overlap,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told the House panel. \u201cWe need to make sure that banks understand how the regulation works.\u201dThe Volcker rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, prevents banks from trading for their own account and seeks to make them only facilitate their clients\u2019 trading activities. Bank executives complain that the line separating the two is fuzzy.The Treasury secretary also urged Congress to move quickly in raising the threshold at which banks are labeled as \u201csystemically important financial institutions.\u201d The threshold is currently $50 billion in assets, and raising it would provide some regulatory relief to community and regional banks that argue they didn\u2019t cause the financial crisis and shouldn\u2019t be subject to the increased oversight.There is some bipartisan support in Congress to increase the asset threshold. Mr. Mnuchin said he supports legislation that would raise it to at least $250 billion. He also agreed with Republicans in requiring regulators to take into account a bank\u2019s risk as part of the designation process, not just its size.\u201cThis is something that we could accomplish quickly,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.The Treasury Department is prompting regulators to move swiftly in overhauling some rules after it released a report in June with recommendations on streamlining Obama-era regulations, which Republicans see as too burdensome and restricting economic growth.House Republicans recently passed a bill that would repeal the Volcker rule as part of a package to unwind key parts of Dodd-Frank.Mr. Mnuchin told the lawmakers Thursday that \u201cwe don\u2019t object\u201d to repealing the Volcker rule if Congress approves such a move.

Thirty-one years later, a top U.K. banking regulator said the benchmark would be phased out over the next five years.Libor is calculated by asking banks how much it theoretically would cost them to borrow money from other banks. It wasn\u2019t designed to be anything more than an invisible bit of financial wiring, hidden deep below the surface of the banking system. Nobody expected it to become a foundation of global finance\u2014or a synonym for one of the era\u2019s biggest banking scandals.Libor started out as a symbol of the clubby and arguably incestuous world of London banking in the 1970s and \u201980s. Libor was based on something resembling an honor system.Libor quickly came to symbolize much more: the globalization of finance and the adrenaline-crazed, anarchic environment that overtook the banking system in the years leading up to the financial crash last decade.Banks, driven by a rational desire for ever-growing profits, rushed to create newfangled products that their traders used to place bets on the future direction of interest rates and many other trends\u2014and Libor became a crucial ingredient. The lobbyist group that ran Libor, the British Bankers\u2019 Association, hungered for new revenue sources and concocted dozens of new flavors of its product, across different currencies and time periods.By the late 1990s, the once-obscure benchmark grew to a core component of trillions of dollars of derivatives and other financial contracts.Meanwhile, American banks adopted Libor to determine what borrowers paid on variable-rate mortgages, student loans and, more recently, credit cards. Libor soon was buried in the fine print of countless contracts all over the world.\u2018[For regulators,] the current system is essentially unworkable; there is no way to guarantee the integrity of a benchmark that is based purely on guesswork by banks, especially when those banks have powerful interests in the outcome of their guesswork.\u2019Because most derivatives aren\u2019t traded on public exchanges, it is hard to say exactly how vast Libor\u2019s reach is, but studies have estimated that hundreds of trillions of dollars of financial contracts world-wide are based on the benchmark.That was great news for the BBA, which triumphantly coined the phrase \u201cthe world\u2019s most important number.\u201d That wasn\u2019t much of an exaggeration. The London lobbying group was unregulated, and so was its primary product. A gusher of licensing fees poured into the BBA, which used the funds to push a deregulatory agenda.But Libor was rife with problems. Its method of calculation\u2014the BBA simply asked banks to estimate how much it might cost them to borrow\u2014was inexact at best. And the lack of government supervision proved an invitation for banks to manipulate the number.Banks had huge stakes in the direction of Libor. The profitability of their loan portfolios hinged on the benchmark\u2019s fluctuations. And bank traders, with huge holdings of interest-rate swaps and other derivatives, had billions of dollars riding on tiny swings.It turned out that banks were skilled at getting Libor to move in favorable directions. After all, it was their employees who were guesstimating their borrowing costs, so it was simple enough to skew those figures in helpful directions.Tom Hayes,        a UBS Group AG and             Citigroup Inc.       trader who in 2015 was convicted as the ringleader of a Libor-manipulating crew, once estimated that perhaps 5% of his hundreds of millions of dollars in trading profits stemmed from his ability to get Libor nudged up or down by fractions of a percentage point. And he was hardly alone\u2014dozens of other traders and bank managers were involved in similar manipulative behavior (although Mr. Hayes, sentenced to 11 years in prison, is currently the one of the few behind bars).When the industry\u2019s shenanigans first came to light in 2008, they were greeted by indignant denials from banks, regulators and, most of all, the BBA. But government investigations soon showed not only that manipulation was widespread and easy to pull off, but also that government officials and central bankers had known for years about Libor\u2019s vulnerabilities but failed to act.More than a dozen banks ultimately paid roughly $10 billion in penalties related to their fraudulent Libor activities. Senior executives at banks including             Barclays                   PLC,             Royal Bank of Scotland Group                   PLC and Dutch lender Rabobank Groep NV lost their jobs. The scandal-tarred BBA was recently disbanded.The era of financial anarchy gave way to a period of intense regulation and risk aversion by banks. Libor\u2014a potent symbol of the heady precrisis days\u2014couldn\u2019t survive in that new climate.Central bankers and regulators in the U.S. and U.K. have been reviewing whether it is possible to make Libor safer. Their ultimate conclusion is that the current system is essentially unworkable; there is no way to guarantee the integrity of a benchmark that is based purely on guesswork by banks, especially when those banks have powerful interests in the outcome of their guesswork.\u201cIt is not only potentially unsustainable, but also undesirable, for market participants to rely indefinitely on reference rates [like Libor] that do not have active underlying markets to support them,\u201d       Andrew Bailey,        the head of the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, said in a speech Thursday. He cited Libor\u2019s susceptibility both to manipulation and to malfunctioning in a crisis.The goal now is to find or create comparable benchmarks that are calculated based on actual transactions in the market\u2014in other words, derived from actual, not theoretical, borrowing costs. The new measurements are likely to lean on algorithms, a reflection of the increasingly computerized and robotic nature of the financial system.Five years from now, Libor isn\u2019t likely to exist. Its legacy\u2014distrust in banks and doubts about regulators\u2019 ability to police the industry\u2014is likely to linger.\u2014David Enrich is author of \u201cThe Spider Network: The Wild Story of a Math Genius, a Gang of Backstabbing Bankers, and One of the Greatest Scams in Financial History,\u201d a book about the Libor scandal.

Yields rise when bond prices fall.Treasurys were pressured in part by AT&T, which was poised to sell $22.5 billion of bonds to help fund its pending acquisition of             Time Warner Inc.       That marks the largest U.S. corporate bond deal since January 2016, when             Anheuser-Busch InBev        BUD -0.28%       NV issued $46 billion of bonds to investors, according to Dealogic.Large corporate-debt sales can sometimes make a dent in the Treasurys market as underwriters sell Treasurys to neutralize unwanted swings in interest rates and fund managers look to free up cash to absorb the new bonds.A $28 billion auction of seven-year Treasury notes also weighed on the market Thursday, following sales of two-year and five-year notes earlier in the week.In addition, fresh data showed that sales of durable goods rose in June at the quickest pace in nearly three years, providing a relatively upbeat assessment of the economy a day before investors get their first reading on second-quarter economic growth.AT&T\u2019s offering was \u201ca big deal, but we also got better-than-expected durable goods numbers,\u201d said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. \u201cThat combination is weighing on the market.\u201dThursday\u2019s move added to a choppy run of trading sessions for Treasurys, which sold off to start the week before rallying Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and issued its latest policy statement.Investors and analysts said the statement generally offered few surprises, leaving the door open to another interest-rate increase this year but not committing to one. That boosted the appeal of Treasurys, which generally benefit from looser monetary policy.Months of soft inflation data have helped support bond prices, as lower inflation helps preserve the purchasing power their fixed payments. Tepid inflation has also depressed expectations for future rate-increases from the Fed. Though higher than the historic lows it reached in 2016, the yield on the 10-year note is still well below where it started the year.The strong reception for AT&T\u2019s bond sale suggests that investors don\u2019t anticipate a big rise in Treasury yields, which would hurt the value of high-quality corporate debt, said Scott Kimball, portfolio manager of BMO TCH Core Plus Bond Fund.Current market indicators suggest investors are highly skeptical that inflation will reach the Fed\u2019s 2% target. \u201cIn that case, it\u2019s difficult to envision rates move higher in a way that\u2019s detrimental to investors,\u201d Mr. Kimball said.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasurys-pull-back-on-new-debt-supply-1501164693", "keywords": ["treasury prices,treasury yields,u.s. government bonds,Anheuser-Busch InBev,ABI.BT,BUD,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,food,beverages,tobacco,brewing,alcoholic beverages,drinks,consumer goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 16:24:00", "news_title": "SNL\u2019s Aidy Bryant and Vanessa Bayer Celebrate Their Favorite Jewelry Brand", "content": "WHAT BETTER GIFTS to receive from a romantic interest than jewelry and flowers?

If you haven\u2019t noticed, charcoal is now everywhere.Its popularity may lie in its reported ability to help us detox, a current cultural obsession. \u201cFor most people just hearing that charcoal is detoxifying is enough to get them on board with any product that has it as an ingredient,\u201d said Jessica Richards, owner of Brooklyn beauty shop Shen, which stocks a number of charcoal products.Charcoal isn't a Johnny-come-lately beauty fad. Its applications span centuries and cultures. Hippocrates, the father of natural medicine, used it on patients suffering from epilepsy, anemia or poisoning (it remains an antidote for poisoning in hospitals today); ancient Egyptians and, centuries later, Native Americans relied on it to heal wounds and treat intestinal and digestive issues; and the Japanese have long valued it as part of their dental hygiene routines.Beauty company Origins introduced its first charcoal product in 1990: the Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask. \u201cActive charcoal acts like a magnet, drawing out oil, dirt and other environmental debris from clogged pores,\u201d said Lizz Starr, executive director of global product development at Origins. The Clear Improvement mask, she added, continues to be a top seller to this day, though the company has launched newer charcoal products like the Exfoliating Cleansing Powder (below).Charcoal also plays a role in hair products. \u201cMany scalp issues stem from buildup of product, oil and dirt which clog the follicle,\u201d said Nancy Twine, founder of haircare brand Briogeo. \u201cA detoxified scalp is the foundation to healthy hair.\u201d When developing products like her Scalp Revival tonic, she found charcoal to be useful.Indeed, charcoal seems poised to take over your entire medicine cabinet. It\u2019s also used in deodorant and toothpaste (see below). But the big question, of course, is: Does it really work?       Dr. Frank Lipman,        an expert in integrative medicine, believes it does. \u201cCharcoal literally binds to toxins, and that binding effect makes it a great cleanser, inside and out,\u201d said Dr. Lipman, founder of Eleven Eleven Wellness Center in New York, which offers services ranging from acupuncture to nutritional counseling. He does caution though that activated charcoal supplements, which are taken orally, can interfere with the absorption of nutrients and medication. He recommends no more than 1000mg to counter a heavy meal or excessive drinking\u2014and only occasionally.Other doctors aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cThere is no concrete evidence that charcoal will help the skin look better,\u201d said New York dermatologist Robert Anolik, citing the absence of peer-reviewed scientific studies. He admitted, though, that trying some topical products would probably not be harmful. High-quality companies will use high-quality ingredients, he said.

Private equity will remain the focus for a unit of specialized examiners, and that team\u2019s exams could become more targeted to probe specific concerns, but the SEC probably won\u2019t carpet the industry in the same way as it did starting in 2012.\u201cI think we\u2019ve hit that area pretty hard,\u201d Mr. Driscoll said on the sidelines of an SEC compliance conference in Washington. \u201cGenerally we are going to focus more on retail investors.\u201dSEC Chairman       Jay Clayton,        who took office in May, has said he wants to focus on fraud that targets mom and pop investors. That includes operations such as pump-and-dump schemes\u2014where promoters try to inflate a stock\u2019s price through false or misleading statements, then dump their shares on unsophisticated investors\u2014and boiler rooms\u2014where fraudsters use high-pressure sales tactics to trick people into buying into an investment scam.Speaking Wednesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Clayton said retail fraud \u201cmakes me sick.\u201d\u201cVirtually everyone said I was going to be surprised by the amount of retail fraud that still goes on\u2014and I was,\u201d Mr. Clayton said. \u201cThere is just no room for somebody who ruins somebody else\u2019s life using the capital markets.\u201dThe SEC\u2019s examiners operate a risk-based program, which means they don\u2019t have to inspect firms every year or even every couple of years. Mr. Driscoll said SEC inspectors would respond when they hear complaints or notice red flags about particular private-equity advisers.U.S. workers can be indirect investors in private-equity funds because union and workplace pension plans invest with them, but retail investors don\u2019t directly invest in private equity.Whether the SEC backs away from scrutinizing many private-equity firms may become clearer as Mr. Clayton refines his agenda and new commissioners join the agency and influence its focus.Congress already is giving them signals to back off. The Financial Choice Act, a sweeping deregulatory bill that passed the House in June, would exempt private-equity advisers from routine SEC oversight, although individual firms could choose to remain registered because their clients support it.The SEC examined hundreds of private-equity managers beginning in 2012, after gaining broad authority to supervise the industry through the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law. SEC officials took the unusual step of lambasting the industry for what officials called \u201chidden fees\u201d that harmed investors such as pension funds and university endowments.Blackstone Group                   LP in 2015 agreed to pay about $39 million to settle SEC civil charges over its disclosure of accelerated monitoring fees, large one-time fees it took when selling portfolio companies or taking them public. Blackstone, the world\u2019s largest private-equity firm by assets, has stopped taking accelerated monitoring fees.In another settlement announced earlier in 2015,             KKR                   & Co. agreed to pay almost $30 million to settle charges that it improperly allocated more than $17 million in expenses, hurting some investors while benefiting the firm\u2019s executives and certain clients.Both Blackstone and KKR settled the cases without admitting or denying the claims.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-scrutiny-of-private-equity-may-dwindle-official-says-1501185494", "keywords": ["finreg,pe legal,private equity,sec,Securities and Exchange Commission,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,partnerships,collaborations,public-private partnerships,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 15:51:00", "news_title": "Oil Prices Advance on Momentum From Recent Inventory Declines ", "content": "Oil prices rose to fresh two-month highs Thursday on building momentum from recent inventory declines.Light, sweet crude for September delivery settled up 29 cents, or 0.6%, at $49.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

International demand could simply be from international buyers refilling their storage. And increasing exports are necessary to keep easing a glut in U.S. storage, the Simmons analysts said.Prices could still be locked into a range between $45 and $50 a barrel because higher prices would probably support an oversupply from new drilling in the U.S., the Goldman analysts said. Signs of more inventory declines in other industrialized nations are also likely necessary before it is clear that a glut is gone from storage, which has been at historically high levels, they added.Crude demand by U.S. refiners will likely recede in September and October when seasonal maintenance work begins,             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale                   noted. Meanwhile, long-term Chinese oil demand is expected to lose some steam as the country veers toward green energy and natural gas, said BMI Research.Some selling early Thursday likely came from producers taking advantage of higher prices to sell future production, Scott Shelton, broker at             ICAP                   PLC, said in a note. And, as the other analysts suggested, the market will need new buyers to balance that out.\u201cI am not convinced that these kinds of buyers will show up,\u201d Mr. Shelton added. \u201cI don\u2019t see the next incremental buyer and I see more natural sellers.

The French state already owns 33.3% of STX France.\u201cThe decision has one sole objective: defend France\u2019s strategic interests in ship building,\u201d said French Finance and Economy Minister       Bruno Le Maire.       The move will cost the state around \u20ac80 million ($93.9 million).The nationalization\u2014Mr. Macron\u2019s first major industrial move since coming to power in May\u2014runs counter to his pro-business campaign rhetoric and pledges to foster industry on a European rather than national level.Since his appointment as finance minister, Mr. Le Maire has also shunned heavy-handed state intervention, touting plans to sell shares in large companies to instead finance investment in disruptive innovation.Before becoming president, however, Mr. Macron intervened on a number of corporate deals as economy minister. He scuttled a plan to sell the telecom operations of             Bouygues                   to its competitors and engineered raising the state\u2019s stake in             Renault SA       to 20%, against the wishes of management.Mr. Le Maire said it was necessary to temporarily nationalize the Saint-Nazaire shipyard to keep jobs and skills in France. Saint-Nazaire also has a military interest for the French as it is the only French shipyard capable of building the hull of an aircraft carrier.\u201cWe can\u2019t take the slightest risk with these skills or this know-how,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said.Mr. Le Maire said France could accept a 50-50 split with Rome not Fincantieri taking majority control of STX France. The French finance minister will travel to Italy Tuesday for talks with Fincantieri and the Italian government.The brinkmanship from France\u2019s government sparked consternation in Italy, where the government described the temporary nationalization as \u201cgrave and incomprehensible.\u201d\u201cNationalism and protectionism aren\u2019t acceptable bases on which to govern the relations between two great European countries. To achieve shared projects there is a need for mutual trust and respect,\u201d said Italy\u2019s Economy Minister       Pier Carlo Padoan       and Economic Development Minister       Carlo Calenda       in a joint statement.The Italian ministers said there is no reason why Fincantieri can\u2019t hold a majority stake in STX given the Italian company has committed to protect French interests.A Fincantieri spokesman said the company had no immediate comment on France\u2019s decision.\u201cWe are not less than the Koreans. We can\u2019t accept to be treated worse than them,\u201d said       Giuseppe Bono,        Fincantieri\u2019s chief executive, on Wednesday, commenting on the prospect of being blocked by the French state.Fincantieri was the sole candidate to buy STX Offshore and Shipbuilding\u2019s share in STX France as part of a court-ordered restructuring process of the Korean shipbuilder.Mr. Le Maire said the French government remains committed to promises Mr. Macron made to strengthen Europe during his election campaign. The French president has called for a mechanism to regulate foreign investment in Europe and a \u201cBuy European Act\u201d to limit access to European Union public contracts for non-European companies.Mr. Le Maire said he is hopeful France and Italy can find a shared solution for the shipyard that could one day also lead to greater cooperation on military matters.\u201cWe have absolutely no suspicions about our Italian friends.

Glencore has acknowledged the shift in payments and said it was done at the request of Gecamines.Canada\u2019s Ontario Securities Commission, the country\u2019s biggest regional securities regulator, is investigating whether the Glencore subsidiary,         Katanga Mining,       violated rules requiring that companies disclose business done with their own investors, said the people familiar with the investigation. Katanga is listed in Toronto and Mr. Gertler\u2019s company has invested in its business.Glencore and Gecamines declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Gertler\u2019s company said it disputes any allegations of bribery and follows all disclosure obligations.A spokeswoman for the Ontario Securities Commission said the agency had a policy against commenting on the \u201cexistence, nature or status of any investigation.\u201d Investigations by securities agencies don\u2019t necessarily result in regulatory action.The payments began in 2013, according to Global Witness, a nonprofit investigative group that works to publicize allegations of resources-industry corruption and brought the payments to light.Both Gecamines and Mr. Gertler\u2019s company, Fleurette Group, have for years been large investors in Katanga Mining\u2019s business, according to Canadian public records. That could make them so-called related parties to Katanga, meaning that each has a significant stake in the company and therefore potentially subject to disclosure requirements under Canada\u2019s law, said experts on Canadian securities regulations.Katanga had disclosed in regulatory filings payments to Gecamines, which it described as a related party, until 2014. Starting that year, Katanga disclosed no further payments to Gecamines nor the payments to Mr. Gertler\u2019s company, according to a review of its filings by The Wall Street Journal.Under a deal with the Congolese government, Gecamines is allocated a slice of annual sales from Katanga Mining subsidiary Kamoto Copper Co., known as KCC. But rather than send the royalties to Gecamines, KCC has been sending them to Mr. Gertler\u2019s Cayman Islands-based company, Africa Horizons Investment Ltd., Glencore and Fleurette have said.Glencore and Fleurette have said Gecamines wanted the money shifted to Mr. Gertler\u2019s company to pay back a $196 million loan Fleurette made to Gecamines in 2013. The payments are ongoing, they said.Glencore is the world\u2019s third-largest copper producer behind Chile\u2019s state-owned copper mining company, Codelco, and             Freeport-McMoRan Inc.,       according to CRU Group, a commodity research firm. Katanga ranks among Glencore\u2019s largest copper operations, though work there has been suspended for the past 18 months as the company undertakes a $1 billion upgrade.The probe represents a new risk posed by Glencore\u2019s longtime relationship with Mr. Gertler, from whom the company has sought to distance itself in recent months.Mr. Gertler was a central figure in a $412 million settlement in September between the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission with New York hedge fund             Och-Ziff Capital Management Group                   LLC. The Justice Department alleged in a criminal case that Och-Ziff, in pursuit of investment profit, went into business with Mr. Gertler despite a consultant\u2019s warnings that he used political connections in Congo to benefit himself and his associates.The Justice Department said Mr. Gertler paid more than $100 million in bribes to Congolese officials, including President       Joseph Kabila,        in exchange for access to some of the nation\u2019s best mineral assets. Mr. Gertler hasn\u2019t been charged.\u201cWe dispute any allegation of bribery\u201d in Congo, a Fleurette spokesman said.Congolese government officials haven\u2019t responded to requests for comment about the allegations.Daniel Och,        chairman and chief executive of Och-Ziff, has said the firm\u2019s conduct scrutinized by the Justice Department was \u201cinconsistent with our core values.\u201dIn response to the Justice Department findings, a Glencore spokesman said that the firm \u201ctakes ethics and compliance very seriously and is considering this information.\u201dGlencore and Mr. Gertler joined forces in Congo in 2007 when Glencore invested in a Congo-focused mining company called Nikanor PLC, partly owned by the Israeli businessman. Nikanor merged with Katanga a year later, forming one of Congo\u2019s largest copper-mining operations.Glencore in February purchased Mr. Gertler\u2019s stake in Katanga Mining, as well as his stake in another jointly run Congo copper mine, Mutanda Mining, for nearly $1 billion, a move analysts said helped distance the company from Mr. Gertler.The buyout, as well as rising copper and cobalt prices, have turbocharged Katanga Mining\u2019s stock, which has surged nearly 500% in the past 12 months, according to FactSet.Write to Scott Patterson at scott.patterson@wsj.com and Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Glencore Payments Face Canada Probe.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/glencore-under-probe-over-congo-payments-1501184279", "keywords": ["Gecamines,Glencore,GLEN.LN,GLEN.U.K.,Katanga Mining,KAT.T,CA:KAT,Ontario Securities Commission,Freeport-McMoRan,FCX,Och-Ziff Capital Management Group,OZM,Fleurette Group,Daniel Och,Dan Gertler,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,metal ore mining,copper ore,nickel ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 15:34:00", "news_title": "Treasury to Sell $72 Billion of Debt", "content": "The U.S. Treasury Department will auction $72 billion in securities next week.

The reason? Not enough workers.The new 224-bed women\u2019s facility in Concord will be completed in mid-October, but the department needs to staff up first, according to       Jeff Lyons,        spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.\u201cWe can\u2019t open until we can find enough qualified people to fill those positions,\u201d he said. The prison may not be able to open until some point next year, he said.The corrections department faces multiple staffing challenges, Mr. Lyons said: State lawmakers have said the prison can add up to 74 new positions, but have funded only 55 of those jobs. The corrections department also had to wait until July 1, when the positions were authorized in the department budget, to start recruiting, he said.The state\u2019s low unemployment rate of just 2.9% has made it even more difficult to hire prison workers. Excluding positions for the new prison, New Hampshire\u2019s corrections department had funding to hire 468 corrections officers statewide, yet has struggled to keep 400 at any given time, Mr. Lyons said.The staffing challenge at prisons \u201cis universal around the country,\u201d said       Josh Tewalt,        director of operations at the Association of State Correctional Administrators, a Nampa, Idaho, organization representing corrections leaders nationwide. The jobs are often low-paying and stressful, and officials in other states have linked the acute staffing shortages to violence against corrections officers.Some states have responded by boosting salaries and bonuses to try to retain and attract staff. In New Hampshire, the corrections department recently lowered the minimum age to 19 from 20, Mr. Lyons said. The department has also tried to relax physical-fitness standards.The new prison was commissioned following long-running complaints and lawsuits that women prisoners don\u2019t have access to the same programs and services as men. The state\u2019s older women\u2019s prison has less than half as many beds as the new prison, is overfilled, and only has a third as much space.A lawsuit from 2012, filed by New Hampshire Legal Assistance on behalf of four female inmates, was put on hold a year later after the legislature funded the new women\u2019s facility.Elliott Berry,        managing attorney in the NHLA\u2019s Manchester, N.H., office, said the group may bring the case forward if staffing problems aren\u2019t resolved. He is concerned that lawmakers haven\u2019t authorized enough workers to adequately staff the facility, even if they are able to fill the open jobs, which will mean shortchanging programming and services for women.\u201cThis was never about having a nice, state-of-the-art prison,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about what\u2019s going on inside. That requires adequate staffing.\u201dMr. Lyons said the corrections department is still evaluating how to best deploy the officers the state has funded. This may require opening the new prison gradually or sharing services with a men\u2019s prison next door.\u201cWe continue to make every effort to provide the women with programming and treatment equivalent to what the men receive using the resources we have been provided,\u201d he said.Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-hampshire-may-delay-opening-48-million-prison-over-staffing-challenges-1501184036", "keywords": ["new hampshire prison,nh prison,political,general news,national,public security,law enforcement,prisons,prisoners"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 15:32:00", "news_title": "Say Anything ", "content": "Imagine an industry in which the competing firms have spent several years dramatically raising prices while simultaneously reducing the availability of services in markets nationwide, leaving customers with fewer options and higher costs. You might expect progressive leftists to be among the first to demand congressional hearings on this anti-competitive disaster for consumers. But in the any-tool-in-the-shed scramble to maintain Washington\u2019s control over health care, the left is now celebrating this outcome as a welcome sign that insurance markets may be stabilizing.The Beltway crowd has been gleefully sharing the results of a recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which states:So Kaiser claims that the insurance industry has managed, despite all the burdens and distortions of ObamaCare, to push the heavy new costs on to customers and taxpayers while reducing service offerings. Is this the \u201cbetter deal\u201d Democrats have been promising? The party\u2019s elected officials have used reports like Kaiser\u2019s to argue that Republican claims of an ObamaCare \u201cdeath spiral\u201d are overstated.Such is the absurd devotion to maintaining the ObamaCare status quo that we now have the spectacle of progressive heroine Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) taking to Twitter to defend the insurance industry against the potential predations of Republican reformers. Yesterday the Bay State\u2019s favorite radical leftist warned that a proposed Republican plan to end the law\u2019s mandates \u201cguts the marketplace \u2013 premiums will skyrocket. Insurers will quit.\u201d The good news is that Sen. Warren has finally found a marketplace that she doesn\u2019t want to gut\u2014at least while she\u2019s helping to mount the goal-line stand against any GOP reform.It\u2019s true that if lawmakers keep all of ObamaCare\u2019s costly regulations in place but no longer force people to buy expensive products they don\u2019t want, it will increase the already substantial pressure Washington has applied to insurers. That\u2019s one reason Republicans hope to give states flexibility to allow less expensive insurance plans that consumers do want to buy\u2014which Sen. Warren and her colleagues also oppose.Kaiser\u2019s report is thought to be politically useful because it allows Democrats to sell a fantasy that after a rocky start, ObamaCare is working. But even if the report is accurate, this is a success story only if one defines \u201cworking\u201d as the ability of large insurance companies to navigate the complicated and costly new world of U.S. health law.As this column has noted previously, Democrats are proving extremely resourceful during this debate in persuading the media and even some Republican senators to accept performance measurements for health policy that have nothing to do with patient care, consumer choice or fiscal sanity.A large number of people enrolled in federal insurance plans is not a mark of success if insured patients cannot find doctors willing to treat them. The financial position of a regulated private insurer is certainly important, but rising earnings at the firm do not automatically mean that a policy holder can get the coverage she needs at a price she can afford.Let Sen. Warren and the Democrats worry about insurance companies and the bureaucrats who oversee them. Republicans need to enact reform for the consumers and taxpayers who see a system of diminishing choices and rising costs that is anything but stable.***This column is very sad to pass along the news that our wonderful Best of the Web contributor Jacqueline Tillman Harty has lost her beloved husband.

It is based on data reported daily by banks. Other interest rate indexes, like the Euribor (euro interbank offered rate) and the Tibor (Tokyo interbank offered rate), function in a similar way.Why it\u2019s important: Hundreds of trillions of dollars of securities and loans are linked to the Libor, including auto and home loans, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Even small movements\u2014or inaccuracies\u2014in the Libor affect investment returns and borrowing costs, for individuals, companies and professional investors.Libor is calculated every working day by polling major banks on their estimated borrowing costs. Its integrity was called into question following a rate-rigging scandal where traders at numerous banks were able to nudge it up or down by submitting false data. Banks were fined billions of dollars and several traders were sent to prison.Over the past five years, regulators have tried to find ways to tie Libor submissions to actual trades, as opposed to estimates. But in several cases that proved impossible because interbank lending has hugely diminished, Mr. Bailey said.The push to ditch Libor creates a headache for authorities who have to drum up alternative benchmarks and banks that face having to rewrite trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of contacts. In financial markets, Libor is ubiquitous, used to price financial products ranging from mortgages to complex derivatives. Industry bodies have yet to agree on fallback rates that can be inserted into existing contracts if Libor suddenly ceases to exist.Libor, created in the early 1980s, was previously overseen by a British banking lobby group. During the financial crisis, lenders\u2019 submissions in the rate-setting process were closely watched as a gauge of their health. The less a bank said other lenders charged it to borrow, the safer the institution was deemed to be. The problem: Bank lending largely froze up, so the Libor rate was based on guesses and in some cases on deliberately skewed data.Following the rate-rigging scandal, the bank lobby was stripped of its control of the benchmark. In 2014, the ICE Benchmark Administration, a subsidiary of             Intercontinental Exchange Inc.,       became the new administrator of Libor. The IBA implemented a series of changes\u2014including putting in a surveillance team that evaluates the data coming out of the banks\u2014to ensure that the lenders\u2019 submissions are more accurate.But interbank lending has dried up. In one case, banks setting the Libor rate for one version of the benchmark executed just 15 transactions in that currency and duration for the whole of 2016, Mr. Bailey said. The U.K. regulator has the power to compel banks to submit data to calculate the benchmark. \u201cBut we do not think it right to ask, or to require, that panel banks continue to submit expert judgments indefinitely,\u201d he said, adding that many banks felt \u201cdiscomfort\u201d at the current set up. The FCA recently launched an exercise to gather data from 49 banks to see which institutions are most active in the interbank lending market.Mr. Bailey didn\u2019t set out exactly what a potential replacement for Libor might look like, but a group within the Bank of England is already working on potential replacements.However, any shift will have to be phased in slowly.Some \u00a330 trillion ($39.4 trillion) of over-the-counter derivatives reference the rate, while dollar Libor contracts run to the hundreds of trillions, according to the central bank. After 2021, IBA could choose to keep Libor running, but the U.K. regulator would no longer compel banks to submit data for the benchmark. The IBA said in a statement that Libor \u201chas a long-term sustainable future.\u201d\u200bRegulators have already been working with banks for several years to find alternatives to Libor.Last month, the U.S.\u2019s Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which is made up of a group of big banks and sponsored by the Federal Reserve, voted to use a benchmark based on short-term loans known as repurchase agreements or \u201crepo\u201d trades, backed by Treasury securities, to replace U.S. dollar Libor. The new rate is expected to be phased in starting next year, and transition will be voluntary.\u201cIt is now clear that market participants can no longer avoid facing up to Libor\u2019s structural challenges,\u201d said Fed governor       Jerome Powell       in statement Thursday. \u201cThe FCA\u2019s action today gives market participants the time they need to transition from Libor to a more durable reference rate in a careful and considered way.\u201dIn the U.K., one potential replacement is the Sterling Overnight Index Average, which is calculated using banks\u2019 overnight funding rates in the sterling unsecured market. This rate is currently being reformed by the Bank of England. The euro\u2019s overnight interbank lending rate, Eonia, could also be a possible Libor replacement, said the FCA\u2019s Mr. Bailey. Both these rates are administered by central banks.A major unknown is how existing contacts written using Libor will be amended and what rate will replace the current benchmark. The Financial Stability Board, a global standards setter, is currently working with groups including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association to define a fallback rate to use if Libor suddenly disappears. Regulators could then have to enforce rules that push financial groups to simultaneously amend vast numbers of contracts.\u2014Katy Burne contributed to this article.Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-calls-time-on-scandal-hit-libor-1501148216", "keywords": ["andrew bailey,bank of england,financial conduct authority,libor,libor scandal,rate rigging scandal,Financial Conduct Authority,Andrew Bailey,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,interbank rate,london interbank offered rate,money,currency markets,money markets,commodity,financial market news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 15:30:00", "news_title": "In July, Pitchers Have Barely Been Able to Get Jose Altuve Out", "content": "For much of the first half of 2017, the best player in baseball was Yankees rookie outfielder Aaron Judge, a 6-foot-7 behemoth who might actually be a real-life Terminator in disguise.

He leads the majors with a .365 batting average, putting him in position to win his third AL batting crown. His 1.005 on-base-plus-slugging percentage ranks second in the AL only to Judge, and he is on track to lead the AL in hits for the fourth straight season.If Altuve\u2019s incredible numbers come as a surprise, don\u2019t feel bad: He\u2019s done all of this in the past four weeks. Or, at least, it feels that way.With four more games remaining in July, Altuve is having one of the greatest offensive months in history. He\u2019s batting .494, including .513 during his current 18-game hitting streak. It\u2019s not all singles, either: He has four home runs and nine doubles in July, posting an OPS of 1.285 over that span.Since 1913, there have only been seven instances of a player going through a calendar month with at least 100 plate appearances and a .500 batting average. Six of those times took place between 1913 and 1927, featuring names like Shoeless Joe Jackson, Rogers Hornsby and Ty Cobb. The only player to do this since the Hoover administration was former Rockies first baseman Todd Helton, who hit .512 in May 2000.Altuve could join that exclusive club with a few more good games.

The legislation also would prevent the president from easing sanctions without congressional approval.President       Donald Trump,        who has spoken out against that portion of the bill, has expressed skepticism over the allegations of Russia\u2019s interference in last year\u2019s vote.Moscow couldn\u2019t easily respond economically to the sanctions because of the relatively low volume of trade between the two countries, but Russia\u2019s pro-Kremlin press has speculated U.S. diplomats might be expelled.\u201cWhen the response comes, what it will be, that will depend on what the final version of the law, which is being debated in the Senate, will look like,\u201d Mr. Putin said, Russian news agencies reported.Russian officials had initially hoped for better relations with the U.S. under a Trump presidency, and Russia had been measured in its responses to Washington\u2019s steps to punish Moscow.\u00a0When President       Barack Obama       expelled 35 diplomats in the wake of accusations that Russia had interfered in the presidential vote, Mr. Putin defied expectations and invited U.S. diplomats\u2019 children to Kremlin holiday festivities.But Mr. Putin\u2019s sharper rhetoric Thursday showed Moscow\u2019s rising frustration with the Trump administration. Investigations into alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia have tied the U.S. president\u2019s hands in terms of trying to change policy with Moscow, Russian officials say.Mr. Putin\u2019s statement Thursday also broke from the Kremlin\u2019s more dismissive statements about the effect of sanctions enacted after the Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Those sanctions, together with the fall in the oil price in late 2014, plunged Russia\u2019s economy into a recession.New sanctions could cloud Russia\u2019s economic outlook just as the economy is showing growth potential for the first time in three years. New measures on Russian pipeline projects could be most damaging, analysts say.\u201cWe see substantial scope for Russia\u2019s risk profile to deteriorate further in the coming quarters,\u201d said\u00a0London-based economic and industry analysis group\u00a0BMI Research in a note, adding the sanctions could affect big export pipeline projects such as Russia\u2019s NordStream 2.Write to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/putin-condemns-u-s-impudence-as-congress-pushes-new-sanctions-1501183550", "keywords": [" impudence, putin, russian sanctions,russia sanctions, u.s.-russia relations,Vladimir Putin,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 15:19:00", "news_title": "Halliburton to Settle SEC Allegations Over Angola Payments", "content": "Halliburton Co.

TM 0.51%       believes it has mastered the technology and production process for a new lithium-ion battery that could slash charging time and double the range of electric vehicles, according to U.S. patent filings and one of the inventors.On Tuesday, Toyota said that by the early 2020s it planned to sell cars equipped with solid-state batteries, which replace the damp electrolyte used to transport lithium ions inside today\u2019s batteries with a solid glass-like plate.Behind Toyota\u2019s brief statement lay years of research aimed at solving issues that have long bedeviled batteries for electric cars. Current lithium-ion batteries can\u2019t be packed too tightly together because of fire risk. That is one reason electric cars tend to have limited range compared with traditional gasoline-powered cars.With the solid-state battery, \u201cyou can improve the output and reduce the charge time\u2014hopefully,\u201d said       Ryoji Kanno,        a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Prof. Kanno led a team including Toyota scientists that discovered the materials for the glass-like electrolyte.Advances in battery technology have a tendency to come later than initial expectations, and Prof. Kanno cautioned that his version of a solid-state battery has been shown effective only on a small scale and in a laboratory setting. Figuring out how to produce more powerful versions of the battery\u2014in large quantities and at reasonable cost\u2014is Toyota\u2019s job, he said.History suggests those are all high hurdles. Prof. Kanno said the original rechargeable lithium-ion battery was born in the laboratory in 1980, but manufacturing didn\u2019t start until the early 1990s. Based on that precedent, he said his battery might be a decade away, \u201cbut then, everything moves faster now, so I don\u2019t know.\u201dToyota seems to have a fair idea of how it might work. A spokeswoman said that among emerging battery technologies, solid-state batteries are the closest to practical application in vehicles.In a series of patent\u00a0filings, the car maker outlines how it would produce the battery and describes safety features. One U.S. patent application filed in January states that Toyota overcame a tendency for the batteries to crack during the manufacturing process. Toyota believes it can \u201ceasily manufacture a high-performance all-solid-state battery,\u201d according to the patent application.These batteries can store nearly twice the energy compared with batteries with a liquid electrolyte, said Prof. Kanno, in part because they are less flammable by design and can be packed with more energy in the same space.Toyota also aims to cut charge times because the solid electrolyte can safely handle higher currents.Solid electrolytes also aren\u2019t as sensitive to temperature as liquids. Today\u2019s electric cars suffer from shortened range in cold and hot weather. Researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory found that electric vehicles had their range cut by a fourth during winters in Chicago.Eliminating most of the safety features in today\u2019s batteries makes solid-state batteries much less expensive, according to a U.S. patent granted in February for a Toyota-designed solid-state battery.Still, it is one thing to claim advances in a patent, and another to put an affordable car in showrooms using those advances.In addition to its own technology challenges, Toyota faces competitors in developing solid-state lithium-ion batteries.Among them is a design from       John Goodenough       of the University of Texas at Austin. He is one of the scientists credited with developing the rechargeable lithium-ion battery in 1979.In an interview, Prof. Goodenough said he believed Toyota\u2019s goal of selling vehicles with these batteries by the early 2020s was well within reach. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t do this by 2020,\u201d he said.Prof. Goodenough said more companies should be jumping on solid-state batteries, including his version, but he said he hadn\u2019t been able to license his technology yet. Companies are \u201cused to having a product to validate, and I don\u2019t have a product. I have intellectual property,\u201d he said.Write to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Toyota: Battery Can Make Electric Cars Go Farther.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyotas-cure-for-electric-vehicle-range-anxiety-a-better-battery-1501157272", "keywords": ["battery tech, electric cars, electric vehicles,lithium ion battery,ryoji kanno,solid state battery,toyota,toyota patent,Toyota Motor,7203.TO,Tokyo Institute of Technology,JP:7203,John Goodenough,Ryoji Kanno,patents,corporate,industrial news,intellectual property rights,industrial property rights,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,batteries,motor vehicles,passenger cars,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 15:14:00", "news_title": "Famed Sports Gambler Billy Walters Sentenced to Five Years for Insider Trading", "content": "William \u201cBilly\u201d Walters, who rose from an impoverished childhood in Kentucky to become one of the most famous sports bettors in America, was sentenced Thursday to five years in prison for masterminding a long-running insider trading scheme.U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel handed down the punishment in a packed Manhattan courtroom, almost four months after a federal jury found Mr. Walters, 71 years old, guilty of trading on inside tips from the former chairman of             Dean Foods Co.        DF 0.37%Prosecutors say the insider-trading scheme, which lasted for at least six years, benefited Mr. Walters by more than $43 million in trading profits and avoided losses.\u201cWhen it comes to the stock market, Billy Walters is a cheater and a criminal and not a very clever one,\u201d the judge said.Judge Castel said a significant prison sentence was necessary as a deterrent to others. He pointed to the large portion of middle-class Americans who own stocks, saying crimes like insider trading undermine confidence in the economy.Mr. Walters began trading on Dean Foods tips in his 60s, at a time when he already owned a private plane and a $17 million home, Judge Castel said.Mr. Walters was \u201cfixated on appearing to himself and to others to be a winner,\u201d the judge said. \u201cMoney was a way of keeping score.\u201dThe judge also imposed a fine of $10 million.Lawyers for Mr. Walters had asked for a sentence of approximately one year, pointing to his advanced age and charity work in the local community.One hundred people submitted letters to the judge on Mr. Walters\u2019s behalf, including a handful of luminaries from Las Vegas, where Mr. Walters lived and plied his trade as a professional gambler. Former Senate Majority Leader       Harry Reid,        former professional tennis player Andre Agassi and Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman testified to Mr. Walters\u2019s generous contributions to charity and support for people with disabilities.Barry Berke, a lawyer for Mr. Walters, and Mr. Walters each declined to comment on the sentencing. Mr. Berke told the judge that he intends to appeal.Mr. Walters, wearing a pinstripe suit and blue tie, showed no reaction as the judge read the sentence.The government wanted a sentence between eight and 10 years, asking the judge in a court filing to \u201csquarely reject the toxic notion that wealthy criminals can write a check in exchange for avoiding meaningful jail time.\u201dBrooke Cucinella, an assistant U.S. attorney, said Thursday that Mr. Walters personally made more from ill-gotten gains than almost any other insider trader charged in Manhattan.The case wasn\u2019t the most profitable insider-trading scheme ever charged, but \u201cits scale as an insider-trading crime of individual gain is almost unprecedented,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Mr. Walters personally pocketed more than $33 million, the government alleged in a court filing last week.After a three-week trial, Mr. Walters was found guilty in April of 10 criminal charges, including securities fraud and wire fraud. The trial focused on his relationship with former Dean Foods Co. chairman Thomas Davis, who passed lucrative tips onto Mr. Walters in exchange for friendship and almost $1 million in personal loans.Mr. Davis pleaded guilty last year and became the government\u2019s key cooperating witness against Mr. Walters at trial.Prosecutors say Mr. Walters regularly traded on inside tips ahead of public announcements. To avoid detection, he used a burner phone and instructed Mr. Davis to use code words, such as \u201cDallas Cowboys\u201d to refer to Dean Foods.Mr. Walters allegedly passed one of the tips to famed golfer Phil Mickelson, who wasn\u2019t charged with any wrongdoing but agreed to pay the government $1 million, which includes the profits the government says he made from the tip.Mr. Walters\u2019s positions in Dean Foods sometimes amounted to more than 30% of the trading volume in Dean Foods in a single day, \u201ca number that...is almost unheard of for an individual,\u201d prosecutors said.Dean Foods has asked for restitution from Mr. Walters. The judge will determine the dollar amount at a later time.Born in Munfordville, Ky., Mr. Walters was abandoned by his mother at a young age and lived in his grandmother\u2019s home with no running water. He first started gambling when he was six years old, when his grandmother took him to his uncle\u2019s pool hall. At age 7, he obtained a $40 loan to buy a lawn mower and start his first business.His grandmother died when he was 13, forcing him to move in with his mother, who charged him $10 a week in rent to live in her basement. He became the first in his family to graduate high school.In the early years of marriage to his third wife, Mr. Walters decided to become a full-time sports gambler. In 1982, with $200,000 in debt, he and his wife sold their car and moved to Las Vegas. He eventually became one of the most successful sports bettors in the country.Federal and state authorities have indicted Mr. Walters four other times, related to his gambling, but he had never been convicted.Write to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/famed-sports-gambler-billy-walters-sentenced-to-five-years-for-insider-trading-1501182889", "keywords": ["billy walters,insider trading,phil mickelson,sports gambler,stock tip,Dean Foods,DF,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,insider dealing,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,securities fraud,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,food,beverages,tobacco,dairy products,consumer goods,food products"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 15:12:00", "news_title": "Germany Recalls Porsche Models It Says Have Defeat Devices", "content": "Germany on Thursday ordered Porsche to recall and stop selling 22,000 diesel vehicles that the government says have illegal defeat devices.Transport Minister       Alexander Dobrindt       said a probe by the German Federal Motor Transport Authority found the defeat devices, software that allows vehicles to dupe tests measuring emissions, in three-liter Porsche Cayenne TDI models in Europe, with 7,500 of those in Germany. The total recall, which includes vehicles already sold and some that haven\u2019t yet been delivered to customers, is equivalent to about 9% of the more than 235,000 vehicles Porsche sold world-wide last year.Mr. Dobrindt said the same defeat device was probably also used on the Volkswagen Touareg, though that hasn\u2019t yet been confirmed.       Matthias Mueller,        chief executive of         Volkswagen AG      , which owns Porsche parent             Audi AG        NSU -0.29%      , agreed to fully cooperate with the authorities, the minister said.The new recall is yet another blow to Volkswagen, which has been unable to put the diesel scandal in the rearview mirror despite multiple settlements and internal investigations since 2015 when it first admitted to using defeat devices. It also follows on the heels of a recently revealed investigation into whether Volkswagen colluded with other German manufacturers including BMW AG to manipulated diesel engines.Volkswagen Chief Financial Officer       Frank Witter       declined to comment on the Porsche recall when asked about it on a conference call Thursday with analysts.Porsche said in a statement that an internal probe found irregularities in the software that controls the engine and alerted the transport authority.

The decision upheld a bankruptcy court\u2019s 2015 ruling and concludes nearly a decade of legal wrangling in Mr. Hoffman\u2019s quest to collect from the remnants of Lehman.Barclays had agreed to pay Mr. Hoffman $83 million and to copy other key terms of his employment contract with Lehman. Since 2009, Mr. Hoffman has argued the money he received from Barclays was entirely for his success after Lehman closed, and Lehman retained its own separate obligation to pay him.Mr. Hoffman never denied the payment from Barclays but argued it was purely a special bonus to lure a star who would go on to produce $1.25 billion in profit for his new employer.In a deposition, a Barclays managing director recalled thinking Mr. Hoffman was a \u201csneaky bastard\u201d for seeking compensation from the Lehman estate but later conceded that Barclays elected to make its payments and \u201cwe were under no obligation that I know to do that.\u201dThursday\u2019s decision also granted Hoffman a $7.7 million claim surrounding an unpaid portion of his bonus from 2007. But the appeals court mostly sided with Lehman\u2019s liquidation trustee, who said he was pleased \u201cthe most significant portion of this attempted double recovery has been denied.\u201dThe trustee, James Giddens, said the ruling was \u201cconsistent with the law and supports fairness to all customers and creditors.\u201dDouglas Baumstein, an attorney for Mr. Hoffman, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not everything we were looking for, but it\u2019s certainly a partial vindication.\u201dMr. Hoffman\u2019s $7.7 million allowed claim will now be paid, but only in part. He will be paid on an equal basis with other Lehman unsecured creditors, who have received 39 cents on the dollar, or approximately $9 billion, so far. More than $115 billion overall has been returned by the bankruptcy estate, including full repayment for customers, secured creditors and administrative expenses.The brokerage is being wound down separately from its parent, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Mr. Giddens is leading the proceedings, which are governed by the Securities Investor Protection Act rather than U.S. bankruptcy law.The Second Circuit ruling boosts the amount available for other unsecured creditors because the trustee can now release $75.3 million that had been set aside in case Mr. Hoffman prevailed in full. The trustee maintained Mr. Hoffman shouldn\u2019t be paid twice for the same bonus since both he and Barclays understood the payments would be Barclays\u2019s responsibility.Of more than 15,000 general creditor claims, Mr. Giddens has resolved all but approximately 400.Mr. Hoffman took a job at Lehman in 1994 after deferring a bid to get his M.B.A. at Penn\u2019s Wharton School. At Lehman he became a star, specializing in government bonds in its Miami office. Mr. Hoffman made nearly $550 million in profits for Lehman during 2008, and his trading represented 10% of the bank\u2019s total profit in 2007. He received $100 million in compensation for his trading at Barclays from 2008 to 2010, in addition to the $83 million he received on account of his Lehman bonus.\u2014       Patrick Fitzgerald       contributed to this article.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lehman-double-dip-trader-denied-bulk-of-83-million-bonus-1501182507", "keywords": [" bankruptcy, bankruptcy court, bankruptcynews, barclays,broker, chapter 11, creditors, jonathan hoffman,lawsuit, lehman,lehman brothers, liquidation,Lehman Brothers,Barclays,BCS,Jonathan Hoffman,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,ownership changes,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,divestments,liquidation,banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 14:53:00", "news_title": "U.K. Government Lines Up, to a Point, on Brexit Transition ", "content": "It took a while, but British government ministers finally got their messages aligned over the past week over an issue many businesses regard as vital. Finally speaking with one voice, they said Britain would seek a multiyear transitional agreement with the European Union to reduce the economic uncertainty around Brexit.From either side of the Brexit divide inside Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       government, ministers publicly backed an intermediate period post-Brexit before the U.K. fully separates from the EU. That would\u00a0help firms adjust to leaving the bloc\u2019s regime of zero tariffs and common regulation, and provide time for customs and other parts of the\u00a0bureaucracy to cope.They found common cause partly in recognition that it would be impossible, in the 20 months left before Brexit, to negotiate a wide-ranging permanent trade and economic agreement with the EU and have it ratified by the more than 30 national and regional parliaments that must do so.In fact there was unity only up to a point. On Thursday, immigration minister       Brandon Lewis       suggested the matter wasn\u2019t yet settled when he told the British Broadcasting Corp. that \u201cFree movement of labor ends when we leave the European Union in the spring of 2019.\u201dIf Mr. Lewis is really ruling out free movement of labor from the EU on Brexit day, he is also probably ruling out the most likely and practical transition deal with the EU, one that would keep the U.K. temporarily inside the bloc\u2019s single market and its customs union.The EU insists that free movement of goods, services, capital and labor come as a package. If you want to stay in the EU\u2019s single market and enjoy free movement of services, goods and capital, as many businesses are demanding in the transition, then labor comes as part of the deal.True, that EU proposition could be tested in the negotiations. But it would be tough for London to persuade the bloc to make concessions to a nonmember of the EU, which the U.K. will become on Brexit day, that it wouldn\u2019t concede to a member of the club.The U.K. could try to negotiate a bespoke interim arrangement, sector by sector, issue by issue. But the Confederation of British Industry, which lobbies for British business and says a transitional deal keeping the U.K. in the single market and customs union is an urgent priority, has joined other observers in reaching a firm conclusion on that prospect: \u201cIt is hard to see how this could be negotiated in time and it may not provide a sufficient legal basis for business continuity in many sectors.\u201dUnlike a wide-ranging permanent arrangement that would require time-consuming ratification, legal experts think a time-limited transitional deal could be appended to the divorce agreement. That would require only the consent of a qualified majority of the 27 remaining EU national governments and a simple majority of the European Parliament.The real problem with a transitional arrangement has lain with Britain\u2019s most eager EU-leavers, many of whom are in the governing Conservative Party. For them, staying in the customs union and single market would extend the agony of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice that polices the single market, and mean Britain would have to keep making accommodations for EU workers.It would also mean continued U.K. contributions into the EU budget\u2014a prospect Brexiteers hate but that provides a big incentive for the EU to accept a transition. Such a deal would keep a large net payer in the fold for a while longer and postpone a big impending fight between net contributors and recipients of EU funds over the bloc\u2019s shrinking spending pot.It would also take some of the steam out of the argument over the British \u201cdivorce bill\u201d\u2014the financial settlement the EU wants from the U.K. over spending pledges it has made but won\u2019t have carried out by Brexit day.The EU\u2019s unofficial calculations of upward of \u20ac60 billion ($70 billion) for that bill include U.K. spending commitments for the current seven-year EU budget period through 2020. If the U.K. stays in the single market and customs union until then, keeping the British government\u2019s budget contribution at current levels would require it to pay more than \u20ac20 billion of the bill anyway.A transition would also likely mean delaying the implementation of any trade agreements the U.K. negotiates with non-EU countries such as the U.S. Since customs unions impose common tariffs on goods coming from outside, members can\u2019t negotiate away tariffs with third parties.Ministers have been talking of a three-year transition, allowing the U.K. to be free of its EU entanglements by the next scheduled U.K. general election in 2022.U.S. President       Donald Trump       might thus be able to sign a trade accord with the U.K. during his first term of office. But he would have to win the 2020 presidential election to oversee its implementation.Write to Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-government-lines-up-to-a-point-on-brexit-transition-1501181618", "keywords": ["brexit, eu customs union , eu single market, transition period,European Union,British government,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 14:46:00", "news_title": "U.K. Judge Orders Charlie Gard to Be Moved to a Hospice to Die", "content": "LONDON\u2014A judge\u00a0on\u00a0Thursday\u00a0ordered that terminally ill infant       Charlie Gard       be moved from a hospital to a hospice where the ventilator keeping the 11-month-old alive will be removed and he will die \u201cwithin a short period of time.\u201dJudge       Nicholas Francis       had granted his parents,       Connie Yates       and       Chris Gard,        until\u00a0noon Thursday\u00a0to find a specialized medical team so they could spend a few extra days with him at a hospice, but the deadline passed without an agreement with the hospital.\u00a0The ventilation process requires round-the-clock attention from a medical team, including a pediatric intensive-care specialist.

They make their way there safely. Before the night is out, though, they\u2019re caught up by a horrific sequence of events in the motel\u2019s annex. Three unarmed black men are killed and nine other people\u2014two white women and seven black men\u2014are brutally beaten during an hour-long interrogation by a combined police-and-military riot squad that has responded to a telephone report of a sniper in the building. No gun is ever found.Join WSJ+ & Rooftop Cinema Club for a member-only screening on Saturday, July 29, atop the landmark Montalb\u00e1n Theatre in the heart of Hollywood. Featuring WSJ Movie Critic Joe Morgensten\u2019s summer pick, \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d the private screening will be followed by a special discussion and Q&A with Morgensten himself.\u201cDetroit\u201d is far from the first account of what has come to be known as the Algiers Motel incident. Though the filmmakers tell us that this account is based on extensive reporting, it is still a dramatization, a heightened narrative that\u2019s heightened further by the power of the big screen. (The cinematographer was       Barry Ackroyd.       The editors were       William Goldenberg       and       Harry Yoon.      ) Be forewarned that the film is violent, and sometimes clumsily so; it\u2019s suffused by the filmmakers\u2019 rage at the brutality of the Detroit cops and their military enablers, who decline to intervene. And what goes on in the confines of the motel annex is not only a microcosm of the larger riots, or a documenting of police misbehavior. It\u2019s a riveting parable of mob behavior with unrestrained power flowing from one probably psychopathic personality\u2014in this case a cop given the fictional name of Krauss and played frighteningly well by       Will Poulter      \u2014to accomplices who are either empowered in their turn or scared into inaction.Others in the cast include the always formidable       Anthony Mackie       in a fairly small but significant role, and       John Boyega,        of recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d fame. He is superb as a real-life security guard,       Melvin Dismukes,        an earnest young black man who believes that he can mediate the situation or mitigate the police violence without paying a steep price for his Samaritan impulses. Occasionally the script slips into didactic mode. \u201cWe gotta stop failing these people,\u201d one cop says to another. For the most part, though, the film teaches by terrifying example.

Yet the film doesn\u2019t dwell on the Trump administration\u2019s hostility to climate science, and, because of the production\u2019s release date, it includes only an end-title mention of last month\u2019s announcement that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate accords. Rather, the emphasis is on the intensifying impact of global warming caused by human activity, on heartening signs of progress in renewable energy, and on the need for sustaining hope that brighter days will come.Eleven years after \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d Mr. Gore remains a prodigy of hope, with energy that seems endlessly renewable. During much of the intervening time he continued to travel the beleaguered globe with the slide show that became the core content of the first film, though the campaign against carbon emissions sometimes seemed doomed. \u201cIf I said there weren\u2019t times I considered this a personal failure I\u2019d be lying,\u201d he says at one point in this new documentary feature, which was directed by       Bonni Cohen       and       Jon Shenk.At another he says: \u201cThere came a time for me when I thought, wow, we could really lose the struggle.

But the world\u2014the physical world\u2014has changed dramatically since the first film was released, and \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel\u201d reflects those changes with startling visuals. In Greenland, glaciers have been exploding from within because of rising temperatures. In Miami, roads and sidewalks have been raised in response to rising sea levels. Some of the videos are so familiar\u2014lashing storms, widespread floods, raging fires, droughts associated with political upheavals and refugee crises\u2014that the mind glazes over, and Mr. Gore acknowledges the problem: \u201cEvery night on the evening news is like a nature walk through the Book of Revelation.\u201dBut the man who was often faulted for dispassion during his long political career unleashes the wrath of a country preacher at certain moments here. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he imagines future generations wondering about us. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you hear what the scientists were saying? Couldn\u2019t you hear what Mother Nature was screaming at you?\u201d And he brings good news along with the litany of tempests and record temps\u2014the growth of wind and solar power on exponential curves that were unimaginable a decade ago.

The script is based on a graphic novel series called \u201cThe Coldest City.\u201d That\u2019s why the film is grimly handsome, in color that yearns to be black and white.One early shot is almost worth the price of admission, not because it\u2019s conventionally erotic but because it\u2019s chillingly beautiful, as well as indispensable to the trailer.       Jonathan Sela\u2019s       camera studies Ms. Theron\u2019s Lorraine from above, nude in a sullen blue light and rising slowly from a bathtub full of ice cubes, her powerful body covered with scars and bruises that attest to the punishment she takes in the course of her work. Lorraine gives what she gets, of course. She\u2019s a bisexual Wonder Woman minus the lariat and the buoyant spirit, though with myth-worthy boots; the only source of pleasure in her life is a brief encounter with a young French intelligence agent,       Delphine Lasalle,        who is played by Sofia Boutella.In other words, Lorraine doesn\u2019t have a lot of fun. She\u2019s approximately as joyous as       Richard Burton\u2019s      Alec Leamas       in \u201cThe Spy Who Came In From the Cold,\u201d a Cold War thriller that was in black and white and didn\u2019t want to be anything else. That\u2019s perfectly fine because Ms. Theron has the sly style, the deadpan wit and the drop-dead beauty to pull it off. (      James McAvoy       is also entertaining as       David Percival,        an MI6 station chief and Lorraine\u2019s Berlin contact.) But the film as a whole is a deep-dyed downer, notwithstanding Ms. Theron\u2019s sensational physicality in several spectacular fight sequences\u2014the director,       David Leitch,        is a former stunt man of note\u2014and a pounding soundtrack of 1980s rock and pop. The story is impenetrable, with more betrayals than you can give a damn about, and the frigid tone borders on self-parody, with frequent excursions to the wrong side of the border. As strong and formidable and commandingly tall as Ms. Theron is, she can\u2019t rise above the gloom.Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/atomic-blonde-review-explosive-action-fails-to-ignite-1501181060", "keywords": [" action,arts in review,atomic blonde, charlize theron, james mcavoy, movies,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,reviews"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 14:37:00", "news_title": "Self-Driving-Car Legislation Clears U.S. House Panel ", "content": "A U.S. House panel approved legislation regarding self-driving cars, a significant step aimed at clarifying the rules of the road for manufacturers developing vehicles that pilot themselves.The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee cleared the bill, which would bar states from setting driverless-car rules that conflict with federal standards, on a 54-0 vote Thursday morning. Auto makers have been concerned about a patchwork of state-by-state driverless-car regulations.The legislation would require companies to submit safety-assessment certifications to U.S. regulators\u2014a practice already urged in automated-vehicle policy, but that lacks legal force\u2014and then prevent the federal government from halting the deployment or testing of automated vehicles while the assessment is reviewed.The bill also eventually would allow exemptions from existing U.S. safety regulations to companies that deploy up to 100,000 vehicles each. The legislation would require a publicly searchable database of each exempted vehicle. The exemptions are intended to prevent delays in technological advancements that could improve vehicle safety.U.S. officials spanning the Obama and Trump administrations have been attempting to balance safety concerns with rapid technological development among self-driving-car makers.Driverless cars are expected to aid the elderly and disabled, ease congestion and pollution, and cut traffic fatalities, 94% of which are attributed to human error, according to government officials and industry experts. Current U.S. safety standards cover vehicles with human drivers, and the bill would require the transportation secretary to eventually present lawmakers with a plan for developing rules addressing self-driving cars.Auto makers have been selling vehicles with semiautonomous features\u2014including automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control\u2014and are racing to master cars and trucks that can operate without input from a driver.The exemptions from existing U.S. safety standards in the bill would initially be capped at 25,000 vehicles for each company in the first year before climbing to 100,000 a piece over three years. Car makers would have to demonstrate their vehicles\u2019 safety to receive the exemption.The bill also requires that vehicles eventually have an alarm system alerting motorists to check rear seats when shutting down the engine, which is intended to reduce the number of children left unattended in cars.While the bill would bar states from setting their own driverless-car rules, the states would still keep traditional powers to address matters such as licenses, safety and emissions inspections and crash investigations, under the legislation\u2019s parameters. It also attempts to clarify that it doesn\u2019t pre-empt state dealer-franchise laws.The legislation still needs to clear the full House, with a vote expected as soon as September, and then be reconciled with any similar Senate bill before heading to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk, which could take a number of months.Write to Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/self-driving-car-legislation-clears-u-s-house-panel-1501179662", "keywords": ["driverless cars,house of representatives,self-driving cars,semiautonomous cars,technology,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,transport,autonomous driving technologies,automotive"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 14:34:00", "news_title": "North Korea\u2019s Army of Hackers Has a New Target: Bank Accounts", "content": "SEOUL\u2014North Korea\u2019s cyberarmy has splintered into multiple groups and is unleashing orchestrated attacks increasingly focused on funneling stolen funds to the secretive nation, according to a government-backed South Korean report released Thursday.The emphasis on finances represents a significant shift from Pyongyang\u2019s prior patterns of attack seeking to obtain military information, destabilize networks or intimidate. It also shows how North Korea\u2019s fast-evolving\u2014but costly\u2014nuclear-missile program has accelerated its need for cash as it is subjected to financial sanctions.Pyongyang has been blamed for major cyberattacks including 2014\u2019s Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, last year\u2019s daring cyberheist at Bangladesh\u2019s central bank and this year\u2019s WannaCry global ransomware attack.Cybersecurity researchers have long suspected the hacking group Lazarus carried out those attacks with the backing of North Korea.Earlier this year, Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab AO identified an offshoot of Lazarus, called BlueNoroff, which specializes in heists of foreign financial institutions.In the new report, the government-funded Korea Financial Security Institute said it had identified a second group linked with Lazarus that has carried out a range of cyberattacks on South Korea. FSI researchers found eight attacks from 2013 to May conducted by this new hacking operative, which they call \u201cAndariel,\u201d and whose coding and internet-protocol address bear similarities to Lazarus attacks.The efforts include even low-level scams such as planting malware in South Korean ATMs to steal bank-card information, according to the FSI report, the country\u2019s first-ever public report on North Korean cyberattacks, with law enforcement and intelligence officials getting briefed on the findings. That is behavior more typical of an organized-crime ring.North Korean operatives then sold the swiped data to people in Taiwan, China and Thailand who would try to withdraw money from ATMs in their own regions. But only several thousand dollars were withdrawn before South Korean law enforcement identified the ruse after six days.\u201cNorth Korea now cares more about making money than causing disruptions or cyberterrorism,\u201d said       Joon Kim,        owner of Naru Security Inc., who has advised South Korean law enforcement on cyber issues.South Koreans have a unique lens into North Korea\u2019s cyberoffenses, as Pyongyang\u2019s longest-running and most frequent target. South Korean government groups and agencies withstand 1.4 million hacking attempts a day, according to law-enforcement and intelligence officials.The eight Andariel attacks shared similarities in hacking tools and encrypted codes. To access \u201cweb shells,\u201d or servers used by hackers that allow them to control computers remotely, the Andariel group used one of two passwords: \u201ciamboss\u201d or \u201cyouaredied,\u201d according to a person familiar with Andariel\u2019s techniques.Andariel has also recently teamed up with BlueNoroff to target a large South Korean financial institution, according to the FSI report. The institution wasn\u2019t identified.The report helps paint a fuller picture over how North Korea\u2019s digital army has grown into a web of specialist teams.\u201cThe problem is that it\u2019s not just simple attacks anymore with North Korea. It\u2019s more orchestrated now, as if it were a military operation,\u201d said Kim Seung-joo, a Korea University professor who sits on a South Korean government cybersecurity advisory team.North Korea\u2019s hacking teams have been recruited internally over years within the country\u2019s military and Ministry of State Security, said       Adam Meyers,        vice president of intelligence with the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, Inc. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a rich capability that extends across multiple government organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have education programs and they have training programs.\u201dMr. Meyers believes that the country\u2019s hackers are \u201clikely really well taken care of financially,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys are definitely an important element of their doctrine.\u201dThe country likely sees offensive cyber operations \u201cas a cost-effective, asymmetric, deniable tool that it can employ with little risk from reprisal attacks, in part because its networks are largely separated from the Internet and disruption of Internet access would have minimal impact on its economy,\u201d the Department of Defense wrote in a 2015 report.The broader Lazarus group, discreet and meticulous in covering its tracks, has specialized in breaching computers or networks, foreign and South Korean cybersecurity experts said. BlueNoroff then follows up with the actual heists or data swipes with less regard for cloaking its moves.Outside of South Korea, the Lazarus group has recently set its sights on casinos, financial-trade software firms\u2014and even organized-crime rings, said Vitaly Kamluk, a global research and analysis director at Kaspersky Lab, who is focused on the Asia-Pacific region.\u201cIt sounds like a perfect crime,\u201d Mr. Kamluk said. \u201cWhen you steal from a thief, nobody will go after you. Law-enforcement will focus on the criminal that stole the money in the first place.\u201dLazarus and BlueNoroff in recent years have made attempts to breach financial companies or institutions in at least 18 countries, including Mexico, Norway and India, according to Kaspersky.\u2014Min Sun Lee and Robert McMillan contributed to this article.Write to Timothy W.

The moves come as EVs account for just a fraction of global auto sales, but as the industry prepares for a ramp-up in demand in the coming decade.The push into EVs has been hastened by increasingly stringent regulations globally on fuel-economy standards and tailpipe emissions, along with generous government subsidies. That is prompting more auto makers to offer alternatives to gasoline engines.That trend was highlighted when the U.K. earlier this week said it would ban sales of cars powered by traditional internal-combustion engines altogether by 2040. Earlier this month Sweden\u2019s Volvo, owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. of China, said it would only sell partly or wholly electric vehicles by 2019.Mr. Marchionne\u2019s comments mark a sharp about-face from previous public statements. He has repeatedly questioned consumer demand for EVs, warned they risk turning cars into commodities and lampooned his company\u2019s sole existing EV\u2014the Fiat 500e\u2014as a perennial money loser.The CEO said battery costs still present a challenge for mass market EVs, but that trouble with diesel-engine technology has made electrification a more attractive path for meeting government-mandated emissions-reduction targets, especially in Europe.\u201cMy aversion to electrification was based on cost issues. What has really made it mandatory is the diesel\u201d problem, Mr. Marchionne said.Car makers have had to recall millions of diesel-engine powered cars in Europe after they were shown to emit excessive levels of emissions.\u00a0            Volkswagen                   admitted in 2015 to rigging nearly 11 million diesel engines world-wide to cheat emissions tests and pleaded guilty in 2016 to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and U.S. consumers.FCA has offered an \u201ceco-diesel\u201d engine option on some of its Jeep SUV and Ram pickup trucks in the U.S., but that has come under fire from U.S. regulators who accuse the company of using emissions-defeating technology similar to that deployed by Volkswagen. FCA has denied seeking to intentionally subvert emissions regulations.Mr. Marchionne said recently that FCA would seek to meet tougher fuel-economy targets by introducing gas-electric hybrid engine versions of most Jeep SUVs, a powertrain configuration already available on its new Pacifica minivan. It is unclear if Maserati cars will be equipped with this type of hybrid solution or fully electric engines.Without a major breakthrough in standard lithium-ion battery technology, Mr. Marchionne said the global market for EVs is likely to be capped by price increases as demand for batteries exceeds manufacturers\u2019 ability to supply them in large volumes as soon as early next decade.But Toyota this week reported a\u00a0potentially promising development for more widespread adoption of EVs in mainstream brands.\u00a0The Japanese auto maker said it is working on commercializing by the early 2020s a so-called solid-state battery,\u00a0which would clear a major cost hurdle by not needing to be cooled constantly like lithium-ion batteries. It is one of several companies, including German auto-parts supplier\u00a0Robert Bosch GmbH, which see promise in solid-state battery technology for next-generation EVs.Mr. Marchionne\u2019s remarks came after FCA reported its most profitable second quarter since Italy\u2019s Fiat first took a stake in bankrupt Chrysler in 2009.A strong showing from the Maserati division added to the boost FCA got from improved results in Europe, Asia and Latin America. In North America, which accounts for 58% of revenue, sales fell in the quarter and the company shipped 14% fewer cars. Its closely watched net industrial debt level came in at \u20ac4.2 billion ($4.9 billion), well above financial analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of \u20ac3.71 billion.Shares of FCA were down 10 cents to $11.81 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Adjusted operating profit, which strips out one-time items, for the three months ended June 30 rose to \u20ac1.87 billion ($2.2 billion) from \u20ac1.63 billion. Revenue was little changed at \u20ac27.93 billion. Net income more than tripled to \u20ac1.16 billion as FCA benefited from tax changes in Brazil.\u2014Eric Sylvers contributed to this article.Write to Chester Dawson at chester.dawson@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiat-chrysler-ceo-learning-to-love-electric-vehicles-1501180035", "keywords": ["diesel,electric cars,electric engines,fiat,maserati,sergio marchionne,Fiat,FCA.MI,Maserati,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.,FCAU,Sergio Marchionne,financial performance,earnings,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,commercial vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,motor vehicle parts,automotive,vehicle engine,engine parts"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 14:20:00", "news_title": "Investors Don\u2019t Believe in Twitter\u2019s Turnaround", "content": "Twitter        TWTR -3.91%       has found a way to moderate its revenue declines, but it told investors not to get too excited about it.The social media company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings and revenue for the second quarter Thursday. Revenue fell 5% year over year as advertising revenue dropped 9%. That was an improvement over the previous quarter\u2019s declines of 8% and 11%, respectively, as sales of Twitter data and live video offerings grew. Monthly active users were flat sequentially after accelerating in the first quarter. Investors weren\u2019t impressed, sending shares down more than 13% Thursday.Twitter said it was encouraged by the improvement in its revenue trend, but cautioned that it doesn\u2019t expect its overall revenue growth rate to get better in the second half of 2017 because it is winding down less-profitable products. It said that would hurt revenue to the tune of $75 million.

Clashes broke out between Palestinians and Israeli security personnel at the compound later Thursday as thousands of Palestinians came to pray.The metal detectors and metal archways supporting cameras and railings at the site had been installed after Arab gunmen killed two Israeli policemen there on July 14. The security measures sparked widespread protests among Arabs who said Israel was using the measures to try to control access to the site.Violent protests and attacks over the weekend left three Israelis and at least three Palestinians dead.The episode has weakened Mr. Netanyahu, who already faces growing unpopularity at home over corruption allegations. Some 77% of Israelis believe the government capitulated to Palestinian demands by removing the metal detectors, according to a Tuesday poll by the country\u2019s Channel 2 broadcaster.Israel Hayom, a daily owned by U.S. billionaire       Sheldon Adelson       and once considered supportive of Mr. Netanyahu, published a scathing editorial on its front page this week over the prime minister\u2019s handling of the crisis, calling the government response \u201cfeeble and frightened.\u201d\u201cIsrael will come out weakened,\u201d Naftali Bennett, who is a member of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition and secretary of education, as well as leader of the far-right Jewish Home party, told Army Radio on Thursday.Police are investigating Mr. Netanyahu in twin corruption probes into whether he received unlawful gifts in office and tried to negotiate favorable coverage in another newspaper. Mr. Netanyahu denies the allegations, but the probes have damaged his standing among Israelis.\u201cAll these things are adding up,\u201d said Emmanuel Navon, a political analyst and lecturer at Tel Aviv University. \u201cHe comes across as a leader that\u2019s made the wrong decisions.\u201dEven so, he will likely weather this latest crisis, according to Mitchell Barak, political analyst at Jerusalem-based Keevoon Global Research.\u201cNetanyahu walks away from this unscathed,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one reason: Israelis cannot identify an alternative to Netanyahu.\u201dA spokesman for the prime minister declined to comment on the criticism.Mr. Netanyahu is expected to back a bill from members of his government to absorb settlements around Jerusalem in the West Bank into the city\u2019s municipal boundaries, adding thousands more Jewish settler residents, Israeli media said. The move is likely to appeal to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing political base.Members of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party have lobbied for the government to officially annex the settlements and absorb them into Israeli territory, a move that the prime minister has so far not supported amid signals from the White House to curb settlement expansion.The latest proposal would absorb the settlers into the Jerusalem municipality but not Israeli territory, Israeli media said. Its time frame for implementation is unclear.Mr. Netanyahu also called on Thursday for the death penalty for a 19-year-old Palestinian who killed three Israeli settlers at their home last weekend in response to the Israeli security measures at the holy site in Jerusalem, echoing similar calls by right-wing lawmakers. Israel hasn\u2019t used the death penalty since it hanged Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1962.Palestinians were initially jubilant over what they consider a symbolic victory over Mr. Netanyahu and his government over the removal of the security measures. Thousands of Palestinians visited the site on Thursday afternoon, giving out free food and water to fellow worshipers and shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d Arabic for God is great.\u201cThey now know the force of the people of Jerusalem,\u201d Farah Walid, 71, said of the Israeli government as he entered the compound to pray at the Al Aqsa mosque.The metal detectors were removed on Tuesday and the archways on Thursday. The government has said it would install sophisticated technology in the coming months to detect weapons, but hasn\u2019t said how the equipment would work. It also said it would increase police presence around the site.While Jews can visit the site, only Muslims are allowed to pray on the holy plaza. Jewish groups have lobbied for that right.Israel has maintained that the new measures are purely for security, and has denied it is attempting to change the current rules.The Waqf, the Jordanian religious body that is custodian of the site and had called for Muslims to boycott and pray outside, and Palestinian Authority President       Mahmoud Abbas       both encouraged Palestinians to return.Mr. Abbas had called for the cutting of ties with Israel until full access was returned. He didn\u2019t immediately restore those ties on Thursday but his office said he was closely following developments.\u200bHamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, praised the Palestinian protesters.\u201cWe salute the steadfastness of the people of Jerusalem,\u201d Ismail Haniyeh, the Islamist movement\u2019s leader, told reporters in Gaza.\u2014       Nuha Musleh       in Ramallah and Abu Bakr Bashir in Gaza City contributed to this article.Write to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-removes-remaining-security-measures-at-jerusalem-holy-site-1501145639", "keywords": [" israel hayom, noble sanctuary, temple mount,waqf,Benjamin Netanyahu,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,islam,politics,international relations,domestic politics,religion,state security measures,policies"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 14:01:00", "news_title": "KKR Earnings Soar as Its Portfolio and Fees Grow", "content": "KKR        KKR 1.06%       & Co.\u2019s second-quarter profit surged as its private-equity portfolio appreciated, though a senior executive said new investments are commanding steep prices.\u201cValuations, generally speaking, are pretty high,\u201d       Scott Nuttall,        a co-president of the New York private-equity firm, said on a conference call with analysts Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been selling, on a global basis, more than we\u2019ve been buying\u2014in particular in the U.S. and Europe.\u201dKKR said its earnings for the quarter ended June 30 rose to $405.6 million, or 81 cents a share, from $93.9 million, or 19 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.Economic profit, a closely watched performance measure that reflects unrealized investment gains, nearly quadrupled to a firm record of $752.5 million, or 89 cents a share.KKR\u2019s shares climbed 2.3% to $19.75 in early afternoon trading, extending their year-to-date advance to 28%.For years, markets\u2019 upward drift has buoyed buyout firms\u2019 portfolios and offered them ample opportunity to take profits when selling prior investments.

Adding to the pressure, pensions\u2019 and large investors\u2019 increased demand for private-equity funds and other so-called alternative investment products is fueling a fundraising boom, boosting competition for deals.KKR recently amassed a new $13.9 billion buyout fund for investments in North America and has $9.3 billion dedicated to the Asia-Pacific region.             Apollo Global Management                   LLC plans for its new flagship private-equity fund to raise $24.7 billion, according to a regulatory filing.             Carlyle Group                   LP is in the midst of an effort to raise $100 billion for new investment products between 2016 and 2019.KKR\u2019s Mr. Nuttall said the firm\u2019s response includes acquiring businesses to tack onto existing portfolio companies. KKR on Monday said it struck a deal to buy WebMD for $2.8 billion through its Internet Brands, which maintains a portfolio of websites including autodata.com. The firm is also finding opportunities to invest in infrastructure assets and corporate debt, he said.Exits during the period included the sale of shares of             US Foods Inc.       and             GoDaddy Inc.       The food-service distributor and web-hosting provider went public in 2016 and 2015, respectively, after earlier buyouts by KKR and other investors.KKR\u2019s bottom line got a lift from its capital markets business, which advises companies in raising debt and equity capital. The unit\u2019s revenue more than doubled from the year-earlier quarter to $93.7 million. That marked its second-highest haul ever, following the first quarter\u2019s $121.1 million.At the end of the quarter, KKR managed $148.5 billion in assets, up from $137.6 billion the prior quarter and $140 billion in June 2016.KKR took a step in settling longstanding questions about its succession this month, promoting       Joe Bae       and Mr. Nuttall to the newly created roles of co-president and co-chief operating officer.

The share of Americans who own homes has climbed steadily since then.The homeownership rate also edged up from the first quarter, when it sat at 63.6%.\u201cThe damage the [2007-09] great recession has done to the homeownership rate is likely reversing course,\u201d said       Ralph McLaughlin,        chief economist at home tracker Trulia.The quarterly reports can be volatile, but several factors point to sustained improvement. The number of new-owner households exceeded new renter ones for the second consecutive quarter. Some 1.26 million new-owner households have been formed since the second quarter of 2016, while there are 702,000 fewer renter households than there were a year ago, according to the Census.There are now more homeowners in the U.S. than any time since 2009, according to Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.That doesn\u2019t bode well for apartment landlords, who are battling a flood of new supply that is pushing vacancy rates up and keeping rent growth tepid in many parts of the country.The national vacancy rate climbed to 4.4% for the quarter from 4.2% a year earlier, according to data provider             Reis Inc.\u201cAs the rental market becomes more saturated and vacancies keep climbing, there is some hope that builders may begin to re-focus their attention on the for-sale segment, a potential boon for those renters that likely want to buy, and would if they could, but haven\u2019t been able to find the right home for them given incredibly tight inventory,\u201d Ms. Gudell said.Nonetheless, the trend is good news for the housing market and the U.S. economy overall, given the boost that new-home construction provides. Builders are likely to continue ramping up production of starter homes in response to increasing demand from millennials.The homeownership rate for households headed by someone under 35 years old climbed to 35.3% in the second quarter, up from 34.1% a year earlier.Increasing demand is likely to put additional upward pressure on home prices unless there is more supply to meet it.

The company said it believes it could successfully defend itself against any action the Justice Department might bring.United Therapeutics is one of at least nine drug companies being investigated by the Justice Department over their contributions to nonprofit groups that help patients pay their out-of-pocket costs for drugs, including patients in the federal Medicare program for the elderly, according to companies\u2019 regulatory filings. Others receiving subpoenas in the probe since 2015 include             Johnson & Johnson,Pfizer Inc.       and             Biogen Inc.       The companies have said they are cooperating with the investigations.United Therapeutics, which had revenue of $1.6 billion last year, is the first of the companies to disclose a potential settlement. The company\u2019s SEC filing said any settlement may include a corporate-integrity agreement with the federal government, a pact that typically requires companies to adhere to certain business practices for several years.The company said it received a subpoena from the Justice Department in May 2016 seeking documents about its support of nonprofit organizations that provide financial assistance to patients taking its medicines. The company hasn\u2019t identified the organizations.A United Therapeutics spokesman declined to comment beyond what the company disclosed in its SEC filing and its second-quarter earnings press release.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.Nonprofit organizations, sometimes centered around a specific disease, provide financial assistance to reduce patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs, and drug companies have donated to the charities.This has triggered scrutiny by the federal government because patients covered by federal health-insurance programs such as Medicare have received the assistance. The federal anti-kickback law prohibits companies from making payments intended to induce the use of a drug or medical product that is reimbursed by federal health programs.The Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2014 issued a bulletin saying that if a company\u2019s donation to a patient-assistance charity is intended specifically to induce the charity to pay for patients\u2019 use of the company\u2019s drugs, it could be a violation of the anti-kickback law.The OIG said drug companies\u2019 donations to charities can be appropriate if the charity is sufficiently independent in deciding which patients receive the financial help, or how much.But the OIG said it had concerns that companies were supporting charities for patients with narrowly defined diseases, so that the charities were primarily supporting payments for the donor companies\u2019 products.The heightened scrutiny of patient-assistance charities has hit some drugmakers\u2019 sales, as manufacturers have reduced donations to the charities and instead given away certain medicines free.United Therapeutics said Thursday it reduced its grants to nonprofit patient-assistance programs by $32 million during the first six months of 2017. The company didn\u2019t say why it decreased the grants.United Therapeutics markets four drugs that treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is high blood pressure in arteries feeding the lungs.

This has prompted criticism from politicians and the public who asked why the affair only recently came to light.The Transport Agency has moved to allay public fears over the data that was leaked, saying that most of the information it handles is open and not confidential, such as rail infrastructure details, railroad records, aircraft registers, ship and seafarers registers, and road traffic registers.\u201cHowever, there is some information in our registry that is worthy of protection,\u201d the agency said. \u201cFor security reasons, we cannot tell you what the information is about...We hold no records of military pilots, military airports, military aircraft or shipping.\u201dOpposition parties on Wednesday demanded no-confidence votes against Messrs.

Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) told reporters Thursday that he will introduce a bill next week that would curtail the power of the president to fire a special counsel under some circumstances without approval from a federal judge.The legislation will say that \u201ca special counsel cannot be fired when they were impaneled to investigate the president or his team unless you have judicial review of the firing,\u201d Mr. Graham said. He said the legislation would apply to Mr. Trump and future presidents.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.\u201cWe need a check and balance here,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who as a member of the House of Representatives in the 1990s helped manage impeachment proceedings against       Bill Clinton       over perjury and obstruction of justice allegations.According to a January report from the U.S. intelligence community, Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election was directed at the highest levels of its government. Its tactics included hacking state election systems; infiltrating and leaking information from party committees and political strategists; and disseminating through social media and other outlets negative stories about Democratic nominee       Hillary Clinton       and positive ones about Mr. Trump, the report said.\u2018Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency\u2019The investigation into the meddling, including whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign colluded in the effort, is being led by Special Counsel       Robert Mueller,        a former prosecutor and former head of the FBI. Mr. Trump cannot directly remove Mr. Mueller and Justice Department regulations require any firing to be for \u201cmisconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause\u201d\u2014though the president could ask the leadership at the Justice Department to terminate Mr. Mueller.Mr. Trump has called the probe a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and has suggested that if the special counsel investigation started looking into his finances, that would be a \u201cviolation\u201d of its mandate. Mr. Trump has declined to say whether he would try to remove Mr. Mueller.Mr. Trump has expressed his displeasure with Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       in interviews and on Twitter, criticizing the former Alabama senator\u2019s decision to recuse himself from management of the Russia investigation. Because Mr. Sessions is recused, he cannot make any decisions around the special counsel, including firing him.In a Wall Street Journal interview this week, Mr. Trump described himself as \u201cvery disappointed in Jeff Sessions.\u201d On Twitter, he has repeatedly said that Mr. Sessions should investigate Mrs. Clinton instead.Mr. Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in March after questions were raised about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during last year\u2019s election. The investigation was managed by Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       until Mr. Trump fired FBI director       James Comey       in May.A week after the firing of the FBI director, Mr. Rosenstein put Mr. Mueller in charge of the investigation in an effort to insulate it from political pressure. Special counsels operate outside the normal Justice Department chain of command.Mr. Trump\u2019s public musings about removing his attorney general over his handling of the Russia matter raised alarm on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers from both parties are warning the president not to take any steps to undermine the investigation.\u201cIf Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay,\u201d said Mr. Graham. \u201cAny effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.\u201dHe said Mr. Trump was proposing \u201cturning democracy upside down\u201d by subverting the independence of the Justice Department.Other members of Congress also warned Mr. Trump against firing Mr. Sessions and trying to use his power to make a recess appointment when Congress goes home for two weeks in August. The Senate has frequently held \u201cpro forma\u201d sessions in recent years in part to block the White House from making such appointments.\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of making a recess appointment to push out the attorney general, forget about it,\u201d said Sen.       Ben Sasse,        a Nebraska Republican.In 2012, former President       Barack Obama       made several temporary appointments during brief Senate breaks, in an effort to overcome Republican resistance to his nominees. The Supreme Court later ruled he exceeded his constitutional authority.Mr. Graham\u2019s legislation would need to be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate and House of Representatives, where many Republicans have been more protective of Mr. Trump than in the Senate.The president could also veto the legislation, which could be overturned by two-thirds of the House and Senate.If Mr. Sessions is fired by Mr. Trump or resigns, the Senate could deny Mr. Trump the ability to permanently replace him. The attorney general must be approved by the Senate, and even conservative Republicans warned the president this week that confirming a new attorney general would be difficult.Sen.

Shell Chief Executive       Ben van Beurden       said the company has a mind-set that oil prices would remain \u201clower forever\u201d\u2014a riff on the \u201clower for longer\u201d mantra the industry adopted for a price slump that has proved unexpectedly lasting.\u201cWe have to have projects that are resilient in a world where oil has peaked,\u201d Mr. van Beurden told reporters on a conference call discussing the company\u2019s second-quarter financial results. \u201cWhen it will happen we don\u2019t know, but that it will happen we are certain.\u201dThe views of the British-Dutch oil company reflect the transition under way in a global energy industry grappling with the twin forces of an oil-supply glut and a looming consumer shift away from petroleum. These trends are even more pronounced for oil companies in Europe, where local and national governments are trying to phase out vehicles with internal-combustion engines, encourage electric automobiles and reduce overall carbon emissions.Experts differ on the timing of peak oil demand. In its most-guarded scenario, Shell sees oil peaking within the coming decade. The International Energy Agency says the timing will be more like 2040. The advent of declining demand\u2014after decades of unrelenting growth\u2014would likely erode the value of oil and the companies that produce it.On the other hand, U.S. energy giants such as             Exxon Mobil Corp.       and             Chevron Corp.       have said peak oil demand is still far off. And even when oil consumption eventually stops growing, Shell isn\u2019t expecting it to drop off a cliff.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s game over straight away,\u201d Mr. van Beurden said. \u201cThere will be a continued need for investment in oil projects.\u201dMr. van Beurden\u2019s comments are broadly in line with Shell\u2019s overall strategy of moving toward producing fuel for electricity, such as natural gas and even renewables, and focusing on keeping costs low. The company now produces more gas than oil. It is also building a massive wind farm off the Dutch coast and envisions spending as much as $1 billion a year on developing new energy sources such as renewables by the end of the decade.Despite Shell\u2019s warnings on oil, the company posted what analysts said was a strong second quarter.Shell\u2019s equivalent of net profit rose to $1.9 billion from $239 million a year earlier and its cash flow from operations\u2014a metric that has become increasingly important to investors\u2014soared to $11.3 billion. The company said it generated $38 billion of cash from its business over 12 months, enough to cover dividend payments and pare debt.French oil giant             Total SA       and Norway\u2019s             Statoil AS      A also reported their quarterly results on Thursday, both striking a confident if cautious note. They trumpeted falling debt levels and strong cash flow.Total\u2019s profit for the quarter was $2 billion, roughly the same as last year, while the company reported a significant increase in cash flow from operations to $4.6 billion.Statoil said it earned $1.4 billion, compared with a loss of $302 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. The company said it generated $4 billion in free cash flow.Exxon and Chevron report earnings on Friday.Cash flow has become an important way to gauge the health of big oil companies during the price downturn because it demonstrates their ability to make dividend payments to investors without taking on new debt.Hefty, regular dividends are a significant reason big investors put money in oil companies, which historically haven\u2019t held out much hope of significant share-price growth because of their size. Investors are particularly wary in an era of low oil prices.At the depths of the oil-price crash, big oil companies took on tens of billions of dollars in debt to help cover dividend payments. Several offer payouts as company shares, known as scrip\u2014a practice that has kept investors happy in the short-term but was widely seen as unsustainable.In the first quarter of last year when oil hit its nadir of $27 a barrel, Shell\u2019s cash flow fell to just $700 million. Oil\u2019s fragile recovery since then to around $50 a barrel has helped the sector, but Shell and its peers have also engaged in aggressive efforts to bring down costs so they can survive at lower prices. Shell said that removing its scrip dividend remains a priority that it is working toward.\u201cWe are getting fit for the 40s,\u201d Mr. van Beurden said, referring to a world in which oil prices are below $50 a barrel.Write to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/royal-dutch-shells-second-quarter-earnings-rise-sharply-1501137915", "keywords": [" natural gas, oil prices,peak oil, second quarter earnings,shell earnings,Royal Dutch Shell,RDSB.LN,RDSA.LN,Ben van Beurden,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,crude oil markets,energy,natural gas upstream operations,alternative fuels,integrated oil,gas"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 13:32:00", "news_title": "Fed Nominee Quarles: Bank Stress Tests Need More Transparency", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014      Randal Quarles,        President       Donald Trump\u2019s       pick to become the Federal Reserve\u2019s point person on financial regulation, told lawmakers Thursday he would support changes to the central bank\u2019s stress tests for big banks, embracing industry-backed efforts to boost their transparency.At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Quarles criticized \u201cthe lack of transparency that has surrounded\u201d the annual tests, which have become the key regulatory hurdle large U.S. banks face.The remarks suggested Mr. Quarles, if confirmed, would be willing to go further than his predecessor, former Fed governor       Daniel Tarullo,        in publishing more information about how the tests are run. Industry officials have long demanded more details, in part to avoid embarrassing failures. Mr. Tarullo resisted disclosing certain information, saying it could allow banks to game the exams.\u201cI do think the Fed can look at being more transparent about those activities and do it in a way that doesn\u2019t reduce the effectiveness of those tests,\u201d Mr. Quarles said.Mr. Quarles, who was testifying alongside       Joseph Otting,        Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for the comptroller of the currency, also called for \u201csome refinements\u201d to the postcrisis rule book for Wall Street, which he said has broadly made the financial system safer.\u201cAs with any complex undertaking, after the first wave of reform, and with the benefit of experience and reflection, some refinements will undoubtedly be in order,\u201d Mr. Quarles said.The hearing is a crucial step to advance the nominees toward their expected confirmation in the coming months. The nominations require a simple Senate majority to pass, and Republicans control 52 of 100 seats in the chamber.Both likely would represent more industry-friendly voices at the country\u2019s top bank regulators. The Trump administration already is conducting a review of Obama-era banking rules that it says go too far and curb lending.No Republican criticized either nominee Thursday, but the pair quickly came under fire from Senate Democrats. Sen.       Sherrod Brown       of Ohio, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, highlighted positive remarks about the economy that Mr. Quarles made before the financial crisis while he was serving in the       George W. Bush       administration.\u201cMany of his statements leading up to the crisis lead me to wonder whether he was asleep at the switch or willfully turning a blind eye to Wall Street abuses,\u201d Mr. Brown said. Mr. Quarles said later at the hearing that he regretted some remarks highlighted by Mr. Brown.Idaho Sen.       Mike Crapo,        the Republican who heads the panel, praised both Messrs. Quarles and Otting as \u201chighly qualified.\u201dMr. Quarles, an investment-fund manager and former Treasury Department official nominated earlier this month, would become Fed vice chairman of supervision, taking on a job created by Congress in 2010. That post was never formally filled, although Mr. Tarullo effectively served in the role.At Thursday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Quarles also said he would be open to revisiting the Volcker rule, which bans banks from certain types of trading and investing. He swatted away questions about bank capital requirements, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have a view as to whether they should be higher or lower.\u201dIn addition to his work on financial regulation, Mr. Quarles would weigh in on monetary policy as a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors. The seven-seat board is currently short-staffed, with only four members.Mr. Quarles didn\u2019t back away from his previous support of using clearly stated rules for setting monetary policy, but he did tell senators that he doesn\u2019t necessarily support the rule named for Stanford professor       John Taylor,        his former boss at the Treasury Department. \u201cI\u2019m not advocating the adoption of a Taylor rule to guide Fed policy,\u201d he said.Mr. Quarles previously served in the Treasury Department in both Bush administrations. He left the government in 2006 and the following year became a managing director at private-equity firm             Carlyle Group,       investing in troubled banks. To join the Fed, he is leaving a job as managing director at Cynosure Group, a Utah investment firm backed by family offices, including the Eccles family, which Mr. Quarles married into.Not much is known about Mr. Otting\u2019s regulatory views, though he adopted a similar tone to other Trump administration officials, who have called for a review of banking rules. On Thursday, Mr. Otting suggested he would be open to easing capital requirements that he said are \u201chighly complex\u201d and need \u201cto be examined.\u201dMr. Otting has worked in banking for decades. In 2010, he was hired as chief executive of OneWest, now owned by CIT Group. At the time, he was a lieutenant of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was chairman of OneWest.Democrats pressed Mr. Otting on allegations that the bank engaged in \u201crobo-signing\u201d during the foreclosure crisis, pushing borrowers out of their homes without properly reviewing their loan documentation. Mr. Otting said that although he signed a 2011 consent order laying out what regulators called faulty practices at the bank, he didn\u2019t agree with the findings.\u201cThe error rate was incredibly low, and so my viewpoint is, is if you look at the actual facts, there is a false narrative,\u201d he said.Mr. Otting would succeed       Keith Noreika,        the acting comptroller.Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com and Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-nominee-quarles-bank-stress-tests-need-more-transparency-1501176730", "keywords": ["fed board,fed governors,fed hearing,occ,otting,otting hearing,quarles,quarles hearing,senate banking committee,senate hearing,Federal Reserve,Mike Crapo,Joseph Otting,Randal Quarles,Sherrod Brown,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 13:30:00", "news_title": "Court Rules Against Politician Who Banned Access to Her Facebook Page", "content": "A federal court in Virginia ruled that a local politician violated the free-speech rights of a constituent she banned from her             Facebook                   page, in a case the judge said raises \u201cimportant questions\u201d about the constitutional restrictions that apply to social media accounts of elected officials.The ruling by U.S. District Judge       James Cacheris       in Alexandria, Va., could buttress a lawsuit in New York alleging that President       Donald Trump       unconstitutionally suppressed dissent by blocking             Twitter                   users from following his account.President Trump\u2019s frequent use of Twitter has added urgency to First Amendment questions revolving around the use of social media by public officials.In the Virginia case, Brian Davison sued the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, who temporarily banned him from her Facebook page after he posted criticism of local officials last year.Judge Cacheris, finding that       Phyllis Randall       was \u200bacting as a public official on her Facebook page, said Ms. Randall committed \u201ca cardinal sin under the First Amendment.\u201d\u201cThe suppression of critical commentary regarding elected officials is the quintessential form of viewpoint discrimination against which the First Amendment guards,\u201d Judge Cacheris wrote in his 44-page ruling on Tuesday.Ms. Randall, who lifted the ban against Mr. Davison after 12 hours, faces no penalty. Judge Cacheris said the consequences of her actions were \u201cfairly minor.\u201dJulia Judkins, a Fairfax, Va., lawyer who represents Ms. Randall, said Judge Cacheris erred in equating Ms. Randall\u2019s personal Facebook page to a government account.\u201cHow does this one person\u2019s Facebook page that she\u2019s not using county resources to maintain...how does that become like the government?\u201d Ms. Judkins said.Judge Cacheris noted that Ms. Randall used her Facebook page to solicit comments from her constituents.Mr. Davison, a software consultant, said Ms. Randall posted during business hours and meshed the trappings of her office, including her government email address, into her account.\u201cShe wants the public to believe she\u2019s transparent but then to ban critics,\u201d he said.Ms. Randall said she blocked Mr. Davison briefly because he posted comments that mentioned the family of elected officials, but that she wouldn\u2019t block anyone solely for making comments critical of public officials themselves.A separate lawsuit filed by Mr. Davison against county school board officials who blocked him, alleging similar violations, is pending before another judge on the Alexandria-based federal trial court. A decision could come at any time.Judge Cacheris said Ms. Randall is still free to moderate comments on her Facebook page, and he cautioned that his ruling shouldn\u2019t be read as prohibiting all public officials from blocking commenters from their social media accounts.Earlier this year, Judge Cacheris dismissed another lawsuit by Mr. Davison against a state prosecutor who deleted Mr. Davison\u2019s comments from the prosecutor\u2019s official Facebook page.The judge ruled that the deletion was constitutional because the plaintiff had attempted to \u201chijack the discussion\u201d in violation of a government social-media policy that permitted the removal of \u201cclearly off-topic\u201d comments. The case is on appeal.Ms. Randall\u2019s case could influence other courts weighing what Judge Cacheris described as \u201cimportant questions about the constitutional limitations applicable to social media accounts maintained by elected officials.\u201dThe lawsuit against Mr. Trump in federal court in Manhattan was brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University on behalf of seven users whom Mr. Trump blocked.\u201cWe hope the courts look to this opinion as a road map in holding that it is unconstitutional for President Trump to block his critics on Twitter,\u201d said Alex Abdo, senior staff attorney at the institute.The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Corrections & Amplifications   The name of the plaintiff in the Virginia case is Brian Davison.

In late 2014, when prices were around $16,000 per metric ton, Mr. Schvartsman\u2019s predecessor,       Murilo Ferreira,        told investors that prices would likely rise \u201csubstantially\u201d higher than Vale\u2019s $21,000\u00a0forecast for the coming year. Instead, prices went the other way, and nickel is currently trading at less than $10,000 a ton.The change in strategy could result in an eventual shutdown of Vale\u2019s money-losing nickel operation in the French territory of New Caledonia. Until Mr. Schvartsman took over, the company had been implementing a four-year project to ramp up production on the South Pacific island from 34,300 metric tons of nickel\u2014about 11% of Vale\u2019s capacity\u2014to 57,000 metric tons.But the operation has been troubled in recent years by regulatory issues, such as stricter environmental laws, and operational problems, such as an acid leak in 2016. In its annual report, Vale said its reserves in New Caledonia wouldn\u2019t be economically viable at the average nickel price over the past three years. It took a $284 million impairment charge on the operation in 2016.\u201cIf the other alternatives are exhausted and we don\u2019t find any way to permit a sustainable operation, I think our obligation is to face the question of shutting down,\u201d Mr. Schvartsman said.Write to Paul Kiernan at paul.kiernan@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-miner-vale-grows-weary-of-nickel-1501176529", "keywords": ["brazil,fabio schvartsman, metals nickel production, mining,new caledonia, nickel,nickel investments, vale, vale sa,Vale,VALE5.BR,VALE3.BR,Fabio Schvartsman,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,metals markets,commodity,financial market news,nickel markets,non-ferrous metals markets,metal ore mining,iron ore mining,copper ore,nickel ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 13:25:00", "news_title": "\u2018Unlimited\u2019 Boosts Verizon Subscribers", "content": "After losing subscribers earlier this year,             Verizon Communications Inc.        VZ 1.01%       turned things around in the second quarter. But it came at a price.In response to aggressive marketing from rival             T-Mobile US Inc.,       Verizon last year started selling wireless plans with a \u201csafety mode\u201d feature that slowed data speeds instead of charging overage fees when customers exceeded their data caps. Then, in February, the U.S.\u2019s largest wireless carrier by subscribers started selling unlimited data plans for the first time in five years.Customers responded, and the carrier added 614,000 net postpaid subscribers in the second quarter, a major improvement over the 307,000 it lost during the first three months in the year. Already, 59% of Verizon\u2019s customers have moved to an unlimited plan or one that doesn\u2019t charge overage fees.Investors cheered Verizon\u2019s results, sending shares up 7% in midday trading.Alongside the customer gains, however, is a dramatic drop in revenue from overage fees. Overage-fee revenue fell 34% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.Verizon doesn\u2019t disclose exactly how much money it makes from overage fees, but       Matt Ellis,        its finance chief, said on a call with analysts that it represents \u201ca low single-digit percentage\u201d of total service revenue, which was $15.6 billion in the quarter.\u201cDo I like losing the overage revenue?

Excluding certain items, Verizon earned 96 cents a share.During the quarter, Verizon launched its newly formed digital-media division, called Oath, after closing its purchase of Yahoo assets.

That marked the biggest jump in nearly three years. Separately, the nation\u2019s trade deficit in goods narrowed 3.7% last month as exports rose sturdily and imports fell, the agency said.Meanwhile, the Labor Department said jobless claims\u2014a measure of layoffs across the U.S.\u2014have held near four-decade lows, showing a tight labor market overall despite a rise of 10,000 in the past week to 244,000.The data boosted hopes for a strong report from the Commerce Department Friday on gross domestic product in the second quarter. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal project that GDP\u2014the broadest measure of goods and services made in the U.S.\u2014expanded at a 2.7% annual pace in April through June.After Thursday\u2019s data, some economists lifted projections to 3% and above. Such growth would be more than double the first quarter\u2019s 1.4% gain. And it would put the economy in familiar terrain. In recent years and for various reasons, output has often risen slowly at the start of the year, rebounded in the spring and then settled into firm but modest growth in the second half.\u201cThe economy is on a 2% growth path\u2026the same path it\u2019s been on since 2010,\u201d said Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Markit. \u201cThe economy is nearing full employment and so we\u2019re not going to see surges in growth because we just don\u2019t have the labor force to make that happen.\u201dSeveral factors are working in the economy\u2019s favor of late. After two years of turmoil, oil markets have stabilized. That has pushed energy companies to renew drilling, in turn stoking demand for equipment and labor.A booming stock market and rising business confidence also may have led to a modest pickup in business spending on equipment in the second quarter. Meanwhile, stronger growth in Europe and Asia are pushing up demand for U.S. goods. The weakened dollar, which makes U.S. goods cheaper globally, has also helped exports.But there are reasons for caution. Thursday\u2019s report on durable goods showed that higher demand last month was largely contained in one, volatile segment\u2014aircraft. Sales of civilian aircraft soared, reflecting better business at aircraft makers such as Boeing Co. that are benefiting from a rise in global passenger airline traffic and higher sales of jetliners.Excluding transportation, orders rose 0.2%. Sales of computers and cars fell last month, though each are up modestly overall this year compared with the same period last year.And while businesses stepped up investment in the second quarter overall, they retreated at the end of the quarter. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for spending on equipment and software, fell 0.1% after two months of solid gains.

I want to see the man eat squirrel jerky he bought at a Stuckey\u2019s in Arkansas. Commit, dude.The Atlas ($30,500 base MSRP) is a steel-bodied, seven-passenger crossover SUV, the largest and heaviest vehicle built atop VW\u2019s transverse-front-engine vehicle architecture, known as the MQB. The Atlas comes out of VW\u2019s new, $900 million assembly hall on the Chattanooga campus, part of a planned $7 billion investment in North America by 2019. The one I drove was nicely knocked together, I must say, with excellent fit and finish.The only engine currently available is VW\u2019s immortal 3.6-liter gas V6 (276 hp), bolted to an eight-speed automatic, with front-wheel drive and optional on-demand all-wheel drive. Our test vehicle was an SEL in Premium trim ($49,415, with destination charge), including big-ticket items such as 4Motion all-wheel drive, 20-inch wheels and panoramic sunroof. A version with a 2.0-liter four, front-drive only, will follow later this year.The square-shouldered Atlas lines up against popular three-row family crossovers such as the Chevy Traverse, GMC Acadia, Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander. Fortunately for the Atlas, this segment doesn\u2019t have a lot of what you would call lookers. Compared to some of these steel-bodied flower arrangements, the Atlas is a vision of purpose.Above all, the Atlas is about product, volume, moving the tin. In case you hadn\u2019t heard, VW Group has recently incurred some legal liabilities that it will be paying down for the next few years. The Atlas\u2014a high-volume crossover SUV built on fully amortized underpinnings in a low-wage state\u2014represents naught but rich, creamy profit.Which is to say, VW desperately needs cash flow from an American-spec SUV that gets quite mediocre fuel economy (19 mpg, combined) to help pay off damages from Dieselgate, which involves cheating on emissions. That makes my head hurt.You know who\u2019s delirious with joy at the sight of the Atlas? VW dealers, whose collective misery in the wake of the scandal would make a really good Broadway musical called \u201cScrewed!\u201d Not only does the Atlas fill in gigantic product white space, it changes the topic of conversation.A subject for M.B.A. seminars of the future is American consumers\u2019 remarkable clemency toward VW as a brand, notwithstanding the roughly half-million wildly pissed off victims of Dieselgate who will never darken its door again. In 2016, VW\u2019s annus terribilis, brand sales in the U.S. were off only about 7%.The Atlas is not, fair to say, revolutionary car-building. It takes VW\u2019s modular architecture\u2014the sideways-mounted engine and transmission, front axles and auxiliaries in front of the firewall\u2014to places it has been before, in vehicles such as the Tiguan compact SUV. The dash module (including LCD instrument panel, steering column, center-stack touch screen, HVAC vents, plumbing and controls, air bags) is freshly modern but conspicuously carlike, even a bit dwarfed in the Atlas\u2019s cavernous cabin.Still, the innards look pretty nice, retaining a bit of German premium-ness as compared to the domestics\u2019 interiors. The Atlas\u2019s app-driven, 8-inch central touch screen\u2014commanding connectivity, entertainment and navigation functions\u2014is bright, fast and works effortlessly. Between the seats, in a console with two gigantic cupholders, is a stubby shift selector that could have come out of a sport compact. Near at hand is the (optional) all-wheel-drive-mode selector, with special mapping for snow and loose terrain. The Atlas\u2019s crisp, substantial switchgear (window and locking controls, switches, column stalks) is typical of the VW Group parts bin, and it\u2019s good stuff.When it comes to the chassis, the MQB\u2019s usual suspension array (struts in front, multi-links in rear) delivers driving behavior that is blandly competent and composed, but no more. The power steering feel is light, strongly boosted for ease of low-speed maneuvering, but at highway speeds it\u2019s just a tiller. The suspension occasionally runs out of leverage trying to contain the Atlas\u2019s raised mass (4,728 pounds on Car and Driver\u2019s scales) and high center of gravity (27.5 inches, also according to C&D) so it\u2019s easy to provoke body roll.In performance, the Atlas team was content with being merely competitive against the segment, and I think that\u2019s fine. Zero-to-60 mph acceleration (8 seconds) matters less than maximum towing capacity (5,000 pounds). Likewise with content: The Atlas offers a competitively priced spread of optional driver-assistance functions, including autonomous collision-avoidance braking, which tops my list. Also included in the SEL\u2019s package is the parking assist, which stitches together video from several cameras to simulate a bird\u2019s-eye view.Most of all, the Atlas does an exquisite job of being soft. VW conducted extensive market research into the vehicle preferences of American SUV buyers. Based on this analysis, VW\u2019s chassis engineers tuned the Atlas to ride and handle like a turgid water bed.And yet, by a quirk of its own expedience\u2014putting a big SUV body on a car\u2019s mechanical platform\u2014the Atlas is able to offer American customers the thing that they actually covet most in three-row family trucksters: room.The Atlas\u2019s interior is comparably vast, almost improbably spacious, especially the front cabin around the broad driver\u2019s, um, throne. If I had the butt that did justice to that seat, I would definitely avoid tennis whites.\u2018The Atlas offers American customers the thing that they covet most: room.\u2019The second and third-row seating areas are also Checker Cab-like in their spaciousness. If you are transporting a high school basketball team, the Atlas\u2019s mid- and rear-seat legroom will look like a problem solved. Moreover, the mid-row bench seats (heated, ventilated, 60/40 split fold-down) tilt and slide forward easily, with a single lever pull, making third-row entry almost as easy as it is in a minivan. Parents, please note: The mid-row seats can fully forward-retract even with a baby car seat in place. That. Is. Huge.Finally, both second and third-row seats fold forward to form a wide flat floor and cargo area of 97 cubic feet behind the front seats.Such acute market research as produced the Atlas constitutes nothing less than a portrait of the intended audience, a mirror of industrial design. We\u2019re a big people, with big beverages, and large feet, apparently. And we\u2019ll forgive just about anybody for the right price on a family SUV.You, me, VW? We\u2019ve all come to look for America.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/2018-vw-atlas-suv-a-german-vision-of-americas-dream-car-1501175778", "keywords": ["Volkswagen,VOW.XE,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,reviews,motor vehicles,passenger cars,sports utility vehicles,automotive"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 13:00:00", "news_title": "Hanging Nude Paintings in Your Home: So Out, They\u2019re In", "content": "MY LATE FATHER was a doctor who dabbled in life drawing. He loved the human body. During my childhood, plenty of nude art decorated our suburban Chicago home, including a large lithograph by Swiss artist Hans Erni that hung in my parents\u2019 bedroom.The print depicted a naked man crouching over a woman who wore only a dreamy expression. \u201cBelieve it or not, it was hanging over your father\u2019s fireplace when I met him,\u201d my mother recalled recently. \u201cWe used to stare at it and wonder, \u2018Before or after?\u2019 \u201dA lot of people in the 1960s and \u201970s, my formative decades, considered nudes socially progressive. My parents respected the frank sexual references in Freud, Picasso and \u201cPortnoy\u2019s Complaint.\u201d In those heady days of wine and roach clips, they were not alone.And today? After falling out of style for years\u2014sensitivities ran higher over the perceived objectification of women; reserved minimalism dominated d\u00e9cor\u2014naked folks are so out they\u2019re arguably in. As the pendulum swings toward maximalism, a look characterized by a profusion of pattern and design exhibitionism, the candid expressiveness of nudes seems fresh.The decision to hang one in your home, however, is still fraught for many.       Mary Crowder Spears,        29, attended graduate school for American literature with a focus on women\u2019s and gender studies. She thought twice before installing female-nude portraits\u2014one painted by a male artist, one anonymous\u2014in her Philadelphia living room. Was she supporting the exploitation of women, promoting \u201cthe male gaze\u201d? Ms. Spears, who owns the vintage fashion and design boutique Millay, ultimately decided \u201cno\u201d: She was attracted to the imperfect bodies in the paintings. \u201cThey celebrate any woman,\u201d she said.\u2018One designer offsets crisp right angles with the curves of female nudes.\u2019More than once, New York designer       Vicente Wolf       has set out to hang clients\u2019 nudes in living rooms and heard the cry, \u201cNo, no, the kids will see that!\u201d Indeed, many people still cache their nudes in bedrooms and bathrooms, a move New York architect       Calvin Tsao       considers clich\u00e9d. He talked a client out of displaying some not particularly provocative male-nude photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe in the bedroom. \u201cIf you\u2019re squeamish and not proud to expose a piece, don\u2019t buy it,\u201d he advised. The photos hang in the living room.Still other professionals insist that clients are not prudish, arguing that the painted, drawn or sculpted figure\u2014with or without clothes\u2014has simply gone out of style. The trend is for \u201ccontemporary art and its more abstract imagery,\u201d said New York designer       Jamie Drake.       Ms. Spears acknowledged that, for her generation, progressive artwork isn\u2019t figurative: \u201cIt\u2019s bold, abstract and super minimalist.\u201d She characterized the nudes she hung so hesitantly as \u201cfrumpy.\u201dDesigner       Todd Nickey,        who sells art in his Los Angeles (and, soon, New York) shop,       Nickey Kehoe,        said of the relative absence of the human figure in d\u00e9cor: \u201cAn antidote will follow.\u201d The return of exuberant color and layered pattern may help turn the tide, especially as old-school painted nudes have taken on a quaint quality after the deluge of undressed humans in         Abercrombie and Fitch               catalogs, web porn and HBO series. \u201cI see plenty of nudity on \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 \u201d said design historian Steven Heller, co-author of the coming Rizzoli book \u201cHead to Toe: The Nude in Graphic Design.\u201dChicago designer Sean Cowan disputes the notion that nudes and minimalist d\u00e9cor don\u2019t mix. He uses the curves of female nudes to offset crisp right angles in his own home. Mr. Wolf, too, champions the use of nudes, male or female, in any style of setting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful, beautiful form,\u201d he said. The Cuban-born designer suggests a series of photos by a single artist with a strong compositional sense, like Hungarian-born Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz.When Los Angeles designer       Isabelle Dahlin       remodeled a home in Los Feliz, Calif., she found a moody portrait of a bare-breasted woman in her clients\u2019 collection. The oil painting went between the nobby spindles of a four-poster, on a busily papered wall in a guest room (pictured above). The work, she said, was a refreshing departure from the craft-based art pieces she had been dealing with: \u201cIf I have to see another macram\u00e9 wall hanging, I\u2019m going to kill myself.\u201dThe couple is now expecting a girl.

They\u2019re down about 20% from their highs earlier this year after the lender put behind it a major litigation threat and then embarked on a successful \u20ac8 billion capital raise.On Thursday, Deutsche Bank executives again faced questions from analysts about how much more investment-banking market share the bank might lose to rivals. Shares continued to fall after an early-afternoon conference call. On that call, Chief Executive Officer       John Cryan       said strategic changes are \u201cstarting to bear fruit\u201d but warned that a lot of work remains.The German lender said net income was \u20ac466 million ($546.8 million), compared with \u20ac20 million for the same period a year earlier. But investors focused more on Deutsche Bank\u2019s companywide revenues, which declined a worse-than-expected 10% from the year-ago period, to \u20ac6.6 billion.Also on Thursday, Deutsche Bank said it reached an agreement with 11 mostly former senior executives who will voluntarily forfeit \u20ac38.4 million ($45 million) in frozen bonus payments. That amounts to more than half of the almost \u20ac70 million in bonuses the bank froze while it investigated whether the executives, including former co-CEOs       Anshu Jain       and       J\u00fcrgen Fitschen       and former CEO       Josef Ackermann,        could be held personally liable for legal and other costs tied to activities when they served as management-board members.Deutsche Bank said its supervisory board found \u201cinsufficient factual and legal basis\u201d to pursue such claims. The individuals voluntarily waived the unpaid bonuses and believe they upheld their duties as Deutsche Bank executives, the bank\u2019s statement said. The individuals declined to comment or couldn\u2019t be reached.Investors want to see Deutsche Bank prove it can cut its workforce, expenses and overall risk-taking without further weakening its moneymaking engines.But its biggest division, investment banking, posted worse-than-expected revenue declines last quarter in most key areas, from securities trading to trade financing.Expectations for the quarter were modest, with analysts projecting Deutsche Bank to manage a narrow profit of about \u20ac169 million, according to consensus estimates of 12 analysts compiled by the bank.Dismal results in the bank\u2019s huge trading division show it remains hobbled in the business it has long depended on most for profits. Overall trading revenue across debt, interest-rate products, currencies and equities was down 18% last quarter.The fixed-income piece of that business\u2014the most important for Deutsche Bank\u2014performed roughly in line with big U.S. rivals during what was broadly a rough quarter for debt trading. Deutsche Bank\u2019s fixed-income trading revenue was down 12%.But unlike those U.S. banks, Deutsche Bank failed to get a bump from clients\u2019 stock-trading. The German bank\u2019s equities-trading revenue fell 28% from a year earlier. Not enough hedge funds and other clients have come back to the bank after a rocky 2016 to generate the volume of business it had a year ago, according to the bank. And the clients who have returned aren\u2019t paying enough fees to make up for the exodus.Mr. Cryan said \u201cmuted client activity in many of the capital markets\u201d hurt the lender. Net revenue was down 16% in investment banking, which includes deal-advising, securities issuance and trading. In the private and retail-banking unit, net revenue fell 7%. Asset-management revenue fell 4%, but that division earned higher performance fees and would have shown a 7% revenue rise excluding a one-time accounting charge last year, Deutsche Bank said.The lender said clients continued to return to Deutsche Bank last quarter, bringing \u20ac9 billion in net inflows across the retail and private bank, wealth management and asset management. This time last year, clients were pulling money and business from the bank over concerns about big legal charges and its capital cushion.The lender is going through its second major restructuring in less than two years, recombining its investment bank and trading divisions and folding in a German retail-banking business, Postbank, that it had intended to sell. It is now integrating Postbank and has closed hundreds of bank branches as part of broader cost-cutting moves.Deutsche Bank brought on a new chief financial officer, former             Citigroup Inc.       Treasurer       James von Moltke,        who started this month. Ex-banker-turned-finance-chief       Marcus Schenck       is now overseeing the recombined investment bank along with trading-unit chief       Garth Ritchie.Mr. Cryan and his management team are under pressure to rejuvenate Deutsche Bank\u2019s lagging revenues after raising \u20ac8 billion in capital from shareholders earlier this year.Citigroup Inc. analysts called Thursday\u2019s results \u201clow-quality,\u201d because cost-cutting benefits can\u2019t keep making up for lagging performance, and Deutsche Bank hasn\u2019t proven it can revive revenue as much as investors expected.The bank said it cut head count by almost 4,700 employees from a year ago, to 96,652 full-time workers, as of the end of June. Its noninterest expenses last year were down 15% from a year ago.Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-banks-second-quarter-profit-rises-but-revenue-falls-1501133695", "keywords": ["deutsche bank, earnings, european banks, second quarter earnings,Deutsche Bank,DBK.XE,DB,120Deutsche Bank,XE:DBK,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,earnings surprises,management,corporate,industrial news,corporate restructuring,executive pay,banking,commercial banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,integrated banks,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 12:53:00", "news_title": "CFTC Nominees Vow to Finish Derivatives Rule, Disagree on Details", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The three nominees for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission promised to complete a long-delayed rule on position limits in derivative markets, though the two Republicans and one Democrat made clear they disagreed on the specifics.The nominees\u2014Republicans Dawn Stump and Brian Quintenz and Democrat Russ Behnam\u2014received little pushback from members of the Senate Agriculture Committee at Thursday\u2019s hearing, and the committee\u2019s top Republican and Democrat said they were eager to move quickly to confirm the nominees and restore the commission to full strength. The five-seat commission currently has only two members, one of whom plans to step down.While all three nominees voiced support for finalizing the rule on position limits\u2014meant to limit speculation in commodities such as oil and gold\u2014the Republican nominees both argued in favor of robust exemptions to any rule.\u201cIt\u2019s important to allow market participants to continue to hedge as they historically have,\u201d said Mr. Quintenz, a former congressional staffer and commodities fund manager, noting the nonspeculative need for market participants to manage risk. Ms. Stump, a former derivatives lobbyist and Senate staffer, agreed.Mr. Behnam said a hedge exemption was necessary for some end-users but put more emphasis on the need to finish a workable rule.At the end of the Obama administration, the CFTC punted on a proposed position limits rule that would have capped the size of trading positions firms could take in more than two dozen core commodity contracts, including a variety of energy and precious-metals commodities, to curb any one trader\u2019s influence. The proposal would have restricted a firm from owning more than the equivalent of 25% of a commodity\u2019s estimated \u201cdeliverable supply\u201d in a given month.Despite differences on issues like position limits and exemptions for certain swap dealers, members of the Senate Agriculture Committee voiced broad support for the nominees and for filling all five seats on the CFTC.The commission now has two members, Acting Chairman       J. Christopher Giancarlo,        a Republican, and Commissioner Sharon Bowen, a Democrat. However, Ms. Bowen has announced her intent to step down within the next few months, and has urged the Senate to move forward on a full slate of four commissioner nominees to get the committee to full strength. The Senate has also yet to move on Mr. Giancarlo\u2019s nomination to be chairman. He passed the Agriculture Committee by a 16-5 vote in June.Michigan Sen.       Debbie Stabenow,        the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said she was eager to move forward with a bipartisan four-nominee slate once Ms. Bowen\u2019s successor is nominated by the White House.\u201cOnce we receive a nominee, I look forward to working with you to move quickly through the process to seat a full commission,\u201d she said in her opening statement at Thursday\u2019s hearing. She later said that she would be \u201cpleased to support\u201d the three nominees who testified on Thursday.Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R, Kan.) quipped that \u201chopefully soon we can have a full commission in I don\u2019t know how many years.\u201d The last time the CFTC had five commissioners was in 2014.Write to Gabriel T.

I focus here on the tendency to equate white with expertise at higher levels of education and the labor force, in the West as well as in Asia.In American universities, studies have shown that female and ethnic-minority instructors are given lower performance ratings by male and female students of all races. In Singapore\u2019s multicultural universities, even white male faculty acknowledge that a white premium exists, with white professors, especially men, receiving higher teaching evaluations from Asian students.Asian executive-education participants at major U.S. business schools are sometimes overtly racist in response to teaching faculty, many of whom are Chinese, Indian or Korean. Asian executives and students want to be taught by whites, and to study with whites in class. They express disappointment when they perceive there are too many Asians in both faculty and student ranks.My Asian students tell me that undergraduate applicants from their home countries avoid certain U.S. private universities on the East and West Coasts for this reason. Some prefer Midwestern public universities like mine that have a preponderance of whites.So where does this cult of white-male superiority originate? Dismissing it as a mere colonial hangover is too simplistic. Western colonialism disappeared from Asia more than a half-century ago, and some Asian countries that exhibit these values and behaviors\u2014for instance China, Japan and Korea\u2014were not colonized by whites.Asia\u2019s much-vaunted economic success also didn\u2019t derive from Western sources, but was led by Asian governments and business.I speculate that this adulation reflects a continued deep-seated Asian sense of inferiority to the West in one area where Western hegemony remains unchallenged\u2014the realm of ideas. This explains why elite Asian students prefer to attend second- and third-tier Western universities, or their satellite campuses in Asia, even as Asian universities climb the global rankings.In executive-education programs, Chinese and Indian companies and executives increasingly accept their own nationals as expert instructors\u2014if senior and male. But this is because these individuals have been anointed by their Western-university experience. This creates a halo effect and may diminish the modesty and lack of assertiveness that cause East Asians to be underestimated in Western-leaning contexts.Experimental psychological research by my colleague       Fiona Lee       at the University of Michigan shows that, all else being equal, both whites and Asians will choose a white person over an Asian for a leadership position in different U.S. occupational contexts, including universities and corporations. Interestingly, this anti-Asian bias disappears if the Asian in question is not stereotypically Asian and behaves like a prototypical Westerner in being gregarious, extroverted and articulate.One of my Singaporean colleagues is a recognized international expert in her field who is regularly invited to speak at top universities and international organizations. She was specifically asked by a senior executive at a major Singaporean institution to recommend non-Singaporean \u201cWesterner experts\u201d to advise them in her field of expertise.Unlike many of my nonwhite and female colleagues, I personally have not suffered more than superficial slights in my career for not being a white male. I am very used to white males both as peers (faculty colleagues) and as subordinates (students), and to being consulted as an expert by those in the media, business, think tanks and universities. To me they are no different than any other demographic. So it is disconcerting to find white privilege still pervasive, both in the U.S. and Asia.Singapore is one of the most advanced Asian economies, with plenty of international markers of its success\u2014from secondary-school test scores to university rankings. It should lead the way in overturning this economically irrational, socially inequitable and psychologically discomfiting notion that whites are experts and experts are white.More attention to a wider array of experts, including our own native talent, will lead to better advice and greater self-confidence, as befits an independent, accomplished and meritocratic nation in this supposed \u201cAsian century.\u201dMs. Lim is a Singaporean business professor at the University of Michigan.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/asian-students-still-idolize-western-professors-1501173242", "keywords": [" asia, discrimination, education, racism,singapore, white privilege,political,general news,society,community,discrimination,education,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,racism,social issues,university,college,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 12:33:00", "news_title": "New York Times Sees Jump in Digital Advertising Revenue ", "content": "New York Times Co.        NYT -1.42%       reported a jump in digital advertising revenue in the second quarter, boosting its top line 9.2% even as digital subscriber additions fell off somewhat from the record pace of the last quarter.Digital advertising rose 22.5% to $55.2 million, or nearly 42% of total company ad revenue, compared with 34.3% of total ad revenue in the year-earlier quarter. The gains in digital ad revenue came primarily from smartphone, programmatic and branded content, more than compensating for declines in traditional website display advertising.The gains also more than offset the 10.5% decline in print advertising revenue, which lost ground in such categories as luxury, real estate, technology, telecommunications and travel, reflecting ongoing industrywide declines in print.Overall advertising rose 0.8% to $132.2 million, the first increase in total advertising revenue since the third quarter of 2014, said the company.The Times reported 93,000 net additions of digital news subscribers, a solid performance but a slowdown from the 308,000 additions in the first quarter. The Times is one of many publications that has benefited from interest in political news coverage surrounding the administration of President       Donald Trump.\u201cAs we indicated in our last earnings call, we see a moderation in the rate of new subscription additions since the two previous exceptional quarters,\u201d said       Mark Thompson,        chief executive of New York Times Co., in a call with investors.Mr. Thompson noted that digital subscription revenue overtook print advertising revenue for the first time in the quarter.Digital subscriptions together with a 2017 increase in home-delivery prices for the print paper lifted total subscription revenue 13.9% to $250 million in the quarter and offset a drop in print copies sold.Overall revenue for the second quarter increased to $407.1 million from $372.6 million in the year-earlier quarter.The company reported a profit of $15.6 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of $211,000 in the same quarter a year earlier. Adjusted diluted earnings were 18 cents a share, compared with 11 cents a share in the second quarter of 2016.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected adjusted earnings of 14 cents a share on revenue of $393.9 million.New York Times shares were up 4% in late morning trading.The improvement in digital subscriptions and advertising sales also helped offset severance charges of $19.3 million in the second quarter related to a recent round of buyouts intended to accelerate the company\u2019s push to reinvent its newsroom for digital publishing.In a recent federal filing, the company said that the savings generated by the restructuring would enable it to hire as many as 100 additional journalists.Josh Austin, a spokesman for the New York NewsGuild, said Wednesday that 76 buyouts of New York Times Guild members were accepted recently, including copy editors, photo editors, columnists, reporters, and senior writers. Before the buyouts, the Guild estimated that 1,100 of its 3,000 members worked at the Times.Looking ahead, the New York Times said it expects its total third quarter subscription revenue to increase at a rate similar to that of the second quarter. Total advertising revenue for the third quarter, however, is expected to decrease in the mid-to-high single digits compared with the year-earlier quarter.Write to Jeffrey A.

Ford, President       Donald Trump      said, \u201cAmerican steel and American hands have constructed a 100,000-ton message to the world: American might is second to none\u2026We will win, win, win. We will never lose.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s speech reflected his administration\u2019s emphasis on the military as the primary instrument of U.S. foreign policy. He has delegated broad powers to his military commanders while sidelining the State Department and proposing deep cuts to foreign aid. As a former Marine, I loved seeing a new aircraft carrier commissioned. But as I listened to Mr. Trump, I recalled a lesson from my service in Iraq a decade ago: Feeling strong and being strong are often two very different things.I vividly remember one particular mission in which we searched four compounds for \u201chigh-value\u201d insurgents. It was the heady stuff of recruiting commercials\u2014heavily armed Marines riding helicopters into lawless terrain in the dead of night. The raid was a success, and when we landed back on base at 5 a.m., we felt great, high on testosterone and adrenaline.But I soon began to wonder if this was the best we could do with our superior technology and troops. More than 60 Marines, backed by assault helicopters and fighter planes, just to capture a few Iraqi farmers who had taken potshots at other Marines a few weeks earlier?Later in my deployment, I joined a small group of Marines to talk to some sheikhs who lived along a U.S. resupply route that was riddled with explosive devices. We tried to map the road out in one- or two-kilometer segments, identifying which local leaders held their communities\u2019 respect. With various rewards and punishments as our tools, we worked with them to reduce the number of roadside bombs.The second mission lacked the action-movie excitement of helicopters whisking away bad guys under cover of darkness. But what feels effective is often different from what is effective. Winning the support of local leaders was a key part of the counterinsurgency strategies forged by such commanders as       David Petraeus       and       H.R. McMaster       (now Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser). These low-key efforts buttressed the pulse-pounding raids\u2014and made Iraq a safer place for several years before the U.S. troop pullout that ended in 2011.This problem\u2014the gap between the exciting and the effective\u2014is particularly relevant today. Mr. Trump\u2019s affection for firepower is reflected in his administration\u2019s budget proposals and overall attitude toward diplomacy. He has suggested raising military spending by $54 billion, up some 10%, and cutting such soft-sounding programs as \u201ceconomic support funds\u201d and \u201cdevelopment assistance.\u201d That means slashing the budget of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development and related organizations by $17 billion, or about 32%.Such a shift in priorities may feel strong, and with plenty of problems here at home, many Americans think that we should not spend dollars abroad. But relying so completely on the military is a formula for disengagement that will make the U.S. less secure\u2014and put at risk the lives of American soldiers forced to deploy without our country\u2019s full array of resources behind them.In the 20th century, U.S. strategists worried about strong states. In the 21st century, Mr. Trump and his advisers will find themselves forced to focus instead on weak states, which destabilize regions, foment terrorism and spread misery as they crumble. For dealing with the likes of Yemen, Mali, Afghanistan and Libya, the best tools are not drone strikes and sanctions. The U.S. can do far more to bolster them with diplomacy, aid and the private sector.\u2018Helping weak states to prevent conflict costs far less in American blood and treasure than intervention after they collapse. \u2019Helping such states to prevent or limit conflict costs far less in American blood and treasure than intervention after they collapse. Fragile states struggle to provide security, build institutions and find jobs for their young populations. Once they start meeting those needs, they enter a virtuous cycle that helps their neighbors too. The U.S. spent more than $2 billion and deployed 2,800 troops to stop Ebola in the weak West African states of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea\u2014but more developed African countries such as Nigeria controlled their initial outbreaks of the disease with minimal assistance.A more well-rounded national-security approach would also capitalize on America\u2019s unrivaled strengths. The world still looks to U.S. leadership in tech, education and entrepreneurship. When I travel to conflict zones such as Mali and Afghanistan now to work with local companies, I find them more eager for American partners than most of the local defense forces in Iraq ever were.The U.S. still needs to deter potential foes, of course, but the return-on-investment for the purchase of that 1,000th missile is pretty limited. A few well-spent development dollars, by contrast, can unlock 100 times more in private investment for the long-term infrastructure that provides jobs and electricity in a faltering state. The U.S. military budget is already 10 times that of our diplomatic and development efforts, which represent only 1% of the federal budget. We need to adjust that balance.A more expansive idea of how the U.S. operates abroad can also help us to deal with the challenge from China, which is adept at using its own influence in the developing world\u2014a soft-power contest with hard-power consequences. China has deployed aid and loans across Africa, winning infrastructure deals and a new military base in the strategically critical Horn of Africa. U.S. funding for such programs as AIDS relief and scholarships for African youth to attend American universities can help to counter the pull of Chinese-built stadiums and railways.\u2018The best barometer of progress available to U.S. commanders in Iraq was often how many times our forces had been hit in the past week.\u2019When the U.S. military isn\u2019t backed up by aid, diplomacy and private investment, it has a harder time identifying early signs of instability. A standard briefing during my time in Iraq would cover firefights and roadside bomb attacks and our own response with patrols and checkpoints. The best barometer of progress available to our commanders was often how many times our forces had been hit in the past week. That\u2019s hardly a complete picture of a complex modern conflict.We put our troops at a disadvantage if our approach scorns key instruments of American power. U.S. private and public engagement in developing countries isn\u2019t charity. It is a wise investment in security writ large\u2014the returns from which make it less likely that we\u2019ll need to send more Marines into harm\u2019s way.\u2014Mr. Cusack served as a sniper-platoon commander and intelligence officer with the U.S. Marine Corps in Iraq from 2005 to 2008.

", "content": "YOU MAY NOT have heard of a yacon, but pay attention. This Andean tuber could be big.If you\u2019ve ever eaten a kiwi or a kale salad, you\u2019ve already surfed a produce wave. But there\u2019s a new urgency to fruit and vegetable trends as a tight restaurant economy makes it more important than ever for a chef to stand out. Savvy customers want produce that\u2019s intriguing, surprising, delicious and, if possible, wildly nutritious\u2014not only at restaurants and stores but on our doorsteps, as grocery-delivery services such as FreshDirect expand the market.On the local level, veteran southern California farmer       Alex Weiser       plants what he calls \u201cdevelopment crops\u201d\u2014seasonal items that a chef might audition on his menu\u2014to see if they warrant more acreage. On a much larger scale, companies like Los Angeles-based Frieda\u2019s Specialty Produce scour the globe for fruits and vegetables that might come from nearby or from South America, because supermarket clients want variety year-round.Karen Caplan,        CEO of the 55-year-old Frieda\u2019s, has never seen anything like the current scramble for marquee produce. \u201cInformation travels at the speed of light\u201d in the Instagram era, she said. The next big thing gets a lot more exposure, and faces a lot more competition.The new star could be a tomato called the datterino\u2014Italian for little date\u2014that Pennsylvania farmer       Chris Field       brings to New York\u2019s Union Square Greenmarket every Friday. \u201cWe can\u2019t grow enough,\u201d said Mr. Field, considering a near-empty crate only an hour after the market opened.Or it could be a happy fluke like the Stokes purple sweet potato that Frieda\u2019s distributes. Its debut happened to coincide with the popular Blue Zone diet; though the regimen promotes the health benefits of a different variety of purple sweet potato, the Stokes benefited from the association.Yet for every lucky crop there\u2019s a story of unmet potential. Remember kale sprouts, aka lollipop kale or kalettes? Back in 2013, this hybrid of kale and Brussels sprouts was touted as the next kale\u2014the biggest produce-marketing success story in recent memory\u2014but wasn\u2019t.On a postcard Sunday morning in Santa Monica, Calif., Mr. Weiser presides over his family\u2019s stand at the farmers\u2019 market in a well-worn \u201cLife is Good\u201d T-shirt. Conversations with customers invigorate him. Chatting with a couple of chefs, he learned about the yacon, the aforementioned Andean tuber, which he now cultivates alongside other newcomers at his farm at the base of the Tehachapi Mountains. The versatile vegetable \u201ctastes like a combo of celery and apple raw, and cooked, it gets sweeter,\u201d said Mr. Weiser. He\u2019ll give the early yield to the chefs who told him about it, to see what kind of response they get from diners.Collaborations between chefs and small farmers sometimes hinge on matching produce to the appropriate microclimate.       Evan Funke,        chef-partner at Felix Trattoria in Venice, Calif., handed out chicory seeds to Mr. Weiser and a few other farmers, to make sure he has a constant supply of the bitter green as the seasons shift. He\u2019s a one-man chicory trendmaker: When the crops hit, there will be enough not only for him but for other local chefs.Kong Thao,        who has a farm in Fresno, Calif., is going to grow a thin-skinned Italian pepper called Jimmy Nardello for Mr. Funke, as is Mr. Weiser. Once the peppers hit the market, Mr. Thao expects word of mouth to expand his customer base. \u201cChefs try something, people see it on the menu, they want to buy it and try it at home,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if a chef\u2019s here buying something and another chef\u2019s standing nearby, they have a conversation\u2014and the second chef tries it too.\u201dThe same synergy informs the East Coast market.       Greg Vernick,        who won this year\u2019s James Beard Foundation award for Best Chef, Mid-Atlantic Region, said that his menu at Vernick Food & Drink in Philadelphia emphasizes vegetables because so many people, himself included, are eating more of them (or feel they should be). He\u2019s always on the hunt for novel produce.Like most people, Mr. Vernick thought of kohlrabi as a fall vegetable\u2014until he found some in June at the local farmers market. The summer strains were tasty and easy to work with, Mr. Vernick found\u2014the right combination for a potential trend. \u201cIt\u2019s not like an artichoke, where you do all this work to get a quarter cup of vegetable,\u201d said Mr. Vernick. His kohlrabi slaw recipe, at right, combines the zesty bulb, cut into matchsticks, with cabbage, corn, tomatoes and strawberries.The back-and-forth among farmer, chef and market customer means more variety, and more candidates for fame. When Mr. Thao first came to the Santa Monica market 21 years ago he had about 15 crops to sell, including Chinese long beans, most of which went back on the truck at the end of the day. Now he grows about 300 produce varieties, and a bigger harvest of Chinese long beans frequently sells out in the first hour.\u2018The back-and-forth among farmer, chef and market customer means more variety.\u2019On the national level, big distributors take a more strategic approach to trend-building, selecting candidates that satisfy two additional criteria: volume and a decent shelf life. \u201cJackfruit\u2019s the hottest,\u201d said Ms. Caplan of Frieda\u2019s Produce, who likens its flavor to \u201cJuicy Fruit gum\u201d and describes it as \u201cbig as a toddler.\u201d It doesn\u2019t spoil quickly, it\u2019s unusual enough to appeal to a retailer who wants to stand out, and it works raw and cooked, frozen or canned. It also has a demographic advantage, coming from Asia: The Asian population is the fastest-growing in the U.S.None of which was sufficient to make a shopper take a chance on an $80 whole jackfruit. Ms. Caplan said shoppers will spend about five dollars to try a new fruit or vegetable. So Frieda\u2019s created a label to introduce the new item and got retailers to sell cut segments for a fraction of an entire jackfruit\u2019s cost.As with any trend, there can be backlash. Chef       Missy Robbins       of Lilia, in Brooklyn, said that over the last couple of seasons she saw versions of the same dish everywhere: \u201ccarrots, roasted, with some seeds and yogurt.\u201d Instead, she used thinly sliced raw carrots in a salad with feta and boquerones. For years she embraced springtime peas and fava beans, an annual rite at New York restaurants. \u201cPeas come in, people do them with everything; favas come in, people do them with everything,\u201d she said. She\u2019s over it.\u201cPeas and favas don\u2019t excite me the way they used to,\u201d she said. Vegetables have moved to the center of the plate, from the cauliflower steaks that have been so popular in recent years to Ms. Robbins\u2019s own hearty, boldly flavored broccolini salad (recipe at right). \u201cI like a vegetable you can eat as a meal, and people want that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trend.\u201dAppeared in the July 29, 2017, print edition as 'Growing Fashionable.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/have-you-tried-this-seasons-it-vegetables-1501172181", "keywords": ["best slaw recipe,best vegetables,broccolini recipe,escarole recipe,in season now,jimmy nardello,kohlrabi recipe,produce trends,summer kohlrabi,summer produce recipes,summer vegetarian main dish recipes,vegetable recipes,yacon,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 12:16:00", "news_title": "Spain Has a Debt Problem and So Now It Has a Zorro Problem ", "content": "VALENCIA, Spain\u2014      Antonio S\u00e1nchez       recently came to a dispiriting conclusion about his professional future. Spain isn\u2019t big enough for two debt collectors who dress up like Zorro.His troubles began one day in the Spanish city of Valladolid. Mr. S\u00e1nchez was at the wheel of the Zorro-branded car he would use to drop by unannounced\u2014in full Zorro costume\u2014to the homes and businesses of debtors he\u2019d been hired to confront and to shame into paying up.He pulled alongside another vehicle that, to his astonishment, also sported an image of the fictitious 19th-century masked crusader. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, dude?\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez recalls saying.This chance meeting in Valladolid marks the moment Mr. S\u00e1nchez learned there was another company using masked Zorros to collect debts in Spain. \u201cNeither of us knew about the other,\u201d he said.The Zorros parted ways amicably that day after sharing a beer, but it was only a matter of time before these competing crusaders-for-hire would cross swords.Chasing money in Spain is an expensive and slow process. So for decades, Spaniards have tried another way: humiliating debtors with attention-grabbing stunts. If somebody is being pursued by a man carrying a briefcase while dressed as a monk or a bullfighter, most Spaniards assume that person hasn\u2019t paid their bills.Though Spain\u2019s economy is improving, there is still a lot of debt unpaid. In the first quarter of this year, 71% of money owed to companies was late for payment, according to the Spanish Confederation of Small and Medium Enterprises.Because these costumed nuisance-makers get to keep between 20% and 60% of the money they collect from businesses and individuals, the spoils can be substantial. So substantial, in fact, that competing firms sometimes find themselves in court, too.Last year, a company called El Zorro Cobro de Morosos took legal action against Mr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s employer, El Zorro Cobrador\u2014successfully claiming it holds exclusive rights to the use of Zorro in debt collecting because it had registered the brand and the logo with the Spanish Patents and Trademarks Office in 1994. The other Zorro firm said it registered a month later.\u201cThey were using that name improperly,\u201d said an employee at El Zorro Cobro de Morosos, who declined to be named.The story may not end there, however. The Zorro who laughs last laughs best\u2014and that Zorro might be Zorro Productions Inc. of Berkeley, Calif. The firm owns the rights to       Johnston McCulley\u2019s       original character and leases the Zorro trademark for movies, jewelry, ice cream parlors, household d\u00e9cor and even robotic machinery. \u201cThey cannot do it,\u201d said       John Gertz,        the company\u2019s president and chief executive.Mr. Gertz, who was baffled to learn about the Spanish Zorros, said he is now gathering more information about the matter. Using Zorro\u2019s likeness to hunt down debtors could hurt the character\u2019s reputation as a defender of the poor, he said.The employee at El Zorro Cobro de Morosos said they\u2019ve never sought to use the brand internationally.Meanwhile, El Zorro Cobrador has rebranded to El Coyote Cobrador, or The Coyote Collector, mimicking a novel and comic-book character of the same name, itself inspired by Zorro. Mr. S\u00e1nchez and his five costumed colleagues at the Valencia-based firm are doing business as usual, but had to scrap their old uniforms that spelled \u201cEl Zorro\u201d and order new, similar-looking ones.The firm has also set up different companies that rent out other characters, including the Clown Collector and Roman Collection, where centurions show up. In the Basque Country, where there is a strong nationalist drive, it deploys a collector dressed in traditional regional attire. Different brands \u201callow us to be our own competition and gain market share,\u201d said the owner, who goes by       Jes\u00fas Cano,        a pseudonym he said he uses in business to protect himself.Juan Jos\u00e9 de Diego,        who runs a different company, was among the first to use a costume, donning the habit of a Franciscan monk to chase delinquent debtors some 30 years ago.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 16% to $2.73 billion, Vale said.But Vale, which is located thousands of miles away from its main iron-ore market in China, suffered from sharply higher freight costs in the April-to-June period. Its derivatives on commodities, currencies and interest rates, after bringing in a hefty profit a year earlier, produced a loss in the second quarter, as did currency fluctuations.Vale also recorded asset write-downs of $414 million related to discontinued operations, such as fertilizer assets sold in December in exchange for shares of             The Mosaic Co.      , which fell during the second quarter.The company\u2019s preferred shares traded in S\u00e3o Paulo were recently up 0.6% at 28.12 Brazilian reais ($8.91).Mr. Schvartsman said he expects better results from Vale in the third quarter, as iron ore prices so far have exceeded the $62.90-per-ton average in the second quarter.

The result is a showhouse-worthy property that is part innovations lab and part marketing kit to show potential clients what a construction company can accomplish.While real-estate agents urge people who build their own homes not to include too many oddball amenities, builders are proud of the extreme features they include in their own abodes. In Lubbock, Texas, for example, custom builder Robert Wood completed a 5,200-square-foot house for himself and his wife in 2015 that includes seven ovens.The house, which cost roughly $1.3 million to build, is constructed around a courtyard that has a pool and an outdoor dining area. An indoor/outdoor stainless-steel kitchen with four ovens is separated from the courtyard by a retractable glass wall. The ovens come in handy when Mr. Wood and his wife, Candace, entertain their friends and host charity events. (The home\u2019s main kitchen has three additional ovens.)\u201cThe courtyard feel is the No. 1 thing I wanted to try,\u201d says Mr. Wood, who says he got the idea from homes in Palm Springs, Calif. An enclosed courtyard ensures privacy, he adds, and orients the view away from the arid West Texas landscape. Though the home has three outdoor spaces, the intimate courtyard \u201cis by far the one we use the most,\u201d says Mr. Wood, 54.What builders consider worthy of including\u2014or excluding\u2014from their personal homes can be revealing.The features deemed \u201cessential\u201d by buyers who earn over $150,000 a year are relatively common comforts, such as laundry rooms and ceiling fans, plus basic \u201cgreen\u201d features such as Energy Star appliances and energy-efficient windows, according to the results of a 2017 National Association of Home Builders survey of buyers\u2019 home preferences.But luxury builders tend to have much higher standards for what constitutes an environmentally friendly home. Some invest small fortunes in the latest energy-efficient heating systems, weather resistant materials and building techniques that minimize energy loss.Luxury-home builder Arnold Karp spent $175,000 on a geothermal heating and cooling system in his new $2.7 million contemporary home in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Karp, 57, knows that even if his system slashes his utility bills dramatically, it may not pay for itself. But nonetheless, it\u2019s still a great marketing tool for potential clients.\u201cIt helps sell the house to \u2018green\u2019 and \u2018non-green\u2019 buyers who care about operating costs and the environment,\u201d says Mr. Karp.Contractors are often able to rationalize high upfront spending because they use their own homes as both testing grounds for new technologies and as showcases they can take potential clients through to help close a deal. But it\u2019s a two-way street: They are also able to use clients\u2019 experiences to inform their choices. Mr. Karp knew to stay away from a complicated, multi-device, iPad-controlled \u201csmart home\u201d technology system because he has fielded so many complaints about them from customers.\u201cEverybody calls me two hours before the Super Bowl to tell me their fancy technology is not working,\u201d says Mr. Karp, who is president of Karp Associates in New Canaan, Conn. Both Mr. Karp and Mr. Daniels, having heard such gripes, made sure their systems had buttons on walls that even young children could use without help.And some builders\u2019 clever features don\u2019t win over all clients. Mr. Daniels\u2019 \u201cdog room\u201d has stone floors and baseboards, and the doors are lined with Plexiglas so the dogs can\u2019t damage them with scratches. It leads to the backyard and has a shower, so muddy paws can be quickly cleaned.\u201cIf clients have a dog, they think it\u2019s amazing,\u201d says Mr. Daniels. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, they think I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d he cracked.These builders say they don\u2019t take advantage of cheap labor in building their homes. \u201cI\u2019d rather pay than owe people favors,\u201d says Mr. Karp. They say they pay their subcontractors\u2014electricians, plumbers and other tradesmen\u2014full freight, in the interest of maintaining good relationships with people who are key to their success in business.\u201cI would sell my house if someone offered me a big price. Then I would have to face them,\u201d which would be uncomfortable if he had demanded cheap or free work, says Mr. Wood.But builders do admit to some foibles familiar to anyone who has built their own home. Mr. Daniels\u2019 perfectionism comes with a high price tag: The ceiling in the screened-in porch is made from reclaimed wood from a barn in Wisconsin, he says. Each board needed to be sized, squared, cut and installed, adding to labor costs.Builders aren\u2019t immune to a version of the classic upsell: Mr. Wood said that while appliance and other hardware suppliers will often provide discounts to people in the business, in some cases he paid full fare in exchange for upgrades to the next level of luxury.More proof that when it comes to their own homes, builders are only human: Mr. Karp\u2019s budget numbers got fuzzy as he got excited about glamorous upgrades, like a Jacuzzi with a fire feature, and backlit stairs that \u201cmake it look like you\u2019re walking up a magic carpet,\u201d he said.\u201cMy original budget was $2.3 million, but we ended up at $2.7 million,\u201d says Mr. Karp.Write to Katy McLaughlin at katy.mclaughlin@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-luxury-home-builders-consider-worth-the-splurge-1501170604", "keywords": [" green homes ,home amenities,home builders,home construction , luxury homes, luxury real estate,smart homes,political,general news,living,lifestyle,luxury homes,estates,real estate,property,building construction,residential building construction,construction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 11:47:00", "news_title": "Chinese Billionaire Scales Down His Hollywood Dreams", "content": "BEIJING\u2014Chinese billionaire       Wang Jianlin       was on the verge last year of becoming the entertainment industry\u2019s newest mogul, snapping up prime media assets and setting his sights on a major Hollywood studio.But that breakthrough now seems remote with the $13 billion sale of assets by Mr. Wang\u2019s majority-owned company Dalian Wanda Group to         Sunac China Holdings Ltd.Buried in the fine print of filings related to the asset sale is the disclosure that Mr. Wang is unloading his nascent sound-stage business, known as Wanda Studios. The 30 film and TV sound stages are part of the Qingdao Movie Metropolis entertainment complex Mr. Wang was building in the seaside city of Qingdao.Once billed as a $7.4 billion project with production facilities, a studio tour, outdoor theme park, yacht club and hotels, the Qingdao Movie Metropolis was the focal point of Mr. Wang\u2019s fillmmaking ambitions.In 2013, he flew Hollywood luminaries including Leonardo DiCaprio, Nicole Kidman and       John Travolta       to Qingdao for a red-carpet launch event and vowed to make China the global center of filmmaking.Since then, however, the studio tour and theme park have been scrapped, plans for an international film festival intended to draw attention to the complex have stalled, and its original director has left.Most of the Movie Metropolis sound stages are in use mainly by Chinese film and TV production crews lured by rich incentives of up to 40% off production costs, according to a producer currently shooting there. Under the terms of the sale to Sunac, Wanda will retain a 9% stake and a management role in them. Still, for Mr. Wang it marks the surrender of a prize.A Sunac spokeswoman confirmed it would acquire the sound stages, identified as a \u201ctelevision industry park\u201d in a regulatory filing related to the acquisition. Dalian Wanda Group declined to comment on the sale.Wanda has shelved plans for further overseas acquisitions following a rebuke from the Chinese government for deals regulators view as overpriced and irrational. China has blocked state-owned banks from financing or refinancing six of Wanda\u2019s pending or completed acquisitions, with the approval of President Xi Jinping.Dalian Wanda will \u201crespond to the state\u2019s call and has decided to keep its main investment within China,\u201d Chinese financial magazine Caixin quoted Mr. Wang as saying last week.\u201cLooking forward, these recent policy changes will certainly derail many of Wang Jianlin\u2019s ambitions vis-a-vis Hollywood, at least for the short term,\u201d said Michael Berry, a professor of contemporary Chinese culture at University of California, Los Angeles.Mr. Wang was the talk of Hollywood last year after he bought U.S. entertainment company Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion. He entered talks to buy a 49% stake in             Viacom Inc.\u2019s       Paramount Pictures unit and negotiated to acquire Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Productions for $1 billion. Legendary would help Wanda become \u201cthe highest revenue-generating film business in the world,\u201d Mr. Wang predicted.But the prediction hasn\u2019t yet come true. Mr. Wang failed to merge Legendary with his other film businesses, and he didn\u2019t get the Paramount stake. Earlier this year, he couldn\u2019t close the Dick Clark deal, largely because of the Chinese government\u2019s tightening of capital outflows.Regulatory filings related to the Legendary acquisition and a presentation on it that Dalian Wanda made to prospective investors offer a glimpse into a deal that caught the attention of Chinese regulators.In January 2016, with the ink barely dry on its Legendary purchase, Dalian Wanda pursued an immediate follow-up transaction\u2014seeking $1.5 billion in financing from investors in China to help take its movie businesses public, according to the investor presentation viewed by The Wall Street Journal.Dalian Wanda planned to merge Legendary with its existing movie-production assets and list the combined entity\u2014called Wanda Pictures\u2014on a Chinese stock exchange, according to the presentation. If the new entity failed to list within one year, Dalian Wanda promised to repay investors with 15% interest, according to the presentation.To do the listing, Dalian Wanda intended to sell the combined movie-production assets to another one of its entertainment units, Wanda Film Holding Co., which was already listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange. Such transactions have become common in China with companies seeking higher asset values by tapping demand from retail investors, people familiar with the practice say.Regulatory filings made by Wanda Film in May 2016 show Legendary\u2019s liabilities exceeded its assets in 2014 and 2015, and that it reported a net loss for both years.Legendary said in a statement last week it is \u201cwell capitalized with liquidity to fund its film and TV slates.\u201dThe filings also show a net book value of $2 billion for the Wanda Pictures assets. Yet the Wanda Film unit would have paid $5.6 billion for them, based on their estimated future worth, according to the filings.Such a lofty valuation would likely draw regulators\u2019 scrutiny, said Marshall Meyer, professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School who studies Chinese companies. \u201cIf they see that the overvaluation is going to protect [a company\u2019s] own interests, they are going to put it on ice,\u201d he said.Wanda Film suspended its planned merger of film assets in August 2016, citing a change in market conditions and \u201can objective need to run [Legendary] independently for a period of time to prove the stability of its profit forecast,\u201d regulatory filings show.Christopher Balding, a professor at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen, said, \u201cRegulators sometimes are heavy-handed, but sometimes they can also smell when something stinks.\u201dWhile Chinese regulators never publicly rejected the transaction, they met with the country\u2019s big banks in June and told them Wanda is no longer allowed to inject overseas assets into its listed companies in China.This month, Wanda Film said it would try to buy media assets again as part of a reorganization. Legendary won\u2019t be part of that transaction, people familiar with the matter said.\u2014Junya Qian in Shanghai and Lilian Lin, Liyan Qi and Grace Zhu in Beijing contributed to this article.Write to Wayne Ma at wayne.ma@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Mogul\u2019s Hollywood Dream Shrinks.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/billionaire-scales-down-his-hollywood-dreams-1501170450", "keywords": ["dalian wanda group,legendary entertainment,legendary studios,leonardo decaprio,movie metropolis,qingdao,wang jianlin,who bought legendary,Dalian Wanda Group,dalian wanda,Sunac China Holdings,1918.HK,HK:1918,Wanda Media,Wang Jianlin,ownership changes,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,diversified holding companies,real estate transactions,property managers,audiovisual production,cinema film production,business,consumer services,real estate,construction,media"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 11:47:00", "news_title": "Why Jeff Sessions Recused", "content": "President       Trump       lashed out again Wednesday at       Jeff Sessions,        and his fury over the Attorney General\u2019s recusal from the Russia campaign-meddling probe may take the President down a self-destructive path. So this is a good moment to explain why Mr. Sessions felt obliged to recuse himself and why it was proper to do so.Mr. Trump seems to think Mr. Sessions recused himself in March due to a failure of political nerve after news broke that he had met with the Russian ambassador during the 2016 campaign. Mr. Sessions did recuse himself shortly after that story appeared, and the AG didn\u2019t help by forgetting to report those meetings during his confirmation hearing.But Mr. Sessions and his advisers had been considering recusal long before that story\u2014and for reasons rooted in law and Justice Department policy.After Watergate in 1978, Congress passed a law requiring \u201cthe disqualification of any officer or employee of the Department of Justice, including a United States attorney or a member of such attorney\u2019s staff, from participation in a particular investigation or prosecution if such participation may result in a personal, financial, or political conflict of interest, or the appearance thereof.\u201dThe Justice Department implemented this language with rule 28 CFR Sec. 45.2. This bars employees from probes if they have a personal or political relationship with \u201cany person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution\u201d or which they know \u201chas a specific and substantial interest that would be directly affected by the outcome of the investigation or prosecution.\u201dThis language didn\u2019t apply to Mr. Sessions during his confirmation process because he didn\u2019t know the contours of the FBI and Justice investigation. But the AG soon learned after he arrived at Main Justice in February that the investigation included individuals associated with the Trump presidential campaign.Mr. Sessions had worked on the campaign, and he clearly had personal and political relationships with probable subjects of the investigation. These included former National Security Adviser       Michael Flynn,        former campaign manager       Paul Manafort,        and potentially others.James Comey       publicly confirmed this on March 20 when he told the House Intelligence Committee that the FBI \u201cas part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination.\u201dSome legal sages say this means Mr. Sessions did not have to recuse himself because this was a \u201ccounterintelligence,\u201d not a criminal, probe. But you have to be credulous to think Mr. Comey would ignore potential crimes if he found them in the course of counterintelligence work. Mr. Sessions might have become a subject of the probe because of his meetings with the Russian ambassador.The AG had no way of knowing where the investigation would lead, and the ethical considerations were serious as the post-Watergate statute makes clear. During his confirmation hearing in January, Mr. Sessions had promised that \u201cif a specific matter arose where I believed my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, I would consult with Department ethics officials regarding the most appropriate way to proceed.\u201dMr. Sessions fulfilled that promise, and on March 2 he announced that he\u2019d recuse himself \u201cfrom any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States\u201d based on the advice of senior career Justice officials. Imagine the media storm if word leaked that Mr. Sessions had ignored his department\u2019s ethics officials.Mr. Sessions\u2019s recusal helped Mr. Trump for a time by eliminating an easy conflict-of-interest target for Democrats. The calls for a special prosecutor died down. They only erupted again in May after Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey and tweeted his phony threat that there might be White House tapes.We understand Mr. Trump\u2019s anger at special counsel       Robert Mueller\u2019s       open-ended Russia probe, and Deputy AG       Rod Rosenstein       made a mistake in appointing Mr. Mueller, who is close to Mr. Comey and part of the FBI fraternity. Mr. Rosenstein should have selected a more disinterested special counsel, and even now the Mr. Rosenstein should insist that Mr. Mueller investigate Clinton campaign contacts with the Russians, as our colleague       Holman Jenkins Jr.       has argued.But Mr. Trump will only compound the problem now if he fires Mr. Sessions and appoints a replacement who fires Mr. Mueller. He will cause multiple resignations and bipartisan talk of impeachment. Mr. Sessions acted honorably in recusing himself, and the President should let him do his job without harassment.Appeared in the July 27, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-jeff-sessions-recused-1501111108", "keywords": ["political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,commentaries,opinions,editorials"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 11:39:00", "news_title": "Li Ka-Shing Leads Hong Kong\u2019s Europe Buying Spree With Ista Deal ", "content": "A joint venture backed by Hong Kong Billionaire Li Ka-shing agreed to acquire Germany\u2019s Ista International GmbH, betting on the increasing adoption of so-called smart metering technology to cut water and power consumption.The sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed. But the deal values Ista at about \u20ac4.5 billion ($5.3 billion), including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.The transaction also coincides with a major investment by a Hong Kong company in U.K. real estate Thursday. LKK Heath Products Group agreed to acquire one of London\u2019s most recognizable office towers \u2014 known as the Walkie Talkie because of its shape \u2014 for \u00a31.28 billion ($1.68 billion).Together the two acquisitions represent a positive sign that companies based in parts of China can continue to secure foreign acquisitions even as European sellers show signs of skittishness dealing with Chinese buyers following China\u2019s clampdown on capital outflows and scrutiny of some loans.Cheung Kong Property Holdings Ltd.        1113 0.72%       together with             CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd.       is acquiring the smart-metering company from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners, and its minority partner Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Canada\u2019s biggest pension fund.Based in Essen, Germany, Ista\u2019s metering equipment is used by property managers and homeowners to measure individual tenant and home consumption of energy and water to reduce waste and cut costs. By billing energy and water use based on individual consumption, consumers have more incentive to use less.CK Infrastructure is a well-known global infrastructure investor, recently winning government approval to acquire Australian pipeline operator and power distributor Duet Group for $5.8 billion. Its infrastructure investments including in energy, transportation, water, and waste management span parts of Asia, Australia, Canada and Europe. The Ista deal would be CK Infrastructure\u2019s first in Germany, according to a list of holdings on the company\u2019s website.Cheung Kong Property, with interests in commercial, industrial and residential real estate, is one of Hong Kong\u2019s largest property developers. It also operates in mainland China and has properties in Singapore, the U.K. and the Bahamas.The Ista acquisition comes at a time when governments are pushing measures to curb energy use as a way to reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports, cut greenhouse gases to help counteract climate change and foster development of new technologies to boost economic growth.Last year, the European Commission proposed to update its so-called energy efficiency directive, which would require member countries to cut energy use by 30% by 2030. To help achieve that goal, the EC recommended that consumers get access to individual metering to give them more control over their energy consumption.By acquiring Ista, which is present throughout most of Europe, the CK Infrastructure-Cheung Kong Property joint venture gains exposure to the expected growth in demand for smart metering to help EU countries meet their energy efficiency targets. The joint venture can also take advantage of its presence and knowledge of the Asian market to further expand Ista\u2019s operations in Asia where it already has a presence in China.Last year, Ista generated revenue of \u20ac850.4 million, up 4.9% from the previous year, according to its website. Profit figures weren\u2019t available. The company has more than 5,400 employees.CVC, based in London, acquired a majority stake in Ista in 2013 from Charterhouse Capital Partners, another U.K.-based buyout firm, in a deal that valued the company then at about \u20ac3 billion including debt.In the real estate deal, LKK, a diversified business with interests ranging from the development of Chinese herbal health products to property investment, is acquiring the Walkie Talkie building from British property companies             Land Securities Group                   PLC and Canary Wharf Group. It is the latest example of Chinese buyers targeting U.K. real estate to diversify geographically and take advantage of the strength of their domestic currencies against the British pound since the Brexit vote in a move that makes real estate cheaper for the buyers.In March,             CC Land Holdings Ltd.      , controlled by Hong Kong property tycoon       Cheung Chung Kiu,        agreed to acquire another London office tower known as the Cheesegrater from             British Land                   PLC and a Canadian pension fund for \u00a31.15 billion.Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kongs-cheung-kong-infrastructure-to-acquire-germanys-ista-in-5-3b-deal-1501147820", "keywords": ["acqusitions, canada pension plan investment board,cheesegrater,cheung kong property holdings, china,ck infrastructure , ck infrastructure holdings, duet group, honk kong, ista, ista international,li ka-shing,lkk heath products group , walkie talkie,Cheung Kong Property Holdings,1113.HK,HK:1113,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,joint ventures,consortia,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,energy,real estate,construction"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 11:35:00", "news_title": "UPS Expects Retailers to Pay Up for Christmas Deliveries", "content": "\ufeff        UPS 0.95%United Parcel Service Inc.        UPS 0.95%       expects most retailers to agree to higher shipping prices during the weeks leading up to Christmas, which it says are necessary because of the glut of online orders.UPS last month revealed the extra peak-season fee, which will affect packages shipped in the two weeks around Thanksgiving and in the week before Christmas. Discussions with retailers about the charges and their holiday-season forecasts are continuing, but UPS said it expects most shippers will have to pay them.UPS is encouraging retailers to avoid shipping during those peak-season weeks by holding promotions earlier in November, offering incentives to shoppers to accept later deliveries or other tactics.\u201cIf you can work with us to smooth out the flow, then it reduces your costs as well,\u201d Chief Executive David Abney said in an interview Thursday. In the week leading up to Christmas, where the surcharge is between 27 cents and 97 cents per package based on the service used, shippers may be able to delay orders that aren\u2019t gifts. \u201cNot everything is a Christmas present,\u201d he said.Shipping consultants say retailers may have some wiggle room to negotiate other elements of their contracts. UPS still needs prices to rise to cover the costs of delivering packages during a period when daily volumes surge by nearly 60% to 30 million.UPS is already getting paid more for the extra packages it delivers. In the second quarter, its revenue per unit shipped rose 1.7%, including 3% in the U.S. package business. That pushed U.S. package revenue up 8.1% to $9.75 billion. Gross margins rose to 14.3%, the highest level in nearly two years for the division.Investors have been looking for evidence that UPS and rival         FedEx Corp.       can offset the higher costs of e-commerce deliveries by raising prices and operating more efficiently. The shift to online shopping and the closing of thousands of brick-and-mortar stores has put stress on delivery networks, as deliveries to homes are more costly than bulk deliveries to stores. In the second quarter, UPS total operating expenses rose 7.5%.UPS posted higher sales in its international division and its domestic freight business. Overseas, UPS says it is picking up some business from FedEx, whose European arm TNT was hit by a cyberattack this summer. FedEx has warned that the attack will have a material effect on its results this year.\u201cWe obviously don\u2019t wish cyberattacks on any company,\u201d Mr. Abney said, adding that UPS is regularly updating its defenses to, in part, prevent service disruptions.Overall for the period, UPS revenue rose 7.6% from the year-earlier quarter to $15.75 billion. Profit rose 9% to $1.38 billion.On a per-share basis, the company said it earned $1.58, up from $1.43. The latest quarter included about 10 cents of benefits from new fuel surcharge formula and other items. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.47 a share.UPS said that it expects currency headwinds and costs linked to strategic initiatives to weigh on its results in the second half. Third-quarter earnings are expected to be \u201crelatively flat\u201d compared with last year\u2019s, and UPS reaffirmed its annual guidance for adjusted earnings of between $5.80 and $6.10 per share.In morning trading, shares fell 2.9% to $109.08.\u2014Ezequiel Minaya contributed to this articleWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-delivers-on-growing-demand-improved-pricing-1501159589", "keywords": ["delivery,earnings,earnings season, fee, holidays, peak season,surcharge,ups,ups earnings,United Parcel Service Cl B,UPS,United Parcel Service ,FedEx,FDX,financial performance,contracts,orders,non-governmental contracts,corporate,industrial news,couriers,messengers,freight transport,logistics,transportation"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 11:25:00", "news_title": "A Swiss Gallerist on Finding His Furniture Favorites ", "content": "Stefan von Bartha doesn\u2019t mind taking his work home.The Swiss gallerist sells everything from kinetic art to works of light, which make up part of the personal collection that only friends get to see at his Basel penthouse residence. The 36-year-old, who runs the von Bartha gallery founded by his parents, lives in a 2,600-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in St. Johann, an artsy neighborhood in the northern Swiss city.Mr. von Bartha owns the 14-unit building in which he resides. About four years ago, he decided to combine three attic spaces into one large rooftop apartment. \u201cI was looking to construct something very different from what you could rent on the market,\u201d he says. He then commissioned Zurich-based Luvo architects, who also designed his Basel gallery space, for the job. The renovation took about a year, and in early 2015, he moved into his new home. \u201cThere\u2019s a classic touch to it though it\u2019s also very modern and slick,\u201d says Mr. von Bartha, who lives there alone.Here, a look at the open-plan living/dining space where he hosts clients and friends.The Vitra sofa designed by       Jasper Morrison       is a recent addition to Mr. von Bartha\u2019s home. While he generally prefers vintage furniture, Mr. von Bartha wanted a large couch and realized it would be challenging to find a big antique he liked. The black-and-white cushions are from Italian artist Piero Fornasetti and are a gift from his mother. Price: $8,175Mr. von Bartha purchased the \u201ctankette\u201d table created in the 1980s by       Paolo Pallucco       and       Mireille Rivier       at an auction eight years ago. He had seen similar editions of the metal table, which actually rolls like a tank, in the home of a friend and spent a long time trying to find it on sale. \u201cI was very fortunate to be the only one bidding for it,\u201d he says. Price: $2,335The green vintage 1950s molded fiberglass chairs are by Ray and       Charles Eames.       Mr. von Bartha, who worked in the furniture business before joining the art world, was originally reluctant to buy the designer seating because the chairs were a relatively common sight, but he liked that the pair he settled on were in a relatively unusual color. Price: $2,120The       Joe Colombo       Kd27 table lamp from the 1960s is one of several bargains Mr. von Bartha is proud of. He bought it at a flea market at what he estimates to be a fraction of its retail price. \u201cIt\u2019s made out of plastic and very light and beautiful,\u201d he says, noting that the lamp is designed to be stackable. Price: $20The dining table is custom made of heavy wood by local designers Inch furniture. Mr. von Bartha wanted a table he could use to host events for up to 20 people and commissioned this piece, which weighs almost a ton and had to be lifted by a crane into his apartment. \u201cI love to do dinners at my place where people can meet,\u201d he says.

Revenue in the filmed entertainment division jumped 60%, thanks to the latest installment of the \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d franchise, which offset disappointing results from \u201cThe Mummy\u201d reboot.Comcast shares rose 1.5% to $39.94 in morning trading.The cable networks and broadcast TV units grew revenue and earnings due to increases in subscription fees from pay TV providers, but both also saw a decline in ad sales because of ratings softness. Cable networks\u2019 ad revenues declined 0.9% to $906 million, while broadcast TV ad revenue declined 1.2% to $1.27 billion.In the cable business, the company lost 45,000 residential television customers, compared with a loss of 21,000 in the same quarter last year.Comcast has generally managed to withstand the turmoil in cable TV from cord-cutting better than some peers in pay television. In a tough environment, with consumers gravitating to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Sling TV, the company has added net video subscribers in five of the past seven quarters. The cord-cutting has taken a toll on TV ratings, however, for NBCUniversal\u2019s channels just like those of many other media companies.To help prevent customers from dropping its services, Comcast recently started offering wireless service, adding a fourth pillar to the typical television-phone-internet bundles. The mobile service is only for customers who subscribe to at least its internet service already.The cable operator is relying on a five-year-old network-resale agreement with             Verizon Communications                   to offer its mobile service. Comcast, along fellow cable provider             Charter Communications Inc.,       has explored a deal with Sprint Corp. that could provide an alternative reseller arrangement, potentially with better terms, people familiar with the matter have said.On a call with analysts, executives implied the company was unlikely to pursue a large deal in the wireless industry. Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts said the company is happy with its plan of being a reseller and noted that it is still early days for Xfinity Mobile.\u201cWe really feel we\u2019re not missing anything,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cNo disrespect to wireless. It\u2019s a tough business.\u201dComcast and industry analysts point to its investment in X1, a cloud-based, set-top box system, as a reason its video business has held up. The company said that 55% of its residential video customers now have X1, up from nearly 40% in the same quarter last year.Comcast said that over-the-top streaming services are \u201cnot all that material\u201d to its business.\u201cWe\u2019re skeptical that it\u2019s going to be a very large business or profitable business for the people that are in it and they\u2019re off to a relatively slow start,\u201d       Steve Burke,        CEO of Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, said on the call.Meanwhile, Comcast and other cable providers stand to benefit on the internet access side of their business as streaming TV subscriptions and usage increase.

It didn\u2019t name the individuals.Ten are former management-board members, and one is current, according to people familiar with the matter.The Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday reported the bank expected to keep roughly \u20ac38 million, out of about \u20ac70 million in deferred and unvested compensation it had suspended. The remaining \u20ac31.4 million in outstanding bonus payments will be paid out to the individuals, Deutsche Bank said in its statement.They include former co-Chief Executive Officers       Anshu Jain       and       J\u00fcrgen Fitschen,        people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Jain declined to comment. Mr. Fitschen didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. He continues to advise Deutsche Bank but no longer serves on the management board.Stuart Lewis,        Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief risk officer and the only current management-board member subject to the agreement, declined to comment through a bank spokeswoman.Other former executives subject to the agreement include former CEO       Josef Ackermann       and       Hugo B\u00e4nziger,        a former chief risk officer. They couldn\u2019t immediately be reached.Some of the executives left soon after the financial crisis; others left more recently.Deutsche Bank said its supervisory board suspended the roughly \u20ac70 million in bonus payments because it was required by German law to investigate responsibility for costly legal woes. At issue was whether the bank could hold management board members personally liable for \u201csupervisory investigations and regulatory penalties\u201d stemming from decisions made before and during the financial crisis, Deutsche Bank said.The bank has paid billions of dollars in regulatory fines and other legal settlements stemming from the period. Ultimately, the supervisory board decided based on \u201cextensive investigations\u201d not to hold the executives personally liable, Deutsche Bank said.\u201cThere is insufficient factual and legal basis for actionable damages claims\u201d against the relevant management board members, according to the bank\u2019s statement.The current and former executives believe they upheld their management responsibilities and \u201ccannot be accused of any breach of duty,\u201d according to the bank\u2019s statement. Under German law, management-board members who fail to uphold their executive responsibilities can be found liable\u2014personally and as a group\u2014for costs to shareholders or other parties.The agreement follows months of negotiations over the contributions, which differ among the individuals but follow the same formula for calculating each person\u2019s share of the final amount, a person familiar with the matter said.Deutsche Bank\u2019s statement called the agreement an \u201cact of solidarity\u201d between the individuals and the bank. Chairman       Paul Achleitner       said the agreements help Deutsche Bank \u201clook forward toward the future again.\u201dDeutsche Bank said Thursday it had \u20ac2.5 billion in reserves set aside for outstanding legal costs as of June 30, down from \u20ac3.2 billion at the end of March.Write to Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-expected-to-keep-45-million-in-compensation-from-ex-executives-1501159240", "keywords": [" anshu jain,deutsche bank ceo pay, deutsche bank compensation,deutsche earnings, deutsche legal issues, jurgen fitschen,Deutsche Bank,DBK.XE,DB,Stuart Lewis,Hugo B\u00e4nziger,Josef Ackermann,J\u00fcrgen Fitschen,Anshu Jain,corporate crime,legal action,management,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,class action,settlements,executive pay,senior level management,banking,credit,financial services,integrated banks"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 11:12:00", "news_title": "Bringing Live Music\u2019s Power to Hospital Rooms", "content": "In 1993, the great jazz trumpeter       Wynton Marsalis       came with a small band to perform for patients and workers at Manhattan\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

He felt that he needed to bring such experiences to more patients, particularly those too ill to leave their rooms.In 1999, together with       Vivek Tiwary,        a friend and fellow impresario, Mr. Solomon launched Musicians on Call, a nonprofit group that sends volunteer musicians to play in hospitals, veterans\u2019 facilities, nursing homes and hospice centers across the country.The organization, which has offices in Nashville and New York City, now runs 74 weekly programs in 26 cities, including Atlanta, Dallas, Indianapolis, Miami and Wilmington, Del. Its volunteers\u2014ranging from local professionals to the occasional celebrity\u2014typically spend several hours going door-to-door in medical facilities to play a song or two to bedridden patients, the group says.Musicians on Call says it has performed for nearly 600,000 patients, families and caregivers to date.       Pharrell Williams,       Kelly Clarkson,       Keith Urban       and Nick Jonas have all lent their talent to the cause. Most volunteers hear about the group by word-of-mouth, and many become regulars.Live music can have a dramatic effect on an otherwise somber hospital room. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people who weren\u2019t able to really move get out of bed and start dancing,\u201d says       Pete Griffin,        the organization\u2019s president. \u201cI\u2019ve been in rooms with children where afterward, their parents come to me and say, \u2018That\u2019s the first time my daughter has smiled in three weeks.\u2019 \u201dWhen Mr. Griffin joined Musicians on Call as its president three years ago, it had programs in 15 cities. Today, the group has increased its geographic scope considerably without dramatically expanding its budget of around $1.8 million, most of it from individual donors.As more hospitals discover the value of music therapy, which studies show can alleviate patients\u2019 pain and anxiety, demand for volunteers is outstripping supply. To reach more people, Musicians on Call is working to create a digital platform that directly connects health-care centers with accredited musicians.The group\u2019s mission is straightforward but powerful, says Mr. Griffin. \u201cYou might see a family that\u2019s really struggling, but when a musician comes in to play a song, you can see the entire room transform right in front of you. Once you see something like that, there\u2019s nothing that can replicate it.

Behind the global adoration she enjoys today lies the irony that in her own time Austen\u2019s name never appeared on her books.In \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d she was simply the author of \u201cSense and Sensibility,\u201d which had carried the title \u201cBy a Lady.\u201d Her veil of anonymity worked so well that even friends of the Austen family had no idea that dear, sweet spinster Jane was a novelist of repute. An acquaintance of her brother Henry actually told him that \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d was \u201cmuch too clever to be the work of a woman.\u201d Austen\u2019s decision to publish anonymously was par for the course before the mid-19th century. Writing for money was akin to taking on paid work\u2014something that few gentlemen, much less gentle ladies, would ever consider.Authors of politically controversial tracts also frequently chose to be invisible, for reasons of safety or to let their views stand on their own.       Tom Paine,        author of \u201cCommon Sense,\u201d which galvanized American public opinion in favor of revolution in 1776, kept his identity hidden for a short time after publication. \u201cThe Federalist Papers,\u201d urging ratification of the Constitution, were famously the work of Publius, the joint pseudonym adopted by       Alexander Hamilton,       James Madison       and       John Jay.But for a woman, there was the added burden of societal expectations regarding \u201cfemale respectability,\u201d which characterized any sort of publishing or public display of talent as not just vulgar but unchaste behavior. As       Virginia Woolf       declared in \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own\u201d: \u201cI would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t only fear about propriety that deterred women from writing under their own names. Despite the esteem afforded Austen, women\u2019s writing was seldom taken seriously, as       Charlotte Bront\u00eb,        author of \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d discovered when she sent her poetry to the poet laureate       Robert Southey,        who responded: \u201cLiterature cannot be the business of a woman\u2019s life.\u201d Bront\u00eb used the pseudonym Currer Bell to publish \u201cJane Eyre\u201d in 1847, while her sister Emily published \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d as Ellis Bell in the same year.They joined a long list of women authors who felt they had to hide.       Mary Shelley\u2019s       \u201cFrankenstein\u201d had come out anonymously in 1818, while       Mary Anne Evans       wrote \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d and her other novels under the pen name       George Eliot.In theory, the great strides toward gender equality in the 20th century should have made it unnecessary for women writers to follow the same path as Austen, unless driven by personal reasons. In a 2016 interview with the Guardian, the Italian novelist       Elena Ferrante       claimed that her use of a pseudonym let her \u201cconcentrate exclusively and with complete freedom on writing and its strategies.\u201dBut in practice, certain prejudices just won\u2019t go away, making a pen name appear to be the only option.       Joanne Rowling,        author of the Harry Potter novels, was advised to become       J.K. Rowling       because, as       Connie Ann Kirk\u2019s       biography puts it, \u201cboys might frown on picking up a book by a woman.\u201dVirginia Woolf was more right than she knew: \u201cAnonymous\u201d is still often a woman.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/austen-anonymous-writers-and-history-1501165205", "keywords": ["amanda foreman,anonymity,books,history,jane austen,literature,novels,pride and prejudice,sense and sensibility,political,general news,arts,entertainment,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 10:15:00", "news_title": "Mastercard Results Beat Estimates as Consumers Boost Spending", "content": "Mastercard Inc.

That is a switch from the             Visa Inc.        V 0.51%       network that the cards have been running on. Mr. Banga said the issuer remains U.S. Bank. The card program will launch by the end of 2017, with new cards to be issued by spring 2018.Profit for the second quarter increased 20% to $1.18 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $983 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected profit of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of $1.04.Mastercard shares edged down 0.9%. The stock closed Wednesday at a record high of $130.99.Net revenue increased 13% to $3.1 billion from a year prior, also beating analysts\u2019 estimates. That was fueled by an ongoing rise in gross dollar volume transactions occurring on the Mastercard network, which increased 6% worldwide to $1.28 trillion in the second quarter from the year prior. Mastercard, like Visa, is a major network on which credit card and debit card transactions are processed.The company also benefited from an increase in cardholders using Mastercard cards outside of the country they are issued in. Those \u201ccross-border\u201d volume fees increased 14% from a year prior to $984 million. Also up are the number of transactions occurring on its network rather than on domestic networks in foreign markets. Those \u201cswitched transactions\u201d increased 17% from a year prior.Mr. Banga said Mastercard is finalizing its latest application to enter the Chinese domestic market. The company is reviewing several options including filing a sole application or pursuing a \u201cjoint venture\u201d with another company. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important here is to get it right out of the gate,\u201d he said.Visa\u2019s CEO       Al Kelly       said last week that the company filed an application with the People\u2019s Bank of China for a domestic license. The U.S. and Chinese governments reached an agreement in May that is supposed to result in more access to the Chinese economy for electronic-payments providers. That reignited hopes that Visa and Mastercard may get more market share in China.The companies are benefiting from a booming card market as more consumers switch to using cards or paying with phones that are linked to cards. The rise in online shopping also helps card companies.In the U.S., credit card spending and debt is on the rise, fueled in part by the ongoing rewards wars as issuers offer more in points and cash back to consumers.Operating expenses continued to rise as the company pays out more in advertising and marketing and shares in more costs with card issuers on rewards programs. They increased 7% from a year prior, but when excluding litigation costs that the company incurred a year prior, total adjusted operating expenses increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis.Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mastercard-results-beat-estimates-as-consumers-boost-spending-1501159455", "keywords": ["cardmember spending,credit cards,mastercard earnings,spending,Mastercard,MA,Visa,V,Ajay Banga,financial performance,earnings,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,usage,consumption statistics,economic performance,indicators,consumer credit,expenditure,savings,economic news,credit types,services,banking,credit,financial services,plastic cards"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 10:12:00", "news_title": "Hamptons Estate of Venture Capitalist Asks $23.45 Million", "content": "The Hamptons estate of the late venture capitalist and art collector Jerome L.

In addition to the \u201cart barn,\u201d the property also includes two guest cottages, a horse barn with three stalls, a swimming pool and pool house, and a tennis court. The property has a dock on Quantuck Bay.Mr. Stern, who lived primarily in New York City, first bought the property in 1966 for $250,000\u2014he added more acreage later on\u2014and used it as a vacation home for his family.In the early 2000s, Mr. Stern and his wife, Ellen, built a climate-controlled art barn on the property to house their collection of contemporary photography and sculpture, his son said. Surrounded by trees so it\u2019s not visible from the main house, the 36-foot-high metal building has four main galleries. (The art is being sold separately and isn\u2019t included in the price of the house.)

It was a wonderful way to enjoy nature and entertain yourself.\u201dThe barn served as a private space for the family to view the collection, but they did occasionally open it up for tours and fundraisers.

The company\u2019s combination of new cancer drugs failed to shrink tumors any more effectively than chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer. The revelation overshadowed second-quarter earnings that topped analyst expectations.The trial will continue through next year, and there is still a possibility that the drugs will show a survival benefit. Investors took no comfort in that fact: AstraZeneca Shares were down 15% in European trading. The news rippled through rivals\u2019 share prices as well.             Bristol-Myers Squibb        BMY 2.70%       shed 5% and             Merck        MRK -0.45%       & Co. gained 3% in early U.S. trading. Merck has a key part of the lung cancer market to itself for the time being, while Thursday\u2019s news appears to have negative implications for a key part of Bristol-Myers\u2019 new drug pipeline.Immunotherapy drugs, which leverage the body\u2019s immune system to fight tumors, are arguably the hottest segment of the market for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.\u00a0Share prices for companies of all sizes have gotten a boost thanks to investor enthusiasm.\u00a0AstraZeneca\u2019s U.S. shares had \u00a0appreciated by 24% so far this year before Thursday\u2019s meltdown. And some of these drugs already have hit the market and generated impressive financial returns, in addition to providing significant benefits to cancer patients on an overall basis.At the same time, trial failures are starting to pile up.\u00a0A key Bristol-Myers lung cancer trial failed last summer and the stock has yet to recover a year later. Even Merck, which now is the clear market leader in immuno-oncology, announced that a clinical trial in head and neck cancer missed the target earlier this week. Fortunately for Merck\u2019s shareholders, head and neck cancer is a much smaller market than lung cancer.Successfully anticipating clinical trial outcomes with any consistency is a tall order for almost any outside observer. Investors can protect themselves by not overpaying for growth, though. AstraZeneca shares traded at 17-times forward earnings before the trial results, according to FactSet. That was close to a 10-year high. Bristol-Myers traded at an even loftier 25-times forward earnings last summer, before its shares were leveled.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in it to win it\u201d is Wall Street\u2019s mantra when promising technologies emerge.

Give \u2019Em a Shot ", "content": "Who would dare to eat a plate of raw oysters in Penn Station?That is the question I asked when I first heard from a friend about Tracks Raw Bar & Grill, a restaurant that has occupied an easy-to-miss spot near the Long Island Rail Road ticket booths for 15 years. But my friend insisted I give it a chance, saying it is one of his go-to places in the city for the briny bivalves. And for the record, he doesn\u2019t even commute through Penn.But as someone who covers New York City\u2019s restaurant scene for The Wall Street Journal, that posed a larger question about the state of the dining scene at the nation\u2019s busiest train station.It is too easy to assume that Penn Station\u2019s restaurants are a mirror image of the station itself\u2014grimy, tired and dated. About 600,000 people pass through there every day. Surely, in this summer of transit woes, they must be taking comfort in something other than Auntie Anne\u2019s pretzels and tall-boy cans of mass-market beer, to name two of the station\u2019s seemingly most popular offerings.Which brings me to my first find at the station: Don Pepi Pizza, a by-the-slice joint on the upper level that has been in business for three decades. And that explains why it makes the kind of honest, old-school pizza that would be familiar to anyone who came of age in the city during the \u201970s or \u201980s. Think a triangular delight of tangy tomato sauce, chewy cheese and a crust that has the proper foldable quality but doesn\u2019t go completely limp, either. At $3 for a plain-cheese slice, it is New York City in an affordable mouthful.Just a short walk from Don Pepi is another respectable option: Penn Sushi, home of the Amtrak Roll.Raw fish at Penn Station might sound as off-putting as raw oysters at Penn Station. But when you see the staff at this to-go establishment busily slicing and rolling, all while customers line up to make their purchases (rolls start at around $5), the worries about freshness quickly abate.This isn\u2019t sushi that will rival $200-a-meal omakase establishments, but it is flavorful and well prepared, with the rolls holding their shape nicely. And that Amtrak Roll\u2014actually, an assortment of rolls, arrayed to vaguely resemble a train\u2019s wheel\u2014is a hoot.Of course, Penn Station has got more than its share of chain options, from Subway to             Starbucks                   to, yes, Auntie Anne\u2019s. In my survey, I generally bypassed those (if I really want chain food, I can go above ground), but I couldn\u2019t resist stopping by one of the station\u2019s two locations of Zaro\u2019s, the New York-based bakery chain, for its $3.25 black-and-white cookie, one of the best exemplars of the treat in the city.Perhaps my strangest foodie find of all wasn\u2019t at a restaurant, but at the midtown Kmart that is connected to Penn via the station\u2019s lower level. And right at that lower-level entrance is a small area where patrons can buy snacks and drinks.For reasons that probably are known only to Kmart\u2019s upper management, the store stocks an impressive selection of Jamaican sodas, which are otherwise hard to find in the city. I satisfied myself with a pink grapefruit Ting, a sweet-and-tart sip that is the perfect summer refresher.None of this is to suggest that Penn Station is a great place to dine. Just the opposite. My few finds notwithstanding, the station does a rather poor job of bringing in operators who reflect the current vitality of the New York City dining scene. Where is the vegan vendor? Or the taco maker?For now, the closest you will find to that sort of contemporary approach is at the Pennsy, the food hall, itself recently revamped, that is right outside the station. But I suspect someone waiting for the\u00a05:22 p.m.\u00a0train to Ronkonkoma on Long Island would prefer a decent food option closer to where they board.Ah, but at least there is Tracks. My culinary tour of Penn included two meals at the restaurant, which is noteworthy both for its collection of train memorabilia and its 105-foot-long bar.

The idea is that with more accurate data covering consumers\u2019 offline and online shopping habits, retailers and brands can better target ads at people who are most likely to make purchases.Amazon\u2019s increasing power has sent shock waves across the entire retail industry. About 55% of U.S. online shoppers start their product searches on Amazon, according to e-commerce startup BloomReach, and the company is making inroads in brick-and-mortar commerce with its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods.Nike, which had held off selling its wares directly on Amazon for years, capitulated in June and entered into a partnership with the company to make some of its products available on the site and to minimize the prominence of third-party sellers hawking its shoes and athletic wear.Amazon helps companies get their products in front of a wide range of consumers, but it also controls the web experience and has a goal of offering the widest assortment of goods at the lowest prices, which doesn\u2019t always sit well with companies looking to build their brands.\u201cAmazon is creating a means to disintermediate brands if they wish to,\u201d said Criteo\u2019s president of brand solutions, Jonathan Opdyke. \u201cYou need to work with them as it\u2019s a huge channel, a huge access point, but if you over-index you could be digging your own grave. The need for diversity is important.\u201dGet your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here.Criteo is hoping that by working together, retail rivalries can be set aside for the benefit of the wider industry, by using targeted online ads to persuade consumers there are more places to shop than on Amazon.com.The Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem, as it will be called, will give its clients the option to share anonymized, or \u201chashed,\u201d aggregated data sets of customer email addresses or other customer relationship management (CRM) data, plus purchase and other \u201cevent\u201d information from their physical stores, websites and apps. Criteo says it doesn\u2019t store any personal data that allows for individuals to be identified.Those clients will then have the ability to join a data pool with Criteo\u2019s other opted-in customers to receive data back that could soon expand their ad targeting options, beyond the people who have previously visited their websites. Criteo is looking to build a product similar to Facebook\u2019s \u201cLookalike Audiences,\u201d for example, to be able to segment groups of potential customers who have shown interest in similar products and product categories as their existing customer base.Criteo says, in the more immediate term, the new platform will also help a handbag brand, for example, better understand if an ad it served to a consumer online for a certain product contributed to that person purchasing that item on a department store\u2019s website, app or in a brick-and-mortar location\u2014cross-device, anonymized data they may not have had access to before on their own.\u201cBrands over time want the ability to work with a third party,\u201d Criteo CEO Eric Eichmann said. \u201cThey are more comfortable with a distributed set of retailers than just one single brand.\u201dStill, the idea will only be successful if Criteo manages to get enough of its customers on board who are willing to work together. Mr. Eichmann declined to comment on how many customers Criteo would need for the platform to work effectively, but said once the company manages to sign up big brands, he is confident the rest will follow and create a network effect.Brands and retailers also tend to store and sort their data in different ways, so Criteo will need to put its algorithms to work to match it all up in order for the information to be used effectively.Martin Kihn, an analyst at technology research firm Gartner, said Criteo\u2019s challenge in making its data collective work is that it is competing with the likes of Google and Facebook, which offer a wealth of targeting and measurement capabilities based on their databases of first-party login data. They are also both increasingly looking at ways to link online advertising to offline sales.But Criteo also has an advantage, Mr. Kihn said, because the ad tech company has relationships with around 18,000 publishers, many of which are reluctant to cede too much control to Google and Facebook. Many publishers like working with Criteo because it\u2019s an alternative to what the ad industry often refers to as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d The ad tech company has become skilled at creating shopping ads that generate clicks and, therefore, high ad rates, Mr. Kihn said.The Commerce Marketing Ecosystem is currently in development. Criteo\u2019s executives said they expect to share more details about the platform, plus the company\u2019s ambitions to be more than just a retargeting firm during its next quarterly earnings call, which is planned for Aug. 2.Criteo is one of the two standout performers in the public ad tech market, alongside The Trade Desk, a demand-side platform that made its debut on the stock market last September.Criteo reported revenue of $517 million in the quarter ended March 31, a 30% increase from a year earlier.Write to Lara O\u2019Reilly at lara.oreilly@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ad-tech-firm-criteo-to-launch-data-cooperative-to-help-retailers-take-on-amazon-1501163625", "keywords": ["ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate actions,branding,corporate,industrial news,customer relationship management,retail,wholesale,etailing,market research,public relations,business,consumer services,e-commerce,online service providers,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 09:48:00", "news_title": "Mexico Registered $62 Million Trade Surplus in June   ", "content": "MEXICO CITY\u2014Mexico chalked up a small trade surplus in June as strength in exports of manufactured goods offset increased imports of petroleum products.Exports last month rose 11.5% from June of 2016 to $35.61 billion, and imports grew 9.5% to $35.55 billion.

He will also sit on the Financial Policy Committee and the Prudential Regulation Committee, which between them set the rules for lenders and other financial institutions.Mr. Ramsden joined the Treasury in 1988 and is now its chief economic adviser, having worked in a variety of roles that included leading the government\u2019s assessment of whether the U.K. should adopt the euro. After four years of deliberation, the U.K. in 2003 decided against joining the eurozone.\u201cSir Dave\u2019s unrivaled experience at the center of U.K. economic policy for more than two decades gives him the thorough grounding needed to be successful in his new role,\u201d said       Philip Hammond,        the U.K.\u2019s Treasury chief. \u201cHis departure will be a loss to the Treasury.\u201dThe BOE job became available when       Charlotte Hogg       resigned in March after a panel of lawmakers said her failure to disclose a potential conflict of interest meant she shouldn\u2019t do her job.

In June, three members voted for a rate rise, but one of those has now left.Those who oppose a rate rise point to the uncertainties around the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union as one reason to proceed with caution.

Volumes edged up just 1%, meaning much of the sales lift came from Diageo raising prices. Its operating margin on an organic basis climbed by 37 basis points.Diageo\u2019s shares were up nearly 7% in London afternoon trading at \u00a32429.5, a record.Following a lackluster couple of years, Diageo has recently made strides toward turning around its performance in North America, its largest and most profitable market. More broadly, the company is using data to make better choices about how to allocate its marketing budget and has been working on cutting costs throughout its business.On Thursday the company raised its cost-cutting target to \u00a3700 million from \u00a3500 million and said it now aims to increase its profit margin by 175 basis points, up from a target of 100 basis points, which it says it will reach by fiscal 2019.

AstraZeneca said Thursday the trial instead showed the combination was no better than standard chemotherapy at shrinking tumors in newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer.The test was seen as an important milestone in Chief Executive       Pascal Soriot\u2019s       go-it-alone strategy, outlined after he rebuffed             Pfizer Inc.\u2019s        PFE 0.50%       2014 takeover offer that was worth $120 billion at the time. Rejecting the rich premium that went along with that offer, he promised AstraZeneca\u2019s research and development pipeline would supercharge revenue over the next decade.Dr. Soriot has also touted the drug-combination approach as a competitive edge that could help it take on immuno-oncology market leaders             Merck                   & Co. and             Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.After the disappointing results, AstraZeneca\u2019s shares fell sharply, trading down 16% in midday London trading.Adding to investor unease, Dr. Soriot refused to rule out definitively whether he was leaving AstraZeneca. Earlier this month, an Israeli news outlet reported he was headed to run Israeli drug giant             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.       Shares dropped sharply on the report, though they had recovered those losses, until Thursday.AstraZeneca representatives have said they wouldn\u2019t comment on what they described as market rumors and speculation. Dr. Soriot did the same Thursday.\u201cI\u2019m not a quitter,\u201d Dr. Soriot told reporters after fielding a handful of questions about whether he was staying or going. \u201cThat\u2019s as far as I will go.\u201d It is unusual for such a large company to allow uncertainty over a CEO\u2019s tenure to linger this long.The Mystic setback sows fresh worry about the company\u2019s ability to meet Dr. Soriot\u2019s revenue goal, despite a string of successes in other clinical trials earlier this year that had shored up confidence in the company\u2019s cancer pipeline. As part of his Pfizer defense, he promised to nearly double revenue by 2023.Those successes had pumped up AstraZeneca\u2019s share price this year. Last month it briefly touched the \u00a355 that Pfizer offered back in 2014. After Thursday\u2019s rout, it is trading well below that level again.Dr. Soriot said comparing the share price to Pfizer\u2019s offer was unfair. The Pfizer deal was structured as an \u201cinversion,\u201d which would have technically relocated the tax residence headquarters of the combined company outside the U.S., where corporate taxes are lower. Dr. Soriot said subsequent opposition to such deals in Washington would have made a combination impossible anyway.\u201cI would wait a little longer before passing judgment on the share price,\u201d he said.Sean Bohen,        who leads drug development at AstraZeneca, said that while the result was disappointing, the combination could yet prove effective in prolonging overall survival. Progression-free survival, the metric used in the initial result, measured how effective the treatment was at shrinking tumors. Some other cancer immunotherapy drugs have failed to improve progression-free survival, yet extended overall survival.Still, UBS analyst Jack Scannell said the combination\u2019s prospects were \u201cmodest.\u201d             Citigroup\u2019s       Andrew Baum said Mystic was \u201cessentially a failed trial.\u201dSeparately, AstraZeneca announced that another of its drugs, Tagrisso, was more effective than standard therapy at shrinking tumors in patients whose lung cancer is linked to a particular genetic mutation known as EGFR.Astra also said it would share the rights to its ovarian cancer drug Lynparza with Merck & Co. for $1.6 billion upfront, $750 million in option payments and another $6.15 billion over time based on development and sales targets. Under the terms of the deal, the companies will share profits generated from the drug and work together on developing it to treat other cancers, including combinations with their respective immuno-oncology drugs. The deal also gives Merck access to AstraZeneca\u2019s experimental lung cancer drug selumetinib.The Mystic result came as AstraZeneca said it swung to a net profit in the second quarter, due to lower spending on research and marketing, proceeds from several licensing deals, and a favorable year-earlier comparison. Revenue fell as sales of new drugs struggled to offset the decline of older best sellers.The company posted net profit of $477 million, compared with a net loss of $3 million a year earlier, when AstraZeneca took a restructuring charge related to job cuts. Revenue dropped 10% to $5.05 billion. Analysts had expected net profit of $450 million on revenue of $5.05 billion.AstraZeneca\u2019s top line has been shrinking for several years as its historic best sellers like the cholesterol-lowering pill Crestor lost patent protection, allowing cheap copycats to enter the market. Mr. Soriot has told investors that 2017 will be the year when sales bottom out.Write to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/astrazeneca-faces-major-setback-over-cancer-drugs-1501140320", "keywords": ["astrazeneca, drug trial, lung cancer, oncology trial,Pfizer,PFE,AstraZeneca,AZN.LN,Pascal Soriot,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings,research,development,corporate,industrial news,new product,service testing,cancer,political,general news,health,respiratory tract cancer,medical conditions,biotechnology,pharmaceuticals,cancer drugs,health care,life sciences,biopharmaceuticals,specialized drugs,medications"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 09:33:00", "news_title": "Senator Expands Probe into Opioid Addiction Crisis ", "content": "The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee expanded a probe into the opioid addiction crisis, asking four more drug companies and three drug distributors to provide documents.Sen.

Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov.       Dan Patrick       have sought to push Texas rightward.\u00a0 Moderate Republicans aligned with big businesses are pushing back,\u00a0worried that such an approach\u00a0will slow Texas' humming economy.\u201cWe would have preferred if we didn\u2019t have to get involved in this case,\u201d said       Diane Gherson,        IBM\u2019s chief of human resources, who traveled from the company\u2019s Armonk, N.Y. headquarters to Austin\u00a0last week.\u00a0\u201cWe realized it was important to have face to face dialogue with legislators to make sure they understood where we are on the issue,\u201d she added, saying the legislation was against the company\u2019s policy of diversity and inclusion.This year in particular, an array of social issues such as gender identity, immigration and abortion have become flash points here, both at the statehouse and in legal battles, as the state\u2019s top GOP leaders\u00a0have sought to burnish Texas' conservative identity. As the special session\u00a0continues this week, the bathroom bill is taking center stage, putting on full display the chasm between the moderate and conservative factions of the GOP.\u201cTexas is trying to balance a role in the global community and economy equivalent to that of California and New York, with a Republican Party whose social conservative wing has values that are more in line with\u00a0isolated rural states like Idaho and Wyoming,\u201d said Mark Jones, political-science fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.Earlier this year, Texas passed one of the nations\u2019 toughest immigration laws, which bans sanctuary policies and threatens law-enforcement officials with jail time if they don\u2019t comply. Major Texas cities, including Dallas, Houston and Austin, are\u00a0challenging the state in federal court to block the law from taking effect in September.But the bathroom bill, which seeks to regulate public restroom use based on a person\u2019s biological sex at birth, has generated the most controversy. The measure failed to pass during the recent legislative session. But it was added to the special session agenda by Gov. Abbott, who supports the proposal and like Mr. Patrick calls it a safety issue.Texas Republicans control both chambers of the legislature. A new version of the legislation, which requires people in public schools and government buildings to use the bathroom of the sex listed on their birth certificate or other types of state identification, cleared the state Senate on Tuesday. But its fate in the more moderate House is unclear.\u201cThis is has nothing to do with transgender people,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Patrick, adding that the bill was designed to protect women from sexual predators and that many businesses he had spoken with understood its intent.In recent weeks, Mr. Patrick has traded increasingly heated barbs with\u00a0House Speaker Joe Straus, a moderate Republican,\u00a0over the issue, accusing him of blocking an issue supported by most Texas GOP lawmakers.Mr. Straus, who has said the bathroom bill is unnecessary, has urged businesses to be more outspoken in their opposition this time around.\u201cI hope this is a wake-up call to the business community not to take for granted that things won\u2019t get out of hand here,\u201d he said, noting that the political atmosphere in Texas had become too focused on \u201cdivisive social issues.\u201dSome Texas businesspeople said they weren\u2019t bothered by the legislation and welcomed the state\u2019s turn to the right.Joseph Slovacek, a senior partner at a Houston civil-litigation law firm, supports both the bathroom bill and the sanctuary policy ban, and praised both Mr. Patrick and Mr. Abbott for staying true to what he says are Texas\u2019 core values.\u201cThis is common sense. I don\u2019t think city ordinances or school district should try to tell the state of Texas who is a man, who is a woman and who can go into which restrooms,\u201d said Mr. Slovacek, a Republican who raised money for President       Donald Trump\u2019s       campaign.On Tuesday, Mr. Abbott touted several groups,\u00a0including the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention and the Texas Home School Coalition that support the issue.Meanwhile, opponents of the measure in the business community are ramping up pressure on lawmakers to reject the bill.IBM chief executive\u00a0      Ginni Rometty       called Gov. Abbott\u00a0last week\u00a0to voice her disagreement with the measure, the first time they have spoken about the matter, the company said. IBM employs 10,000 people in Texas, and says, the legislation will affect its ability to recruit top talent to Texas. The company said it will consider investing elsewhere if the measure is approved.The Texas Association of Business, an opponent of the bathroom bill,\u00a0recently announced an ad campaign against the measure. The first ads, which began running this week on radio, feature a former Republican state legislator and a Republican county judge.\u201cBathroom bills\u00a0are completely unnecessary and go against my Christian values and conservative principles,\u201d said Denton County Judge Mary Horn in one of the ads.Earlier in May, top tech leaders\u00a0including\u00a0Ms. Rometty,       Mark Zuckerberg,        CEO of             Facebook Inc.,      Tim Cook,        CEO of             Apple Inc.,       and       Meg Whitman,        CEO             Hewlett Packard Enterprise                   wrote to Mr. Abbott expressing their opposition to \u201cdiscriminatory legislation.\u201d\u201cThe kinds of people that are the best in the world at creating technology, at creating entertainment\u2026these are people that do not want to live in places that are seen as discriminatory,\u201d said Randy Pitchford, the CEO of Gearbox Software, a popular videogame company based in North Texas, who signed the letter.The governor\u2019s office says fears about Texas\u2019 growth are unfounded, noting that at least nine\u00a0major corporations have announced relocations to Texas over roughly the past year, including Jamba Juice, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hulu, drawn by low taxes and fewer regulations.Earlier this month, Mr. Abbott\u00a0formally welcomed             Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s       North American Headquarters to Plano, north of Dallas, from its previous home in Southern California.According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Texas has seen a 2.7 percent job growth this year, more than double the employment growth from 2016.Write to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bathroom-bill-signals-widening-gop-rift-in-texas-1501160402", "keywords": ["International Business Machines,IBM,Apple,AAPL,Hewlett Packard Enterprise,HPE,Facebook,FB,Hulu,Jamba Juice,Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,7011.TO,JP:7011,Ginni Rometty,Meg Whitman,Mark Zuckerberg,Tim Cook,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,human rights,civil liberties,lgbt rights,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,computer services,business,consumer services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 08:34:00", "news_title": "U.S. Jobless Claims Rose Last Week", "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits rose last week, though broader trends remain consistent with steady job gains.Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., rose 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 in the week ended July 22, the Labor Department said Thursday.

It said strong sales growth in China and Europe powered that increase, and that it sold more high-end phones.Though Huawei is narrowing the gap with Apple Inc. and South Korea\u2019s             Samsung Electronics,             it still has some catching up to do with its rivals in the competitive and slowing smartphone market, especially overseas. It had 9.9% of global market share in the first quarter, up a percentage point from a year ago but behind rivals Apple and Samsung, according to analytics firm Canalys. The company has been in third place for two years.Huawei is already a major player in the sale of networking gear and telecommunications equipment, along with Sweden\u2019s         Ericsson               AB.Last year, the company\u2019s top consumer executive, Richard Yu, set a target of becoming the No. 1 smartphone vendor within five years.At the company\u2019s Shenzhen headquarters Thursday, Mr. Yu said Huawei is sticking by its goal. A major priority is boosting its sales and brand image in the more profitable high-end phone market, he said.\u201cWe are trying to build up a high-end and premium brand image,\u201d Mr. Yu said.Huawei launched a new flagship model, the P10, earlier this year. Meant to challenge Samsung and Apple, the phone featured improvements on the dual-lens camera on the back of the phone and the selfie camera on the front, developed in conjunction with Germany\u2019s Leica Camera AG.Mr. Yu said the company has shipped more than six million P10 phones since its launch. He said the company plans to release another high-end phone, the Mate 10, around the time of Apple\u2019s iPhone 8 release later this year.Overseas, Huawei has invested heavily in marketing and last year spent spending more than $11 billion on research and development across the entire company, including on patents to build its brand portfolio. The company has also expanded its gadget offerings beyond just handsets, pushing into wearables with a smartwatch and earlier this year unveiling a laptop version of its MateBook tablet.While Huawei is a household name in its home market\u2014where Chinese consumers are increasingly eschewing foreign phone companies in favor of local marques\u2014its phone brand still isn\u2019t as well known in Europe, said       Tim Coulling,        senior analyst at Canalys.\u201cOur product competitiveness is stronger than our brand competitiveness,\u201d Mr. Yu said. \u201cWe need to further improve our brand awareness.\u201dHuawei said smartphone shipments in Europe rose 18% in the first half of the year, but didn\u2019t break out actual sales for the region. That suggests the company\u2019s sales accelerated during the second quarter, since the company had a market share of 10% in Europe in the first quarter, virtually unchanged from a year ago, according to data from Canalys.Huawei has struggled to crack Asian markets outside of China, where regulatory hurdles and a marketplace favoring low-cost models have presented challenges. In Southeast Asia and India, Canalys data show Huawei had a 3% share of the market in the first quarter, putting it in eighth place.The challenges facing Huawei are compounded by a broader slowdown in the global handset business and a slate of new models from rivals. Apple is set to release its iPhone 8 later this year, while Samsung launched a new flagship phone in May, the Galaxy S8, hoping to move past the massive Galaxy Note 7 recall last year.Among Huawei\u2019s biggest challenges: its small presence in the U.S., the world\u2019s largest market for high-end smartphones. The company\u2019s telecom equipment has been effectively banned in the U.S. since a 2012 Congressional report that recommended U.S. carriers avoid Huawei\u2019s gear. Huawei has repeatedly denied allegations in the report that the company could use its gear to spy on Americans, but it still lacks a major carrier partner in the U.S.Another challenge: getting Huawei\u2019s customers to pay more for its smartphones. A Huawei phone in Europe, for example, fetched $312 on average last year\u2014less than half the average price of an Apple smartphone, and below the $414 for an average Samsung phone, according to Canalys.Huawei\u2019s overall consumer business generated 105.4 billion yuan ($15.6 billion) in revenue, up 36% from a year ago. The company isn\u2019t publicly traded and only reports selective financial metrics. It didn\u2019t report net income.Revenue across the entire corporation\u2014which includes its equipment business and an enterprise business in addition to its consumer line\u2014rose 15% to 283.1 billion yuan during the first half of the year. The company reported an operating margin of 11%.Write to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-huawei-posts-soaring-revenue-in-smartphone-business-1501142404", "keywords": ["huawei earnings, p10 phone, smartphone sales,tech earnings,Huawei Technologies,02502.SZ,Samsung Electronics,005930.SE,Apple,AAPL,Richard Yu,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,computers,consumer electronics,networking,telecommunications equipment,mobile communications devices,personal electronics,audio,video equipment,cellular,mobile phones,consumer goods,durable household products,handheld electronic devices,home electronics,appliances,smartphones,technology,wireless area network technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 08:21:00", "news_title": "Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Slow Growth Plays Into Dan Loeb\u2019s Hands ", "content": "If activist       Dan Loeb\u2019s       hopes for food giant Nestl\u00e9        NSRGY 0.03%       are to bear fruit, he needs support from other investors. Weak second-quarter results reported Thursday may push a few more in his direction.Like other consumer-goods groups, Europe\u2019s most valuable company is struggling to grow at the healthy clip investors once took for granted. Unlike other consumer-goods groups, Nestl\u00e9 isn\u2019t offsetting its growth problem with a more radical approach to trimming costs.Second-quarter organic sales, which strip out the effects of acquisitions and currencies, were up just 2.4% year-over-year, barely above the first-quarter growth rate despite a boost from a late Easter. Management once again massaged down expectations, suggesting full-year growth would be in the lower half of the 2% to 4% range unveiled by new Chief Executive       Ulf Mark Schneider       in February.U.K. peer             Unilever,       still smarting from an unsolicited takeover approach from       Kraft Heinz       in February, last week posted slightly disappointing second-quarter sales growth of 3%, but big margin gains. Yoghurt-maker             Danone                   pulled off the same trick Thursday, helped by initial cost savings from the acquisition of U.S. peer WhiteWave.Nestl\u00e9 had nothing comparable to offer. Its underlying operating margin was all but flat at 15.9%; cost savings were offset by rising commodity prices. Mr. Loeb argued in an open letter last month that management should set a formal margin target of 18% to 20% by 2020, as Unilever has done. Since taking the reins in January, Mr. Schneider has stressed the need to balance margin gains with reinvestment in innovation and other sources of top-line growth.Nestl\u00e9\u2019s stellar long-term track record has earned it loyal investors. The stock, which set a new record after Mr. Loeb\u2019s intervention, dipped less than 1% Thursday morning. But each quarter of mediocre growth undermines the company\u2019s exceptionalism.

As the jobless rate falls, employers in places including Arizona, Indiana and Maryland are scouring the fringes of the labor market for able-bodied workers, including ex-offenders.Erickson, which has about 250 employees in Arizona and roughly 1,000 nationwide, has been recruiting directly from corrections department job fairs for prisoners nearing release. Karen Hellman, director of inmate programs and re-entry, said there has been a noticeable uptick in companies looking to hire inmates this year.National data on hiring of ex-offenders isn\u2019t available, but other state correctional systems across the U.S. and training programs for ex-offenders report similar experiences.\u201cI\u2019ve never dealt with employers who are more willing to hire ex-felons,\u201d said John Nally, who started working at the Indiana Department of Correction in 1967 and is now its director of education. \u201cIt is a totally different landscape when you have an unemployment rate of 3.6%. We have all these people in construction who are literally begging for workers.\u201dIndiana\u2019s unemployment rate was 3.6% in April and fell to 3.2% in May.The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low in May and the number of job openings climbed to a record in April, according to separate Labor Department reports, underscoring tightness in the labor market. In a recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, nearly half of small businesses said they could find few or no qualified workers for the positions they were trying to fill.\u201cContacts across a broad range of industries reported a shortage of qualified workers which had limited hiring,\u201d the Federal Reserve said in its most recent summary of economic conditions.More than 600,000 sentenced prisoners nationwide are released from state or federal prisons each year. Research shows that most struggle to find steady work and stable housing\u2014and frequently end up offending again.The vast majority\u2014nearly 90% in the Indiana study\u2014of ex-offenders have a high-school diploma or less, putting them at a distinct disadvantage among a population that already has higher unemployment and lower participation rates than those with at least some college.But as the labor market tightens, their fortunes improve.A review of Indiana state prisoners released in 2005 found that nearly half were rearrested within five years. \u201cEx-offenders would likely become recidivists if they were unemployed after release from prison,\u201d the study said. \u201cAt its core, postrelease employment was the major predictor of recidivism.\u201dOf those released in 2005, 92% to 97% didn\u2019t hold a job during the year they got out of prison, the Indiana study found. That fell to more than 60% by 2007, when the national unemployment rate was also low and the labor market tight. Unemployment among those released in 2005 was back up to 80% by 2009, after the recession hit. Americans with criminal records still face significant barriers to finding a job.Many employers, for example, won\u2019t hire someone without at least a high-school diploma. More than one-third of the ex-offenders in the Indiana study lacked such a credential. Businesses also are often leery of hiring anyone with a criminal background, sometimes because of regulations, legal liability concerns or worries a person will repeat past criminal behavior. Employers frequently complain potential workers can\u2019t pass a drug test.The right and left are making efforts toward criminal justice reform.That includes initiatives to promote hiring as a means of rehabilitation, to lower crime rates and save money on incarceration costs.\u201cSlowly but surely there\u2019s a mind shift about people who come out of prison,\u201d said       Mark Holden,        general counsel at Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan., manufacturing conglomerate perhaps better known for the conservative activism of its owners, Charles and       David Koch.       One priority for the group is criminal justice reform. \u201cHopefully we will see more opportunity [for people with criminal records] going forward.\u201dThe situation shows signs of improving for ex-offenders in some parts of the country.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that employers are beginning to open up to individuals with criminal backgrounds,\u201d said Kent Kramer, president and chief executive of Goodwill of Central and Southern Indiana. He said former inmates need stable housing, health care, a track record of employment and some marketable skill if they want a steady job with a living wage.Timothy Phillips was released from Maryland\u2019s prison system in February 2016 after 17 years behind bars for murder. The 48-year-old quickly found a job at a retailer but was later let go after a background check turned up his criminal history.He participated in Baltimore\u2019s Jump Start program, an 87-hour construction pre-apprenticeship. Job placement director Kate McShane estimates three-quarters of its enrollees have criminal records.Mr. Phillips graduated from the program in February and the same month started working at Kogok Corp., an Upper Marlboro, Md., company that manufactures and installs commercial duct work. His work as a sheet metal mechanic feels like a career, not just a job, he said.\u201cIt seems that you do have companies like Kogok that may not mind hiring someone with a criminal background\u2014it seems like companies out there do exist,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that hard if you\u2019re determined.\u201dIn the Baltimore metropolitan area, which includes more suburban Columbia and Towson, the unemployment rate is 4.1%, leaving some companies scrambling for workers.Daniel Warner, president of Loganville, Penn.-based Structural Restoration Services Inc., said his company since May has hired seven Jump Start graduates for jobs in the region, its first experience with the program.\u201cThe labor market\u2019s really tight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tried just about every avenue of hiring we can figure out.\u201dSo far, five have stuck with the building repair company\u2014not much different than other hires off the street\u2014and Mr. Warner said when he needs additional workers, he would consider recruiting from the program again.\u201cThese are guys who have really made a decision to change their life,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Write to Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-convicts-help-companies-fill-need-for-skilled-labor-1501156800", "keywords": [" ex-convicts, ex-felons, ex-offenders,jobs, labor, prisons, unemployment,economic performance,indicators,employment,unemployment,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,law enforcement,prisons,prisoners"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 08:00:00", "news_title": "Starbucks Earnings: What to Watch", "content": "Starbucks Corp.

The company is expected to report $5.76 billion in revenue, up from $5.24 billion a year ago.THE U.S.: The coffee chain\u2019s largest market had been posting quarterly same-store sales growth of 5% or greater for more than six years until it began missing sales targets last year. The company has said it would return to that rate of growth again, but so far it hasn\u2019t. Investors will be watching for that figure on Thursday \u201clike a hawk\u201d Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski said. If the company falls short of that growth rate again, he predicts Starbucks shares will fall. The company has cited a number of factors for the slower growth, from economic uncertainty to congestion caused by mobile orders. The company also has said it needs to speed up service for customers who order inside and at the drive-through.RESERVE: Longtime Chief Executive       Howard Schultz       stepped down from running the company in April so he could focus on opening higher-end coffee shops within the company but under different brands as a way to create a destination for people to leave their homes. The company is planning to open up to 30 giant luxury coffee shops where coffee is roasted on-site, under the name Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room. So far, one Roastery store is open in Seattle with others slated to open in the next two years in New York, Chicago, Shanghai, Milan and Tokyo. In addition, the company plans to build as many as 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the Starbucks Reserve brand. Starbucks also is remodeling many of its traditional Starbucks cafes with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and brewing methods that are available at the Reserve stores, where a cup of coffee can cost up to $12. Investors are hoping to get a taste of how the initiative is coming along.LUNCH: Starbucks has been trying to expand its business beyond the busy morning rush by introducing more food, including a new line of freshly made salads and sandwiches that made its debut in Chicago in April. New Chief Executive       Kevin Johnson       recently told The Wall Street Journal that the chain already had a significant number of customers coming in at lunch time for a beverage, so it decided to offer fresh food that goes well with the drinks customers order midday. Investors will want to know whether the chain plans to expand the test into other markets. Starbucks has said it plans to double its food business in the next four years. In the second quarter, food contributed more to U.S. same-store sales than beverages did for the first time since Starbucks began breaking out the sales contributors.Write to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/starbucks-earnings-what-to-watch-1501156800", "keywords": ["Starbucks,SBUX,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,leisure,arts,hospitality"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 08:00:00", "news_title": "Party Time!

The S&P 500 rose 0.70 point, or less than 0.1%, to 2477.83.The reports picked up on a theme recurring during the second-quarter earnings season: Companies are benefiting from growing demand for goods and services by foreign buyers as well expectations for faster global growth with continued low inflation.The belief in corporate earnings has helped propel markets to new highs for the past year. Recent earnings periods have helped solidify that view.Earnings from America\u2019s largest companies have in large part helped keep the market rally going in the face of political uncertainty at home and abroad.Profits at companies in the S&P 500 rose 14% in the first three months of the year, and second-quarter earnings are projected to have climbed 8.2% versus the prior-year period, according to FactSet.\u201cEarnings in general have been very good,\u201d said       Paul Brigandi,        managing director and head of trading at Direxion Investments, an exchange-traded fund provider. \u201cThat\u2019s fueled the continued optimism in the market.\u201dThe declining dollar is also helping drive earnings higher. U.S. exports become cheaper to foreign buyers when the dollar\u2019s value falls.The U.S. currency slid again Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged. Many analysts don\u2019t expect the Fed to raise rates again until December, and a slowdown in inflation could keep the dollar under pressure.With the Fed\u2019s commentary suggesting the central bank will keep rates low for the time being, investors say U.S. stocks should keep eking out gains, provided that corporate earnings continue to be supportive.The Dow Industrials rose 97.58 points, or 0.5%, to 21711.01 on Wednesday., setting another new high.Coca-Cola Co.       Chief Financial Officer       Kathy Waller       cited the \u201cslightly better currency environment\u201d as a reason the company was raising its earnings forecast for the full year, saying Wednesday it expects adjusted earnings per share to be flat to down 2%, compared with guidance of a 1% to 3% decline from the year prior. It shares climbed 1.1% to $45.74.\u201cClearly a weaker dollar is helpful there,\u201d       Fredrik Eliasson,        the sales and marketing chief at railroad company             CSX Corp.      , said on an earnings call last week, referring to the company\u2019s coal-exports business. The company transports U.S. exporters\u2019 freight. \u201cAnd I think as we look at some of the other markets, we will see some of those benefits. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a lot of it yet, but anytime we have a little bit of weaker dollar, it does help them.\u201dThe ICE Dollar index, which measures the currency against six peers, is down about 8.6% this year at its lowest level in 13 months. The euro, which is heavily weighted in the index, has been a standout performer, rising almost 12% against the dollar this year.The dollar has tumbled in 2017 after a rally that followed the U.S. presidential election, when investors bet on faster growth and higher inflation under the Trump administration. Tepid data on inflation, auto and retail sales have pressured the U.S. currency recently, and investors and analysts have tempered expectations for President Donald Trump\u2019s policy agenda.The Fed has penciled in one more rate increase this year, but some investors believe that plan will be thwarted by persistently weak inflation, which has continued to undershoot the central bank\u2019s annual target of 2%. The fed funds futures market, where traders bet on the future rate path, suggests a 49% probability of at least one more increase before the end of the year, according to data from             CME Group.A weaker dollar, if it lasts, could further fuel earnings gains in the coming quarters. If the ICE Dollar Index ends 2017 about where it is now, the drop for the year would lift per-share earnings in the S&P 500 by roughly 4% in 2018, according to Morgan Stanley, which estimates that profits increase 1% for every 2% fall in the dollar.Some experts say the dollar is poised to fall further, particularly if Mr. Trump, facing resistance to his economic agenda, attempts to use the currency as a tool to help the economy grow faster. He could do so by, \u201cjawboning the dollar further down and instituting policies that are more dollar depreciative in nature,\u201d said       Adrian Helfert,        head of global fixed income at Amundi Smith Breeden.Mr. Trump praised Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       for keeping the dollar \u201cnot too strong,\u201d in an interview with The Wall Street Journal Tuesday.There are risks for companies banking on a lift from currency movements. If the Trump administration chooses to pursue protectionist trade policies that provoke tit-for-tat tariffs, it could undermine the advantages of a weaker dollar by adding other costs for exporters. Mr. Trump, for example, is considering whether to block steel imports, telling the Journal Tuesday that he would take his time to make a decision.Many firms hedge their currency exposure to reduce its impact on earnings. Toy company             Hasbro Inc.,       for example, hedges nearly three quarters of its costs, Chief Financial Officer       Deborah Thomas       said on an earnings call Monday.\u201cTo the extent we haven\u2019t hedged, we should get some benefit from it. But on a full year basis, again, we really hedge to protect the pricing that we offered to our retailers,\u201d she said.Some said a stronger global economy was helping results.       M. Keith Waddell,        chief financial officer at staffing agency             Robert Half International Inc.,       cited a strong operating environment outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, on an earnings call Tuesday afternoon. The stronger euro, he said, was simply \u201ceven more icing.\u201d\u2014Amrith Ramkumar contributed to this article.Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Global Sales, Weak Dollar Lift U.S. Corporate Profits.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/party-time-weak-dollar-unleashes-record-stock-run-1501156803", "keywords": ["Boeing,BA,Hershey,HSY,CME Group,CME,Priceline,PCLN,Robert Half International,RHI,Coca-Cola,KO,CSX,Hasbro,HAS,Facebook,FB,Morgan Stanley,MS,Janet Yellen,Jim Tierney,M.

INTC 0.27%       is scheduled to announce second-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:EARNINGS FORECAST: For the quarter that ended in June, analysts expect Intel to report earnings of 68 cents a share on an adjusted basis, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, up 15% from 59 cents the same quarter a year earlier. Intel\u2019s adjusted earnings exclude restructuring charges and certain items arising from acquisitions.REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $14.4 billion for the quarter, up roughly 6% from $13.5 billion the year-earlier quarter.WHAT TO WATCH:DATA CENTER GROWTH: Not long ago, Intel expected annual revenue growth in the midteens in the segment that sells chips for the computers that drive cloud services, network providers, and corporate operations. But data-center growth slowed to about 6% in the first quarter as sales to enterprises slowed amid strengthening competition from rival             Nvidia Corp.      , whose graphics processors are well suited to emerging artificial intelligence tasks. Boosting data-center growth is \u201cNo. 1, the most important thing,\u201d said Srini Pajjuri, an analyst with Macquarie Capital.PC COMPETITION: The latest quarter was the first full reporting period in years in which Intel faced meaningful competition in personal-computer chips, products that helped drive more than half of total revenue last year.             Advanced Micro Devices Inc.       in March began shipping its Ryzen chips for desktop computers, which were roughly 40% of the PC market in 2016, according to research firm             Gartner Inc.       Although AMD\u2019s products haven\u2019t had much time to prove themselves in the market, investors will be looking for perspective on their impact, according to       Tom Sepenzis       of Northland Securities Inc.NEW MARKETS: Intel is investing heavily in new markets to spur growth as PC sales flag and data centers diversify, and investors will be on the lookout for signs that returns are coming, said Matt Ramsay of             Canaccord Genuity Group Inc.       Shareholders will watch for information about sales, profit margins, and competitive positioning of memory products, a segment the company has said it expects to become profitable by 2019. They will also want to know about the competitive position of             Mobileye                   NV, a $15.3 billion acquisition that hasn\u2019t yet closed, relative to rivals pushing toward fully autonomous vehicles.

The company reported overall growth in volumes around the world for the quarter. Earnings, stripping out one-off gains or losses, beat analysts\u2019 expectations. AB InBev shares were up 5.9% in Brussels on Thursday.Still, AB InBev\u2019s longer-term struggles in the key U.S. market threaten to overshadow those shorter-term gains.In May, the company said it was launching one of the largest capital investment programs in U.S. brewing history, pouring close to $500 million into its U.S. operations this year and a total of $2 billion through 2020. AB InBev\u2019s sales in the U.S. have fallen as American consumers shift away from domestic lagers toward craft beers, Mexican imports, wine and spirits.That new spending follows previous efforts at turning around Bud Light and Budweiser, AB InBev\u2019s namesake beers. Earlier this year, the company launched a fresh Bud Light marketing campaign, \u201cFamous Among Friends.\u201dPitched as a down-to-earth homage to the large and small moments of friendship, it followed a more over-the-top campaign, \u201cThe Bud Light Party,\u201d that featured comedians       Seth Rogen       and       Amy Schumer       but failed to improve sales.More recently, Bud Light has sponsored a \u201cDive Bar Tour\u201d of Lady Gaga performances across the country. It is rolling out more marketing around its \u201cFriends\u201d campaign later this summer and into the fall.AB InBev said it has seen some improvement from those efforts, but was disappointed in the steep market share decline. Bud Light lost nine-tenths of a percentage point of market share in the second quarter of 2017, a decline that has accelerated sharply from the half percentage point it lost through all of 2016.In the U.S., \u201cwe\u2019ve seen additional pressure in the premium sector, especially for Bud Light,\u201d Chief Financial Officer       Felipe Dutra       said Thursday. Still, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201dBud Light remains by far America\u2019s favorite beer by sales, but the second-quarter drop continues years of declines. Mr. Dutra said the company needs to \u201cto balance the equation in terms of share and profitability.\u201dThe company also recently rolled out marketing aimed at some key Hispanic markets and is releasing a handful of beers it markets as \u201ccraft,\u201d to compete with the hundreds of smaller brewers that have popped up across the U.S. in recent years. It said this portfolio gained market share. It didn\u2019t provide details.The Budweiser brand, meanwhile, lost over a third of a percentage point of market share in the quarter despite its own marketing push. Last year, and again this year, it rebranded cans and packaging of Budweiser with a special \u201cAmerica\u201d logo. The move\u2014which first came ahead of last year\u2019s presidential campaign\u2014drew controversy, but the company said in May it would do it again this year, through late summer.Mr. Dutra said the company was seeing \u201cpositive momentum\u201d behind the campaign.Overall sales volume in North America fell 1.1% in the quarter from a year ago. Margins in the U.S. increased, however, as the company\u2019s portfolio of more-expensive beers, including Michelob Ultra and Stella Artois, performed well.Outside the U.S., AB InBev had better news. It said overall net profit rose to $1.5 billion in the quarter, from $152 million a year earlier. Adjusted core earnings, which strip out one-time gains or losses, rose 12%, to $5.35 billion as the company benefited from higher prices and additional cost savings from its acquisition of SABMiller.AB InBev said the integration of SAB \u201ccontinues to go as planned,\u201d with savings of $335 million from the combination in the period. That has led some analysts to suggest the company could wring out more than the overall $2.8 billion in cost savings the company is targeting in the deal.Gains in Mexico, South Africa and Australia lifted revenue to $14.18 billion, a rise of 5%, excluding the effects of currency swings and acquisitions. Brazil saw core profit decline for a sixth straight quarter as the brewer\u2019s second largest market emerges slowly from a prolonged recession.AB InBev said its full-year expectations of an acceleration of revenue growth remains unchanged despite increased volatility in some key markets.Write to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ab-inbev-profit-jumps-despite-falling-u-s-market-share-1501137945", "keywords": ["american light beer,belgian beer,belgian brewer,budweiser,corona,craft beers,inbev,stella artois ,Anheuser-Busch InBev,ABI.BT,BUD,SABMiller,SAB.LN,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,market share,industrial news,selection of top stories,trends,analysis,suggested reading   industry news,suggested reading \u2013 food,beverages,tobacco,food,brewing,alcoholic beverages,drinks,consumer goods"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 07:45:00", "news_title": "TSG Consumer-Backed Maker of Sandwiches Explores a Sale", "content": "Raybern Foods LLC, a producer of ready-to-heat sandwiches backed by one of the oldest consumer products-focused private-equity firms, is weighing a sale, said people familiar with the matter, as the food-and-beverage sector continues to experience a robust level of deal making.The TSG Consumer Partners-backed company is projected to generate about $10 million of 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, said the people.

That\u2019s an average of nearly $19 million per team or, in total, enough to field four full rosters.The flush coffers highlight a peculiar reality across the league this year: Most teams in the league could be better. They chose not to be.To put it another way: This is tanking, 2017 style.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. The NFL\u2019s salary cap for this season\u2014a record $167 million per team\u2014should have, in theory, produced a spending bonanza. In some instances, it did. But most teams simply added the surplus to their rainy-day funds.This is possible because of a provision in the collective-bargaining agreement that requires teams to spend 89% of their caps, but measured over a four-year window. This year marks the beginning of a new four-year period so, in effect, all teams begin this season with the option to squirrel away cash. And they are seizing that opportunity.Teams argue they are simply managing the system. Others say it\u2019s concerning\u2014most notably the players, who want those extra dollars to end up in their pockets.\u201cIf I\u2019m a season-ticket holder, why do I want to renew my tickets if my team isn\u2019t even trying to win?\u201d said Eric Winston, a Cincinnati Bengals tackle and president of the NFL Players Association.Adds long-time NFL executive Bill Polian: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be right if you\u2019re going to follow this approach. If they\u2019re not right, they really have cheated the fans.\u201dIt is undeniable that the NFL\u2019s salary-cap system rewards tanking more than ever.In the past, the main payoff from tanking was a high draft pick to be used on a franchise quarterback or other potentially transformative player. Now teams have increasingly embraced the ability to also stockpile tens of millions of dollars that, theoretically, can be spent once the team is in a push for the playoffs or even the Super Bowl.\u201cThat\u2019s the key word: flexibility,\u201d said Paraag Marathe, chief strategy officer of the 49ers. But he adds, \u201cyou don\u2019t win the Lombardi for having the most cap room.\u201dExcept if they did hand out Super Bowl titles for managing the cap, San Francisco would be scheduled for a ring-fitting. The 49ers enter the season with $67 million in cap room\u2014the most in the league. Or, to put it another way, they could afford to help their neighbors pay for Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, and still have millions to spare.Of San Francisco\u2019s cash reserve, almost $39 million is the result of carryover from prior years. The Browns, with more than $50 million in carryover, lead the league in that department.And it\u2019s no coincidence that these two teams had the two worst records in the NFL last season. Both teams have been undergoing major rebuilds\u2014so with the choice over the past few years of spending more to prop up a bad team, or to have even more to spend down the road, they chose the latter. Which explains both why they have struggled so much and why they have reasons to be optimistic going forward.In some respects, they\u2019re already seeing the benefits. Both signed a bevy of free agents this offseason\u2014and still have a stockpile of cash in reserve. And the Browns used some of their flexibility to net a second-round draft pick when they used a chunk of their cap room to take on quarterback Brock Osweiler, and his mega contract, from the Texans.The idea of successfully timing a spending spree isn\u2019t far-fetched. After the 2015 season, the Raiders had some of the most money to spend in the league\u2014and they had to spend to reach the 89% salary cap floor after years of building slowly around quarterback Derek Carr. The Raiders signed four stars to rich deals last offseason, then proceeded to make their first playoff appearance in more than a decade.One of the main reasons so many teams have reached a position to build such fluffy cushions is how much the cap has gone up. This season alone, it rose $12 million. The $167 million cap is $47 million higher than in 2012.The problem, at least as viewed from the other side of the negotiating table, is that every dollar a team rolls over is a dollar that didn\u2019t get paid to a player here and now. On average, teams have about $5 million more in cap room than they did this time last year. So of the extra $12 million teams could spend this year, more than 40% got tucked away.\u201cWhen you see these numbers out there,\u201d says Kyle Dolan, an agent with the firm Priority Sports, \u201cit\u2019s staggering and a little bit frustrating.\u201dWhether the floor for individual teams is too low or if the four-year period is too long is something that will be examined before the next CBA talks, Winston said. The NBA, for example, has a salary floor that teams have to meet every single season.Yet there is an upside for players who hit free agency in a different part of the spending cycle. For example: If Kirk Cousins hits free agency next offseason, any number of teams could make him the NFL\u2019s highest-paid player without having to do a bit of belt-tightening to afford it. In the meantime, a swath of lower- and middle-tier NFL players are paying the price. As Winston put it, \u201cThe ability to roll over will always have a positive effect for one person and a negative effect for another.\u201dWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfls-new-tanking-strategy-save-till-next-year-1501155764", "keywords": ["cleveland browns,football,nfl,nfl salary cap,oakland raiders,salary cap ,san francisco 49ers,american football,sports,routine general news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 07:39:00", "news_title": "Japanese Opposition Leader Resigns", "content": "TOKYO\u2014The head of Japan\u2019s main opposition party resigned abruptly for failing to boost its election prospects despite the scandals afflicting the government of Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe.Renho\u2019s       resignation Thursday after only 10 months as leader of the Democratic Party highlights the weakness of Japan\u2019s national opposition parties, which makes Mr. Abe\u2019s biggest political risk potential unrest within his own Liberal Democratic Party.Mr. Abe is struggling to deflect allegations, which he denies, that his government provided favors for friends. Opinion polls have shown support for his cabinet below 30% for the first time since he took power in 2012. He has said he will replace some cabinet members early next month, a shuffle widely seen as meant to shore up his approval ratings.Japanese media reported Thursday that Defense Minister       Tomomi Inada       would resign as soon as Friday to take responsibility for contradictory explanations she and other officials gave about Japanese peacekeepers in South Sudan. A Defense Ministry spokesman declined to comment.Renho, who goes by a single name, has led criticism of Mr. Abe and Ms. Inada in Parliament, but her party has also suffered in opinion polls. It was routed along with Mr. Abe\u2019s party in a recent election for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly as voters instead flocked to a new local party led by Tokyo Gov.       Yuriko Koike.In a brief televised news conference on Thursday, Renho said that election contributed to her decision. She also alluded to persistent policy differences within the party that analysts say undermine its prospects of gaining strong public support.\u201cI lacked the power to lead,\u201d Rehno said. \u201cI hope party executives can strengthen the party\u2019s unifying force.\u201dMembers of the Democratic Party cover a wide spectrum of political views. Under Renho it formed closer ties with other opposition parties\u2014including the Communist Party, which conservative members of the Democratic Party opposed.Michael Cucek,        an expert on Japanese politics at Temple University in Tokyo, said the party has no strong leadership candidates and would likely remain fractured.\u201cI have no sense it has any viability,\u201d he said.The departure of Renho, 49 years old, and the expected resignation of Ms. Inada are setbacks for high-level political representation by women in Japan. Women make up only around 10% Parliament, compared with a global average of about 23%, according to data compiled by the World Bank.Renho was the first woman to lead the opposition since       Takako Doi,        who served as leader of the Socialist Party from 1986 to 1991. Japan has never had a female prime minister.One reason more women don\u2019t progress in politics, said       Hiroe Makiyama,        a lawmaker in the Democratic Party, is because it is often harder for them to join the major relationship-building activity for members of Parliament: going out drinking together in the evenings.\u201cIt\u2019s easier for men if they\u2019re suddenly invited for drinks because they just ask their wives to take care of their kids,\u201d Ms. Makiyama said.Renho, who was born to a Japanese mother and a Taiwanese father, has also been dogged since last year by news that she held Taiwanese as well as Japanese citizenship. Japan doesn\u2019t allow dual citizenship, although there is no penalty for it.Renho last week made part of her family register public to prove she had renounced her Taiwanese citizenship. She said the issue hadn\u2019t contributed to her decision to resign.\u2014Koji Everard contributed to this article.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/japanese-opposition-leader-resigns-1501153661", "keywords": ["abe scandal,japanese parliament,japanese politics,japan opposition,japan opposition leader,japan resignation,Shinzo Abe,Renho,political,general news,political appointments,terminations,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 07:30:00", "news_title": "Driverless Trucks Are Barreling Ahead", "content": "Jeff Runions has driven trucks for more than 20 years. But when he got into the driver\u2019s seat of a big rig recently, his hands weren\u2019t on the wheel.Mr. Runions tests trucks for Starsky Robotics, a venture-backed startup developing remote-controlled trucks, and he offers a glimpse into the future of trucking.\u201cI wasn\u2019t scared,\u201d said Mr. Runions, 58. \u201cYou think it\u2019d be bad but this is like a normal thing for me now.\u201dAutonomous trucks are expected to be ready to hit the roads sooner than their passenger-vehicle equivalent, because cruising long distances on highways is less complex than travel on local streets.When they arrive, driverless trucks could upend the existing trucking industry even as it transforms related businesses, from agriculture to shipping to e-commerce.\u201cWith autonomous, pricing will come down dramatically,\u201d said Jim Scheinman, founding managing director at Maven Ventures, which invested in truck startup Embark. \u201cIf you\u2019re a shipper of goods and weren\u2019t using trucks because of cost, that now goes away.\u201dEmbark recently raised a $15 million Series A led by Data Collective with participation from YC Continuity, Maven Ventures and SV Angel. Starsky has raised $3.75 million in seed funding. Otto, meanwhile was acquired by Uber Technologies Inc. for $680 million.Other companies with similar initiatives under way include Daimler North America and Google\u2019s Waymo.Just how many U.S. trucking jobs might disappear\u2014and how quickly\u2014is a matter of debate in a workforce estimated at 3.5 million drivers, plus another 7.3 million people in nondriving roles, according to the American Trucking Associations.Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, co-founder and chief executive of San Francisco-based Starsky, envisions fleets of remotely controlled trucks. While not fully autonomous, that may be the quickest way to get these vehicles on the road, he says. The trucks would be autonomous enough so that multiple vehicles could be controlled by a person acting like an air-traffic controller.Another venture-backed startup, Peloton Technology Inc., aims to have trucks drive clustered together in a bunch, saving fuel by taking advantage of the draft created by the lead vehicle. The company raised $60 million in April.But Embark says it is testing a fully autonomous truck, with initial deployment expected in less than five years, according to Chief Executive Alex Rodrigues. The company envisions human truckers behind the wheel in city driving, with computers in control on the highway.In recent focus groups analyzing workforce changes, truck drivers didn\u2019t seem overly concerned about the transformation, according to the Shift Commission, a joint research project by Bloomberg and the New America think tank. \u201cI do worry a little bit about it,\u201d one driver said. Another said, \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take time. It\u2019s going to take about, what, 100 years? 80 years? 60 years?\u201dFor many in the industry, the potential impact of autonomous technology has been hard to gauge. \u201cWe have a lot of questions\u2014unanswered questions\u2014before we can form an opinion,\u201d said Norita Taylor, a spokeswoman of the Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association.Even if automation doesn\u2019t have a negative impact on the economy, it could become a politically charged issue because it employs millions, said       Roy Bahat,        head of Bloomberg Beta.\u201cI do think this is a possible flashpoint between technology progress and how the economy works,\u201d he said.Some proponents of autonomous trucks play down a threat to jobs, saying trucking companies today struggle with a driver shortage for a job seen as having many undesirable qualities. \u201cThe shortage has gotten worse the last couple years,\u201d Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.But some drivers dispute that argument as artificially created by the industry.\u201cWe reject the notion of a shortage,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s a myth that\u2019s been bandied about for decades. There\u2019s no shortage of truck drivers. What there is instead is a high turnover--as much as 100% or more per year. That\u2019s not a shortage, that\u2019s retention.\u201dOthers such as Matt Ocko, co-managing partner at Data Collective and an investor in Embark, believe the technology could bring truckers smarter vehicles to use to their advantage.Many tech and trucking firms don\u2019t have an idea what should be done if jobs for truck drivers get eliminated.\u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible to introduce the technology without a point of view of what drivers could be doing\u201d when their jobs are eliminated, Mr. Bahat said.Unlike some other industries, the trucking industry is highly fragmented, with 90% of the trucking companies in the industry having less than six trucks. That makes it vulnerable to be upended, industry watchers say. Larger incumbent truck fleets are especially ripe for disruption, said Drew McElroy, chief executive of trucking marketplace Transfix.That could happen sooner rather than later. Mr. Scheinman of Maven Ventures said he recently accompanied Embark for a one-hour test drive and the human driver only had to consider taking the wheel once as another car drew near.\u201cIt was amazing and unbelievable,\u201d Mr. Scheinman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not if, it\u2019s when.\u201dWrite to Tomio Geron at tomio.geron@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/driverless-trucks-are-barreling-ahead-1501155002", "keywords": ["analyses,commentaries,opinions"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 07:24:00", "news_title": "Southwest Sees Slower Growth Than Other Airlines", "content": "Southwest Airlines Co.

Yesterday\u2019s earnings call\u2014after the company reported a 71% profit spike\u2014was no exception. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg criticized the industry\u2019s focus on \u201cproxy metrics\u201d like how long someone watches a video and brand lift. \u201cWhat really matters is you see an ad and you buy a product, you see an ad and you drive a car off a lot.\u201d Suggesting TV-like metrics are missing the point is an interesting stance for a company trying to take ad dollars from TV as it launches a video section with original programming.\u2014Why this matters\u2014Ultimately, nobody can argue with Facebook that the most important measure for any brand is whether their ads drove sales. But other metrics play an important role too in working out whether budgets are being spent effectively, and Facebook has had its share of measurement mishaps and viewability disappointments over the past year. Getting someone to \u201cdrive a car off a lot\u201d can take years of marketing, offline and online. How do you determine what percentage of that purchase decision was influenced by a Facebook ad?

Viacom is out of the running, but Discovery is still in talks to snap up the cable TV programmer, WSJ reported. Why should advertisers be watching closely?

The six plants include two owned by Brazilian meatpacking giant             JBS SA       and one partly owned by Chinese firm New Hope.\u201cThis is a significant issue: these six plants represent up to 50% of our exports of beef to China,\u201d said       Steven Ciobo,        Australia\u2019s minister for trade, tourism and investment. \u201cIt\u2019s tens of millions of [Australian] dollars, and potentially over A$100 million (US$80 million), of trade that could be affected.\u201dMeat that was en route to China ahead of the suspension will be allowed through customs, said Mr. Ciobo, who added that he couldn\u2019t comment on how long it could take for the situation to be addressed. The firms have been given 45 days to rectify issues.He said those issues included labels on the outside of boxes not matching those on products inside.China\u2019s Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, which reported the ban on its website, couldn't be reached for comment.The ban comes a few months after China, along with a number of other countries, suspended imports of Brazilian beef after a scare over alleged corruption in Brazil\u2019s sanitary-inspection services. That suspension was lifted less than a week after Beijing announced it. It included operations from JBS, the world\u2019s largest meat producer.The short-term impact from China\u2019s ban on some Australian meat exports is expected to be limited given that China is only the fourth-largest market for such shipments, accounting for some 10% of Australia\u2019s meat exports. The U.S., Japan and South Korea are larger recipients of Australian meat. But damage could be more extensive if it persists, particularly as Australia has been losing market share in China to Brazilian meat.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s having an impact on prices yet, but we\u2019ll have to watch that space,\u201d said       Angus Gidley-Baird,        meat analyst at Rabobank in Australia. \u201cDepending on how long it\u2019s in place, the number of plants involved, it could start to have an effect.\u201dAustralian cattle prices have already fallen in recent weeks as drought in parts of the country has led to an increase in the number of animals being sent to slaughter.

That came after the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy statement, which indicated officials had become more concerned about a recent slowdown in domestic inflation.While the dollar index turned higher by late New York trading to be up 0.3%, the dollar\u2019s slide this week extends a run of weakness for the greenback in recent months that has fully reversed its surge in the wake of U.S. elections last November.The euro and Australian dollar have both surged 11% against the U.S. dollar this year, while the British pound has gained 5.8% and the Japanese yen is up 5.2%. Intraday Thursday, the Aussie dollar hit its highest level since May 2015 at 80.2 U.S. cents, while the Chinese central bank set the yuan at its highest level against the dollar since Oct. 18 at 6.7307 per dollar.The Fed\u2019s recent caution, as well as waning optimism over the pace at which the Trump administration\u2019s economic policies might take effect, have contributed to the dollar\u2019s recent weakness. Investors now see a less-than-50% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates again this year, according to             CME Group Inc.       data.For central bankers in places such as Europe and Japan that have fought long struggles against low inflation, the dollar\u2019s weakness adds another wrinkle. A stronger local currency tends to drag on inflation because it makes imported goods and services less expensive and it can weigh on growth for trade-reliant economies, as it makes a country\u2019s exports more expensive in dollar terms.\u201cClearly, both yen and euro appreciation have been unwelcome\u201d given low inflation around the world,       Joachim Fels,        global economic adviser at fund manager Pacific Investment Management Co., said in a note on Wednesday.While central bankers tend to couch any concerns in cautious language, several have noted currency moves in recent communications.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said last week that \u201cthe repricing of the exchange rate has received some attention\u201d during the central bank\u2019s latest meeting.Mr. Draghi described the economic recovery in the eurozone as \u201crobust\u201d but also highlighted the region\u2019s low inflation, suggesting the bank\u2019s stimulus efforts could need to remain in place for a while longer. A stronger euro only complicates that calculus, because it should curb inflation.To be sure, several analysts argue that rising currencies can be taken as a sign that the global economy is in reasonable health, and that they shouldn\u2019t derail central bankers from any plans to tighten policy.\u201cThere seems to be some degree of consensus among global central banks that the forces that are capping price pressures are likely to be transitory,\u201d said       Todd Elmer,        head of G-10 FX strategy for Asia at Citi in Singapore.Still, for export-reliant economies like Japan, the yen\u2019s strength this year has given the central bank another headache. The Bank of Japan has been trying to raise the country\u2019s stubbornly low inflation for years by continuing to buy up trillions of yen of government bonds. Last week, though, it again pushed back the date when it expects to achieve its 2% inflation target.Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s central bank has described the gains in its currency against the U.S. dollar this year as \u201cnot helpful.\u201d Consumer prices rose more slowly than expected in the second quarter, according to data released Wednesday, prompting markets to wind back their expectations for when interest rates will be raised.Even if the Reserve Bank of Australia wants to join other central banks in raising interest rates, it is now effectively paralyzed, said       Michael Blythe,        chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \u201cThe RBA clearly is in no hurry to lift rates.\u2026Inflation remains dead in the water.\u201dCurrency gains haven\u2019t been confined to developed markets this year: Emerging-market currencies have soared as investors continue to plow money into stocks and bonds in those countries in search of higher returns. Some analysts say central banks in Asia could prove more tolerant of currency gains because their growth has been solid, driven by robust exports.The Korean won has rallied more than 8% against the dollar, while the Indian rupee is up 6% and the Brazilian real has gained about 3.7%.\u2014Chelsey Dulaney contributed to this article.Write to Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com and James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Dollar Puts Central Bankers In a Bind.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dollar-weakness-gives-worlds-central-bankers-new-headache-1501153890", "keywords": ["Federal Reserve,Donald Trump,Joachim Fels,Michael Blythe,Todd Elmer,Mario Draghi,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,euro zone,currency,economic news,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 07:00:00", "news_title": "Who Needs Life Insurance? Insurers Try Rewarding New Customers", "content": "JOHANNESBURG\u2014Trying to jump-start increasingly weak sales of life insurance, some of the world\u2019s larger insurers are looking to South Africa for a little vitality.An app-based activity-tracking and rewards program dubbed Vitality, created by South African financial-services and insurance company             Discovery Ltd.        DSY -0.49%      , aims to incentivize healthier behaviors with offers of reduced premiums, 50% off flights or 25% cash back on groceries.In most versions of the Vitality program, insurance customers earn points for activities such as visiting the gym and buying healthy foods, though the exact way it works differs by market. There are points for getting a flu shot, running a 10K or getting a mammogram. The more points customers collect, the higher their discounts.For insurance companies, the benefit often is simply getting younger people to buy life insurance.\u201cThe proportion of customers we\u2019re selling to that are first-time insurance buyers is much higher, and we\u2019re seeing more young people and slightly more females,\u201d said Brooks Tingle, senior vice president of marketing and strategy for insurance for U.S.-based John Hancock, a unit of Canada\u2019s             Manulife Financial Corp.Since March 2015, Discovery, with a market capitalization of 88.24 billion South African rand ($6.75 billion), has signed agreements with much larger insurers including Manulife, Italy\u2019s             Assicurazioni Generali                   SpA and Hong Kong\u2019s             AIA Group Ltd.Discovery provides its partners around the world with the intellectual property\u2014proprietary data and technology\u2014for the Vitality program, and in return receives licensing fees and a share of the partners\u2019 resulting revenue or profits. Partners say the program attracts younger clientele\u2014often first-time buyers\u2014increases customer engagement and improves data collection. John Hancock offers Vitality as a $24-a-year add-on to life-insurance policies.Whether it saves companies money over the long term has yet to be seen: The major risk is that most insurance companies won\u2019t know for years whether it is successful financially, given the long-term nature of life insurance policies.There has been a proliferation of wellness programs from U.S. health insurers over the past decade, and their financial track record is mixed. Corporate analyses of return-on-investment, plus a series of lawsuits over privacy concerns, have recently led many companies to halt wellness programs, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.In life insurance, however, a product that is under pressure around the world, the need for a kick-start is immense. U.S. sales of individual life-insurance policies have declined by more than 40% since the 1980s, according to industry-funded research group Limra. In Europe, data from Insurance Europe, an insurance and reinsurance federation, also shows a steep decline.Big life insurance companies are joining with Vitality to help draw clientele back to the languishing market. In six of the countries pioneering the use of wellness programs with life insurance\u2014including Singapore, Austraila and the United Kingdom\u2014Discovery is a partner in more than half, according to a study by Reinsurnace Group of America Inc.Discovery\u2019s pitch to insurance firms is simple: It tells them its program identifies and incentivizes healthier customers, who will pay premiums for more years and get sick less often. Discovery\u2019s system also gives rewards for hitting fitness and health milestones, which often lead to higher levels of engagement. Vitality closes the pitch by arguing that a partnership with the firm is easier for insurers than coming up with their own proprietary platform.Vitality has \u201cpositively disrupted the insurance market,\u201d said Andrew Webb, Discovery European head in Munich, who works closely with Generali. \u201cIf one has a look at some of the initial metrics about type of clients we\u2019re attracting, as well as changing the behavior of existing clients, I think that\u2019s all going very well.\u201dGenerali, which insures some 55 million people around the world, says it has cut premiums for Vitality users: For instance, a 30-year-old bank clerk in Germany who used to pay \u20ac100 ($116) a month for occupational disability insurance through Generali would pay \u20ac95 for the same policy after activating Vitality.Generali launched Vitality in Germany embedded within a variety of term life and disability life insurance products a year ago, and since then sales of the plans offering Vitality have increased about 42%, Mr. Webb said. This year, Generali launched Vitality in France as an add-on to policies through large corporate employers. So far, more than 890 companies have activated the program for employees. Generali expects to launch Vitality in Austria later this year.Adrian Gore,        Discovery\u2019s chief executive, says overseas partnerships have recently become profitable for the company. And despite the immense amount of data being shared, insurers say privacy concerns from members have been limited, since life insurance clients already share so much personal information with providers.\u201cHas there been a pushback from clients? None,\u201d said Alain Peddle, deputy general manager at Ping An Health, a unit of Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd., in which Discovery purchased a stake in 2009. Ping An introduced a version of Vitality for its life-insurance offerings in September, and since then more than two million clients have signed up and are engaged in the program.\u201cThey key here in China is really about getting people to interact with us electronically,\u201d Mr. Peddle said.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-needs-life-insurance-insurers-try-rewarding-new-customers-1501153201", "keywords": ["life insurance,marketing,millennials,rewards program,wellness app,Discovery,DSY.JO,ZA:DSY,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,markets,corporate,industrial news,customer relationship management,usage,consumption statistics,insurance,full-line insurance,financial services"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 06:52:00", "news_title": "Today\u2019s Top Supply Chain and Logistics News From WSJ", "content": "Sign up: With one click, get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s        AMZN -2.88%       latest effort to take command of its fulfillment operations involves people\u2014lots and lots of people. The e-commerce giant is holding what\u2019s effectively a national jobs fair next week to fill 50,000 new positions at distribution centers and sorting sites in the U.S., the WSJ\u2019s Laura Stevens reports, giving the company an early start in setting up for the holiday rush. It also puts Amazon on track to swell its U.S. workforce to around 300,000 by next year, up from 30,000 in 2011 and closer to the payrolls of the big express parcel carriers,             United Parcel Service Inc.        UPS 0.94%       and             FedEx Corp.       The expansion is a result of the rapid growth in online sales and the crunch around the holidays as retailers and logistics scramble to handle a growing flood of packages. Finding the hires is proving tougher, with warehouse employment nearing a landmark 1 million U.S. jobs, according to federal figures, and Amazon looks like it is trying to corner the market for those workers.Norfolk Southern Corp.       may be the winner so far in rival             CSX Corp.\u2019s       drive to remake its freight rail operations. The railroad says it is winning over shippers in its eastern U.S. network just as CSX is struggling with service problems as the railroad cuts costs and streamlines its network, the WSJ\u2019s Paul Ziobro reports. The changes have disrupted operations for shippers, who Mr. Harrison says should brace for \u201ca little pain and suffering.\u201d Shifting volumes from one railroad to another is not easy, but Norfolk Southern says it has seen \u201csome business move over,\u201d and experts say others are looking for changes as they set long-term projects. Norfolk Southern says it will take the business at the right price, and that seemed to be the case in the second quarter.

Beijing-based             JD.com                   is trying to maintain growth by building on its logistics network with faster deliveries and adding to its product line to appeal to more affluent consumers, the WSJ\u2019s Liza Lin and Alyssa Abkowitz report, even as bigger rival             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.       rolls out its own international expansion plan. They are responding to changes in their core market: China\u2019s e-commerce business is expected to grow 19% this year, according to McKinsey & Co., down sharply from 74% growth in 2011. JD.com has outpaced the growth, building up its gross merchandise volume 40% in its first quarter ended March 31. With about twice JD.com\u2019s number of users, Alibaba and its big online shopping sites remain dominant in China. Some analysts believe bigger moves by the smaller competitor could trigger a price war, with Alibaba rolling out liberal discounts to retain customers.The internal combustion engine could be losing steam. The U.K. is planning to ban the sale of cars powered by traditional engines by 2040, joining other European regulators in a bold push toward populating roads with electric cars. The initiative follows a similar move by France and efforts by several European cities to ban or restrict diesel engines, the WSJ Eric Sylvers and John D. Stoll report, even as electric cars remain unpopular in the mass market.

The bank expects revenues to be lower for the full year than they were in 2016, when they fell 10% versus 2015.As the top line shrinks, Deutsche is doing better on costs. It cut 11% from its operating expenses and benefited from \u20ac1 billion less in charges for fines and legal costs, restructuring charges and impairments.Overall, that added up to first-half net income that was five-times higher than the first half last year. Sounds good, but that still meant a dreary 3.2% return on equity.Deutsche Bank has cut more than 4,600 staff, or 4.6%, since the end of June last year, but compensation costs were down just 1.4% because those who remain are getting better pay. More money is being put aside for bonuses this year in both investment banking and retail and private banking. That could improve morale after the big bonus cuts of last year.Equity trading bears the scars of that panic last September, when news of a very damaging potential fine from U.S. regulators sparked a selloff in Deutsche\u2019s stock and bonds. A string of hedge-fund clients pulled out of its prime brokerage business, costing the bank deposits and revenues.Some of those have returned, but equity trading revenues were still 28% down in the second quarter versus the same period last year. That compares with a 1% average rise among U.S. rivals, who reported last week.Deutsche\u2019s bond and currencies trading business, still the main revenue engine, was also down in the quarter, but by slightly less than U.S. rivals on average.There was little sign of improvement in German retail banking, where Deutsche has been talking about better competitive dynamics as small cooperative and mutually-owned savings banks suffer from negative interest rates.Deutsche said it is charging customers higher fees for their accounts without losing them to rivals and is attracting more deposits. It is hard to see that in the numbers. Overall net interest income in the division that contains retail banking was down 8% while total fee and commission income was flat.It is good that charges from restructuring, litigation and the bad bank are disappearing. But Deutsche seems more like a parched farmer praying for rain: a bank that will have to rely on better markets for growth rather than one that has the power to get there itself.Write to Paul J.

AMZN -2.85%       is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Amazon to earn $1.42 per share excluding certain items, compared with unadjusted results of $1.78 per share a year ago. The online retail giant forecast operating income of between $425 million and $1.07 billion, compared with $1.28 billion a year ago.REVENUE FORECAST: Quarterly revenue of $37.18 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $30.4 billion a year ago. Amazon said it expected sales of between $35.25 billion and $37.75 billion for the quarter.WHAT TO WATCH:WHOLE FOODS        WFM -0.10%      : Expect analysts to ask Amazon about its plans for its $13.7 billion acquisition, including debt, of             Whole Foods Market Inc.        WFM -0.10%       and how it might financially affect the online retailer. Plenty of speculation has swirled around how Amazon might use its new brick-and-mortar component, from delivery hubs to collecting customer data. In any event, the acquisition is likely to change the dynamics of Amazon\u2019s revenue mix and profitability\u2014Whole Foods\u2019 operating margins, at 5.5%, are higher than those of Amazon\u2019s North American retail business at 3%, Citi analysts noted at the time of the deal. Also, while online groceries have yet to take off for any player, the deal makes the Seattle-based retailer a major force in food overnight.M&A: Amazon\u2019s decision to buy Whole Foods has triggered a frenzy of speculation regarding what the online retail company\u2019s next acquisition target could be. Rival         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       has undertaken a string of small e-commerce acquisitions, most recently buying men\u2019s clothing brand Bonobos. However, Amazon has a reputation for looking at lots of companies and purchasing few. Executives may shed light on where the company\u2019s appetite is for further spending related to mergers and acquisitions.BRANDS: Dynamics between Amazon and brands are shifting dramatically, as demonstrated by two major brands\u2019 recent decisions to sell their products directly to the retailer:         Nike Inc.,       a longtime holdout that capitulated in exchange for better policing of the third-party marketplace, and         Sears Holdings Corp.\u2019sKenmore line, marking Amazon\u2019s first foray into directly selling major appliances. The company is continuing to expand rapidly to fit its ambitions, building new warehouses and raking in third-party seller fees. Executives may share some of their thinking on what these changes mean for Amazon\u2019s future plans.ANTITRUST: How big is too big? That question is drawing more attention as Amazon continues to grow. Amazon is giving U.S. antitrust enforcers more time to complete an early review of the planned tie-up with Whole Foods, refiling paperwork this week seeking government approval. The deal doesn\u2019t raise classic competition concerns because of the combined companies\u2019 relatively small grocery-market share. Still, advocates for strong antitrust enforcement have called for a close review of the deal. Amazon\u2019s head of world-wide consumer business,       Jeff Wilke,        addressed the concerns at a recent conference, saying the company has a relatively small share\u2014about 1%--of global retail and is still in the single digits in the U.S. \u201cOur job is to take care of customers, to be transparent, and to pass the scrutiny with flying colors, and I think we can,\u201d he said.Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-earnings-what-to-watch-1501149604", "keywords": ["2q amazon, preview, q2 earnings, results, what to watch,Amazon.com,AMZN,Whole Foods Market,WFM,Whole Foods Markets,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings projections,corporate,industrial news,wooden furniture,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,etailing,consumer goods,e-commerce,furniture,online service providers,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 06:00:00", "news_title": "Electronic Arts Earnings: What to Watch   ", "content": "Electronic Arts Inc.        EA -1.25%       is set to report earnings for its fiscal first quarter after the close of trading Thursday. The videogame publisher usually doesn\u2019t release a major game in the April-through-June period, making it one of the quieter quarters of the company\u2019s year.EA shares are up nearly 48% since the start of the year through Wednesday afternoon, part of an industrywide rally tied to growing sales of high-margin, digitally delivered content.Here is what to look for in its quarterly report:EARNINGS FORECAST: EA is expected to report adjusted profit of 27 cents a share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, up from 7 cents a year earlier. The numbers exclude certain items Wall Street and the company don\u2019t consider a regular part of doing business. Under U.S. accounting rules, EA expects a profit of about $1.93 a share, up from $1.40 a year earlier.REVENUE FORECAST: Adjusted revenue is expected to climb 13% to $768.5 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, from $682 million a year earlier. U.S. accounting rules require videogame companies defer some revenue from certain online-enabled games. Overall, EA expects about $1.43 billion in revenue, up from $1.27 billion a year ago.CONTINUING \u2018EFFECT\u2019: While EA didn\u2019t release a major game, finance chief       Blake Jorgensen       has said $53 million in sales from \u201cMass Effect: Andromeda,\u201d which came out at the end of March, would be deferred to the first quarter. Despite criticism during the launch over technical glitches, Wedbush Securities thinks the science-fiction game could sell nearly as many units over its lifetime as its predecessor, \u201cMass Effect 3.\u201d That came out in March 2012 and sold close to six million copies as of January, according to EA.MOBILE MOMENTUM: Revenue from EA\u2019s mobile games rose at least 11% from a year earlier to $183.2 million, according to estimates from Sensor Tower Inc. The analytics firm collects only in-game spending data from             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       and             Apple Inc.\u2019s       app stores and doesn\u2019t capture revenue from other app stores or advertising. It estimates revenue from \u201cStar Wars: Galaxy of Heroes\u201d increased by 35%, accounting for about a third of EA\u2019s total mobile revenue and helping to offset declines in games such as \u201cThe Simpsons: Tapped Out.\u201dEXTRA, EXTRAS: Analysts expect EA to continue to benefit from strong demand for digital \u201cextras\u201d\u2014content designed to enhance console and PC games already on the market. Sales of such goods for \u201cUltimate Team,\u201d a feature inside EA\u2019s sports games, and \u201cBattlefield 1\u201d are expected to be the biggest contributors to overall digital revenue. A year ago, EA said this area of its business\u2014which also includes full-game downloads, mobile games and subscriptions\u2014generated $689 million in revenue.CONSERVATIVE START: EA isn\u2019t likely to raise its full-year guidance this early into the new fiscal year, according to analysts. \u201cManagement prefers to start off conservatively and bank its upside from the start of the year,\u201d MKM Partners said in a recent note to investors. In its last earnings report, EA said it expected revenue of about $5.08 billion and per-share earnings of $3.57 for fiscal 2018.

Nestl\u00e9 warned that organic growth would likely be in the \u201clower half\u201d of the 2-4% range this year.The results underscore the challenges facing Chief Executive Mark Schneider. He assumed the post in January and quickly ditched a longstanding target for annual organic growth of 5% to 6%, which Nestl\u00e9 has missed for four-straight years.In June, billionaire activist investor Daniel Loeb\u2019s Third Point LLC said it had taken a $3.5 billion 1.25% stake in Nestl\u00e9 and pressed for changes, including the sale of non-core assets such as Nestl\u00e9\u2019s stake in L\u2019Or\u00e9al. Days later, Nestl\u00e9 announced a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback program and said it would orient its capital spending toward high-growth parts of its business, including pet care, infant nutrition, coffee and bottled water.In a sign of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s difficult environment, the company reported first-half revenue of 43 billion francs on Thursday, compared with 43.2 billion francs in the same period of 2016, slightly below analysts\u2019 forecasts of 43.8 billion francs.Net profit came in at 4.9 billion francs, up 19% on the year, although the sharp rise was partly because of a one-off tax adjustment last year. Analysts had expected profit at 4.8 billion francs.Analysts at Baader Helvea Equity Research said the results could increase pressure on Nestl\u00e9 to make changes and said new steps could be announced at Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Capital Markets Day in September.Nestl\u00e9 shares fell by over 1% early on Thursday, before paring some losses.The company blamed warm summer weather for weakening spending on items such as pizza, with expenditure on water failing to provide the offset it has in the past.Nestl\u00e9 also continued to face difficulty raising prices in key markets, despite lower deflationary pressures.\u201cWe have seen some signs of improvement in western countries,\u201d said Nestl\u00e9 chief financial officer       Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roger       in a conference call. \u201cWe have less negative prices, but we still have negative prices.\u201dIn June, Nestl\u00e9 put its U.S. confectionery business, which includes Butterfinger and Crunch candy bars, up for sale. Though candy makes up a small slice of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s U.S. sales, the decision underscored the company\u2019s focus on its more profitable divisions like coffee and water.Write to Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-posts-lackluster-growth-amid-investor-pressure-1501138256", "keywords": ["consumer goods, l'oreal,nestle, nestle share buyback,shareholder activism, third point,Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,Third Point,ownership changes,management,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,divestments,food,beverages,tobacco,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,financial services,food products,hedge funds,investing,securities"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 05:48:00", "news_title": "Talking Speakers Just Arrived\u2014and There\u2019s Already a Bubble", "content": "Smart speakers powered by artificial intelligence are one of the hottest consumer products in the U.S. Amazon.com Inc.,             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL -1.49%       Google and             Apple Inc.        AAPL -0.60%       are all offering competing products. If they think that\u2019s a crowded field, they should come to China.Within a day of Apple announcing its voice-activated HomePod speaker in June, Song Shaopeng, founder of smart-speaker technology startup Sugr Electronics Corp., fielded calls from three electronics manufacturers with the same request. All wanted his help to make HomePod-like products.Li Haibo, vice president of China\u2019s biggest online audio-sharing site Ximalaya, says that out of 300-plus speaker makers that license Ximalaya\u2019s audio content, more than 100 have switched to making smart speakers. In Shenzhen, China\u2019s tech hub, Mr. Li says he\u2019s approached by so many smart-speaker startups, all within a 20-minute walk from each other, that he often schedules a full day\u2019s meeting at the same coffee shop.China\u2019s big tech companies are also in the game. This month, e-commerce company             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.        BABA -1.95%       and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. each launched their smart-speaker models. Social media behemoth             Tencent Holdings Ltd.       is working on something it\u2019s calling a \u201csmart box,\u201d according to a senior executive. Search engine             Baidu Inc.       unveiled an Amazon Alexa-like voice system that powers hardware.From tech giants to consumer electronics makers, all see voice-activated products as the gateway to a future where platforms animated by artificial intelligence will power homes, cars and offices. To some, this first wave in the AI revolution already looks frothy.\u201cThis is definitely a bubble,\u201d says Mr. Li of Ximalaya, which launched a smart speaker in June.China\u2019s online population is barely growing\u20142.9% last year by official data\u2014and the number of hours spent online hasn\u2019t budged in two years, 3.8 hours a day. Internet companies need new ways to engage users, and smart speakers look like the next big thing.For the internet giants, voice command is seen as a critical technology, the new interface between humans and computers, after keyboards and touch screens. For ambitious startups, the smart speaker is an opportunity, like apps were at the advent of the mobile internet age. For electronics manufacturers, the smart speaker may keep production lines and sales humming, just as laptops, tablets, smartphones and drones did.An added inducement to jump in is that Amazon\u2019s, Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s smart speakers don\u2019t offer voice interfaces in Chinese\u2014and those are hard to build.Past product booms have set off a now predictable cycle, with quickly assembled look-alikes coming onto market at much lower prices, cutting into the margins of the brandholders. Think laptops and smartphones.Smart speakers aren\u2019t just hardware. They require complex software to recognize and execute voice commands and provide content ranging from weather forecasts, traffic reports, music, news, books and services from shopping to payment. The speakers are supposed to interact with users and learn their preferences over time.That means heavy research and development.\u201cIt\u2019s like when you were trying to build a smartphone in 2007 only to find that you had to build the Android operating system and the mobile apps running on the phone too. It\u2019s not something for small startups,\u201d says Mr. Song, the Sugr founder.Ximalaya\u2019s owner, Shanghai Zendai Ximalaya Network Technology Co., partnered with the new AI subsidiary of app developer             Cheetah Mobile Inc.,       which hired more than 200 engineers to work on the smart speaker.\u201cIt was a lot of work,\u201d says Mr. Li, the vice president. He says they used over 80,000 different voices to ensure the speaker understands when people call its name \u201cXiaoya.\u201d When they changed the cover fabric for the speaker, the voice recognition rate fell from 90% to 10%. They then spent a month rewriting the algorithm.Technology aside, the pack may be chasing a market that\u2019s not yet there, according to industry people and investors. Having only recently risen to the middle class, many Chinese never lived with stereo speakers, much less a digital assistant, so they\u2019ll need to get comfortable with both, some of these people say.E-commerce giant             JD.com,       which launched a smart speaker in 2015, sold 100,000 units last year and expects to sell hundreds of thousands this year. At prices between 179 yuan to 998 yuan ($27 to $148), the sales revenue is negligible for the company whose total revenue was 260.2 billion yuan in 2016. Since the launch three weeks ago, Alibaba\u2019s Tmall shoppers preordered roughly 7,600 AliGenie smart speaker at 499 yuan ahead of the Aug. 10 shipping target.Ximalaya has an advantage, says Mr. Li, because the audio-sharing site\u2019s 370 million registered users and 22 million daily users are natural customers for a smart speaker. The company sold 50,000 units of Xiaoya at 699 yuan the day it was launched and expects to sell one million units this year at 999 yuan, including subscription services.As for his many competitors flooding into the field, \u201cI think 80% to 90% of them will die next year,\u201d Mr. Li says.Write to Li Yuan at li.yuan@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-first-ai-bubble-is-now-here-talking-speakers-1501148910", "keywords": [" ai, alexa, artificial intelligence,china, smart speakers, xiaoya, ximalaya,Apple,AAPL,Alphabet Inc.

Mr. Duda vetoed the heart of that legislation, but allowed the government to now decide who appoints judges to lower, criminal courts.His veto hasn\u2019t allayed fears in Brussels. The laws \u201cwould have a very significant negative impact on the independence of the Polish judiciary and would increase the systemic threat to the rule of law,\u201d the commission\u2019s first vice president,       Frans Timmermans,        said.The EU has limited room to maneuver in its ongoing showdown with Poland. The ruling party, Law and Justice, says the reforms are needed to purge officials who entered public life during the tainted communist era. Previous warnings have done little to sway the government from its efforts.The bloc\u2019s most severe punishment\u2014stripping EU voting rights\u2014requires a unanimous decision of all the countries in the bloc, which looks unlikely. It must also weigh how much to criticize the country and face accusations of outsider meddling or to remain silent and take flak for that.\u201cThe EU was designed to shame its members into compliance, but shame is obviously not working for Poland,\u201d said Roman Rewald, president of the Lewiatan Mediation Center, a legal institution in Warsaw.The government remained defiant following the commission\u2019s statement. The ruling party said that its changes were in line with the Polish constitution.\u201cWe will not tolerate the pressure and blackmail of EU officials,\u201d it tweeted.A majority of Poles oppose the overhaul: In one poll last week, 55% of voters wanted Mr. Duda to veto the bill. But at the same time, the ruling party is Poland\u2019s most popular, galvanizing Poles who say they resent the EU\u2019s attempts to guilt their nation into becoming a liberal democracy.The commission said it is ready to launch an effort to punish Poland, which would begin with asking EU governments to formally warn Poland to reverse course.The process could eventually escalate to a discussion of stripping Poland of its EU voting rights. But while EU governments would need a four-fifths majority for an initial formal warning, sanctioning Poland would require unanimity.Hungary has already said it would veto measures against Poland, whose vision for what a European democracy should look like is shared by Budapest.Mr. Duda has called for a revised Supreme Court bill and said this time he would like to help write it. It is not yet clear if the new bill would also serve to expand government control of the judiciary or help Poland address EU concerns.\u201cThey\u2019re determined to push forward on this,\u201d said Paul Ivan, senior policy analyst at the European Policy Centre. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very fluid situation, far from being over.\u201dWarsaw would cross a red line if it dismisses or forces Supreme Court justice into retirement, Mr. Timmermans said.\u201cIf such a measure is taken the commission is ready to immediately trigger\u201d the procedure for a formal warning, he said.The EU is open to dialogue to resolve the issues, Mr. Timmermans said, but he added that Brussels would nevertheless launch legal proceedings over the measures Mr. Duda did sign. That could lead to a fine.Brussels says Poland\u2019s changes to lower courts breaches EU law by introducing different retirement ages for female and male judges, and endowing the justice minister with powers to dismiss and appoint court presidents, as well as extended the mandates of judges who have reached retirement age.The measures are against EU laws to prevent gender-based discrimination and threaten to undermine judiciary independence, Mr. Timmermans said.\u201cWe will give the Polish authorities one month to reply,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meanwhile, we will watch developments vigilantly and act accordingly.\u201dWrite to Emre Peker at emre.peker@wsj.com and Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Paul Ivan is a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Centre.

A senior Turkish official, meanwhile, denied it was ever made and officials at the Turkish president\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. But that meeting did nothing to soothe the strain in one of Europe\u2019s most important alliances.After a year of slights, barbs and misunderstandings, both sides are now girding for a showdown that could rattle the European Union, alter the fight on terrorism and escalate the refugee crisis.Turkey has made some efforts to calm the waters in recent days, but tensions continued to run high this week. Mr. Erdogan said in parliament that if any country implemented economic sanctions against Turkey, as Germany had threatened to do, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to take bigger consequences into account.\u201d A Turkish pro-government newspaper put a swastika on Chancellor       Angela Merkel       on its front page. The headline: \u201cWorse than Hitler.\u201dGerman officials and politicians say they are prepared for the spat to get worse. Advisers who can moderate Mr. Erdogan, they say, have lost virtually all influence in Ankara; and Turkey\u2019s ambition to become a bigger player in the Middle East in its own right diminishes the weight placed by Turkish leaders on good ties with the EU, they say.\u201cThe entire framework has changed,\u201d said German lawmaker       Rolf M\u00fctzenich,        a foreign-policy specialist for the center-left Social Democrats. \u201cThe best we can do currently is damage control.\u201dTurkish officials say Turkey hasn\u2019t altered its policy on Germany, and say Germany\u2019s changed approach is motivated by Ms. Merkel\u2019s need to drum up support in advance of Germany\u2019s September elections.On July 5, on an island near Istanbul, came a pivotal moment in the drawn-out German-Turkish split: Turkish police stormed a seminar on data protection and detained a German Amnesty International activist,       Peter Steudtner.       He and five others were later charged with aiding terrorism, a charge Amnesty has described as absurd.The arrest\u2014the first of a German national with no prior link to Turkey\u2014convinced Berlin that Ankara wasn\u2019t interested in repairing the bilateral relationship, according to a senior German official. After the arrest, Mr. Gabriel broke off a North Sea vacation and warned, \u201cWe cannot carry on as before.\u201dMs. Merkel backed Mr. Gabriel\u2019s tough line even though their two parties are competing ahead of Germany\u2019s Sept. 24 national election. Mr. Steudtner\u2019s detention represented \u201cthe latest case in which, from our perspective, innocent people\u201d had landed behind bars in Turkey, she said.\u201cThe German government panicked that Turkey was beginning to specifically detain Germans to build up pressure,\u201d said       Kristian Brakel,        an analyst at the German Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cFor a long time, Germany believed [tensions] would shake themselves out again...but this was a misconception.\u201dMr. Gabriel warned Germans who visit Turkey\u2014nearly four million Germans came in 2016\u2014that they risked arbitrary detention. He said the German government could stop issuing export insurance guarantees\u2014a form of insurance against political risk\u2014for sales to Turkey. Germany also withdrew troops from a Turkish air base, complicating the fight against Islamic State.Turkish officials maintain that the arrests of Mr. Steudtner and other German citizens, including       Deniz Yucel,        the reporter arrested in February on terror charges and reputedly offered in exchange for the extradition, are part of an independent judicial process.Mr. Yucel is accused of spreading propaganda for a terrorist group, related to his reporting on the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, according to his newspaper, Die Welt. Mr. Yucel has denied the charges.Mr. Steudtner faces a trial on charges of aiding a terror group, even though German officials say he had never gone to Turkey for work before the seminar earlier this month on information security.\u201cTurkish-German relations have a long history and there is no reasonable ground to break them now,\u201d       Ibrahim Kalin,        spokesman for the Turkish presidency, wrote in a newspaper column published Monday. He called German charges against Turkey \u201cbaseless\u201d and likened the German media\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with Mr. Erdogan to \u201cthe stray thoughts of the mentally disturbed\u201d.Ms. Merkel has long sought to cool the temperature in the war of words with Mr. Erdogan. But weeks before a general election, German voters are showing less patience. Just 3% of Germans described Turkey as a reliable partner in an Infratest Dimap poll last month, compared with 21% for the U.S. and Russia. An Emnid poll published Sunday showed that 76% of Germans said their government was too tolerant of Mr. Erdogan.Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, and Turkey, the only North Atlantic Treaty Organization member in the Middle East, for decades nurtured ties borne both of shared interests and of culture and politics. Germany imported hundreds of thousands of Turkish workers to help rebuild the country after World War II and now is home to 3.5 million people of Turkish descent.For Turkey, Germany became a bridge to the West, one of its biggest trading partners and a major source of tourism income. Germany joined the U.S. and other NATO allies in stationing troops there for operations in the Middle East.Berlin also brokered a deal with Turkey last year in which Ankara agreed to crack down on smugglers who had been ferrying hundreds of thousands of Middle-Eastern refugees through its territory toward Europe. Despite repeated threats by Mr. Erdogan that he could revoke the deal, it continues to be enforced, German officials say.Turkey\u2019s relations with a number of Western allies have deteriorated following the failed military coup attempt in July 2016 that left more than 270 people dead. Ms. Merkel condemned the attempt the following day, but an official delegation didn\u2019t visit Turkey until three weeks later in what some Turks saw as an inadequate show of support. \u201cWe should have probably gone there more quickly\u2014on the same day or the next day,\u201d Mr. Gabriel, then chairman of Germany\u2019s Social Democratic Party, said in August 2016.Since the coup, Turkey has arrested more than 50,000 people, fired over 100,000 officials, expropriated hundreds of companies, and closed over 100 media outlets, all because of alleged connections to the plotters. German politicians have for months criticized the crackdown as out of control.The Turkish government in return has accused Germany of sheltering Turkish officers, diplomats and civil servants who it says were linked to the coup attempt, as well as opposition politicians, critical journalists, and Kurdish leaders. Some 9,000 Turkish citizens have filed asylum claims in Germany over the last year-and-a-half\u2014compared with 1,767 in 2015.Berlin officials, meanwhile, have been growing concerned about what they see as Ankara\u2019s attempts to stir up unrest among residents of Turkish descent, the majority of whom backed Mr. Erdogan at recent polls. Turkish leaders wanted to campaign in Germany\u2014where nearly 1.4 million Turkish voters are registered\u2014for the April referendum on strengthening the powers of the presidency, but local officials banned several such rallies for safety reasons.Mr. Erdogan himself was told he couldn\u2019t address his compatriots at the margins of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg earlier this month. During the referendum campaign, he accused Germany of \u201cNazi methods\u201d and claimed hypocrisy.\u2014Erdem Aydin contributed to this article.Write to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com, Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com and Ned Levin at ned.levin@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tensions-escalate-between-germany-and-turkey-1501148072", "keywords": ["election,german election,german government,germany,germany coalition,human rights,turkey ,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,Angela Merkel,Sigmar Gabriel,Deniz Yucel,Peter Steudtner,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 05:30:00", "news_title": "Qatar, Prepared for Saudi-Led Embargo, Weathers Standoff ", "content": "DOHA, Qatar\u2014If Qatar is withstanding a far-reaching embargo by Saudi-led Arab nations, it\u2019s because the tiny emirate has drawn the right lessons from its previous neighborhood squabble.Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar, making some of the same complaints that resurfaced in this year\u2019s crisis. They objected to Qatar\u2019s support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other regional dissidents, and wanted to end critical coverage by Qatar\u2019s Al Jazeera broadcaster.The confrontation at the time didn\u2019t involve the travel ban and the comprehensive closing of borders, airspace and ports that the three Saudi-led Gulf monarchies and Egypt announced on June 5. The 2014 crisis ended with Qatar\u2019s emir,       Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani,        agreeing to tone down the emirate\u2019s activist foreign policy.For many Qataris, however, it was clear that the 2014 confrontation\u2014the result of their country\u2019s historic rivalry with the Saudis and especially the Emiratis\u2014wasn\u2019t a one-off event. So in the years since, Qatar made sure to prepare for a second round. It helped, of course, to be the world\u2019s wealthiest nation based on per capita income\u2014one that could afford the necessary investments.\u201cIn 2014, we wouldn\u2019t imagine that Qatar could survive if the Saudis closed the border. Now they\u2019ve closed it, and the Qataris discovered that they can live with it,\u201d said       Marwan Kabalan,        head of policy analysis at the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, a Doha think tank close to the Qatari government.\u201cThese countries thought they could corner Qatar and force it to wave the white flag, using a shock-and-awe approach. It didn\u2019t work out. The Qataris had learned their lesson,\u201d he said.In fact, both sides now expect the confrontation and the Saudi-led embargo on Qatar to last for months, if not years, despite international mediation attempts.The most important initiator of the campaign, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, can hardly afford to lose face and backtrack on demands against Qatar. He has yet to show clear successes in his other signature projects, domestic economic reform and the war in Yemen.The Qatari royal family, too, has little inclination to capitulate and transform its emirate into a Saudi vassal state. That is especially so as the Saudi-led sanctions, imposed in the middle of the holy month of Ramadan and aiming to sow dissent in the emirate, have, so far at least, backfired. They have fomented a sense of defiance and newfound Qatari nationalism.Stylized portraits of Sheikh Tamim, surrounded by handwritten pledges of allegiance by citizens, are mushrooming across the capital Doha, as are condemnations of the \u201csiege nations.\u201dIn a televised address last week, his first since the crisis began, Sheikh Tamim agreed to negotiations while defining the conflict with the Saudi-led camp as an existential issue.\u201cSince the onset of blockade, day-to-day life in Qatar continued as normal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Qatari people instinctively and naturally stood up to defend the sovereignty and independence of their homeland.\u201dUnlike in 2014, Qatar now has a new seaport that can handle large container ships, the Hamad Port. That has permitted it to offset the ban on shipping via Dubai, until recently the main hub for cargo to Qatar.The capacity of Doha\u2019s new Hamad International Airport, meanwhile, allowed Qatar to ramp up food imports by cargo planes. The country\u2019s surplus electricity generation capacity meant that the lights and\u2014critically in the Gulf summer, air conditioners\u2014stayed on despite the border closure.The most evident economic impact of Saudi-led sanctions is the disappearance of Saudi dairy products, which used to account for the vast majority of Qatar\u2019s $1.6 billion dairy market. Qatar compensated for this by flying in Turkish, Azerbaijani and Lebanese milk and by shipping in cows of its own.At the sprawling Baladna farm in the desert north of Doha, workers from South Asia are toiling day and night to build air-conditioned housing for up to 14,000 Holstein cows. The 165 that already arrived in the first cargo plane are leisurely chewing cud in the coolness of the first completed shed.Baladna had planned to go into the cow-milk business before the Saudi embargo, but dramatically expanded the project after the crisis erupted. It expects to make an investment of as much as $545 million in the venture.\u201cThe embargo is an opportunity to fill the void. We would have had to battle for market share otherwise,\u201d said Baladna CEO       John Dore.       The Saudis aren\u2019t likely to regain Qatari consumers even once the crisis is resolved, he added.\u201cLook at the patriotic fervor here. People aren\u2019t going to forget the blockade.\u201dDespite the war of words, some business between Qatar and its Gulf foes continues. Crucially, Qatari gas\u2014which generates a large part of the U.A.E.\u2019s electricity\u2014keeps flowing through the Dolphin pipeline to Dubai. Other Gulf nations haven\u2019t withdrawn their funds from Qatari banks and Qatari financial institutions\u2019 affiliates continue operating in Egypt and the U.A.E.\u201cQatar has absorbed the shock,\u201d said       Abdullah Baabood,        head of the Gulf studies program at Qatar University. \u201cYes, there is an economic cost, but you have to compare this cost to the cost of losing sovereignty. And Qatar is not going to give up its sovereignty just like this.\u201dWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.comAppeared in the July 28, 2017, print edition as 'Qatar Weathering Embargo.'", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-prepared-for-saudi-led-embargo-weathers-standoff-1501147803", "keywords": [" gulf rift, gulf states, middle east economy,qatar, saudi arabia, saudi crown prince"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 05:30:00", "news_title": "LinkedIn Case Tests Whether Firms Can Use Your Data", "content": "A lawsuit against LinkedIn Corp. is shaping up as a test of whether it is legal to collect publicly viewable information posted by internet users.The social network for professionals faces a lawsuit brought by hiQ Labs, a San Francisco company that scrapes and analyzes personal data on LinkedIn to predict whether individual employees are likely to leave their jobs.For years after starting in 2012, hiQ amassed data without objections from LinkedIn, which         Microsoft Corp.       acquired late last year. HiQ says it excludes profiles that require a LinkedIn account to view, analyzing fewer than 175,000 profiles in a 500-million-member network.In May, LinkedIn\u2019s legal counsel wrote to hiQ and ordered it to stop accessing the site. It also told hiQ it had tried to ban it through an IP-address block, asserted the company was violating a federal antihacking law and threatened to take it to court.But hiQ got there first. It filed suit in June, asking a federal judge in California to declare that it was complying with the antihacking law and that LinkedIn was unlawfully attempting to stifle competition. On Thursday, a hearing is set on whether LinkedIn should be prevented from limiting hiQ\u2019s access to its site.LinkedIn says it has a \u201cright to control access to its private property\u201d and argues that hiQ\u2019s data-scraping threatens its members\u2019 privacy.The dispute has deeper implications for the growing industry of data analytics and whether \u201clegitimate business will be permitted to scrape from the public portion of websites like LinkedIn,\u201d said       David Thaw,        a professor of law and information sciences at the University of Pittsburgh.These days, the online activities of billions are mined to estimate inflation, glean consumer insights, forecast stock movements, value real estate or, as in hiQ\u2019s case, predict employee behavior. Companies or researchers sometimes get explicit approval to harvest data from a website, but much of the industry operates in a legal gray zone.The case is also the latest to ponder what constitutes hacking under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prohibits unauthorized access to computer systems and carries both criminal and civil and penalties.The statute is mostly used to prosecute hackers and data thieves. Whether businesses that scrape publicly available information can be held liable under the law is a hotly debated legal question.For hiQ, the stakes are high. Without LinkedIn data, hiQ may need to \u201cclose down its operations, lay off its employees, and put to waste millions of dollars in investor capital,\u201d its lawyers told the court.Among its services, hiQ monitors and analyzes LinkedIn profile pages to see who is polishing their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and liable to be poached, assigning so-called flight-risk scores to individual employees.Lawyers for hiQ say LinkedIn has stretched the meaning of \u201cunauthorized access\u201d under the antihacking statute to \u201ccriminalize access to webpages that are public for the entire world to see.\u201dThe data analysis it sells to companies such as eBay, Capital One and GoDaddy is no more invasive than the web-crawling robots that search engines like Google or Bing use to index LinkedIn profiles, its lawyers argue.But LinkedIn says hiQ\u2019s data-scraping isn\u2019t as innocent as the startup contends.\u201cIndeed, if LinkedIn members knew that hiQ was accessing and collecting their data in this manner, many would not update their profiles,\u201d the company told the court.Both sides have retained star litigators. HiQ\u2019s legal team\u2019s includes Harvard University constitutional scholar       Laurence Tribe       and appellate lawyer       Deepak Gupta.       LinkedIn has turned to       Donald Verrilli Jr.      , who was U.S. solicitor general during the Obama administration.The lawsuit isn\u2019t the first to put scraping on trial. LinkedIn\u2019s legal briefs highlight         Facebook Inc.\u2019s       court fight with Power Ventures Inc., a now-defunct social-networking aggregator that enabled Facebook users who supplied login credentials to transfer their Facebook content to other social media platforms.Last year, a federal appeals court upheld Facebook\u2019s claim that Power Ventures had committed computer trespass under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Power Ventures has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, arguing that antihacking law wasn\u2019t intended to outlaw data portability.Classified service Craigslist has also scored legal victories against companies it accused of illegally scraping its content, spamming Craigslist members and unlawfully reposting copyright-protected listings.Distinguishing the case from other scraping disputes, hiQ isn\u2019t just playing defense. Its lawsuit claims LinkedIn is trying to \u201cprevent anyone but LinkedIn from being able to use public information for data analytics,\u201d alleging violations of California\u2019s unfair competition law.\u201cLinkedIn is trying to illegally force out a smaller competitor so that they can have the business for themselves, plain and simple,\u201d said hiQ chief executive Mark Weidick in statement.The anti-competition charges echo the antitrust concerns that         Salesforce.com Inc.       raised with European regulators after it lost a bidding war for LinkedIn to Microsoft.\u00a0A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.\u201cOur members control the information that they make available to others on LinkedIn, and they trust us to honor that control,\u201d LinkedIn said in a statement.Write to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/suit-against-linkedin-could-affect-data-analytics-industry-1501147801", "keywords": ["antihacking legislation,consumer tech: privacy security,cyberhacking,data mining,data scraping,hiq labs,internet privacy,linkedin,linkedin lawsuit,social media,LinkedIn,LNKD,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 05:30:00", "news_title": "When One Investor Borrowed Against Puerto Rico Bonds", "content": "What happens when securities used as collateral for a loan tumble in value? Some investors in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds can tell you.More than 100 investors in Puerto Rican bond funds had borrowed against their portfolios before the U.S. commonwealth\u2019s fiscal troubles began worsening in 2013, according to securities attorneys. The loans were often offered by brokers who reassured clients that the securities backing the loans were safe.The value of investors\u2019 shares in those bond funds plunged when it became evident that Puerto Rico would struggle to repay its debt. After a certain point, brokerages like UBS Group AG and Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch sold the bond-fund shares to pay back the loans. Investors had to take a loss on the securities and, in some cases, still owed the brokerages money.\u201cWhen you\u2019re flush with cash and your accounts are looking good, it seems completely harmless to take out a loan and collateralize it with that money,\u201d said Marnie Lambert, a securities attorney and president of the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association. \u201cBut when the markets go down, there\u2019s a ton of people hurt.\u201dLuis Romero Lopez invested much of his $15 million fortune, earned after the sale of a health-care company in Puerto Rico, in the island\u2019s bonds. Mr. Romero said he lost most of his money in a six-week period in 2013, when Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal decline accelerated. He also had taken out about $30 million in credit against his investment portfolio at the behest of his UBS broker, he said.\u201cThe broker said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re offering this to some of our clients who have a certain net worth,\u2019\u201d Mr. Romero, who speaks Spanish, said through an interpreter. \u201cHe said I could use it for whatever I wanted, real estate, a boat, whatever.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Romero, who lives in Puerto Rico, owed $1 million to UBS. \u201cUBS took over his account and liquidated everything,\u201d said       Samuel Edwards,        Mr. Romero\u2019s attorney.Regulators say UBS, Merrill and other brokerages failed to properly supervise the distribution and use of those loans backed by Puerto Rican securities. Last year, Merrill consented to a $7 million fine issued by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority due, in part, to those lapses. Merrill neither admitted nor denied the charges at the time. UBS, meanwhile, agreed to a $34 million penalty with regulators in 2015.UBS, at the time of its settlement, said it was \u201cpleased to have resolved the matters.\u201d Merrill representatives said the firm has improved its procedures around how the loans are supervised.As for Mr. Romero, a Finra panel concluded UBS either \u201cknowingly encouraged\u201d Mr. Romero to take out the loans or acted with \u201cextreme recklessness and indifference.\u201d The panel added that Mr. Romero would have lost less money had he been \u201csuitably invested with less leverage.\u201dFinra ordered UBS to pay nearly $9 million to Mr. Romero. A UBS spokesman declined to comment for this article.

The company had previously said it planned to deliver dividends at the end of 2017.The results are a good sign for other mining behemoths that will be reporting earnings next month, including Rio Tinto PLC, Glencore PLC and BHP Ltd.Shares of Anglo, which have gained more than 50% in the past 12 months, rose 2.9% in London trading.The resumption of the dividend is \u201cthe big news\u201d at Anglo, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Paul Gait wrote in a note. The move \u201cshould be taken very positively by investors.\u201dExcluding one-time items, Anglo posted a net profit of $1.5 billion in the first half, compared with $698 million a year ago. Revenue rose to $12.1 billion during the first-half from $10.6 billion last year. Net debt fell to $6.2 billion as of June 30, below its year-end target of $7 billion and down from $11.7 billion a year earlier.Anglo\u2019s strong performance is a sharp turnaround from the previous two years, when it and other mining companies were hemorrhaging cash and scrambling to cut costs and divest poor-performing assets. Mr. Cutifani, in the midst of the crisis, launched an ambitious program to slash operations and exit loss-making coal and iron ore businesses, focusing instead on copper, platinum and diamond.But a surge in coal prices and solid gains in iron ore put those plans on the shelf. At Anglo\u2019s Kumba Iron Ore project in South Africa, coal prices surged 151% from last year and iron-ore prices were up 29%, the company said. Overall, the average price for Anglo\u2019s commodities gained 30% from a year ago.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\u2014a common metric used by mining companies\u2014gained in every commodity at Anglo in the first half except for platinum and nickel. A slowdown in Chinese jewelry demand, among other issues, hurt platinum demand. Nickel earnings were hurt by operational issues at Anglo\u2019s Barro Alto mine in Brazil, slowing first-half production.Ebitda at Anglo\u2019s diamond giant De Beers rose 3% from last year, spurred by a 21% increase in rough diamond production. But prices for De Beers\u2019 diamonds fell 12% from a year ago largely due to increased supplies.Mr. Cutifani said operational improvements at the company\u2019s mines, one of the CEO\u2019s primary projects since he took the helm of Anglo in 2013, are a big reason for its strong performance in 2017.\u201cEvery person in the business is now producing 70% more than they were producing in 2013,\u201d he said.Write to Scott Patterson at scott.patterson@wsj.com", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anglo-americans-profit-surge-bodes-well-for-miners-1501145142", "keywords": ["anglo american,bhp,british miner,commodity prices,glencore,iron ore,mark cutifani,moning companies,rio tinto,Anglo American,AAL.LN,BHP Billiton,BHP.AU,Rio Tinto,RIO,financial performance,earnings,dividends,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,metal ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"]}, {"news_time": "2017-07-27 03:16:00", "news_title": "Era of Jumbo Jet Nears End as Airbus Slashes A380 Production ", "content": "LONDON\u2014European plane maker             Airbus SE        EADSY -2.10%       again cut production plans for its A380 superjumbo, bringing nearer to an end the era of the big, four-engine long-haul jets closely associated with the rise of global jet-setting.Boeing Co. pioneered the age with the introduction of the iconic 747 jumbo jet, which entered service in 1970. But the latest model, the 747-8, has sold poorly. The Chicago-based plane maker has cut production plans and said it could cease building the humped-back jet.Airbus said it would build only eight of its double-decker A380 a year from 2019. It had already cut production plans to 12 planes starting next year. Production of the aircraft, which have a list price of $436.9 million each, peaked at 30 aircraft in 2014. Airbus plans to build half that number this year.\u201cThe situation is certainly not comfortable,\u201d Airbus Chief Executive       Tom Enders       said, adding that there were sales prospects, but \u201cnot many.\u201dSingapore Airlines,       the first operator of the plane, has said it wouldn\u2019t renew the lease of its first A380s and planned to retire some starting next year. Other airlines, including             Air France-KLM SA       and             Deutsche Lufthansa AG       have reduced orders.Airlines have shied away from the big, expensive planes, worried about filling all the seats. They have instead flocked to more efficient, twin-engine long-range jets such as Airbus\u2019s A350 and Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner and 777. Even demand for those big planes has softened in recent months.Airbus now loses money on every A380 built, though Mr. Enders said cost-cutting efforts mean the impact on earnings is marginal.The plane maker has sold 317 A380s with Emirates Airline alone ordering 142 of them. The future of some A380 deals in the backlog are uncertain.The company is also contending with supplier issues that are hobbling deliveries of some of its more popular planes. Delivering new planes smoothly underpins its promise to investors that earnings and cash flow will improve toward the end of the decade.Lower deliveries of those planes, particularly the A320neo single-aisle jetliner that has a record backlog of orders and the A350 long-range jet, dragged on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings Thursday. Airbus reported a 34% fall in net income to \u20ac895 million ($1.1 billion). The company also suffered about \u20ac2 billion in cash outflow in the first six months of 2017.Airbus did, however, stick to its full-year guidance, including delivering about 720 jetliners. That would include close to about 200 A320neo models, which Mr. Enders said was contingent on engines being available. Airbus said meeting its targets was now \u201cmore challenging.\u201dShares in Airbus fell more than 3% in early trading in response to the figures.The European aircraft maker couldn\u2019t match Boeing Co, which reported strong second-quarter results Wednesday, including $4.5 billion in free cash flow, propelled its stock up nearly 10% on the day to close at a record high.Mr. Enders expressed frustration with continued problems Pratt & Whitney, a unit             United Technologies Corp.      , was having with the engines it makes for the A320neo.The engine maker delivered to Airbus far fewer engines than it should have in the first six months and reliability problems haven\u2019t been fixed, the Airbus CEO said. \u201cThey certainly need to work hard and harder to fix the outstanding issues,\u201d he said, adding it should be a \u201cwinning engine.\u201dUnited Technologies Chief Financial Officer       Akhil Johri       this week said supply chain issues had been addressed and reliability issues would be completely fixed by year-end. The company stuck to its commitment to ship 350 to 500 of the engine this year.Despite the production headaches, Airbus is pressing forward with boosting output of A320 planes to 60 a month in 2019. With a backlog of more than 5,500 single-aisle planes, Airbus is sold out through 2022, Mr. Enders said.The large cash outflow in the first six months also was caused by a decision from Qatar Airways to cancel an order for four A350 long-range jets that are already built.

Given the scale of the debt it owes, it may have no choice.But what\u2019s left\u2014mainly an Asia-focused coal-and-metals operation\u2014may have trouble surviving on its own even without the company\u2019s massive debt problems. The heady days of China\u2019s turn-of-the-century construction boom are long over, while the country\u2019s outsize influence on the global coal market has become a pernicious force from a trading perspective. Noble\u2019s days as an independent trader look to be numbered.Investors apparently agree. The firm\u2019s shares fell by almost half Thursday after it warned late Wednesday that it expects a second-quarter loss of up to $1.8 billion, and detailed plans to sell off its North American power-and-gas division for $248 million. It also said it was seeking buyers for its global oil-liquids business.Given the financial constraints under which the firm is operating\u2014it has over $1 billion of bonds and bank loans coming due next year\u2014getting rid of the most working-capital-intensive part of its business, global oil liquids, may make sense.Unfortunately what will be left\u2014a business focused on trading coal, metals and liquefied natural gas in Asia\u2014won\u2019t be in a good competitive position. Wildly fluctuating coal prices over the past 18 months, part of what tripped Noble up earlier this year, reflect the dangers of overdependence on a market where Chinese regulators can put such a heavy hand on the scale: an unexpected shift in domestic Chinese supply controls was behind much of the volatility. Liquefied natural gas is likely to remain oversupplied in the Asian market for the foreseeable future as massive Australian projects ramp up further and the U.S. and Russia duke it out to supply hungry Chinese power plants. And the boom years for iron and steel are already a distant memory.Noble has little choice but to limp home and rediscover its roots in Asian metals and coal.

GS 0.68%A new partnership with Fidelity Investments announced\u00a0Thursday\u00a0will enable the Wall Street firm to offer securities-based loans to roughly six million accounts managed by broker-dealers, family offices and wealth\u00a0advisers that use Fidelity\u2019s technology. Goldman currently offers such loans to fewer than 12,000 ultrawealthy clients of its private bank.The move enables Goldman to gain access to millions of potential borrowers at a time the bank\u00a0has been trying to lend more. It is the latest attempt by a firm known for its investment banking and trading to reach Main Street customers without a network of brick-and-mortar branches.The centerpiece of the action is a new online platform, called GS Select, that will offer loans of between $75,000 and $25 million, with borrowers\u2019 portfolios of stocks and bonds serving as collateral, the companies said\u00a0Thursday. Goldman\u2019s software can analyze the holdings and make a decision within a day about how much to lend and on what terms.Fidelity, meanwhile, gains another offering for the 3,850\u00a0wealth managers and brokers\u00a0on its platform. Those firms use Fidelity to house, trade and manage their customers\u2019 assets.Securities-backed loans are a booming business on Wall Street, as brokerages search for ways to offset falling trading commissions. Merrill Lynch parent             Bank of America Corp.       had $40 billion in such loans on its balance sheet at the end of last year, up 140% from 2010.\u00a0            Morgan Stanley\u2019s       customers had $30 billion in these loans, more than double from 2013.These loans can generate needed cash without triggering taxes for borrowers or forcing investors to sell higher-yielding investments. Borrowers often such loans to pay taxes, remodel homes and refinance more-expensive loans.Critics say they sometimes aren\u2019t clearly explained and can saddle savers with unnecessary debt.Goldman currently offers securities-backed loans to clients of its private bank, where they account for more than half of the unit\u2019s $29 billion in loans outstanding. But with fewer than 12,000 clients\u2014versus, for example, Morgan Stanley\u2019s 3.5 million\u2014the demand is limited. Fidelity\u2019s network represents six million accounts that could become Goldman borrowers, although the Goldman loans won\u2019t be available to Fidelity\u2019s own retail brokerage or wealth-management clients.Fidelity won\u2019t make money on the loans, according to Mike Durbin, head of Fidelity institutional product.\u00a0Instead, they are another way to retain customers.The partnership is the first of several Goldman expects to strike, said Andrew Kaiser, head of Goldman\u2019s private bank.Small wealth advisers and independent broker-dealers are good fits because they aren\u2019t already connected to a bank, he said.Goldman hasn\u2019t historically been a major lender, an area it left to commercial-banking rivals. But it has been embracing loans over the past few years to replace declining revenues in core businesses like trading.Marcus, the online platform it launched last fall to make\u00a0small personal loans, has lent more than $1 billion. Goldman is also building a robo adviser to attract consumer clients, according to people familiar with the effort.In partnering with Fidelity, Goldman is targeting America\u2019s \u201cmass affluent.\u201d That group is better-off than the average Marcus borrower but not as wealthy as customers in Goldman\u2019s private bank, where the average account size is about $50 million.Brokers will apply online for loans on behalf of their customers, but they can call a Goldman call center in Salt Lake City for advice and answers.\u201cIt\u2019s the right mix, to us, of human touch and digital efficiency,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said.Fidelity has funded its own securities-backed loans for about a decade, but it has turned to banks as demand has increased.
