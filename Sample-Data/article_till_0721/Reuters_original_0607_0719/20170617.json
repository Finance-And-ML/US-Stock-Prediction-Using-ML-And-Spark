Amazon used aggressive pricing to become an e-commerce retail juggernaut and has recently been experimenting with brick-and-mortar outlets. It will take over a natural and organic grocer pioneer with 456 stores, a mecca for young, high-end shoppers, that has been struggling to rein in prices and integrate technology. The deal represents a dramatic turn in strategy for Amazon, which has offered food delivery through its Fresh service for a decade but has not made a major dent in the $700 billion grocery market. “The ramifications for all of retail are seismic – not just retailers that sell grocery, but for everyone,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said. For graphic - Whole Foods at a glance - click: tmsnrt.rs/2skJDSv Shares of dozens of supermarkets, food producers, payment processors and shopping malls collectively lost at least $35 billion in U.S. market value on Friday as the news reverberated across financial markets. Shares of grocer Kroger Co swooned 9.2 percent, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc fell 4.7 percent, signaling fears that Amazon could broaden Whole Foods' product mix and cut prices. Amazon's shares rose 2.4 percent to $987.71, adding $11 billion to its market capitalization, which in one sense makes the acquisition nearly free for Amazon shareholders.   Supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and non-traditional grocers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp, but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively,  said Mickey Chadha, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service. Amazon agreed to pay $42 per share in cash for Whole Foods, a 27 percent premium on the Austin, Texas-based grocer's closing share price on Thursday.

No Value in Status Quo A former grocery expert at Amazon predicted that the chain, nicknamed  Whole Paycheck , would add a selection of discounted food and build out non-grocery areas within stores, particularly for pharmacy and Amazon devices.  There’s no value in Amazon keeping the status quo at Whole Foods. Whole Foods was losing market share to Kroger,  said Brittain Ladd, who until earlier this year was a senior manager working to roll out AmazonFresh globally.   It’s pharmacy. It’s having the ability to put stores that are similar to Apple stores inside Whole Foods,  he said.  Amazon has been looking at shop layouts that could allow traditional in-store purchase, online ordering with on-site pickup, and home delivery, using store warehouse space as a distribution point, Ladd said. A Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo AllegriDespite Amazon's reputation for harnessing technology, a prototype store inside its corporate office in Seattle, called Amazon Go, which uses sensors and tech-savvy cameras to detect shoppers' selections and then charge their Amazon accounts, has rolled out more slowly than planned, a person familiar with the matter said.  And while some analysts expect Amazon to bring vast buying power to Whole Foods, Amazon's heft in the food market is far smaller than in other areas, and high demand for organic products gives farmers unusual bargaining power. Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said plans do not include reducing jobs as the result of the deal and that the company does not plan to automate Whole Foods cashiers jobs with Amazon Go technology.  Whole Foods Was Under Pressure The deal unfolded after Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive officer, approached Whole Foods CEO John Mackey about a month ago and received an eager response from Mackey, two people familiar with the matter said. Slideshow (18 Images)The grocer will continue to operate stores under the Whole Foods Market brand, and Mackey will remain CEO, the companies said.  Whole Foods has posted seven straight quarterly sales declines at established stores and recently overhauled its board of directors in the face of pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC. Jana, which disclosed an 8.3 percent stake in Whole Foods in April and is the company's second biggest shareholder, stands to make roughly $300 million from the sale to Amazon. The deal is for $13.4 billion in cash and the remainder in debt. The acquisition price implies a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Whole Foods of 31 times, versus a 14.4 average for the S&P; 500 Food Retail index. Amazon and Whole Foods expect to close the deal during the second half of 2017. Eyes on Grocery Shoppers Amazon, started in Seattle in 1994 by Bezos, a former hedge fund manager, has grown into the world's biggest diversified online retailer, with a market capitalization of nearly $500 billion. It has expanded from a book seller into a merchant of nearly all consumer products, as well as producing videos.  Both Amazon and Whole Foods cater to younger consumers including millennials as well as the affluent.  Amazon could bring technology to all Whole Foods locations, or it could absorb Whole Foods into AmazonFresh. Either way, it's good for consumers like myself,  said Di Wu, a New York resident in her early 30s who is a member of Amazon's Prime fast-shipping club and who shops at Whole Foods at least twice a week.   Amazon is known to drive down prices and make the shopping experience more efficient,  Wu said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc advised Amazon on the deal and provided bridge financing. Bank of America Corp also provided financing to Amazon, while Evercore Partners Inc advised Whole Foods.

No. 23 got out in a hurry. The Arizona Diamondbacks erased a two-run deficit in the seventh inning thanks to Blanco's two-run homer, then took the lead and held on for a 5-4 win over the Philadelphia Phillies in the opener of a three-game series on Friday night. Arizona (42-26), which has won five in a row, matched its 2002 squad for best 68-game start in franchise history.  We have that winning spirit,  Blanco said.  You always find a way as a team. We believe in all 25 guys to win a ballgame. Each day it's a new hero.  Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at PhilliesPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchTrailing 4-2 after six innings, the Diamondbacks wasted no time pulling back even with their hosts. After pinch-hitter Jeremy Hazelbaker reached on a chopper to short to open the seventh, Blanco drove them both in with a line-drive shot to right that cleared the wall for his second home run of the year. It certainly wasn't the most likely source for power in an Arizona lineup that has two players with 15 home runs or more and three others with at least six. Blanco, who has played in 32 games this season (88 at-bats), has never had more than five homers in any one MLB season, despite five years with more than 300 at-bats.  I hit one like that in Miami a couple years ago off Jose Fernandez that went into the upper deck,  he recalled.  I don't hit many -- but when I hit a homer, I hit it far.  A single by the next batter, David Peralta, chased Phillies starter Aaron Nola from the game. Paul Goldschmidt then singled against reliever Pat Neshek to move Peralta to third, and the right fielder scored on a sacrifice fly by Jake Lamb to put Arizona back on top 5-4.  We do well responding to a lot of negative moments and I think that's what good teams do,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  They learn how to win and stay together. The big blow was Gregor's home run to tie it, but inside of the game after that we had a lot of little moments -- like Jake Lamb's at bat against such a quality reliever in Neshek.  The Phillies (22-44) threatened in the bottom of the seventh with men on the corners and two outs but couldn't score as they lost for the ninth time in 10 games. Phillies manager Pete Mackanin was generally pleased with the effort of his team. Center fielder Odubel Herrera received mention for his hustling out an infield single and tagging from first to second on a fly ball to center field, but he wasn't the only one who made winning plays in an overall losing effort.  Those are the type of things that you have to do to win games,  Mackanin said.  We only got five hits, we came up short, didn't have enough offense.  Arizona starter Patrick Corbin (6-6) picked up the win for the second consecutive start despite letting the Phillies take the lead in the bottom of the sixth on a two-RBI double by Maikel Franco. The left-hander finished out six innings, giving up four runs (two earned) and five hits while striking out five without allowing a walk. Archie Bradley pitched 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief for the Diamondbacks before Fernando Rodney retired in side in order for his 19th save of the season. Nola (3-5) gave up nine hits and those five runs (all earned) in six-plus innings, walking two while striking out six. A round of applause from the 18,000 in attendance was proof his outing was far from poor, but he admitted he had more to work on than just one mistake pitch to Blanco.  It was a lot of things,  he said.  I think I was inefficient with my fastball pretty much all game, I wasn't getting ahead of guys too much ... and then yeah I made that mistake, hanging curveball.  NOTES: The series continues Saturday with first pitch scheduled for 4:05 p.m. ET. The Phillies will pit RHP Jerad Eickhoff (0-7, 5.09 ERA) against Diamondbacks RHP Zack Godley (2-1, 2.44). ... Phillies 1B Tommy Joseph extended a career-long hitting streak to 12 games with a single in the fourth inning. ... 3B Jake Lamb's sacrifice fly in the seventh inning was his league-leading 58th RBI. ... Arizona is 14-6 (.700) in one-run games, which breaks a tie with the Los Angeles Angels for most one-run wins in MLB this year.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-phillies-writethru-idUSMTZED6HO7OVO6"},

At least that would be the case based on his performance in his 14th major league game on Friday. DeJong went 3-for-4 with three RBIs and his second MLB homer as the St. Louis Cardinals whipped the Baltimore Orioles 11-2. He became just the third St. Louis player to collects three hits, score three runs, drive in three runs and hit a homer out of the No. 9 spot in the batting order, joining All-Star pitchers Dizzy Dean (1937) and Bob Gibson (1965).  It was a fun night to be a Cardinal,  DeJong said.  Sometimes I over-swing and don't make contact. Hitting is contagious sometimes and tonight was one of those.  The Florida native made his MLB debut on May 28 and hit a homer in his first Major League at-bat. DeJong is now hitting .286 with a .469 slugging mark. On Friday, he started at second base and was one of five St. Louis players to homer off a beleaguered Baltimore pitching staff. Other homers came from Matt Carpenter, Dexter Fowler, Tommy Pham and Jedd Gyorko, playing in front of family from Morgantown, West Virginia. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at OriolesSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatch A lot of hitter's counts. He got behind a lot of hitters,  Carpenter said of Baltimore starter Kevin Gausman. The Orioles have given up at least 10 runs in four of their last seven games.  Every mistake is kind of magnified,  Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said of Gausman.  He's having trouble getting the count back in his favor. They're able to box out some pitches on him unless he can get a breaking ball over behind in the count. The one quality that pitchers when they're pitching well, they can locate a fastball down and away to get back in the count. It's been a little bit of a challenge for him.  The Orioles were stymied by starter Carlos Martinez, who has a 2.86 ERA after giving up just one run in six innings.  He has a plus fastball. He goes to different (eye) levels when he needs to,  Showalter said.  He's a good pitcher. We are not scoring a lot of runs.  Martinez (6-5) allowed four hits and had eight strikeouts before Brett Cecil took over in the bottom of the seventh inning. Martinez has allowed just six runs in his last four starts, giving up just four hits each time. The Cardinals (31-35) snapped a three-game losing streak and are 3-6 against American League teams. The Orioles (32-34) have lost eight of nine and have been outscored 82-31 during that stretch. DeJong, who homered in the fourth inning off Gausman (3-6), had an RBI single in the sixth as the first batter to face reliever Gabriel Ynoa. Carpenter followed with a two-run homer just over the fence in right-center field to give St. Louis a 7-1 lead. The next batter, Fowler, hit his 11th homer of the year to extend the margin to 8-1. It was the second time this season the Cardinals hit back-to-back homers. Pham had a two-run homer in the seventh off Ynoa to give the Cardinals a 10-1 lead and Gyorko homered in the ninth to make it 11-1. Pham, Carpenter and Fowler each had two hits and two RBIs. Gausman went 5 2/3 innings and gave up nine hits and five earned runs while tying a season-high with 116 pitches. He now has a 6.60 ERA this season. Trey Mancini (two hits) homered in the ninth for Baltimore. The Cardinals loaded the bases with three singles in a row by Jose Martinez, DeJong and Carpenter to begin the third inning. Fowler then walked to force in a run and Stephen Piscotty followed with a sacrifice fly to center to make it 2-0. Manny Machado had a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the third to trim the margin to 2-1. DeJong hit his second career homer as he lofted a ball down the left field line for a two-run shot to make it 4-1 against in the fourth.  You could see some things trending as we kept taking good at-bats in that last series against Milwaukee. But everybody really contributed today, and Carlos set the tone by going about his business,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. NOTES: The Orioles sent RHP Jimmy Yacabonis to Triple-A Norfolk and placed RHP Michael Wright (right shoulder bursitis) on the 10-day disabled list. Baltimore called up LHP Vidal Nuno and RHP Gabriel Ynoa, who gave up three homers. Nuno also pitched and gave up a solo homer. ...

Fisher was a mental health advocate who spoke about her struggles with bipolar disorder and cocaine addiction. Aside from her film work, she was also popular as a writer and humorist and her memoir  The Princess Diarist  was released a few weeks before she died.    The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office conducted an examination of her body on Dec. 30 and has since found she died of sleep apnea and  other undetermined factors,  the coroner's statement said.

The day after Carrie Fisher died, Reynolds, who starred in Hollywood musicals such as  Singin' in the Rain,  suffered a stroke and died, aged 84. Eddie Fisher died in 2010.  Born in Beverly Hills, Carrie Fisher got her show business start at age 12 in her mother's Las Vegas nightclub act. She made her film debut as a teenager in 1975 comedy  Shampoo,  two years before her breakthrough in the first  Star Wars  movie. Fisher reprised the role in later  Star Wars  sequels, gaining sex symbol status in  Return of the Jedi  in 1983 when her Leia character wore a metallic gold bikini while enslaved by the diabolical Jabba the Hutt. In the 2015 film  Star Wars: The Force Awakens,  also known as  Episode VII  of the franchise, she appeared again as Leia, who by then had become an astute military general. After undergoing treatment in the mid-1980s for cocaine addiction, Fisher wrote the bestselling novel  Postcards from the Edge,  about a drug-abusing actress forced to move in with her mother. The book was later adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine.

After Friday night's win at Great American Ball Park, Wood is off to the best start for a Dodgers pitcher since the legendary Orel Hershiser. Joc Pederson homered and Wood allowed one run and four hits in eight innings, lifting the Dodgers to a 3-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the opener of a three-game series before 35,613 fans. Wood is the first Dodgers pitcher to begin a season with 10 or more consecutive starts without a loss since Hershiser went 11 starts to begin the 1985 campaign.  He worked every quadrant tonight,  Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said.  His ability to locate and command all three pitches. Very rarely does a pitcher have the command of all three of his pitchers like he's had for this period of time.  The eight innings tied a career high for Wood (7-0) who struck out five and did not walk a batter in his 10th start. He also contributed a two-out single in the eighth inning to drive in a run. It was his second hit and third RBI of the season.  I closed my eyes and got a knock,  Wood said. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at RedsLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchWhile on the mound, Wood worked ahead in the count for most of the night and said he only regretted four of his 89 pitches.  I always want to be on the attack, it's just that all three of my pitches have been as sharp as they've been together at the same time,  Wood said.  My stuff has been consistent and that's been the biggest difference for me.  In addition to his third homer, Pederson also doubled and walked for the Dodgers (42-26), who have won seven of eight while improving to 4-0 this season against the Reds. Devin Mesoraco ended Wood's shutout bid with his sixth home run with two outs in the eighth.

Billy Hamilton and Zack Cozart, the top two batters in Cincinnati's lineup, went 1-for-8 on Friday night.  We're having a little bit of trouble putting runs on the board,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  It happens. They've been so good at igniting the offense. It's inherent in baseball that there are going to be times when things don't go your way.  Cincinnati starter Tim Adleman (4-3) managed to stick around for six innings despite four walks and being under almost constant pressure from the Dodgers' offense. He allowed two runs and five hits but needed 108 pitches to get through six. Pederson, who was 2-for-11 on the road trip and batting .198 coming into the game, belted a solo home run in his first at-bat to put Los Angeles ahead 1-0 in the second inning. Pederson doubled in his next at-bat with one out in the fourth. The teams combined for three outs on the bases early. The Reds had a runner retired in a rundown between first and second and another thrown out at home to waste a leadoff double by Eugenio Suarez in the second. In the top of the third, Chris Taylor's RBI double put the Dodgers up 2-0, but Cody Bellinger was thrown out trying to score from first on the play. The Dodgers needed innings out of Wood and he was able to limit his pitches to 51 through five while allowing three hits to lay the foundation for the rest of his outing. Wood also snared a hard grounder from Mesoraco to start an inning-ending 1-4-3 double play in the fifth.  I'm glad I didn't screw it up,  Wood said.  We've got guys behind me, Chase (Utley) is right back. It's hard not to react. I just reacted and fielded the ball. I kind of slipped on the throw so glad I was able to get it there.

Among the early starters on another steamy day at Erin Hills, Casey survived a hair-raising round that included a gut-wrenching triple-bogey and a thrilling run of five straight birdies and ended with him signing for one-under 71. The Englishman then sat back and watched as compatriot Tommy Fleetwood and Americans Brooks Koepka and Brian Harman each carded two-under 70 to join him at the top of a crowded leaderboard at seven-under.

McIlroy, sidelined for a month with rib and back injuries, could not shake off the rust missing the U.S. Open cut for the second consecutive year. The Northern Irishman closed out his round in style with four birdies over his final six holes for a 71 but it was a case of too little unable to undo the damage of a first round 78.

I was out of it ... trying to stay out of the way of Rory.  And unfortunately with where I was hitting it, I wasn't in the way.  Casey, who began the day one shot back of Fowler, found trouble when he flew his approach out of rough over the green at the par-five 14th, his fifth, into the deep fescue and needed five more strokes to get in the cup. A rattled Casey added another bogey at the 15th to extend his miserable run before hitting the turbo-charger and firing off five consecutive birdies.  Not every day you enjoy a round of golf with an eight on the card, but I'm a pretty happy man,  said Casey.  It was a bit of a roller coaster.  After an opening round 74, world number four Hideki Matsuyama looked ready to join the parade of top ranked players to the exit but the Japanese hit back with the joint best round of the day of seven-under 65 to shoot up the leaderboard and into contention at five-under.

The mass-selling newspaper Bild reported that Kohl died at 9.15 a.m. on Friday morning in bed at his home in Ludwigshafen, in western Germany, with his second wife, Maike Kohl-Richter, at his side. Merkel, Germany's incumbent chancellor who grew up in communist East Germany before being appointed by Kohl to her first ministerial post, said he  changed my own life path decisively  by reuniting Germany.   When a new spirit began to stir in eastern Europe in the 1980s, when, starting in Poland freedom was seized, when brave people in Leipzig, East Berlin and elsewhere in East Germany began a peaceful revolution, then Helmut Kohl was the right man at the right time,  said Merkel, who was wearing black.   He stood fast to the dream and aim of a united Germany even as others hesitated,  she said in a televised statement from Rome. Germany's longest-serving post-war chancellor from 1982 to 1998, Kohl was a driving force behind the introduction of the euro currency, persuading skeptical Germans to give up the  deutschemark, a cherished symbol of the  economic miracle  of the 1950s and 1960s. An imposing figure who formed an unlikely personal bond with socialist French President Francois Mitterrand in pushing for closer European integration, Kohl, a conservative, had been frail and used a wheelchair since suffering a bad fall in 2008. By committing to anchor Germany within Europe under a common currency, he overcame resistance to reunification from Mitterrand, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister who feared the return of a powerful, united Germany.  The maker of a united Germany and Franco-German friendship: with Helmut Kohl, we lose a great European,  tweeted French President Emmanuel Macron, with an iconic picture of Kohl and Mitterrand holding hands at a memorial to the World War One battle of Verdun. British Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to  a giant of European history  and  the father of modern Germany . U.S. President Donald Trump said Kohl was a friend and ally of the United States.  The world has benefited from his vision and efforts,  Trump said in a statement.  Flowers in front of the residence of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Oggersheim, Germany, June 16, 2017.Ralph OrlowskiShortly after leaving office, Kohl's reputation was tarnished by a financing scandal in his center-right CDU, now led by Merkel. Until his death, Kohl refused to identify the donors, saying he had given them his word.  Helmut Was a Rock  Tributes poured in from around the world. Slideshow (16 Images)Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush said he and his wife Barbara  mourn the loss of a true friend of freedom, and the man I consider one of the greatest leaders in post-war Europe .  Working closely with my very good friend to help achieve a peaceful end to the Cold War and the unification of Germany within NATO will remain one of the great joys of my life,  he said in a statement.  Helmut was a rock.  Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, who worked with Kohl to negotiate the peaceful reunification of Germany, said:  The United States has lost one of its best friends and the world has lost a ringing voice for freedom.  The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had sent condolences to Germany's president and to Merkel and cited him as saying Kohl  will be remembered in Russia as a resolute supporter of friendly relations between our countries . In Brussels, European flags were lowered to half-staff in tribute. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who served as Luxembourg's prime minister while Kohl was in office, tweeted:  Helmut's death hurts me deeply. My mentor, my friend, the very essence of Europe, he will be greatly, greatly missed.  At home, Kohl is celebrated above all as the father of German reunification, which he achieved after the November 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall. He won voters in bleak communist East Germany by promising them  flourishing landscapes . Kohl, along with former European Commission chief Jacques Delors and Jean Monnet, founding father of the European project, are the only three people the EU has made Honorary Citizens of Europe, an honor bestowed for extraordinary work to promote European cooperation.

(Reuters) - Bill Cosby's defense lawyer asked a judge to declare a mistrial in his sexual assault case for at least the sixth time on Friday night, arguing that the jury's deliberations, which will enter a sixth day on Saturday, have dragged on too long.  We had a 36-hour trial, and this is the 52nd hour  of deliberations, a visibly frustrated Brian McMonagle told Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill at about 8:45 p.m. Friday was the jury's fourth consecutive 12-hour day. O'Neill said he could not prevent jurors from working as long as they are willing to continue mulling whether the 79-year-old comedian was guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. The star of the 1980s TV hit family comedy  The Cosby Show  faces similar allegations from dozens of women, although only Constand's led to criminal charges. Cosby has denied all of the claims. The jurors told O'Neill on Thursday morning they were having trouble reaching a verdict on the three counts he faces, prompting the judge to give a standard instruction that they should keep working without compromising their individual beliefs. McMonagle said he was concerned the jurors feel compelled to deliver a unanimous verdict even if it meant abandoning their true feelings.  They already said that they're deadlocked,  he said.  I don’t think they know that they can say it again.

Since deliberations began on Monday, the jury has reviewed enormous chunks of testimony, prompting McMonagle to complain that it was essentially watching a replay of the trial. On Friday, the jurors reviewed portions of the sworn depositions Cosby gave during Constand's civil lawsuit in 2005 and 2006, when he described the night in question. Slideshow (16 Images)Cosby did not testify at the trial, but the jury had heard a police interview with him from 2005 as well as his depositions. Constand was the prosecution's key witness, telling jurors that Cosby gave her three unidentified pills before taking advantage when she was disoriented to sexually assault her. Cosby's lawyers sought to discredit her by pointing to discrepancies between her testimony and statements to law enforcement in 2005, when she first reported the incident a year after it allegedly occurred. Outside the courthouse, Cosby's spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, gave a news conference in which he thanked the comedian's supporters and praised the jury for its conscientiousness. In response, one of Cosby's other accusers, Lili Bernard, stood in front of the television cameras and said,  One thing: rapists lie.

Union members participating in the nationwide walkout held near-daily marches, often blocking busy roads in the capital Bogota to demand more funding for school maintenance, supplies, student meals and salaries. President Juan Manuel Santos says he is focused on combating inequality and improving education now that a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), an end of more than 52 years of war, is under way. But educators said improvements are nowhere to be seen and their salaries, some as low as 1.8 million pesos per month (about $610), are not adequate compensation for work that requires extensive and expensive higher education.  The government's priority was always to reach an agreement that recognizes the work of teachers and the indispensable role of education in the development of the country and, at the same time, be responsible with public finances,  Education Minister Yaneth Ghia told reporters. The deal, among other things, will improve salaries through progressive bonus payments and allow bigger union involvement in how money is spent on education, she said. Yaneth Giha, Minister of Education of Colombia and Carlos Rivas, President of the Colombian Federation of Education Workers, sign an agreement to improve the working conditions of teachers in Bogota, Colombia, June 16, 2017.Jaime SaldarriagaThe powerful Colombian Federation of Education Workers (Fecode) union, which represents more than 350,000 teachers, agreed to the deal after meeting with Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas.  The president said the money that went to the war would go to education but now there's no FARC, no guns and we don't see the funds,  said high school teacher Jose Escobar, 36, earlier on Friday during a protest in Bogota's main square. FILE PHOTO - Colombian teachers protest, demanding better salaries and working conditions, in Bogota, Colombia, June 13, 2017.Jaime SaldarriagaPlaces at his school, Colegio German Arciniegas in Bogota's poor Bosa neighborhood, are in such high demand that it has been impossible to implement the government's goal of full-day classes, Escobar said. Instead, 4,800 students in grades nine through 11 attend half-day, or six hours.  Friday's deal will push toward the aim of full-day study.     Santos has weathered a wave of strikes in recent weeks, reaching agreements to halt protests in the port city Buenaventura and a strike by public workers.  If the government truly is working for peace, they need to start here,  said Adriana Tunjo, a fifth-grade teacher in southern Bogota, who like other protesters decried problems which included electricity outages and sporadic provision of meals.

The prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, 59, a former ally of Maduro, has accused security forces of excessive violence, in the highest-profile dissent from within government ranks since anti-government unrest began in April killing at least 72 people. Ortega also has opposed decisions by the pro-Maduro Supreme Court and National Election Council and said the president's plan for a new congress to rewrite the constitution threatens democracy and late leader Hugo Chavez's legacy. That has led to a plethora of counter-accusations by officials against her, ranging from insanity to promoting  terrorist  violence. Lawmaker Pedro Carreno formally petitioned the Supreme Court on Friday to declare her guilty of  grave offense,  meaning she could be dismissed.  This lady stopped being the chief prosecutor of the republic and turned into a right-wing political activist,  he said, also requesting Ortega have her property confiscated and be prohibited from leaving the country.  Demonstrations against Maduro have raged since early April, often turning violent as masked protesters with rocks and Molotov cocktails face off against security forces using teargas and water cannons.  The fatalities, mainly from gunshots, have included supporters of both sides, bystanders and security officials. The latest victim on Friday was Nelson Arevalo, 22, killed in a protest in the city of Barquisimeto, authorities said. Opposition sources said he was shot in the neck.    Protesters are seeking elections to end socialist rule in the OPEC nation of 30 million people, plus solutions to a brutal economic crisis, freedom for hundreds of jailed activists, and autonomy for the opposition-controlled National Assembly. Maduro, the 54-year-old former bus driver and self-declared  son  of Chavez, says his foes are seeking a violent coup against him, with U.S. support.

We need clients, business, we need the economy to move and by isolating Cuba, they will only manage to hurt many Cuban families and force companies to close,  she said. The 2014 deal sparked widespread euphoria in Cuba and raised hopes for an improvement in its ailing economy.  An increased arrival of U.S. tourists thanks to eased restrictions fueled a boom in tourism, especially in Havana, creating demand for more BnBs, restaurants, taxis and tour guides in the fledgling private sector. But critics say the opening failed to improve rights on the island. Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obama’s measures to a large extent on those grounds, the White House officials said, and some Cuban dissidents back his tougher stance, saying repression has worsened since the detente. Cuban authorities have stepped up their detentions of activists, often confiscating their telephones and laptops, but they have also been coming down with a heavy hand on self- employed Cubans who appear to be empowering themselves. Retired electronics technician Aramis Castillo, 79, watches U.S. President Donald Trump announcing his Cuba policy live on television in his home in Havana, Cuba, June 16, 2017.Alexandre Meneghini When the Obama administration stopped condemning human rights violations in Cuba, the regime here said 'look we can do this and nothing happens, so we can continue repressing more forcefully',  said Jose Daniel Ferrer, who leads the Patriotic Union of Cuba, the country's largest dissident group. Ferrer said his group had 53 activists currently imprisoned due to their political views. Other dissidents agree repression has worsened but say rolling back the detente, which will hurt ordinary Cubans, is not the solution.  It will probably not have any benefit in terms of human rights,  said Eliecer Avila, the leader of the opposition youth group Somos Mas.

I am concerned it will affect the private sector quite a bit and much more than the Cuban government,  he said. Without doubt it will impact those in the tourism industry that have benefited from a threefold increase in U.S. visits in the last two years, although it is unclear just how much.  It's going to really hurt me because the majority of my clients are from the United States,  said Enrique Montoto, 61, who rents rooms on U.S. online home-rental marketplace Airbnb, which expanded into Cuba in 2015.  With things going to pot, I'll have to tighten my belt.   This new setback to the Cuban economy will come at a time when it is already wrestling with falling oil shipments from crisis-stricken ally Venezuela and a decline in exports.  This is another blow for Cubans and it will hurt our pockets obviously,  said Martha Garcia, 51.  With the United States, there is no tranquility.

He had roughly $20 million in income from his new marquee Washington hotel, which opened just down the street from the White House last September. Revenues also increased at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort known as the  Winter White House.  Trump reported income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion. (bit.ly/2sah0ZM) The 98-page disclosure document posted on the ethics office's  website showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas [DBKGK.UL], a unit of German-based Deutsche Bank AG. For example, Trump disclosed a liability to Deutsche exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a historic Washington property where he has opened a hotel.  Trump reported liabilities of at least $110 million to Ladder Capital Corp , a commercial real estate lender with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Boca Raton, Florida. The largest component of Trump's income was $115.9 million listed as golf-resort related revenues from Trump National Doral in Miami, down from $132 million he reported a year ago. Income from many of his other hotels and resorts largely held steady. Revenue from Trump Corporation, his real-estate management company, nearly tripled, to $18 million, and revenue from Mar-a-Lago grew by 25 percent, to $37.25 million. The private club doubled its initiation fee to $200,000 after Trump's election. He earned $11 million from the Miss Universe pageant, after selling the beauty contest back in 2015.

His assets probably exceeded $1.4 billion because the disclosure form provided ranges of values. The document showed Trump held officer positions in 565 corporations or other entities before becoming U.S. president. His tenure in most of those posts ended on Jan. 19, the day before his inauguration, and in others in 2015 and 2016. Most of the entities involved were based in the United States, with a handful in Scotland, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, Bermuda and elsewhere. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would give a much clearer indication of his wealth and business interests. But he has submitted federal forms disclosing his and his family's income, assets and liabilities.  President Trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his personal financial disclosure form,  the White House said in a statement, adding that the form was  certified by the Office of Government Ethics pursuant to its normal procedures.  An Office of Government Ethics spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the report, other than to say that it was certified by the office, which is an ethics watchdog for federal government employees. Trump released a disclosure form in May 2016 that his campaign at the time said showed his net worth was $10 billion. Some critics disputed that figure as overblown. Before taking office in January, Trump was a New York real estate developer and television celebrity.

The increased significance of tech comes on the heels of an around twenty percent gain in the sector this year which led to a pullback over the last week. FTSE Russell finalizes its annual refresh of its widely-followed indexes on June 23, a move that prompts fund managers to adjust their portfolios to reflect new weightings. Largecap tech is expected to see a more than 3 percent weighting increase in Russell's growth index, a major benchmark for portfolio managers. After a brief classification as a partial value stock last year, Apple Inc is set to be once again classified as 100 percent growth. Some managers may be uncomfortable about having such a heavy growth weighting in tech, but they will have little leeway if they are benchmarked to a universal index.     At the other end of the spectrum, largecap healthcare and consumer discretionary are expected to see the biggest weighting bumps in Russell's value category according to Jefferies, with increases of 2.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.   If you think of style, you think of whatever has worked in the year goes back to growth and whatever hasn’t worked goes back to value,  said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York.  It’s not a fair assessment, but at the margin that is kind of the driver.    Investors looking to trade on volatility may find some relief on June 23 when Russell's refresh typically drives the largest trading day of the year. Credit Suisse currently anticipates roughly $49 billion in share turnover for this year's rebalance.  FTSE Russell maintains some of the most widely followed benchmarks in the United States with $8.6 trillion in assets tracking or invested in products that follow its indexes, according to the firm.   On an individual basis, nearly 400 companies will be affected by the rebalance, according to Ivan Cajic, head of index research at ITG in New York.   This year there are 10 additions and 2 deletions from the Russell 1000 so it is a much larger trade in the Russell 1000 space,  said Cajic.   Unlike Standard & Poor's, which refreshes its indexes on a rolling basis, Russell's reconstitutes its indexes just once a year.  As the CBOE volatility index has languished below 20 since the U.S. Presidential election, investors will also welcome the boost in liquidity the rebalance provides.  You might not necessarily have only indexers present in this year’s rebalance and the days leading up to it,  Cajic said.   One widely-followed stock that will not be joining a Russell index yet is Snap Inc. Due to the company's unusual share structure, Russell is withholding a decision until after the rebalance until an analysis and comment period from the investment community is completed.   We need to look at it because there is a potentially a trend for these types of offerings, particularly technology companies,  said Mat Lystra, senior research analyst at FTSE Russell in Seattle.

To borrow a phrase from British Prime Minister Theresa May's ill-fated election campaign, it's beginning to look strong and stable. As well as cutting borrowing costs to rock bottom, the European Central Bank has bought well over a trillion euros of mainly government bonds as part of a battle to drive growth and get inflation back to its 2 percent target ceiling. At last, the ultra-loose monetary policy appears to be paying dividends. Euro zone growth hit its fastest rate in two years at the start of 2017, and while it has probably slowed a tad this quarter, it remains robust. [ECILT/EU] This has turned a well-established industry of bemoaning the single currency bloc's poor performance on its head.   The ECB's billions are increasingly filtering through to the real economy. It is somewhat through gritted teeth that we expect two to three further years of buoyant euro zone economic growth,  said Jorg Kramer at Commerzbank.  A flash purchasing managers' index on the coming Friday will provide the first clue on whether May's momentum, which suggested quarterly economic growth of 0.7 percent, has carried into June. A Reuters poll predicted it largely has.      The euro zone has led the developed world upturn, according to the PMI surveys, with the region enjoying its fastest growth for six years so far in the second quarter,  wrote Bernard Aw, an economist at IHS Markit which compiles the PMI surveys, in a research note. Earlier this month the ECB closed the door on more interest rate cuts, judging the bloc's economy to be rebounding, but said inflation looks to remain weak for years so it still needs to keep extraordinary stimulus in place. That stance stands in stark contrast to the United States Federal Reserve. It jacked up borrowing costs for the second time in three months in the past week and said it would begin doing the opposite to the ECB and start cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year. Britain FILE PHOTO: The European Central Bank (ECB) headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, July 29, 2016.Ralph Orlowski/File PhotoEven in Britain, which is about to embark on two years of talks to extricate itself from the European Union, three of eight policymakers at the Bank of England voted this week to raise interest rates.  The chances Britain ends up outside the single market when Brexit talks are concluded have receded somewhat after last week's election, although the pound might weaken further against other currencies, a Reuters poll of economists found in the past  week. EU member states meet in the coming week to review the latest developments in negotiations. May had been expected to win a landslide victory but as voting day approached opinion polls narrowed and in the end May failed to get a majority in parliament. She had repeatedly said she would be prepared to walk away from negotiations without a deal if necessary. But she now might find that more difficult to do and will have to take a softer line.   The hung parliament resulting from last week's election has increased the risk of a slowdown in UK GDP growth due to heightened political uncertainty,  said Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics. Britain's economy slowed more sharply than first thought in early 2017 as consumers felt the hit from rising inflation, official data showed last month, losing a lot of its momentum of last year. In a light week for economic data, public borrowing numbers for the UK will be the main release where a small improvement is predicted, but with growth risks moving to the downside further major improvements may be difficult to achieve. Otherwise, U.S. home sales reports are the coming week's key data, with a slight pick up in housing starts predicted. Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and New York Fed William President Dudley, along with several other Federal Open Market Committee participants, will speak on monetary policy, possibly offering more clarity. Wall Street's top banks brought forward their expectations for when they think the Fed will begin reducing its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio to as early September, and see balance sheet reduction as more of a priority than another interest rate rise, a Reuters poll showed. [FED/R] Central banks in Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines and Taiwan also meet in the coming week.

However, while the world's top three are making other plans for the weekend after missing the cut, college amateur Cameron Champ is proving that massive tee shots can still help get the job done on the long, links-style layout. Champ, a qualifier from Texas A&M;, is leading the 156-player field in average driving distance over the first two rounds at 339 yards, and is tied for eighth on the leaderboard, two shots off the pace at five-under-par after Friday's three-under 69.  It feels great. I came in this week with no expectations really at all,  said the 22-year-old.  The course sets up very well for me off the tee. If you hit it off the tee you can score.  Champ is used to belting the ball a long, long way.  In college I normally am the longest. I guess I've just kind of always been that way. You've still got to make a score. Here if you can hit it long and straight, it's a great advantage. I took advantage of it the last few days.  The Californian has been bashing the ball great distances for a long time.  I just naturally have done it since I was 15 or 16. As I've gotten older, I've gotten a little farther, but a lot more straighter. When I was younger it went everywhere. That didn't work out too well.  This is the first time I've been in kind of the spotlight. I've known my game could be capable ... with my distance and my wedge game. So it's just nice to see it come along at the right time.  Champ said a practice round with former British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen and four-times major winner McIlroy on Monday helped his confidence.  Just to see their games and how they play, I've grown up watching them. And I can hit those shots. So that just kind of gave me a confidence boost, knowing I can hit those shots.  Helping him cope at the tournament is college room mate and caddie Jake Goodman.  My best friend has caddied for me for six or seven years,  said Champ.  It's fun having him on the bag. When I get down he kind of tells me a joke or something dumb. He keeps me smiling.  Editing by Peter Rutherford","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-usopen-champ-idUSKBN19801Q"},

The Englishman rallied with a string of five birdies in a row on the way to a one-under 71 that put the smile back on his face and his name on top of the leaderboard at Erin Hills.  Not every day you enjoy a round of golf with an eight on the card, but I'm a pretty happy man,  Casey said after his round. Following the afternoon wave, Casey must have been positively beaming because the long-hitting 39-year-old surprisingly found himself in a four-way tie for the halfway lead at seven-under 137. Casey refused to let the triple get him down and accepted accountability.  It was a good display, all my own fault, of what can happen if you get out of position on this golf course, which is what I did on 14,  said 14th-ranked Casey.  Even just trying to take my medicine is very, very difficult. It's a good eight in the end.  Casey did not lose faith in his game plan and that paid off.  It felt great. Clearly the game plan is pretty good,  he said about his run of birdies that began at 17 and raged on through the turn.  Looking towards the weekend, he said all the low scoring on the rain-softened course could abruptly end.  It doesn't need to be too much of a change for this golf course to play pretty difficult,  said Casey.  If the sun stays like it is and the wind keeps baking this golf course out, it's pretty treacherous on the weekend, which is just what I would like, and I think what the rest of the players want to see.  Casey said he would not change his approach as he pursues his first major.  It doesn't affect the game plan one bit, and it doesn't really affect the mindset,  he said.  There will probably be more nerves, more excitement.  I've shown what can happen with one bad swing. So you've got to be very, very patient and stay in the moment. I know it's cliché, but the last thing you need to be doing is thinking ahead, especially on this golf course.

The magazine report came a month after members of the billionaire Batista family, who control about 42 percent of JBS, signed a plea deal in a corruption probe in their native Brazil. Efforts to reach Mubadala's media office outside working hours were unsuccessful. The Batista family's investment holding company J&F; Investimentos SA, São Paulo-based JBS and Cargill did not have an immediate comment.

Harris, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, could end his term as head of Pacific Command (PACOM) after three years in May, two sources with knowledge of the potential change told Reuters. Most PACOM commanders serve three years but there is no official term limit. A U.S. official said that while the timing could be right, the process of replacing Harris - starting with a nomination to the Senate Armed Services Committee - had not yet begun.  That definitely hasn't happened,  the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  I would guess it maybe happens in the winter sometime.   This is pure speculation, and no decisions have been made regarding the transition timing for the next commander,  chief PACOM spokesman Captain Darryn James said.    That said, the usual transition for combatant commanders is around the three-year point, and since Admiral Harris took command of PACOM in May 2015, his projected date has always been May 2018,  James added.  Several U.S. sources said Harris' departure would be part of normal rotation of command. If Trump follows Obama's example, he will need to nominate a successor around September for approval by the U.S. Senate by the year-end. Those deliberations would come as Trump courts China to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs. Harris, who upset China two years ago by dubbing its South China Sea island-building as a  great wall of sand,  reports to Trump through Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.  The appointment of his successor will be closely watched by Washington's allies in Asia. The U.S. sources said possible contenders to replace Harris included Admiral Scott Swift, also a strong proponent of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and elsewhere, who has pushed for a bigger role for the U.S. Navy Third Fleet in Asia.  Others were Admiral Philip Davidson, commander of the U.S. U.S. Fleet Forces Command, and Admiral Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations. Should the traditional navy post go to another service, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, commander of Pacific Air Forces, could be in line, analysts say. Harris has had to shore up U.S. alliances in Asia amid concerns that Trump's decision to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and the Paris climate accord could signal a U.S. withdrawal from a global role.  American leadership matters greatly to our allies, partners and even our adversaries in the Indo-Asia-Pacific,  Harris said in an emailed statement to Reuters this month.

But one group of investors is heading the other way - concerned that shale may become a victim of its own success. The speed of the recovery in the U.S. shale industry in the past year has surprised oil investors after a global supply glut led to a two-year crude price slump and bankrupted many shale firms. Eight prominent hedge funds have reduced the size of their positions in ten of the top shale firms by over $400 million, concerned producers are pumping oil so fast they will undo the nascent recovery in the industry after OPEC and some non-OPEC producers agreed to cut supply in November.  The funds, with assets of $286 billion and substantial energy holdings, cut exposure to firms that are either pure-play Permian companies or that derive significant revenues from the region, according to an analysis of their investments based on Reuters data. The Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), accounting for more than a quarter of overall U.S. crude production.  We'll have to see if these U.S. producers have the discipline to not go crazy and keep prices where they keep making money,  said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Dallas-based investment firm Hodges Capital Management. Hodges Capital owns shares of Permian play firms including Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O), RSP Permian Inc (RSPP.N) and Callon Petroleum Co (CPE.N). Bradshaw's firm has maintained its exposure to the Permian. There is no sign that shale producers will restrain production. They redeployed rigs and personnel quickly since prices began strengthening in 2016 and made shale profitable again; rig counts have risen by 40 percent this year in the Permian, which accounts for about half of all U.S. onshore oil rigs.  Hedge funds pulled back in the first quarter, according to the most recently available regulatory filings, and the stocks have continued to struggle as oil prices have come under renewed pressure. The value of these funds' positions in the 10 Permian companies declined by 14 percent, to $2.66 billion in the first quarter, the most recent data available, from $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Hedge funds have continued to reduce their exposure to energy stocks in the second quarter, said Mark Connors, global head of portfolio and risk advisory at Credit Suisse, though he could not provide figures specific to shale companies. Margins Squeezed Fund managers interviewed expressed concern that volatile oil prices along with rising service costs and acreage prices are not reflected in overly optimistic projections for the Permian.  The funds analyzed include Pointstate Capital LP, a $25 billion fund with 16 percent in energy shares, and Arosa Capital Management, a $2.1 billion fund with more than 90 percent of assets in energy stocks. Pointstate and Arosa declined comment.  Margins will continue to be squeezed by a 15 to 20 percent increase in service costs in the Permian basin,  said Michael Roomberg, portfolio manager of the Miller/Howard Drill Bit to Burner Tip Fund. A Reuters analysis of 10 Permian producers, including several that almost exclusively operate in Texas, carry an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 35, compared with the overall energy sector's P/E ratio of about 17.8.      These are not great returns, but the problem is the market is rewarding them,  said an analyst at one of the hedge funds on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Concerns about lofty land prices are driving some of the pullback by hedge funds, according to two fund analysts who could not speak on the record. Values for Permian acreage have increased 30 percent from two years ago, according to Detring Energy Advisors in Houston.  The 10 Permian stocks analyzed have, on average, dropped 18 percent so year, compared with the broader S&P; 500 energy sector's 13 percent fall.  Permian production is expected to reach 2.47 million bpd by July, a 330,000 bpd increase from the beginning of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Department.  Last month the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other key producers, including Russia, extended a historic output cut agreement to combat a global glut.  However, production from non-OPEC countries, especially the U.S., continues to rise and weigh on prices. U.S. crude prices CLc1 on Wednesday hit a six-month low just above $44 per barrel.  Reuters analysis shows many shale companies reduced hedges in the first quarter, leaving them vulnerable to falling oil prices. Still, fund managers say compared to other U.S. plays, the Permian still has the lowest break-even costs.  In terms of the time horizon, the economics of the Permian are so good they’re going to keep on drilling,  said Colin Davies, senior analyst at oil services company AB Bernstein.

The congressman's status remains critical,  Dr. Jack Sava, the director of trauma at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center, told reporters.  An excellent recovery is a good possibility.  Scalise, 51, sustained injuries to internal organs, broken bones and severe bleeding after being shot in his left hip on Wednesday morning on a baseball field in a Washington suburb. Scalise had been at  imminent risk of death  when he was first brought into the hospital on Wednesday, and he received many units of transfused blood, Sava said. The congressman's risk of death was now substantially lower because doctors have controlled the bleeding and his vital signs have stabilized. Scalise, who has had two surgeries, will need additional operations and will be in the hospital for  a considerable period of time, presumably weeks,  Sava said. Because the bullet shattered, there may be hundreds of fragments in Scalise's body and doctors do not intend to try to remove them all, Sava said. He declined to describe specific internal injuries. Once recovered, Scalise will be able to walk and hopefully run, the doctor said. He said doctors have turned down Scalise's sedation levels enough that he has been able to respond to visiting family members. Signs acknowledging wounded congressman Rep.

Hodgkinson died after being shot by police. A list of Republican lawmakers was found on Hodgkinson's body, CBS News reported, citing an unidentified U.S. official. The list included Representatives Mo Brooks and Jeff Duncan, who were at the practice, and Representative Trent Franks, who was not, CBS said.

The FBI continues to process evidence in an effort to assess the potential motivations of the shooter, the agency said in a statement Friday. Hodgkinson had a history of posting angry messages against Trump and other Republicans on social media.

Avildsen had been suffering pancreatic cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, his son, Anthony, said by phone. Avildsen won the Academy Award for best director for  Rocky  while the film was named best picture and other successes included the  The Karate Kid  series in the 1980s. He directed seven actors to Oscar nominations. In the years before  Rocky,  Avildsen won praise for two dark character studies:  Joe  (1970) with Peter Boyle and Susan Sarandon and  Save the Tiger  (1973) starring Jack Lemmon, who won the Academy Award for best actor for the role. He also had his share of career setbacks, directing some clunkers and being fired as director of 1970s classics  Saturday Night Fever  and  Serpico  because of disputes with producers.  Rocky  proved to be as much of an underdog success story as the fictional Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa portrayed by Stallone, who wrote the screenplay. Stallone was an obscure actor at the time but stubbornly refused to allow studios to cast anyone but himself in the role. Producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler consented to let him take the role under Avildsen's guidance.  Rocky  was made for a modest $1 million and generated $225 million in ticket sales to became a cultural phenomenon, with a series of unforgettable characters and scenes and a blend of romance with pugilistic action. The film centers on charismatic champion Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, plucking Balboa, known as  The Italian Stallion,  from obscurity for a dream shot at the world heavyweight boxing title. Rocky, who earns money as a collector for a loan shark, falls in love with the mousy Adrian (Talia Shire), the sister of his miserable friend Paulie (Burt Young), and gets help from a gruff trainer named Mickey (Burgess Meredith) who long felt Rocky had wasted his considerable potential. Avildsen took the  Rocky  job only because funding fell through for another movie he was set to direct.  My friend sent me this ( Rocky ) script and got me to read it,  Avildsen told the Birmingham, Alabama, News in 2000.  And on the third page, this guy is talking to his turtles, and I was hooked. It was a great character study.  There were low expectations.  It had to be done in 28 days for less than a million bucks, and nobody bothered you because there was so little money involved,  Avildsen said.  There was no anticipation of it being anything but on the bottom bill of a drive-in in East Podunk.   Rocky  was nominated for 10 Oscars and won three, with Stallone taking the best actor award. In accepting the Oscar for best director in March 1977, Avildsen told the audience,  I guess what 'Rocky' did was give a lot of people hope and there was never a better feeling than doing that.  Avildsen's professional stumbles included tangling with stars John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd on the comedy  Neighbors  (1981), then made the crass male-stripper movie  A Night in Heaven  (1983). His next film,  The Karate Kid  in 1984, triumphed with an underdog theme similar to  Rocky  as a bullied teenager played by Ralph Macchio overcame the odds with the help of a wise martial arts master, played by Pat Morita. He also directed  Karate Kid  sequels in 1986 and 1989. Avildsen returned to the  Rocky  franchise to direct the critically panned  Rocky V  (1990) about a protégé who turns on Rocky. Avildsen intended for the Rocky character to die in the film but studio bosses disagreed.  They told me James Bond doesn't die. Superman doesn't die. Rocky doesn't die,  Avildsen told USA Today in 2014.  So Rocky didn't die. But the movie died.  Avildsen also directed Burt Reynolds in the likable caper  W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings  (1975), George C. Scott and Marlon Brando in the thriller  The Formula  (1980), Morgan Freeman in school drama  Lean on Me  (1989) and the apartheid tale  The Power of One  (1992). Avildsen was born on Dec. 21, 1935, in Oak Park, Illinois. After serving in the military, he made industrial films for companies and worked as an assistant to directors, including Otto Preminger before directing his first film in 1969,  Turn On to Love.

The migrants were African, Asian and Arab, and included 98 women and 25 children, Qassem said.

More than 60,000 migrants have crossed the central Mediterranean route from Libya to Italy so far this year.   Smugglers pack the migrants onto ill-equipped boats that usually get picked up by European rescue vessels once they reach international waters. However, some sink or become stranded when smugglers remove the engines for reuse, and some get turned back by the Libyan coast guard.

Trump reported income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion. The 98-page disclosure document posted on the office's website showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a unit of German-based Deutsche Bank AG. For example, Trump disclosed a liability to Deutsche exceeding $50 million for the Old Post Office, a landmark historic property in downtown Washington that he recently redeveloped into a hotel located near the White House. Trump reported liabilities of at least $110 million to Ladder Capital, a commercial real estate lender with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Boca Raton, Florida. The largest component of Trump's income was $115.9 million listed as golf-resort related revenues from Trump National Doral in Miami. His assets probably exceeded $1.4 billion because the disclosure form provided ranges of values. The document showed Trump held officer positions in 565 corporations or other entities before becoming U.S. president. His tenure in most of those posts ended on Jan. 19, the day before his inauguration, and in others in 2015 and 2016. Most of the entities involved were based in the United States, with a handful in Scotland, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, Bermuda and elsewhere. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, which would give a much clearer indication of his wealth and business interests. But he has submitted federal forms disclosing his and his family's income, assets and liabilities.  President Trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his personal financial disclosure form,  the White House said in a statement, adding that the form was  certified by the Office of Government Ethics pursuant to its normal procedures.  An Office of Government Ethics spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the report, other than to say that it was certified by the office, which is an ethics watchdog for federal government employees. Trump released a disclosure form in May 2016 that his campaign at the time said showed his net worth was $10 billion. Some critics disputed that figure as overblown. Before taking office in January, Trump was a New York real estate developer and television celebrity.

The grants are intended to buy time for state lawmakers to address potential shortfalls caused by federal attempts to undo the Affordable Health Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, and to eliminate funding for women’s health and for contraception, the state said. A California financing program will provide money for the grants, said Treasurer spokesman Marc Lifsher.  The Community Clinic Lifeline Grant Program will help small or rural nonprofit clinics, including Planned Parenthood clinics, keep their doors open and provide critical services,   according to an announcement the Treasurer's office posted on Friday. Planned Parenthood, a national non-profit that provides contraception, health screenings and abortions, and the country's long-standing divide over abortion are at the heart of the state's move. Planned Parenthood representatives will join Chiang in unveiling the grant program, the announcement said. Republicans generally oppose abortion. Recently, they approved a measure in Congress to allow states to block Planned Parenthood from receiving federal reproductive health funds. By law the funds cannot be used for abortions, but former Democratic President Barack Obama had ensured some money would go to Planned Parenthood clinics. Actual federal funding reductions are still a while off.  In his recent proposed budget President Donald Trump called for slashing health and human services spending, and the Obamacare repeal the House of Representatives passed in April would eliminate federal funds for Planned Parenthood. But those moves do not have the force of law yet. No other state appears to be developing a similar grant program.

Goldman advised Amazon.com Inc and Evercore advised Whole Foods Markets Inc on Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods that will see the U.S. organic grocery chain become part of the world's largest internet retailer. The deal was Amazon's first valued at more than $1 billion, making it a coveted trophy for investment bankers in search of fees and glory. Goldman had laid the ground for this moment. Last year, it dispatched senior bankers to several North American cities where big companies are based, including Atlanta, Toronto and Seattle.    One of those bankers, David Eisman, moved from San Francisco to Seattle to help lead a small team tasked with strengthening ties with the city's biggest companies, including Amazon, Microsoft Corp and Starbucks Corp.   When Amazon decided to approach Whole Foods last month, it picked Goldman for advice. Eisman advised the company alongside fellow Goldman bankers Colin Ryan, who focuses on technology mergers, and Cosmo Roe, who focuses on consumer and retail companies.  FILE PHOTO - Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in Manhattan, New York, U.S. on January 29, 2016.Mike Segar/File PhotoEvercore itself clinched a role in the deal with the help of a Goldman alumnus. Last year, Evercore poached Goldman's head of activism defense Bill Anderson, who for more than 12 years had advised more than 175 companies on how to tackle activist investors and hostile bids. When Jana Partners LLC in April said it had raised its stake in Whole Foods in April and pushed for a sale of the company, Whole Foods interviewed several investment banks to hire an adviser to help defend against the activist hedge fund.  From the moment Jana had announced its stake in Whole Foods ... an onslaught of attention from media and banks ensued,  Whole Foods' chief executive, John Mackey, said in a Texas Monthly article this month. Whole Foods' conversations with banks took place before the company was approached by Amazon, so Goldman was also vying for a role with Whole Foods. With Anderson among its ranks, however, Evercore prevailed. When Amazon approached, Whole Foods turned again to Evercore. Anderson advised Whole Foods alongside senior Evercore bankers Eduardo Mestre and William Hiltz. Goldman now stands to receive $30 million to $35 million in advisory fees, while Evercore stands to receive $40 million to $50 million, according to estimates from investment banking advisory firm Freeman & Co LLC. Goldman and Bank of America Corp, which provided bridge financing to Amazon, could receive between $35 million and $50 million in debt arranging fees, according to Freeman.

Recently, they approved a measure in Congress to allow states to block Planned Parenthood from receiving federal reproductive health funds. By law the funds cannot be used for abortions, but former Democratic President Barack Obama had ensured some money would go to Planned Parenthood clinics. Actual federal funding reductions are still a while off. In his recent proposed budget President Donald Trump called for slashing health and human services spending, and the Obamacare repeal the House of Representatives passed in April would eliminate federal funds for Planned Parenthood. But those moves do not have the force of law yet. No other state appears to be developing a similar grant program.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-california-health-idUSL1N1JD22T"},

Estonia upstart Taxify is hoping to win over drivers and take on Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], the industry leader, by offering a larger share of the profit. Upstarts across the world, such as Lyft Inc and Ola, are trying to catch Uber in the on-demand car-ride market by securing brand loyalty. But Uber has gathered critical mass and reached a valuation of over £60 billion in just eight years, despite a lack of profits. It has kept rivals at bay, partly by offering incentives to drivers to stay online. Taxify, a minnow compared to Uber, cannot afford these perks but believes that by taking a smaller share of fares - 15-20 percent compared to Uber's 20-25 percent - it can steal market share form its San Francisco-based rival. It also hopes that allowing drivers to take cash as well as credit card fares will also help it attract more passengers.    Taxify's biggest advantage is the focus on good service by treating the drivers and riders better than other platforms. This means having higher pay for drivers, thanks to lower fees,  Chief Executive Markus Villig told Reuters at Taxify's headquarters in Estonia.  By the end of the year, I think we will be No. 1 in about 10 countries in Europe and Africa.   An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment but the company has said it had fare revenue of around $20 billion last year. Villig said Taxify generated fares worth  tens of millions of euros  each month. Taxify runs in just 25 cities in Europe and Africa, while Uber operates in nearly 600 cities worldwide. Its basic business model is identical – both hook up passengers with self-employed drivers. Many incumbent cab companies in Europe have developed apps to operate in a similar manner but most have focused on their domestic markets. But Taxify is unusual in launching in about 18 countries, mainly smaller markets in Eastern Europe and Africa, where Uber is absent or not yet dominant. Uber usually takes market share by giving drivers money to sign on to its app, paying them even if they are not driving passengers. Then, as it becomes more popular with passengers, it withdraws the inducements. Analysts say Uber aims to build a customer franchise and stable of drivers to dominate the market.  The way I see it, Taxify is cheaper than Uber,  said Tumelo Malatjie, 33, a former truck driver for a logistics firm turned full-time Taxify driver in Johannesburg.  Taxify takes 15 percent and Uber about 25 percent or 30 percent,  said Malatjie, who nonetheless is on a waiting list to become an Uber driver. Taxify has avoided expensive head-to-head battles with its much larger rival but its model will soon be tested as Villig plans to launch in London - Uber's biggest European market in the coming months. A Taxify car drives in Tallinn, Estonia, June 13, 2017. Picture taken June 13, 2017.Ints Kalnins We are coming in as a second wave,  Villig said.     Founded 3-1/2 years ago, Taxify has 140 staff worldwide, a third of whom are based in Estonia. It says it has 2.5 million active passengers in 18 countries. Uber says it has more than 12,000 people across the world and millions of passengers in 70 countries. In Africa, Villig said Taxify has hired away 20 former Uber executives, helping its expansion in cities like Lagos, Cairo and Johannesburg.     The start-up has raised 2 million euros in outside financing from local venture capitalists. Like Uber, it is losing money, although it was  close to profitability for the past six months,  Villig said. Slideshow (6 Images)    Uber reported in late May that its net loss, excluding employee stock options and other items, narrowed in the first quarter to $708 million, from $991 million in the fourth quarter. (reuters.co.uk/article/idUSKBN18R3EQ) Steering Clear     Taxify and Uber face many of the same regulatory and commercial challenges.     Uber was dealt a major setback to its European ambitions in May when the lead advocate for Europe's highest court said it should be regulated like a transport company rather than an online electronic intermediary. Taxify could face the same legal treatment, which would make it more susceptible to new regulations being introduced by a growing number of European cities. (reut.rs/2sKxTIy)     Similarly, bans on ride-sharing in cities such as Brno in the Czech Republic, apply to Taxify as much as Uber. Uber has faced complaints from its drivers in London, France and the United States who were unhappy about compensation.  But Taxify has also had protests from drivers in Estonia unhappy at how the company had slashed fare rates. Villig declined to comment. While analysts do not expect Uber to be dethroned by Taxify anytime soon, the Estonian company's lower commission model may put pressure on Uber's margins in countries where it is seeking to cut fares or increase its share of fares.      Uber is still the market leader, which gives them the possibility to take higher fees,  Villig said.  But I think over time, they definitely need to get more competitive.

The syndication of the credit facilities was oversubscribed,  company President Ian Anderson said in the statement.  We are gratified by the outstanding level of support for this project within the financial community.  Energy infrastructure projects have faced opposition from environmental groups and aboriginal communities whose land they touch. Opposition to Trans Mountain is set to mount after the effective rise of an unfriendly government last month in Canada's British Columbia province that the pipeline passes. According to the company's statement, Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc, has entered into agreements for C$4.0 billion in revolving credit, C$1 billion in contingent credit and C$500 million in revolving working capital. Kinder Morgan Canada did not specify the source of the credit, although it said the funds would come from a group of banks, some of which underwrote its public offering last month. Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada were the main underwriters, according to Kinder Morgan's prospectus. A group of more than 20 indigenous and environmental organizations this month called on 28 major banks, including all underwriters, to back away from Trans Mountain. Ruth Breech, senior campaigner for Rainforest Action Network, one of the groups, said by phone the banks' backing of Trans Mountain was disappointing.  We'll be committed to challenging this project all the way through,  she said.  There'll absolutely be follow-up discussions with those banks.  Ratings agency DBRS Ltd on Friday placed Kinder Morgan Cochin ULC, the Canadian parent company's operating subsidiary, at  BBB.  The Trans Mountain expansion has  execution risks  including political and environmental opposition, the agency said.  In its rating assessment, DBRS has conservatively assumed a project delay of one year.  The expansion almost triples the capacity of the existing pipeline, which is designed to carry crude from Canada's oil sands to the West Coast. The expansion has obtained both federal and regulatory approvals and has passed an environmental assessment under British Columbia's incumbent Liberal Party, which lost its legislative majority in a May 9 election. The opposition Greens and New Democrats parties, both of which oppose Trans Mountain's expansion, have sealed a deal to unseat the Liberals.

Fed officials on Friday signaled that doubts are simmering.  In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said he was not alone at the U.S. central bank in his view the Fed should have waited to raise interest rates until it was sure the recent drop in price pressures really is temporary.  I wish other people were joining me in my dissents, I'll say that,  Kashkari said in a phone interview with Reuters.  I think that there's more sympathy for my views, but maybe people aren't ready to take action.   Kashkari was the lone policymaker to vote against the Fed's decision on Wednesday to raise its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point.  He also voted against the Fed's first rate hike this year, in March, although he said that his June decision was a closer call because the labor market had clearly strengthened. But while many of his colleagues were uncomfortable with risking a surge in inflation if the Fed failed to act, Kashkari was more worried about the costs of excessively low inflation.  Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan on Friday also signaled the decision to raise rates earlier this week was a tough one, although he in the end supported a rate hike and said he feels comfortable with that decision.  In this job you make trade-off decisions; I think the fact that inflation of late has been more muted, for me, made me weigh those trade-offs much more carefully,  Kaplan told reporters after a meeting of the Park Cities Rotary Club in Dallas. But he said he would want to see more evidence that inflation will rise toward the Fed's 2-percent inflation goal before increasing rates again.  The run of weaker core inflation readings has clearly rattled some Fed officials,  Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients earlier on Friday. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May, but the Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has been running below target for more than five years and in April slowed a second month to 1.5 percent.  That has led to some beginning to question the validity of the traditional narrative of a tight labor market eventually sparking higher inflation.  Recent global developments add doubt to whether the traditional dynamics still work,  Barclays economist Christian Keller said on Friday. He cited the examples of Japan and Germany, whose unemployment levels have declined to levels not seen since the early 1990s but where wage pressures also remain sluggish. At its latest meeting, the Fed scaled back its inflation forecasts for this year to 1.6 percent but according to policymakers’ median forecasts, still sees inflation rising to 2 percent next year. It also maintained its forecast of one more rate hike this year and three the next. But policymakers' inflation forecasts are more optimistic than forecasts by Fed staff, who provide economic intel to the Fed Board of Governors. The latest Fed staff forecast shows they expect inflation to still be below 2 percent in 2019.  Still, Kashkari, who ran the Treasury's bank bailout program during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, said the level of concern he feels now is  no comparison  to the feeling he had back then.   If we are making a mistake, we are making a small mistake now that I think we can recover from,  Kashkari said in the interview.  I am not sounding an alarm bell like, 'Iceberg ahead!'

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board accused Fiat Chrysler in January of using the software, known as a  defeat device,  to illegally allow excess diesel emissions in 104,000 U.S. 2014-2016 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks. Byron Bunker, director of the EPA's Transportation and Air Quality compliance division, said in a January 2016 email to Fiat Chrysler, obtained by Reuters under the Freedom of Information Act, that he was  very concerned about the unacceptably slow pace  of the automaker's efforts to explain high nitrogen oxide emissions from some of its vehicles. Nitrogen oxide is linked to smog formation and respiratory problems. Bunker's email said the EPA had told Fiat Chrysler officials at a November 2015 meeting that at least one auxiliary emissions control device on the car maker's vehicles appeared to violate the agency's regulations. Mike Dahl, head of vehicle safety and regulatory compliance for Fiat Chrysler's U.S. unit, responded in a separate email that the company was working diligently and understood the EPA's concerns. He added that if the EPA identified Fiat Chrysler vehicles as containing defeat devices it would result in  potentially significant regulatory and commercial consequences.  The documents redacted the vehicles named, but two officials briefed on the matter said they referred to diesel models. The EPA's November 2015 meeting with Fiat Chrysler came two months after Volkswagen AG, mired in a major tailpipe emissions scandal, admitted to installing secret defeat device software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to make them appear cleaner than they were on the road. At an event in Venice on Friday, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said he was  confident of the fact that there was no intention on our part to set up a defeat device that was even remotely similar to what (Volkswagen) had in their cars.  Fiat Chrysler said in a statement, meanwhile, that the emails showed it had been  meaningfully engaged with the EPA regarding its diesel engine emissions for an extended period of time.  In Venice, Marchionne also said he expected regulators will soon approve a software fix that will allow the company to sell 2017 U.S. diesel models. The same fix will be used to update and resolve concerns about 2014-2016 cars, he said. The Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler in May, saying it placed eight undeclared  defeat devices  in 2014-2016 Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles that led to  substantially  higher than allowable levels of nitrogen oxide. The department also has a separate criminal probe into the matter. Additional reporting by Agnieszka Flak in Venice","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/fiat-chrysler-emissions-idUSL1N1JB1JA"},

No final determination has been made,  said the spokesman, who asked that his name not be used. Rescinding the policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, would anger those who have said President Donald Trump is already too tough on immigration enforcement. But leaving it in place would conflict with a promise Trump made on the presidential campaign trail. There was confusion over whether the policy would remain in place late Thursday after the Department of Homeland Security published a notice that it would rescind another Obama-era immigration policy. The other policy, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, was written in 2014 to protect illegal immigrant parents with children who are U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The policy never went into effect because federal courts put it on hold. The head of the Department of Homeland Security, John Kelly, said on Friday that the agency only rescinded the policy that had faced legal challenges. DAPA  was immediately enjoined by the courts and it languished in limbo for two or three years, so my action yesterday was just a little housecleaning,  Kelly said at a meeting in Miami with Latin American leaders on security in Central America.  DACA that applies to students has not been changed,  Kelly said. The DHS statement also said DACA  will remain in effect.  The White House spokesman said the statement was only meant to clarify that the rescission of the program for parents would have no impact on the program for immigrants who arrived as children. Trump had pledged on the campaign trail to rescind all of Obama's executive orders on immigration, including DACA. But as president, he has said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA. No formal changes have been announced.

Snarski looked for help to save the fading starling, which  she called Kash in honor of her friend.  Far from the New York City borough of Queens where she rescued the bird, Snarski found The Wild Bird Fund.  Housed on the ground floor of a building on Manhattan's Upper West Side, not far from Central Park, The Wild Bird Fund has been treating sick and injured birds since 2005. Most of those birds are brought there by Good Samaritans like Snarski, said Eugene Oda, a wildlife rehabilitator and veterinary technician who examines incoming birds. Suffering from dehydration and a broken bone, the prognosis was poor for Kash. Oda took a special interest in the bird and brought it to his home to care for it.  When I heard the story, I knew I had to take Kash home,  Oda said.  I needed to make sure that starling got the best care.  Inside the small medical facility, a team of staff and volunteers tends to hundreds of birds every day, providing food, medicine, care and cleaning.   It's baby bird season and it's very, very hard for us. We get over 50 birds a day. People find all these baby birds on the ground,  Oda said.

We get over 120 different species.  Rita McMahon, a co-founder and director of The Wild Bird Fund, started the organization in her Upper West Side brownstone in 2005. Funded by donations, it moved to 565 Columbus Avenue in 2012. It is the only facility of its kind in New York City and the Humane Society, ASPCA and other animal rescue organizations bring birds  to the Fund for treatment. Slideshow (16 Images) There is so much danger out there that birds can get into,  said Oda.  It is our responsibility as citizens in the city to rescue these animals. They are basically hurt by us and we'll do our best.  Oda said the Fund's location means pigeons, sparrows, and  starlings are the most common patients.  These are the city birds that often get into trouble,  he said. The neighborhood is also home to hawks, owls, Robins, doves, ducks, geese, and a host of other types of birds. During a recent visit, a hen shared space with a white swan named Willow that was found six months ago suffering from frostbite in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.   Once healthy, creatures like Willow are sent to sanctuaries in the Tri-State area. This weekend, Willow will go to a sanctuary called Zeze in upstate New York. Local birds are released back into the wild once they have been healed. As for Kash, Oda said,  I think maybe he turned a corner. Hopefully he'll be released. And if he is, I'm hoping to contact the person who brought in the bird.

Nitrogen oxide is linked to smog formation and respiratory problems. Bunker's email said the EPA had told Fiat Chrysler officials at a November 2015 meeting that at least one auxiliary emissions control device on the car maker's vehicles appeared to violate the agency's regulations.      Mike Dahl, head of vehicle safety and regulatory compliance for Fiat Chrysler's U.S. unit, responded in a separate email that the company was working diligently and understood the EPA's concerns. He added that if the EPA identified Fiat Chrysler vehicles as containing defeat devices it would result in  potentially significant regulatory and commercial consequences.  The documents redacted the vehicles named, but two officials briefed on the matter said they referred to diesel models. The EPA's November 2015 meeting with Fiat Chrysler came two months after Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), mired in a major tailpipe emissions scandal, admitted to installing secret defeat device software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to make them appear cleaner than they were on the road. At an event in Venice on Friday, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said he was  confident of the fact that there was no intention on our part to set up a defeat device that was even remotely similar to what (Volkswagen) had in their cars.  Fiat Chrysler said in a statement, meanwhile, that the emails showed it had been  meaningfully engaged with the EPA regarding its diesel engine emissions for an extended period of time.  In Venice, Marchionne also said he expected regulators will soon approve a software fix that will allow the company to sell 2017 U.S. diesel models. The same fix will be used to update and resolve concerns about 2014-2016 cars, he said.

That policy change could be bad news for airlines that have been helped by demand from solo travelers and families who have booked seats for ad-hoc informal  cultural exchanges  that had passed muster under former President Barack Obama's loosened rules.   It's going to frustrate airlines who scheduled service on the premise that travel restrictions would eventually be removed,  Robert Mann, analyst at R.W. Mann & Co, said.  It was an 'if you build it they will come' kind of a philosophy.  Now, under directives announced by Trump on Friday, independent travel to Cuba from the United States will once again be forbidden, complicating the already tricky-to-navigate industry.

[nL1N1JD02O] The president's directive will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island but dim a potentially bright outlook for travel growth between the countries.

(tmsnrt.rs/2rBfMTI) While Trump's new policy avoids the worst-case scenario of cancelling all commercial flights or severing diplomatic relations, it will still be a blow to a tourism sector betting on Cuba as a new high-growth market.    If the goal is to help Cuban entrepreneurs, adding job-killing regulations on U.S. businesses and increasing government resources to investigate everyday Americans traveling to our island neighbor is not the answer,  James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, said in a statement.

Marriott, the world's biggest hotel chain, operates the Gaviota 5th Avenue Hotel, which is owned by the Cuban military. The Treasury Department said on its website that travel-related commercial engagements established before new regulations from the Office of Foreign Assets Control will be permitted, which appears to exempt the Marriott venture. Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said airlines are reviewing the directive and  will continue to comply with all federal rules and regulations regarding travel to Cuba.  Obama's initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into Cuba in mid-2016. Some early entrants, including smaller carriers Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways and Spirit Airlines Inc, have pulled out. While larger U.S. carriers have pared back flights to smaller Cuban cities, American Airlines, Delta, United Continental, Southwest and JetBlue have requested additional flight clearances on various routes to Havana.  Cruise operator Carnival Corp downplayed any impact from the change, saying it was  pleased  its ships could continue to sail to Cuba.

Trump,John Kelly,US,USA,IMMIGRATION,Human Rights / Civil Rights,US Government News,Asylum / Immigration / Refugees,Government / Politics,United States","sector":"Politics","content":"WASHINGTON/MIAMI (Reuters) - The Trump administration is still reviewing a policy set in 2012 by U.S. President Barack Obama that protects from deportation nearly 600,000 immigrants brought into the country illegally by their parents, known as  Dreamers,  a White House spokesman said on Friday.  No final determination has been made,  said the spokesman, who asked that his name not be used.  Rescinding the policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, would anger those who have said President Donald Trump is already too tough on immigration enforcement. But leaving it in place would conflict with a promise Trump made on the presidential campaign trail. There was confusion over whether the policy would remain in place late Thursday after the Department of Homeland Security published a notice that it would rescind another Obama-era immigration policy. The other policy, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, was written in 2014 to protect illegal immigrant parents with children who are U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The policy never went into effect because federal courts put it on hold. The head of the Department of Homeland Security, John Kelly, said on Friday that the agency only rescinded the policy that had faced legal challenges. DAPA  was immediately enjoined by the courts and it languished in limbo for two or three years, so my action yesterday was just a little housecleaning,  Kelly said at a meeting in Miami with Latin American leaders on security in Central America.   DACA that applies to students has not been changed,  Kelly said. The DHS statement also said DACA  will remain in effect.  The White House spokesman said the statement was only meant to clarify that the rescission of the program for parents would have no impact on the program for immigrants who arrived as children.  Trump had pledged on the campaign trail to rescind all of Obama's executive orders on immigration, including DACA.  But as president, he has said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA. No formal changes have been announced.

South Korea is the world's fifth-biggest consumer of nuclear energy, and one of few countries to export its technology, having won an order to build reactors in the United Arab Emirates. But a scandal over forged certificates for spare parts in 2012 and the 2011 Fukushima meltdown in neighboring Japan have undermined public support for nuclear power, while the new left-leaning government aims to speed up plans to move away from both coal and nuclear. Another 11 of South Korea's 25 reactors are set to shut down by 2030 as they reach the end of their operating lives, although some may push to have their operating licenses renewed.  With the country still setting its long-term energy plans, it is unclear how many will be replaced by new reactors.  Since Kori No.1 began operations on June 19, 1977, the 587-megawatt reactor has generated enough electricity to meet the entire country's current demand for around 100 days, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission.  I feel sad because it's like telling me to bury your own child as he turned 40,  88-year-old Lee Chang-kun, who worked as an engineer at the Kori No.1 plant, told Reuters.  The reactor was built by Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO), based on technology by now bankrupt U.S. firm Westinghouse. Suh Kyun-ryul, professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University, said the closure would set the stage for South Korea's aim of scaling back nuclear power. An energy ministry official estimated it will take at least 15 years to fully dismantle Kori No. 1, at a cost of about 644 billion won ($571 million). Some experts hope that shutting the reactor may help South Korea catch up to the United States, Japan and Germany in decommissioning plants. The global decommissioning market is expected to grow to about $980 billion by 2050, according to a report by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.  The Kori No. 1 closure  ... could work as a testbed for dismantling nuclear power plants,  said Kim Chang-lak, a nuclear engineering professor at KEPCO International Nuclear Graduate School.  It should help efforts to standardize technology for other Korean nuclear reactors and tap into the global market.

'Job Killing' U.S. cruise operators and airlines could lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the Trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel, Washington lobby group Engage Cuba said in a recent report. (tmsnrt.rs/2rBfMTI) While Trump's new policy avoids the worst-case scenario of cancelling all commercial flights or severing diplomatic relations, it will still be a blow to a tourism sector betting on Cuba as a new high-growth market.  If the goal is to help Cuban entrepreneurs, adding job-killing regulations on U.S. businesses and increasing government resources to investigate everyday Americans traveling to our island neighbor is not the answer,  James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, said in a statement. Marriott International Inc on Friday urged the White House to improve relations with post-Castro Cuba and recognize tourism as a strategic tool in the effort. Marriott, the world's biggest hotel chain, operates the Gaviota 5th Avenue Hotel, which is owned by the Cuban military. The Treasury Department said on its website that travel-related commercial engagements established before new regulations from the Office of Foreign Assets Control will be permitted, which appears to exempt the Marriott venture. Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said airlines are reviewing the directive and  will continue to comply with all federal rules and regulations regarding travel to Cuba.  Obama's initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into Cuba in mid-2016. Some early entrants, including smaller carriers Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways and Spirit Airlines Inc, have pulled out. While larger U.S. carriers have pared back flights to smaller Cuban cities, American Airlines, Delta, United Continental, Southwest and JetBlue have requested additional flight clearances on various routes to Havana. Cruise operator Carnival Corp downplayed any impact from the change, saying it was  pleased  its ships could continue to sail to Cuba.

The minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told journalists in London that Qatar should respond to demands to halt its support for  extremism and terrorism  which, he said, were being made by the whole world and not just Gulf states. Four Arab states - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt - severed diplomatic relations with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran - charges that Doha has denied. The UAE has also decided to blacklist Qatari individuals and entities.

Tillerson  will continue his efforts to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region through in-person meetings and phone conversations with Gulf and regional leaders,  the U.S. State Department said in a statement. It also said U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan would attend the OAS meeting. Sergei KarpukhinJubeir said the list being compiled by the four Arab countries were not  demands,  but  a list of grievances that need to be addressed and that the Qataris need to fix.   We are working on those with our Bahraini, Emirati and Egyptian partners in order to compile this list and present it to the Qataris, and I think it will be done fairly soon.  Calling Doha an  ally  in the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Jubeir said there was no intention of harming the Qatari people.   Enough is enough, and our Qatari brothers cannot continue to fund extremism and terrorize and incite and use hostile media and interfere with the affairs of other countries and still remain in good standing,  he said, adding he expected a positive response that would move the region to a  better place.  Jubeir did not detail what demands could be made.  But his comments echoed those of the UAE's ambassador to the United States, who said on Tuesday the list would broadly address three areas of support for terrorism, meddling in the internal affairs of the four Arab states and attacks through Qatari-owned media platforms.

Two days of technical talks involved transport ministers and aviation officials from several Gulf states and Egypt, along with senior officials from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the UN that supports the development of global aviation. ICAO cannot impose rules on states, but regulators from its 191-member countries almost always adopt and enforce the standards it sets for international aviation. Qatar had asked the ICAO to intervene after its national carrier was denied access to its neighbors' airspace as part of economic sanctions. It was the first high-level gathering of countries involved in the Gulf crisis, but there were no direct talks between Qatar and its neighbors. While the air dispute might come up at a scheduled meeting of ICAO's governing council next week, no decision on the Gulf airspace dispute is imminent, one of the sources said.     Nobody was expecting a resolution this week,  the source added. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private. Neither Qatar's ambassador to Canada, who led his country's delegation for the talks, nor a member of the Saudi delegation could be reached for comment. ICAO had no immediate comment. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran.  Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Friday in London that a list of grievances involving Qatar was being drawn up and would be presented soon. In Montreal, Saudi Transport Minister Suleiman al-Hamdan had argued that the row is a bigger political issue than airspace rights and could not be resolved by ICAO, Reuters reported on Thursday. The Saudi delegation also accused Qatar of violating article 4 of the convention, which calls on members  not to use civil aviation for any purpose inconsistent with the aims  of the international agreement. Qatar has asked the ICAO to resolve the conflict, using a dispute resolution mechanism in the Chicago Convention, a 1944 treaty that created the agency and set basic rules for international aviation. Article 84 says that if two states cannot resolve a dispute related to the convention through negotiation, one can ask the council to settle it.

PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - A jury on Friday found the Minnesota police officer who fatally shot a black motorist during a traffic stop last year not guilty of second-degree manslaughter. St. Anthony Police Department officer Jeronimo Yanez fatally shot Philando Castile, 32, last July in an incident that drew national attention and local protests when the driver's girlfriend, who was sitting in the passenger seat, streamed the aftermath on social media. Yanez had testified that he was afraid for his life and that Castile did not follow his orders. The shooting in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights, like similar incidents across the United States, fueled debate about the appropriate use of force by law enforcement against minorities. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, speaking to reporters outside the court after the verdict, said:  I'm mad as hell right now. Yes, I am. My first born son died. ... Just because he was a police officer, that makes it OK.  Valerie Castile abruptly left the courtroom after the verdict was read, as cursing and sobbing from spectators could be heard. She said the verdict shows  the system continues to fail black people,  adding,  My son loved this city and this city killed my son and the murderer gets away ... Are you kidding me right now? We are not evolving as a civilization, we are devolving.  A rally  to demand justice (and) accountability  was planned for Friday night at the state capitol by several groups including the local chapter of Black Lives Matter. St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman said the city would open two community centers and a college for community discussion on Friday, Saturday and Monday. Castile's sister, Allysza Castile, who spoke after her mother, said,  I will never have faith in the system.  The jury of seven men and five women, 10 of whom were white and the other two black, deliberated for four days before acquitting Yanez on all charges. Earl Gray, an attorney for Yanez, welcomed the decision.  Justice was done,  Gray told Reuters by telephone.  We're very happy. Yanez was innocent. He was just doing his job.  Shortly after the verdict, the City of St. Anthony said Yanez will not return to active duty and that it is negotiating a  voluntary separation agreement  with him.  I extend again my deepest condolences to Philando Castile's family, to his friends, and to his community,  Governor Mark Dayton said in a statement.  Minnesotans continue to grieve with them, for their horrible loss. Mr. Castile’s death was a terrible tragedy, with devastating consequences for everyone involved.  During his testimony, Yanez said he feared for his life after Castile disregarded his commands and began reaching for a firearm that Castile had disclosed he had in his possession. Prosecutors said Yanez was not justified in firing his gun, saying Castile was courteous and non-threatening. (Additional reporting by Timothy Mclaughlin in Chicago and Eric M.

Several Republican and Democratic members of the House of Representatives and Senate on Thursday said a security review was long overdue.  Scalise, the third-ranking Republican in the House, was seriously wounded when a gunman opened fire on him during a practice at a suburban Virginia baseball field for Thursday's annual congressional ballgame between Republicans and Democrats.  A congressional aide, a lobbyist and one police officer were also shot before police killed the gunman. A budget increase for the U.S. Capitol Police from just under $400 million this year is among the ideas under consideration. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi had been discussing  protocol and resources for members' safety  even before the attack, said a Ryan spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. Pelosi said at a news conference she believes the 2,200-member Capitol Police force needed a bigger budget. She said that she has been subjected to an  incredible amount  of threats, which she did not detail. Strong said that last week, Ryan met with Democratic Representative Cedric Richmond, at Richmond's request, to discuss whether federal regulations might allow members to use some of their campaign funds for additional security. They are seeking guidance from the Federal Election Commission. U.S. Capitol Police keep watch on Capitol Hill following a shooting in nearby Alexandria, in Washington, U.S., June 14, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinSome Republicans already are voicing opposition to the idea. Also under consideration: allowing lawmakers to use money from their House official allowances. In January 2011, a gunman shot then-Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords in a parking lot in the Tucson, Arizona area, where she was meeting with constituents. She recovered, but a federal judge and five others, including an aide to Giffords, died. That shooting prompted some new security steps, which were not described by officials because they say they never do so. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said an increase in the Capitol Police budget for fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1, is likely to be debated. House appropriators are also examining that possibility, according to one committee aide. Murkowski said senators will receive a security briefing next week that she hoped  will better inform us in terms of what we need.  Richmond told reporters he asked to talk to Ryan about security concerns in part because members of the Congressional Black Caucus, which he chairs, have been targets of threats. He said Ryan has been receptive to his ideas.  If I was the speaker...I'd do it tomorrow,  he said of potential legislation. Republican Representative Luke Messer, who supports more spending for Capitol Police, said there is a template that could instruct Congress on how to enhance security for the 535 lawmakers when they hold events in their home states.  The model would be to look at what happens in the Department of Justice,  he said, which has the U.S. Marshals Service looking after federal judges, other court officials, witnesses and jurors all across the United States.

Washington is pushing the violent countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, known as the Northern Triangle, to enact economic reforms to lift private investment and stem the flow of migrants at a meeting of Latin American leaders in Miami.   The Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America began with the Inter-American Development Bank announcing $2.5 billion in funding for infrastructure projects in the nations which make up the bulk of migrants crossing the U.S. border. Trump's administration hopes tax and regulatory changes in the region will boost growth and encourage companies to invest, filling the gap left by less aid to the region. He sent Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to oversee talks in Miami. The U.S. 2018 budget proposal plans cutting aid to Guatemala by almost 40 percent compared with 2016, and by nearly a third to Honduras and El Salvador - two nations which have competed for the title of the world's most murderous in recent years. Still, leaders from the region told the conference organized by the U.S. and Mexican governments that they are committed to local integration and improving common infrastructure.  For every dollar provided by the United States, Honduras will provide four,  Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told the conference.  We Hondurans must be the ones who most invest in these objectives,  Hernandez added.  We're the ones that have to invest in the private sector, we have to make sure that every dollar is well focused on the challenges.  Trump took office vowing to slash illegal immigration to the United States, and pledged to build a massive border wall to realize his plan that he said Mexico would pay for. That has caused repeated diplomatic strains with Mexico, which Trump accused during his election campaign of sending drug traffickers and criminals across the U.S. border. Jimmy Morales, the president of Guatemala, said the region needed to make the most of U.S. support to build on advances in battling organized crime and production of illegal narcotics.  We're saying that we, the Central American countries of the Northern Triangle, don't just have the ability to do what we need to do to help in the fight against these emerging threats, but that we're also ... absolutely willing to help,  he said. Ahead of the meeting, State Department officials said the commitment to the region was still  substantial,  with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State John Creamer saying that over the last two years, the United States has committed $1.3 billion and in fiscal 2017, the U.S. pledged an additional $650 million. Asked at a news conference if there was resistance to the U.S. aid cuts, Tillerson said  direct aid  had not been a major issue.  No one came to our meetings with their hand out,  he said.

The debate within Britain's government about how to quit the European Union has been blown wide open by an election that left May without a majority in parliament and damaged her authority in the ruling Conservative Party. Hammond, speaking to reporters before a meeting of the 28 EU finance ministers on Friday, said Britain should work closely with the bloc to prioritize jobs and prosperity when Brexit talks start next week.  As we enter negotiations next week we will do so in a spirit of sincere cooperation taking a pragmatic approach to trying to find a solution that works both for the UK and for the European Union 27,  he said.  The comments added to signs that Hammond is trying to revive his calls for a business-friendly Brexit. In contrast to May's uncompromising tone with its focus on controlling immigration, Hammond has long stressed the importance of ensuring that British employers can continue to find the skilled workers they need from the EU. Britain's giant banking industry and other business groups see Hammond as their most powerful ally in government and they were worried when it appeared he might lose his job in the run-up to the election. Jobs and Growth But May, weakened by her election flop, opted to keep Hammond in his job along with other key ministers. The chancellor of the exchequer was asked whether he favored a softer version of Brexit - such as British membership of the EU single market or of a customs union.  Hammond said Britain's position had been set out in a speech by May in January and a letter she sent to EU leaders in March when she triggered the Brexit process. May has said Britain will leave both the single market and the customs union.  My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations and take them forward,  he said. Hammond had been due to spell out his views on Brexit in a speech on Thursday, but it was canceled following a deadly tower block fire in London on Wednesday. He is expected to deliver it in the coming days. The Sun newspaper reported this week that Hammond had won the backing of interior minister Amber Rudd on the need to focus on the economy in Brexit. Two former Conservative prime ministers have also urged May to soften her approach.   In a sign that Britain was sticking to its guns on some of the key points in negotiations with the EU, the Brexit minister said on Friday no deal could be struck on exiting the EU unless the future relationship with the bloc was taken into account alongside the withdrawal terms.

Robert Mueller, the special counsel named by the department to investigate the Russia matter, is now examining whether Trump or others sought to obstruct the probe, a person familiar with the inquiry said on Thursday.  I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,  Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his May 9 dismissal of James Comey. Trump did not identify  the man  but appeared to be questioning the integrity of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department's No. 2 official who appointed Mueller on May 17, supervises the probe and wrote a memo to Trump critical of Comey that preceded Comey's firing. Hours later, a source close to Trump's outside legal team said Trump did not intend his tweet to be confirmation of the investigation but rather was reacting to a Washington Post story on Wednesday about the probe. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. Rosenstein has said privately he may need to recuse himself from matters relating to the Russia probe because he could become a witness in the investigation, ABC News reported on Friday. ABC said Rosenstein told Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand she would have authority over the probe if he were to step aside. The Democratic National Committee called on Rosenstein to recuse himself from the Russia matter, but it said authority over the investigation should be given to Mueller and not another Trump appointee. While the Republican Trump administration initially said Rosenstein's letter was the reason the president fired Comey on May 9, Trump later said he did so because of the  Russia thing.  Comey told a Senate panel last week he believed Trump fired him to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Russia probe. Comey testified that Trump directed him in February to drop an FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn relating to the Russia matter. Comey testified it would be up to Mueller to decide whether Trump's action amounted to obstruction of justice, an act that could be cited in any effort in the Republican-led Congress to impeach him and remove him from office. Trump's Lawyer Hires a Lawyer The Russia issue has cast a shadow over Trump's five months in office. In another indication of the seriousness of the probe, Michael Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, said he has retained attorney Stephen Ryan, a former assistant U.S. attorney, to represent him in the ongoing probes. Cohen has received a subpoena from one of the congressional committees looking into the Russia issue. Rosenstein has authority over the inquiry because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself on March 2 after revelations of previously undisclosed meetings with Russia's ambassador to Washington while he was a Trump campaign adviser. Brand was confirmed as the No. 3 Justice Department official on a 52-46 vote in the Senate on May 18, with Democrats lining up against her. From 2011 until her confirmation, she was a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group's legal arm, which played a major role in marshaling legal opposition to environmental and labor regulations championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Senate Intelligence Committee member, said she was  increasingly concerned  Trump would try to fire not only Mueller, but also Rosenstein.  The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn't apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired,  Feinstein said. A Trump confidant said this week the president had considered firing Mueller. Rosenstein, who would be responsible for actually dismissing Mueller, told U.S. lawmakers he would fire him only with good cause. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the presidential race to try to help Trump win, in part by hacking and releasing emails damaging to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Moscow has denied any interference. The White House denies any collusion. Trump kept up his criticism of the investigations, writing on Twitter,  After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my 'collusion with the Russians,' nobody has been able to show any proof.

In a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello and leaders of Puerto Rico's house and senate, oversight board Chairman Jose Carrion said the government's resolve to steer the U.S. territory out of bankruptcy  may be waning,  and voiced concern that  positive collaboration between the board and the administration ... may be receding.  The board, a creation of the 2016 federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, is tasked with managing the island's finances. Earlier this year it helped Puerto Rico develop a 10-year fiscal turnaround plan, and is in charge of making sure it follows through. Tensions between the board and Rossello have run high at times, as the governor has tried to balance carrying out the board's cost-cutting objectives with trying to please the mostly-poor constituency that elected him last November. One of his top advisers, Elias Sanchez, responded to Carrion's concerns in a statement on Friday, saying,  This administration has shown an unwavering commitment to face this inherited crisis with the seriousness it deserves.  Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory facing $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and pension and healthcare systems that are virtually out of money, last month filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Carrion's letter lamented comments by government officials he viewed as downplaying  the truly dire fiscal situation  in Puerto Rico. Carrion cited what he called a false narrative that, under the board-approved 10-year turnaround plan, Puerto Rico can avoid employee furloughs and cuts to Christmas bonuses if it creates an extra $200 million in liquidity by June 30. In fact, Carrion said, the extra liquidity is just a piece of the puzzle. To avoid the furloughs and bonus cuts, Puerto Rico must also produce implementation plans that show it can meet a host of other cost-saving measures outlined in the turnaround plan.  We have yet to achieve confidence in the ability of Puerto Rico to fund essential services,  Carrion said, adding that a  casual reference to a particular  liquidity level is  deceptive  and  bound to generate confusion.  Sanchez said the government has  held almost daily meetings with the board's advisory team  which have detailed  the implementation plans to achieve the objectives.

The bid presented by Raízen, a joint venture between Cosan SA Industria e Comercio and Royal Dutch Shell, beat the only other offer in the auction of 434 million reais from Suem do Brasil, a company which packages and export sugar.

Three are in the region where the two Tonon plants on sale are located, a detail valued by sugar groups as they seek to concentrate operations in clusters to reduce cane transportation costs.

The bid presented by Raízen, a joint venture between Cosan SA Industria e Comercio and Royal Dutch Shell, beat the only other offer in the auction of 434 million reais from Suem do Brasil, a company which packages and export sugar. Reuters reported on Wednesday that lawyers representing creditors had seen the proposals by the deadline for interested companies to bid, on June 13, and knew Raízen's bid was the biggest. Tonon Bioenergia SA is under bankruptcy protection and the auction on Friday was part of a restructuring plan approved by creditors in April. Raízen owns 24 sugar and ethanol mills in Brazil. Three are in the region where the two Tonon plants on sale are located, a detail valued by sugar groups as they seek to concentrate operations in clusters to reduce cane transportation costs. The two Tonon mills, named Santa Cândida and Paraíso, have a combined annual cane crushing capacity of 5.7 million tonnes. Tonon aims to retain its third mill, in the neighboring Mato Grosso do Sul state. Raízen said that if the operation is concluded, it expects to operate total annual crushing capacity of approximately 73 million tons of sugarcane.

In a letter to Governor Ricardo Rossello and leaders of Puerto Rico's house and senate, oversight board Chairman Jose Carrion said the government's resolve to steer the U.S. territory out of bankruptcy  may be waning,  and voiced concern that  positive collaboration between the board and the administration ... may be receding.  The board, a creation of the 2016 federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, is tasked with managing the island's finances. Earlier this year it helped Puerto Rico develop a 10-year fiscal turnaround plan, and is in charge of making sure it follows through.  Tensions between the board and Rossello have run high at times, as the governor has tried to balance carrying out the board's cost-cutting objectives with trying to please the mostly-poor constituency that elected him last November.  One of his top advisers, Elias Sanchez, responded to Carrion's concerns in a statement on Friday, saying,  This administration has shown an unwavering commitment to face this inherited crisis with the seriousness it deserves.  Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory facing $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and pension and healthcare systems that are virtually out of money, last month filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.  Carrion's letter lamented comments by government officials he viewed as downplaying  the truly dire fiscal situation  in Puerto Rico.  Carrion cited what he called a false narrative that, under the board-approved 10-year turnaround plan, Puerto Rico can avoid employee furloughs and cuts to Christmas bonuses if it creates an extra $200 million in liquidity by June 30.  In fact, Carrion said, the extra liquidity is just a piece of the puzzle. To avoid the furloughs and bonus cuts, Puerto Rico must also produce implementation plans that show it can meet a host of other cost-saving measures outlined in the turnaround plan.   We have yet to achieve confidence in the ability of Puerto Rico to fund essential services,  Carrion said, adding that a  casual reference to a particular  liquidity level is  deceptive  and  bound to generate confusion.  Sanchez said the government has  held almost daily meetings with the board's advisory team  which have detailed  the implementation plans to achieve the objectives.

The minister, Adel al-Jubeir, told journalists in London that Qatar should respond to demands to halt its support for  extremism and terrorism  which, he said, were being made by the whole world and not just Gulf states. Four Arab states - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt - severed diplomatic relations with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran - charges that Doha has denied. The UAE has also decided to blacklist Qatari individuals and entities. Related CoverageQatar push to reopen neighbors' skies to flights left unresolvedTurkish, French and Qatari leaders discuss Qatar row in teleconference: sourcesThe political crisis in the Gulf prompted U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to announce on Friday that he was cancelling his planned trip next week to attend an Organization of American States meeting in Mexico to instead remain in Washington to work on reducing diplomatic strains. Tillerson  will continue his efforts to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East region through in-person meetings and phone conversations with Gulf and regional leaders,  the U.S. State Department said in a statement. It also said U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan would attend the OAS meeting. Sergei KarpukhinJubeir said the list being compiled by the four Arab countries were not  demands,  but  a list of grievances that need to be addressed and that the Qataris need to fix.   We are working on those with our Bahraini, Emirati and Egyptian partners in order to compile this list and present it to the Qataris, and I think it will be done fairly soon.  Calling Doha an  ally  in the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Jubeir said there was no intention of harming the Qatari people.   Enough is enough, and our Qatari brothers cannot continue to fund extremism and terrorize and incite and use hostile media and interfere with the affairs of other countries and still remain in good standing,  he said, adding he expected a positive response that would move the region to a  better place.  Jubeir did not detail what demands could be made.  But his comments echoed those of the UAE's ambassador to the United States, who said on Tuesday the list would broadly address three areas of support for terrorism, meddling in the internal affairs of the four Arab states and attacks through Qatari-owned media platforms.

The value of the dollar's net long position slid to $6.48 billion in the week ended June 13, from $8.0 billion the previous week.  Up until the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike on Wednesday, the dollar had been on a declining trend this year amid a spate of soft data such as U.S. inflation and non-farm payrolls. Aside from the rate increase, the Fed also maintained its outlook for a total of three interest rate increases this year as well as three more projected for 2018. It also announced a quicker-than-expected start to the unwinding its balance sheet beginning this year. The Fed viewed the U.S. economy's soft patch as temporary in nature and should not affect its tightening stance. Analysts said this should help the dollar's prospects.  A dovish Bank of Japan and European Central Bank have helped support the dollar with dollar/yen and euro/dollar showing possible reversal signs in their respective bearish and bullish trends,  said London-based Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com.  Thus, the dollar may be able to appreciate despite the weakness in U.S. macro figures. For now, investors are giving the Fed the benefit of the doubt – only just.  The dollar index so far this year though was still down nearly 5.0 percent, on track for its worst yearly performance in 10 years. Euro net longs, meanwhile, rose to a more than six-year high, with 79,053 contracts, CFTC data showed. Ahead of the Fed's midweek rate meeting, the euro had climbed to highs for the year against the dollar, in line with increasing long speculative positioning on the currency.

Tobacco use is the world’s leading cause of preventable death and serious illness, killing an estimated 6 million people each year, researchers note in the youth tobacco report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most smokers take up the habit in their teens.  For the current study, researchers examined data from surveys of teens in 61 countries conducted from 2012 to 2015. Half of nations had a smoking rate of at least 15 percent for boys and at least 8 percent for girls, they found.  “Smoking has been shown to harm nearly every organ of the body, and science shows that most adult smokers first start smoking during adolescence,” said lead study author Rene Arrazola of the Office on Smoking and Health at the CDC. “Young people who begin to smoke at an earlier age are more likely than those who start at older ages to develop long-term nicotine addiction,” Arrazola said by email. “Therefore, efforts to prevent youth tobacco use are critical to prevent another generation of adults who smoke and suffer from smoking-related death and disease.” Across all of the countries in the study, the lowest prevalence of teen smoking (1.7 percent) was seen in Sri Lanka. The highest prevalence (35 percent) was in Timor-Leste.  For boys, the lowest smoking prevalence was 2.9 percent in Tajikistan and the highest was 61.4 percent in Timor-Leste. For girls, the lowest rate - 1.6 percent – was seen in Tajikistan and the highest - 29 percent - in Bulgaria. In the majority of countries, at least half of current tobacco smokers said they wanted to quit, the study also found. The proportion of student smokers who said they desired to quit ranged from a low of 32 percent in Uruguay to a high of 90 percent in the Philippines. Limitations of the study include the reliance on teens to accurately recall and report on their smoking behavior, the authors note. It also only included students enrolled in school, which might not fully represent smoking behavior in these countries.  “I was surprised to see that most of the countries were in the 10 to 20 percent range; I would have thought the numbers would be higher, but they either are similar or slightly higher than rates in the U.S. which are around 10 to 15 percent,” said Dr. Maher Karam-Hage, associate medical director of the tobacco treatment program at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.  A variety of policies at the country level can influence whether young teens will smoke, Karam-Hage, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “Cultural values and norms in their individual countries are most critical, followed by the economic factors (prices and taxes), age restrictions and policies such as whether they have clean indoor air (laws) or not,” Karam-Hage said.

Nonprescription products were also more likely to contain probiotics, although only 8 percent did, compared with 2 percent of prescription alternatives.    Only prescription products contained the stool softener docusate sodium.   One limitation of the study is that researchers looked just at the declared amount on labels, and not at data on the actual amounts found in analysis of the supplements, the authors note.    For some women, insurance benefits and costs may influence what supplement they choose, because prescription products may come with lower out-of-pocket costs, O’Connor pointed out in an email.    Whatever they choose, women should try to avoid taking supplements that contain doses of vitamins and minerals that are higher than the recommended maximum amounts for pregnant women, she said.    Also, she advises, women should consume a varied diet higher in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, seafood, legumes and nuts, “and I would suggest that they lower their intake of red and processed meats and limit sugar-sweetened beverages and refined grains.”    When they follow this advice, they may still need supplements, though.   “Even if their diet is a healthy one, I still recommend, as do most professional organizations, that women planning a pregnancy consume a 400 ug folic acid containing multivitamin supplement,” O’Connor said.    SOURCE: bit.ly/2rEDAGA Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, online May 29, 2017.

The gap between Canadian and U.S. bond yields narrowed, with the 2-year spread recording its smallest gap since Feb. 24.     Chances of a rate increase by December have surged to 90 percent from less than one-in-four before stronger-than-expected jobs data one week ago.                Since then, the central bank's top two officials have said that rate cuts put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates need to be kept at near-record lows.                               Unquestionably, the Bank of Canada has shifted to a hawkish stance, but we don't have a clear indication on the timeline on when they are considering hiking,  said Adam Button, a currency analyst at ForexLive in Montreal.      At 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3221 to the greenback, or 75.64 U.S. cents, up 0.4 percent. The currency traded in a range of C$1.3222 to C$1.3272.     It touched its strongest level in 3-1/2 months on Wednesday at C$1.3165. For the week, it notched a 1.9 percent advance, its biggest since the first week of 2016.     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, bounced up off the year's lows, but crude posted its fourth weekly decline on persistent concerns about global oversupply.           Speculators cut bearish bets on the Canadian dollar for a third straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 88,595 contracts as of June 13 from 94,501 a week earlier. In May, net short positions reached a record high 99,109 contracts.      Speculators were dead wrong on the Canadian dollar and they're clearing out,  ForexLive's Button said.     Foreign investment in Canadian securities slowed in April as investors scooped up bonds but sold their equities holdings, data from Statistics Canada showed.                  In other domestic data, lending to small businesses picked up in April, suggesting growth in the broader economy was gaining momentum.                  Canadian government bond prices were marginally higher across the yield curve, with the two-year            up 2.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.899 percent and the 10-year             adding 6 Canadian cents to yield 1.524 percent.     On Thursday, the 2-year yield touched its highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years at 0.937 percent.

Warmbier, from a Cincinatti suburb, was arrested for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan, North Korean media reported. On Thursday, North Korea said that it had released him  on humanitarian grounds .

Ojea Quintana called on North Korea to  clarify the causes and circumstances  of Otto Warmbier's release.   His case serves as a reminder of the disastrous implications of the lack of access to adequate medical treatment for prisoners in the DPRK,  he said.   His ordeal could have been prevented had he not been denied basic entitlements when he was arrested, such as access to consular officers and representation by an independent legal counsel of his choosing,” added Ojea Quintana, a lawyer and veteran U.N. rights expert.  North Korea is believed to operate political prison camps and foreign nationals have also been detained on political grounds, Ojea Quintana said. Two American university professors in Pyongyang were arrested this year for allegedly plotting anti-state acts.  A 2014 landmark report by a U.N. investigators cataloged massive human rights violations in North Korea which they said could amount to crimes against humanity.  Tens of thousands of people are detained across the isolated country in inhumane conditions and subjected to torture and forced labor, it said.

The energy group, which hit its lowest level in 13 months on Thursday, rebounded 0.9 percent, led by Enbridge Inc, which rose 2.3 percent to C$51.44.

Metro Inc, which operates some 600 supermarkets in Quebec and Ontario, fell 2.9 percent to C$43.16. Consumer discretionary shares also retreated, declining 1.0 percent, with Magna International Inc taking a 4.6 percent hit to trade at C$57.30. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.5 percent.

The Spaniard posted a one-under 71 in Friday's second round for a three-under-par total of 141 as the afternoon wave of players were beginning their rounds at Erin Hills.  I think the greens are getting U.S. Open-like, but not as firm as they're going to get if we don't get any rain,  Garcia said about the course that allowed a record number of sub-par scores in the first round after rain soaked the layout earlier in the week.  I've always liked when a course plays tougher. Obviously my game is on when the course is playing tougher. I think I have a little bit of an advantage,  he added.  You have to be more on when it gets like that because if not, then you're going to struggle. We'll see. We can't control Mother Nature.  Garcia, who waited nearly two decades to notch his first major title at Augusta, would be halfway to a calendar-year Grand Slam should he prevail at Erin Hills.

The decision has major implications for the pharmaceutical industry because it will dictate how long brand-name makers of biological drugs can keep near-copies, named biosimilars, off the market.

Richardson, a former New Mexico governor and congressman who visited North Korea in the 1990s and sought the release of detained Americans, told Reuters he made the proposal in a letter to the North Korean mission to the United Nations.  I have proposed that as of today,  Richardson said, adding that he argued in the letter it was in North Korea's interest to free the detainees unconditionally,  in the light of its failure to properly take care and handle  Warmbier's case. Doctors say the 22-year-old university student who was returned to the United States this week after being held in North Korea for 17 months has a severe brain injury and is in a state of  unresponsive wakefulness.  Richardson said he and members of his foundation had met with North Korean diplomats 20 times in the past year to try to secure the release of Warmbier and the others - Korean-Americans Tony Kim, Kim Dong Chul and Kim Hak Song and Korean-Canadian Hyeon Soo Lim. He said the foundation's executive director traveled to North Korea in November and proposed that Richardson travel there for the purpose, but the North Koreans did not respond. Richardson said he had yet to inform the Trump administration about his letter, but had briefed the State Department and White House in recent weeks on his past efforts. In 1996, Richardson secured the release of a 26-year-old American, Evan Hunziker, who was held for three months in North Korea on spying charges. He called on the administration to find a way to ensure Warmbier  gets the best medical care to see if he can be revived .  This is going to be a long, protracted convalescence; They should do this as a symbol that the U.S. government will stand behind our citizens who have been violated,  Richardson said.   Trump said on Friday that what had happened to Warmbier was  a truly terrible thing.  Richardson, who has been in close contact with the Warmbier family, said he did not believe Pyongyang's explanation that the student's condition was the result of botulism and a sleeping pill.  It could be some kind of stress from the imprisonment; it could be beatings and torture,  he said, adding that North Korea should cooperate with an investigation, perhaps carried out by the United Nations.  They should have a detailed medical explanation why this happened and why they didn’t disclose this a year ago. This is unconscionable,  he said.

Parliament voted on Wednesday to hand over the two uninhabited islands of Tiran and Sanafir and Sisi is expected to ratify the decision soon. Politicians and activists opposed to the deal had called for protests on Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square, center of the Arab Spring upheavals of 2011. At least a dozen police vans and trucks were positioned around the square and in side streets on Friday. The metro station in the square was closed as a security precaution. Armed police were also stationed in and around the Journalists' Syndicate building, scene of a protest earlier in the week. Protest organizers said supporters had dispersed before the event started. Social media posts said other small protests in Cairo and elsewhere were quickly broken up by police. The plan to cede the islands to Saudi Arabia, which has given Egypt billions of dollars of aid, was announced last year and has become mired in political protest and legal action. Opponents of the plan say Egypt's sovereignty over the islands dates back to 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded. Saudi and Egyptian officials say the islands belong to the kingdom and were only under Egyptian control because Riyadh had asked Cairo in 1950 to protect them. Small demonstrations have taken place over the past few days, despite a state of emergency imposed by Sisi in April following a wave of bomb attacks on Christian churches. The controversy over the islands comes as Sisi is losing much of the popularity he enjoyed after overthrowing the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. With an election due next year, he is facing mounting criticism over the struggling economy and is seen by many Egyptians as a traitor for giving up the islands.

Most-active Chicago Mercantile Exchange August live cattle        settled 0.675 cents higher at 118.175 cents per pound. June live cattle futures        finished 0.800 cent lower at 121.700 as traders continued to exit positions ahead of that contract's expiration on June 30.     CME August feeder cattle        were up 0.800 cent to 147.875 cents per pound, rising the day after hitting the lowest levels in more than a month.      Today was just some consolidation, taking stock,  said Steiner Consulting Group analyst Altin Kalo said.     Cash cattle prices in the U.S. Plains have declined for several weeks even as rising wholesale beef prices boosted profits for meat packers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture after the close of trading said choice-grade beef was up 10 cents to $249.84 per cwt.                Pork in the wholesale market gained 73 cents to $95.63 per cwt while hogs in the top cash market of Iowa and southern Minnesota firmed by 60 cents to $82.28 per cwt.                       Retailers were still buying to stock meat cases ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4, when many U.S. consumers eat hot dogs and burgers cooked on outdoor grills.     Kalo said comparatively higher prices for beef pushed some meat packers to switch to pork products for hot dogs and sausages, and the robust pork demand boosted demand for hogs.      The spot cash hog market has been on fire, it's incredibly firm,  he said.     CME July lean hog futures        were up 0.275 cent to 82.325 cents per pound and most-active August hog futures        up 0.200 cent to 79.125 cents.

A third source said the Trump Organization already has agreed to a settlement that will see it walk away from its branding and management deal for the 65-story hotel and condo tower in the financial district of Canada's largest city. It could still take four to six weeks to close the deal to rebrand the Trump International Hotel & Tower, one of the sources said, while another said it could close in two weeks.  There are a number of hotel groups circling for the management,  said one of the sources. The sources, who declined to say how much the deals were worth, spoke on condition of anonymity because the privately held talks are confidential. Trump, whose business connections were the subject of two lawsuits filed by members of Congress and Maryland and District of Columbia officials this week, has never owned the project. The building was developed by Talon International Inc, which later defaulted on a construction loan, and the property was bought in a court-run sale by JCF Capital ULC earlier this year. That sale included 211 hotel units, 74 residential units and most of the commercial, retail and amenity space in the property.  Representatives of the Trump Organization have previously said they would resist any efforts to cut short the company's long-term contract. Trump Organization representatives were not immediately available for comment on Friday. Bloomberg earlier reported that interested parties include Marriott's St. Regis, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc's Waldorf Astoria and Mandarin Oriental International Inc. Since its opening in 2012, Talon had sold less than half of the tower's residential condos and the hotel's occupancy rates have been lower than some investors in the rooms had hoped. A court last year ordered Talon to pay damages to one buyer of a unit in the tower for  negligent misrepresentation  and another sale was ordered rescinded. A partner with JCF Capital could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday but declined to comment earlier this week when asked about rebranding the hotel. Trump had been pressed to distance himself from his global business before becoming president in January. He said he would maintain ownership while turning over control to his two adult sons. Critics said he still would have conflicts of interests under that arrangement and this week more than 190 Democratic lawmakers sued him, saying he had accepted funds from foreign governments through his businesses in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia also filed a lawsuit this week claiming that government payments to Trump's businesses violate the Constitution.

The Green Left, which made huge gains in March's election in the Netherlands, had been in talks for a centrist coalition with Prime Minister Mark Rutte and two other parties until negotiations broke down in May.  They want to close coal-fired plants and channel extra funds into renewables. Rutte, whose center-right VVD party remained the largest party after the vote, has opened new coal-fired power plants.  I think they don't want it so I think it's not going to happen,  Jesse Klaver told Reuters when asked about the chances of the coal-fired plants closing by the end of the next governing period. Speaking on the sidelines of the German Greens' party congress in Berlin, he said divisions over climate change were, along with differences of opinion on immigration policy, partly to blame for the collapse in coalition talks and he could not imagine returning to coalition negotiations. The Netherlands came under intense criticism in 2015 when a review showed just 5.6 percent of its energy had come from renewable sources the previous year and coal use was at a record high after three major new coal plants were brought on line.

According to the people, Cambuhy's staff led by banker Marcelo Medeiros are discussing a possible offer for the 86 percent stake that Brazil's billionaire Batista family has in Alpargatas. Cambuhy oversees the investments of another Brazilian billionaire family, the Moreira Salles. GP Investments (GPIV33.SA), one of the largest Latin American buyout firms, is also eyeing the shoe and sportswear company, one of the people said, adding that other interested parties include a group of shareholders in Brazilian cosmetics maker Grupo Boticario. The people spoke under condition of anonymity because the processes remain private. J&F; Investimentos SA, the holding company running the Batista family's investments, Cambuhy and GP Investments declined to comment. Grupo Boticário did not immediately comment. A sale of Alpargatas, which the Batistas bought late in 2015, would come as J&F; steps up asset divestitures to raise cash and help the Batistas pay for a 10.3 billion-real ($3.1 billion) leniency fine with Brazilian prosecutors. J&F;'s leniency fine, the world's biggest to date, was imposed after members of the Batista family admitted to bribing scores of politicians. The Batistas trumped Cambuhy and half a dozen rivals in the race for Alpargatas late in 2015, after presenting a 2.7 billion-real, all-cash offer for the company known for its flip-flops worn by celebrities like Kate Hudson and Gwyneth Paltrow. The family almost doubled the stake last year. Reuters reported on May 23 that the Batistas had considered partially or fully selling Alpargatas as well as dairy producer Fábrica de Produtos Alimentícios Vigor SA earlier this year. Brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, which negotiated the leniency deal, are conducting talks to sell Alpargatas themselves.

On Monday, Mexico auctions 15 oil and gas blocks along the southern coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico in the next stage of the country's historic opening of the industry following a 2013-14 energy reform. In December 2013 Congress changed the constitution to end a 75-year production and exploration monopoly enjoyed by state oil company Pemex in a bid to reverse years of declining output. Among the companies that prequalified to compete are Chevron Corp, ConocoPhillips, Eni SpA, Repsol SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC Ltd). All told, 20 companies signed up to take part on an individual basis, with 16 consortia also on the list. Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said he was hopeful that at least 35 to 40 percent of the blocks would be won.  The pleasing thing about this auction is the high number of consortia taking part, which is a sign there will be plenty of bids,  he told Reuters on Friday.  There wouldn't be much point in forming a consortium and then not making an offer.  How many blocks were snapped up would depend on whether bidding focused on just a few areas, or many, he added. The auction is the fifth since the energy reform, including one deep-water and two previous shallow-water tenders, yielding 39 contracts signed with forecast investment over the life of the contracts at $48.8 billion, according to energy ministry data. Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as CNH which oversees the auction, also saw the number of equity tie-ups among oil companies as a positive sign, expressing optimism that  a bit more than the international benchmark of 30 percent  could be assigned. The blocks up for auction are spread between the coastal waters of the Gulf states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Campeche, with an average size of 594 square kilometers. If successful, the blocks could yield production of some 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in five years, the CNH estimates.

Fed officials on Friday signaled that doubts are simmering.  In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said he was not alone at the U.S. central bank in his view the Fed should have waited to raise interest rates until it was sure the recent drop in price pressures really is temporary.  I wish other people were joining me in my dissents, I'll say that,  Kashkari said in a phone interview with Reuters.  I think that there's more sympathy for my views, but maybe people aren't ready to take action.   Kashkari was the lone policymaker to vote against the Fed's decision on Wednesday to raise its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point.  He also voted against the Fed's first rate hike this year, in March, although he said that his June decision was a closer call because the labor market had clearly strengthened. But while many of his colleagues were uncomfortable with risking a surge in inflation if the Fed failed to act, Kashkari was more worried about the costs of excessively low inflation.  Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan on Friday also signaled the decision to raise rates earlier this week was a tough one, although he in the end supported a rate hike and said he feels comfortable with that decision.  In this job you make trade-off decisions; I think the fact that inflation of late has been more muted, for me, made me weigh those trade-offs much more carefully,  Kaplan told reporters after a meeting of the Park Cities Rotary Club in Dallas. But he said he would want to see more evidence that inflation will rise toward the Fed's 2-percent inflation goal before increasing rates again.  The run of weaker core inflation readings has clearly rattled some Fed officials,  Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients earlier on Friday. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May, but the Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has been running below target for more than five years and in April slowed a second month to 1.5 percent.  That has led to some beginning to question the validity of the traditional narrative of a tight labor market eventually sparking higher inflation.  Recent global developments add doubt to whether the traditional dynamics still work,  Barclays economist Christian Keller said on Friday. He cited the examples of Japan and Germany, whose unemployment levels have declined to levels not seen since the early 1990s but where wage pressures also remain sluggish. At its latest meeting, the Fed scaled back its inflation forecasts for this year to 1.6 percent but according to policymakers’ median forecasts, still sees inflation rising to 2 percent next year. It also maintained its forecast of one more rate hike this year and three the next. But policymakers' inflation forecasts are more optimistic than forecasts by Fed staff, who provide economic intel to the Fed Board of Governors. The latest Fed staff forecast shows they expect inflation to still be below 2 percent in 2019.  Still, Kashkari, who ran the Treasury's bank bailout program during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, said the level of concern he feels now is  no comparison  to the feeling he had back then.   If we are making a mistake, we are making a small mistake now that I think we can recover from,  Kashkari said in the interview.  I am not sounding an alarm bell like, 'Iceberg ahead!'

The Batistas trumped Cambuhy and half a dozen rivals in the race for Alpargatas late in 2015, after presenting a 2.7 billion-real, all-cash offer for the company known for its flip-flops worn by celebrities like Kate Hudson and Gwyneth Paltrow. The family almost doubled the stake last year. Reuters reported on May 23 that the Batistas had considered partially or fully selling Alpargatas as well as dairy producer Fábrica de Produtos Alimentícios Vigor SA earlier this year. Brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, which negotiated the leniency deal, are conducting talks to sell Alpargatas themselves. Reuters reported earlier in the day that a unit of Chile's Empresas Copec SA COP.SN has placed a bid for J&F-controlled; pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA. Preferred shares of Alpargatas rose 2.5 percent in late afternoon trading on Friday to 12.80 reais, raising this year's rally to 29.5 percent.

The suspension gives the government more time to try to reach an agreement over a bailout of Veneto Banca and rival Banca Popolare di Vicenza, which together need 6.4 billion euros ($7.17 billion) in new capital while they try to offload bad debts. Italy is racing to win European Union approval for the rescue of the two troubled banks, based in the wealthy northeastern Italian Veneto region. Talks between the government and the European Commission have dragged on for months because Brussels wants private investors to pump 1.25 billion euros into the two banks before any taxpayer money can be used to avert them being wound down. In an unprecedented move, the government decided to suspend the payment of the junior bonds coming due on June 21 to fend off potential legal challenges against the bank, according to a statement after a late-night cabinet meeting.  It said the bond repayment would now be delayed for six months from when the bank requested state aid, which means the bond will not have to be repaid until mid-September. The suspension aims to ensure all investors in the bank's junior debt will be treated equally in case of a state bailout, the government said. Under EU rules for dealing with troubled banks, losses have to be imposed on subordinated or junior bond holders. Legal experts had said that if Veneto Banca had decided to honour the bond repayment next week, it could have angered other bondholders who risk large losses under EU rules for bank bailouts. But if the bank had not repaid back the bond, it could have triggered a default. A source close to the situation said earlier on Friday that scenario could be avoided if the government suspended the repayment, though it was unclear whether that would be enough to stop possible legal challenges.     Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, speaking before the emergency cabinet meeting in Rome had approved the bond repayment suspension, expressed confidence that a solution for the two banks could soon be reached. But a second source familiar with the situation said there was no guarantee an accord could be reached over the next week. Rome has put pressure on other Italian banks to step in but with little success so far. With both Veneto lenders bleeding deposits, a European Union official warned last month that they may be wound down if no deal is reached by the end of June. In these circumstances, the Veneto Banca's subordinated bond June 21 repayment created yet another headache for the bank and the government.  Having to make a decision on the bond while the bank is in such a critical situation, you risk violating the principle of treating creditors equally if the bond is repaid, or of not meeting an obligation if it isn't,  Craig Byrne, Partner International Capital Markets at law firm Allen & Overy, said. Besides the risk of lawsuits from other bondholders in the even of a repayment, the bank's board members could also have been held responsible for authorising the repayment.  The situation is very delicate, the subordinated bond is one of the thorniest issues at the moment,  a third source close to the matter said.

Clashes over control of the region, which lies inside Azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic Armenians, have stoked fears of a wider conflict breaking out in the South Caucasus, which is criss-crossed by oil and gas pipelines. Nagorno-Karabakh's self-declared defense ministry said Azeri forces had violated the ceasefire agreement and used anti-tank weapons against one of their block-posts. The Azeri defense ministry did not comment on the report. Fighting between ethnic Azeris and Armenians erupted in 1991 and a ceasefire was agreed in 1994. But Azerbaijan and Armenia  regularly accuse each other of carrying out attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Azeri-Armenian border. Clashes over control of the disputed region have intensified in the past three years and at least 200 people were killed in a violent flare-up last April. Since mid-January this year, incidents involving heavy artillery and anti-tank weapons have occurred with a significant increase in May when self-guided rockets and missiles were reported to have been used near densely populated areas along the contact line.

The Outlook on the Long-Term IDRs is Stable. Kostroma Region's outstanding senior unsecured domestic bonds have also been affirmed at 'B+'. The affirmation reflects Fitch's unchanged base case scenario regarding the region's continuing direct risk growth and weak, albeit slightly improving, operating performance over the medium term. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'B+' ratings reflect the region's high direct risk resulting from an ongoing structural deficit, high refinancing pressure, a modest regional economy and a weak Russian institutional framework. The ratings also reflect continuous support from the federal government in the form of low-cost budget loans and transfers. Fitch forecasts Kostroma's direct risk will remain high, which could reach 120% of current revenue by 2019 (2016: 106%) as the region will likely continue to record a budget deficit in 2017-2019. The region's direct risk increased to RUB21.3 billion at end-2016 from RUB17.7 billion at end-2015. Kostroma is among the most indebted Russian regions rated by Fitch, and its debt metrics are weak. The high debt levels are partly mitigated by the material low-cost budget loans as a share of total debt (40%), which help the region to save on interest payments. Under its base case scenario, Fitch expects the region will continue to benefit from ongoing state support over the medium term. Kostroma remains materially exposed to refinancing risk stemming from short-term bank loans. This leaves the region dependent on access to local debt markets to refinance maturing debt and exposed to interest rate volatility. Fitch expects debt servicing could account for a high 70% of current revenue in 2017 (2016: 49%). By end-2017, Kostroma needs to repay RUB11.8 billion, or 56% of its direct risk. The region has already contracted RUB3 billion one-year credit lines and plans to issue RUB8 billion five-year bonds by end-2017 to cover funding needs. The new bonds will somewhat mitigate  refinancing risk and will help to reduce the annual debt service needs. Fitch projects Kostroma will consolidate its operating balance at about 5% of operating revenue over the medium term, after it improved to 4% in 2016 from an average 1.6% in 2014-2015. However, interest payments could exceed the operating margin, resulting in a negative current balance, which we forecast at -0.7% of current revenue in 2017 (2016: -2%). In 2016, the region's operating performance was supported by a 15% growth in tax revenue, mostly due to a recovery in the financial sector and higher excise revenue. Fitch expects the region's tax revenue growth to decelerate in 2017 on changes by the federal government to the allocation of corporate income tax and excises although this will be more than offset by higher current transfers from the federal budget. Kostroma is committed to shrinking its budget deficit and, hence, stabilising debt levels to comply with requirements imposed by the Ministry of Finance as a condition for granting budget loans to the region. We therefore project Kostroma will narrow its deficit before debt variation to 7%-10% of total revenue over the medium term from an average 15% in 2014-2016. Otherwise continued fiscal slippage would be negative for the ratings. We expect improvement to be gradual, which will likely call for additional support from the federal government as the region's fiscal capacity is limited. Tax-raising capacity is limited by the modest size of the region's tax base and low autonomy in setting tax rates. To meet the target, the region also has undertaken a number of cost-cutting measures, although flexibility is low as most expenditure is social-oriented and hence rigid. The region's economic profile is weaker than the average Russian region. Gross regional product (GRP) per capita was 74% of the national median in 2015. Based on the region's estimates GRP continued to decline 0.6% in 2016 (2015: 1.4% decline), in line with the national economic trend. The regional administration expects the local economy to return to mild GRP growth in 2017-2018. Russia's institutional framework for sub-nationals is a constraint on the region's ratings. Frequent changes in the allocation of revenue sources and in the assignment of expenditure responsibilities between the tiers of government hamper the forecasting ability of local and regional governments (LRGs) in Russia. RATING SENSITIVITIES Further growth of direct debt above 85% of current revenue (2016: 64%), accompanied by persistent refinancing pressure, would lead to a downgrade. An upgrade is unlikely unless direct risk falls below 100% of current revenue, accompanied by an improvement in the debt repayment schedule on a sustained basis.

The Outlook is Negative. The issue ratings on Naples' senior unsecured bond have also been affirmed at 'BBB-' The ratings factor in Italy's preferential payment mechanism ensuring timely debt servicing requirements. They also reflect Fitch's expectation of  stable operating performance by Naples on an accrual basis in 2017-2019, despite a weak local economy and high direct risk. The Negative Outlook factors in the city's still weak, albeit improving, tax and fee collection rates, and a large fund balance deficit leading to additional pressure on the budget. KEY RATING DRIVERS Persistent Fund Balance Deficit: The administration is committed to improving its weak, albeit improving, collection rate - below 85% in 2016 - exacerbated by a slow local economic recovery. The city's recovery plan was revised and extended to 30 years from the previous 10 years after a EUR690 million fund balance deficit emerged in 2015 following the implementation of new accounting rules. In 2016 the fund balance deficit worsened to EUR844 million, as calculated by Fitch, mainly due to EUR266 million off-balance sheet liabilities. The worsened fund balance deficit adds on average EUR55 million annually to the still rigid budget in 2017-2019, on top of the EUR25 million from the recovery plan. Fitch will strictly monitor adherence to the city's plan of improving the collection rate towards 90% and keeping payables and receivables under control. High Direct Risk: Fitch expects Naples' direct risk to stabilise at around EUR2.4 billion in 2017-2019 net of pre-financing, or about 200% of budget when EUR1.1 billion subsidised loans from Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP, BBB/Stable, the national government financial arm) to pay down the city's commercial liabilities are included. CDP is the counterparty to 75% of Naples' direct risk and almost the entire stock of loans carries fixed interest rates, reflecting a prudent debt management approach. Market debt, however, remains moderately high at 120% of the city's revenue. Fitch assumes that the preferential payment mechanism will continue to guarantee timely debt service payments, as presently defined by national law for local and regional governments (LRGs) experiencing liquidity stress. Stressed Budgetary Performance: Naples' 2016 operating margin was about 9%, after adjusting for difficult-to-collect revenue, which was not sufficient to fully repay interest and debt principal, unless through preferential payments. Declining state transfers and low fiscal flexibility are likely to lead to moderate 1% revenue CAGR in 2017-2019, with potential improvements on tax-evasion fighting policies, while current spending growth should keep pace with recovery of the fund balance annually. Under Fitch's forecasts, the city's EUR1.3 billion capex in 2017-2020 will focus on transportation, extraordinary road maintenance, public lighting and urban renovation. They will be mostly funded by non-debt resources such as EU funds and transfers of about EUR1 billion, sales of real estate assets mainly to institutional counterparties (INVIMIT the governmental real estate fund, and INAIL, social insurance) and new borrowing of around EUR200 million. Below National Average Economy: With nearly 1 million inhabitants, Naples is one of the biggest Italian cities and, although it is the most dynamic and industrialised city in southern Italy, its socio-economic profile remains weak relative to national levels. Naples' official labour market is also underperforming the national economy with an unemployment rate of around 20% (11.7% nationally) and an employment rate of 38% (57.2%). Naples' mild GDP recovery, which started in 2015-2016, is likely to continue in 2017, mainly driven by tourism, industry and commerce, but with weak impact on the city's revenue. A large shadow economy accounting for at least 35% of official GDP helps moderate the impact of a sluggish local economy. Supporting National Government: Fitch views inter-governmental relations as neutral to Naples' ratings. Despite Naples being exposed to the national government's spending cuts, the city benefits from state support, such as equalisation transfers (EUR350 million in 2016, or nearly 30% of operating revenue), to offset its weaker-than-national average fiscal capacity and funding for large projects. Naples also benefits from a recovery plan that is biannually monitored by the national audit body, Corte dei Conti, which aims to smoothly replenish the statutory fund balance deficit over the long-term. RATING SENSITIVITIES Inability to improve tax and fee collection rates on a sustainable base or failure to shrink the fund balance deficit would lead to a downgrade. The ratings could also be downgraded if debt and equivalents rise above 2.5x of operating revenue or if the preferential payment mechanism protecting financial lenders is removed. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that the existing preferential payment mechanism as defined by national law will continue to ensure timely debt servicing repayment by Naples, albeit stressing the city's commercial liabilities in the medium term if cash flows continue to be weak.

The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'BB-' ratings reflect the region's growing direct risk, fragile operating performance and modest economic indicators amid a weak Russian institutional framework. The ratings also factor in consolidation of the region's fiscal performance with a narrowing deficit before debt variation and continuous support from the federal government in the form of low-cost budget loans and transfers. Fitch projects Kirov Region's operating balance will be at 4%-5% of operating revenue in 2017-2019 (2016: 3.4%), which will remain sufficient to cover interest payments. This will be supported by higher current transfers from the federal budget due to favourable changes in the formula of federal grant calculation amid expected stagnation of tax revenue. In 2015-2016, Kirov Region gradually restored its operating balance to record a small positive current balance as its government kept operating expenditure (opex) almost unchanged with strict cost control measures. Fitch forecasts the region will further narrow its deficit before debt variation to about 3% of total revenue in 2017-2019 by maintaining growth of opex below that of operating revenue and postponing material capital expenditure. Kirov Region had gradually shrunk its deficit to 6% in 2016 from a peak of 14.3% in 2013. The region's government is committed to a balanced budget in 2017-2019, driven by requirements imposed by the Ministry of Finance as a condition for budget loan grants to the region. However, Fitch does not expect the balanced budget target to be met given slow growth of operating revenue and limited expenditure flexibility. We expect deficit shrinkage to be gradual, which could call for additional support from the federal government as the region's fiscal capacity remains low. Kirov's tax-raising ability is limited by the modest size of the regional tax base and low autonomy in setting tax rates. Most expenditure is social-oriented and therefore rather rigid, while capital expenditure has already been cut back towards 10% of total expenditure. Fitch forecasts the region's direct risk will gradually increase to RUB30 billion by end-2019 from RUB26 billion at end-2016, but remain almost stable relative to current revenue (2016: 65%). Debt burden is high relative to national peers; however, the risk is mitigated by material low-cost budget loans (about 60% of risk at end-2016) as a share of total debt, which helps the region to save on interest expenses. Remaining debt consists of one-to three- year bank loans, which amounted to a moderate 26.5% of current revenue at end-2016. The region remains exposed to refinancing risk due to its short-term debt repayment schedule and low cash balance (end-2016: RUB231 million). It leaves the region dependent on access to debt markets to refinance maturing debt. About 97% of its direct risk is due in 2017-2019. By end-2017, Kirov needs to repay RUB7.9 billion, which consists almost entirely of bank loans. The region plans to fund its refinancing needs with RUB3.6 billion contracted but undrawn credit lines and a RUB0.8 billion budget loan. The remaining funding needs will be covered by new credit lines the region plans to attract in 2H17. Kirov's economic profile is weaker than the average Russian region. Its gross regional product (GRP) per capita was 65% of the national median in 2015. However, the economy is diversified and its major taxpayers are spread across various sectors. The 10-largest taxpayers contributed less than 20% of Kirov's tax revenue in 2016. Based on the region's estimates, GRP contracted 1.8% in 2016 (2015: 0.8%), in line with the national economic trend, and will likely demonstrate close to zero growth in 2017-2019. The recovery of Russia's economy with expected GDP growth of 1.4%-2.2% in 2017-2018, according to Fitch forecasts, would be supportive of the local economy. Russia's institutional framework for sub-nationals is a constraint on the region's ratings. Frequent changes in the allocation of revenue sources and in the assignment of expenditure responsibilities between the tiers of government hamper the forecasting ability of local and regional governments (LRGs) in Russia. RATING SENSITIVITIES An improvement in the operating margin towards 10%, coupled with a debt payback ratio (direct risk-to-current balance) of around 10 years (2016: 103) on a sustained basis, could lead to an upgrade. The inability to maintain a positive operating margin on a sustained basis or an increase in direct risk above 80% of current revenue could lead to a downgrade.

May, already under pressure after a botched snap election, is facing widespread criticism for her response to the blaze. She has promised to set up a public inquiry and pledged 5 million pounds ($6.40 million) to help the victims.

Media reports have said about 70 people are expected to have been killed, although police have not confirmed this.   Local residents also say they are angry that their safety concerns had been ignored and that people had been told to stay in their flats in the event of a fire. May, who on Thursday met emergency services at the fire site but did not meet locals, visited residents, volunteers and community leaders at a nearby church on Friday and was rushed away afterwards by police as an angry crowd outside shouted  Coward  and  You're not wanted .

It issued a statement before the protest to try to address the concerns of residents.  We entirely support the calling of the public inquiry and will cooperate in whatever way we can with it so that local people have all the answers about what has happened,  the council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said. Divided Society While the deadly blaze at the Grenfell Tower in north Kensington has prompted an outpouring of generosity, it has also unleashed rage at the authorities as the charred tower was cast as a deadly symbol of a divided society. The block, which housed some 600 people in about 120 apartments, is in a low-rent housing estate next to one of the most affluent areas of Britain. There have been demands for answers as to how the blaze was able to engulf the building, trapping many on the upper floors. Exterior cladding that was added during a recent refurbishment might have played a part, local residents have said.

Social media viaCourtesy ÒRACHEL LUCAS / 5 NEWSÓThe fire broke out less than a week after a election in which May lost her parliamentary majority.  The criticism over the blaze has added to pressure on May who is trying to strike a deal with a Northern Irish party to stay in power. Her government is also due to launch difficult Brexit talks with the European Union on Monday. Earlier on Friday, May met victims privately at a central London hospital.  I spoke with people who ran from the fire in only the clothes they were wearing,  she said in a statement.  They have been left with nothing – no bank cards, no money, no means of caring for their children or relatives. One woman told me she had escaped in only her top and underwear.  She has promised those left homeless by the blaze would be rehoused locally within weeks, and the 5 million pound fund would pay for emergency supplies, food, clothes and other costs. But even those within her own party said May should have faced the locals herself earlier. Slideshow (17 Images) She should have been there with the residents. You have to be prepared to receive people's emotions, and not be so frightened about people,  former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo told the BBC.  Queen Visits London Mayor Sadiq Khan wrote to May on Friday, saying residents felt increasingly enraged and frustrated by the slow response from the authorities.  The local community feels their grief has been made worse by the lack of information about their missing family members and friends,  he wrote. Residents in other blocks with the same exterior cladding as Grenfell Tower were concerned, he wrote.   People are terrified that the same thing could happen to them,  said Khan.      However, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who was London mayor until last year, took to Facebook to attack opposition Labour politicians for  political game playing . Queen Elizabeth, 91, and her grandson Prince William also visited residents and emergency workers on Friday.   That's one of the most terrible things I have ever seen,  William said of the tower's blackened shell. Some desperate residents pleaded to speak to the queen and her grandson about their plight and the fate of missing children as they left the site, with William promising he would return.  London police said an investigation, led by a detective from its homicide and major crime unit, would examine whether criminal offences had been committed although they said there was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately. Commander Stuart Cundy said they had been able to remove the remains of only 12 victims from the building.  Sadly, it is expected that the total will rise and it is not expected that any survivors will be found,  he said. Police have said it could take months to search the building and some victims might never be identified.

The issue ratings on Portugal's senior unsecured foreign and local currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'BB+'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'A+' and the Short-Term Foreign and Local-Currency IDRs at 'B'. The ratings on Portugal's senior unsecured short-term issues have also been affirmed at 'B'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The revision of the Outlook to Positive reflects the following key rating drivers and their relative weights: HIGH The fiscal deficit was markedly reduced in 2016 to 2.0% of GDP from 4.4% in 2015, prompting the end of the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) launched in 2009. The tightening was supported by contained current expenditure and stronger GDP growth from mid-2016. Fitch expects the same drivers will lead to further deficit reduction, to 1.4% by 2018. Weaker GDP growth and potential cost arising from capital injections into the banks are the two main risks to the deficit forecast. Fitch expects the government to continue to deliver tighter fiscal policy while maintaining stability within the parliamentary majority. However, the structure of the majority, which unites the socialist party and two far-left parties, exposes the government to potential political pressure to relax fiscal policy, especially after the exit from the EDP. Fitch expects the narrowing deficit and the recovery in nominal GDP growth to support a sustained downward trend in the debt to GDP ratio, to 126% of GDP by 2018 and 111% by 2026 from 130% of GDP in 2016. Fitch excludes from its debt dynamics any potential impact from interventions in the banking sector. In order to smooth the debt repayment profile, the authorities have bought back short-term debt, issued at longer term, and repaid part of the expensive IMF loan. The cost of servicing debt has declined as a result of the strategy. MEDIUM Portugal has recorded current account surpluses since 2013, reflecting stronger cost competitiveness and lower domestic demand. Exports accounted for 40% of GDP in 2016, up from 30% in 2010. The net lending position has averaged 2% of GDP since 2013, supporting a rapid decline in net external debt (NXD), to 144% of GDP in 3Q16 from 161% in 2012. Fitch expects higher domestic demand will drive down the external surplus by 2018, although it will remain consistent with a decline in NXD, which will remain high compared with the peer median. Fitch expects GDP growth will rise to 2.0% in 2017 from 1.4% in 2016, before slowing to 1.6% in 2018. Growth has picked up since mid-2016 (+2.8% y/y in 1Q-2017), boosted by a stronger labour market (the unemployment rate was 9.8% in April from 11.6% a year ago and a peak at 17.5% in 2013) and a gradual recovery in investment (+5.5% y/y in 1Q-2017). Net exports have also contributed to the acceleration in growth. Stronger confidence and the ramp-up in EU-funds disbursements should support growth from 2017, although legacy issues in the still challenged banking sector and the high stock of private sector debt will continue to weigh on medium term growth prospects. Portugal's 'BB+' IDRs also reflect the following key rating drivers: General government debt, at 130.4% of GDP at end-2016, is well above the 'BB' category median (51% of GDP) and the eurozone average (90%). GDP growth potential is lower than peers, at around 1.5%, reflecting the interplay of high private-sector indebtedness (equivalent to 217% of GDP in March 2017) and fragile banks that hinders investment, and weak demographics. Banks are weakened by a high level of impaired loans (11.8% of credit at risk loans in 2016, while the weighted average NPL ratio (EBA's definition) was close to 20% at end-1H16), representing a source of continuing risk to the sovereign's balance sheet in Fitch's view, although we currently do not anticipate further recapitalisation costs for the sovereign. Portugal's banking sector solvency has strengthened following capital increases by the two largest banks (CGD and BCP) at the start of 2017. A faster reduction in NPLs might require further strengthening in the insolvency framework, a process likely to take time, in Fitch's view. Human development, governance and income per capita indicators are all above those of 'BB' and 'BBB' rated peers, highlighting the country's institutional strengths. Portugal's Ease of Doing Business score is well above the 'BB' and 'BBB' medians. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Portugal a score equivalent to a rating of 'A-' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. In accordance with its rating criteria, Fitch's sovereign rating committee decided to adjust the rating indicated by the SRM by more than the usual maximum range of +/- 3 notches because in our view the country is recovering from a crisis. Consequently, the overall adjustment of four notches reflects the following adjustments: Macro: -1 notch, to reflect a relatively weak medium-term growth outlook, constrained by high corporate indebtedness, low investment, adverse demographic trends and financial sector weakness. Public Finances: -1 notch, to reflect very high levels of government debt. The SRM is estimated on the basis of a linear approach to government debt/GDP and does not fully capture the higher risk at high debt levels. External Finances: -2 notches, comprising two components. The +2 notch contribution to the SRM for  reserve currency flexibility  has been adjusted to +1 notch given Portugal's financial crisis experience. Secondly, one notch reflects that net external debt as a percentage of GDP is one of the highest in the world. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to an upgrade are: -Greater confidence in a sustained downward trend in general government debt/GDP. -Absence of renewed stress in the financial sector that would lead to further costs for the sovereign and/or affect macro financial stability and economic growth. -Continued reduction in external indebtedness supported by current account surpluses. -Stronger long-term growth prospects. The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a stabilisation of the Outlook are: -Failure to make progress in reducing general government debt/GDP ratios or unwinding of external imbalances. -Renewed stress in the financial sector that requires financial support from the state and/or affects macro financial stability and economic growth. KEY ASSUMPTIONS In its debt sensitivity analysis Fitch assumes a primary surplus averaging 2.1% of GDP, trend real GDP growth averaging 1.6%, an average effective interest rate of 3.7% and deflator inflation of 1.9%. Fitch expects that growth in the eurozone, Portugal's main trade partner, will be 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 from 1.8% in 2016.

The issue ratings on Serbia's senior unsecured long-term foreign- and local-currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'BB-'. The Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs have been affirmed at 'B'. The issue ratings on short-term bonds have also been affirmed at 'B'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'BB-'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Serbia's 'BB-' IDRs reflect the following key rating drivers: Fiscal consolidation continued in 2016, with the general government deficit reaching 1.3% of GDP, a better outcome than the 4.7% deficit planned in the 2015-2017 fiscal strategy. The consolidation in 2016 was partly related to a favourable cyclical position of the Serbian economy and one-off factors, but the structural improvement in the fiscal balance is estimated at 4.5pp of GDP in 2015-2016. Spending composition has also started to improve, with the wage bill declining below 10% of GDP while public investment rose to 3.3% of GDP. Fitch expects further fiscal consolidation, but at a much slower pace as the authorities gradually approach their medium-term deficit target of 1% of GDP. The budget was in surplus over the first four months of 2017, creating fiscal space that is likely to be used to increase wages or absorb some contingent liabilities, bringing the general government deficit to around 1.3% of GDP in 2017. Public indebtedness remains a key rating weakness, despite the improvements seen in the government balance outturns and projections. The debt ratio declined in 2016 for the first time since 2008 to 72.7% of GDP and will likely decline below 70% of GDP by 2018. However, it is around 20pp of GDP higher than the 'BB' median and its currency structure (79.2% of total public debt was in foreign currency at end-April 2017) exposes it to dinar fluctuations. Refinancing needs exceed 10% of GDP, despite an increase in the average maturity of government debt. Fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises (SoEs) remain material, as evidenced by regular support from the budget, through subsidies, guarantee calls or debt repayment. Fitch expects this support to continue as SoE restructuring is proceeding slowly and unevenly. Risks of fiscal slippage appear contained, as an IMF Stand-By Arrangement provides a strong fiscal anchor. Fitch considers macroeconomic performance as a weakness. Real GDP grew by 2.8% in 2016, reflecting both a favourable cyclical position and a rebalancing towards investment and net exports. The favourable employment and wage dynamics will likely support consumption growth and we expect continued FDI in the tradable sector to support export growth, therefore lifting our growth projection above 3% by 2019. However, potential growth, at around 3.5%, is hampered by unfavourable demographic trends, a large informal sector and restructuring needs in the large public sector, and is not strong enough to support income convergence with the EU. Macroeconomic stability is gradually improving, with a declining trend in inflation and improving dinarisation, but dollarisation of the economy remains high, hampering the effectiveness of the monetary policy. External finances metrics are broadly in line with 'BB' peers. Fitch expects the current account deficit to remain around 4-5% of GDP over the forecast horizon as the expanding export base balances higher imports and oil prices, and to be fully covered by robust FDI inflows. At 27.8% of GDP at end-2016, net external debt has been on a declining trend since 2013 and is converging towards the 'BB' median of 21.2%, which could help reduce external interest and the debt service ratio. Foreign exchange reserves cover more than five months of current account payments, ensuring a high liquidity ratio of 161.1% at end-2016. The precautionary IMF programme offers further backing in case of external pressures. There is a large NPL overhang in the banking sector, accounting for 16.8% of gross loans at end-March 2017. NPL write-offs and sales encouraged by the central bank have helped reduce the NPL ratio in recent years, but have also contributed to moderate credit growth (+5.6% in 2016). High provisioning rates together with strong capital adequacy ratios partly mitigate financial risks, and the moderate concentration of the banking sector and its large foreign ownership component (76.7% of assets at end-2016) reduce systemic risks. Serbia's structural features are typical of the 'BB' rating category, with GDP per capita broadly in line with the 'BB' median. Governance and business environment indicators, which are slightly better than the medians, could further improve as Serbia's institutions move towards EU standards under the EU accession negotiations. Structural reforms, particularly on state-owned companies are progressing, albeit at a slower pace than initially envisaged. Potential early legislative elections in the coming year could slow the reform process, even if Fitch expects continuity in economic policy. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Serbia a score equivalent to a rating of 'BB' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Macro: -1 notch, to reflect weak medium term growth potential relative to peers, structural rigidities (including high unemployment, large informal economy and adverse demographics) and the large role of the public sector in the economy. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that, individually or collectively, could trigger positive rating action are: - An improvement in Serbia's medium-term growth prospects - Further fiscal consolidation resulting in a reduction in the general government debt to GDP ratio - Continued reduction in net external debt The main factors that, individually or collectively, could trigger negative rating action are: - A reversal of fiscal consolidation, or the materialisation of large contingent liabilities on the government's balance sheet, that put the general government debt to GDP ratio on an upward path - A recurrence of exchange rate pressures leading to a fall in reserves and a sharp rise in debt levels and the interest burden KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that the EU accession talks and the IMF programme will remain important policy anchors.

Iraqi leaders hope to restore control over all Iraqi territory, defeating Islamic State, before an election due by the middle of next year.  Iran has been interfering even in the decision (making process) of the Iraqi people,  he told Reuters.  We don't want an election based on sectarianism, we want an inclusive political process ... we hope that the Iraqis would choose themselves without any involvement by any foreign power.  Allawi, a secular Shi'ite politician who has supporters among some Sunnis, was in Cairo to meet Egyptian leaders including President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for discussions about oil and the conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya. Iraq lies on the faultline between Shi'ite Iran and the mostly Sunni Arab world. Deep-running animosity and distrust between the two sides is fueled by sectarian divides. Tensions grew further after Iran, by leveraging its ties with Iraq's Shi'ite majority, has emerged as the main powerbroker in Iraq after the United States withdrew its troops in 2011, eight years after it toppled Saddam Hussein, a Sunni. Tehran denies interfering in Iraqi politics, saying the  military assistance it provides to Shi'ite paramilitary groups is meant to help defeat Islamic State, the Sunni insurgents who declared a  caliphate  over parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014. U.S.-backed Iraqi forces have dislodged Islamic State from Iraqi cities the militants captured, and are about to fully capture Mosul, which used to be their de facto capital in the  country. The group however remains in control of swathes of territory by the Syrian border and inside Syria. Both of Iraq's current and previous prime ministers, Haider al-Abadi and Nuri al-Maliki, belong to the Dawa party, a Shi'ite group with close ties to Iran.  But Abadi has managed relations with the Sunnis better than Maliki, and also improved Baghdad's ties with Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional foe.  This is the right time to have a fair election that nobody interferes in, neither Iran nor anybody else, nor Turkey, nor Syria nor the U.S.,  said Allawi. Allawi has previously accused Tehran of blocking his bid to become prime minister in the 2010 elections, even though his group won the largest number of seats, albeit with a narrow margin.

Still trying to shore up her authority after last week's election calamity injected new uncertainty into Britain's path to leaving the European Union, May is sending her Brexit Secretary David Davis to Brussels on Monday to launch the process with EU negotiator Michel Barnier. She herself will travel there three days later for a summit on June 22 and 23 with the other 27 EU national leaders. The others have ruled out letting May negotiate in person with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and others. One diplomat said May tried to  hijack  the summit by drawing other leaders into Brexit talks, though EU officials played down suggestions of any agenda row with London. The agreed schedule will let May make a presentation over dinner of how she sees her Brexit plans. Summit chair Donald Tusk and the other leaders will not respond before May leaves the room to let the 27 discuss their own Brexit strategies.  It's absolutely certain that no one will engage with her,  a second EU diplomat told Reuters.  They will make clear she cannot negotiate. Everything must go through Barnier,  said a third, underlining EU strategy to keep talks technical for now. Clash Averted? The fact Davis agreed to an agenda on Monday that will see him and British officials spend some seven hours in the EU executive's headquarters discussing who will talk to whom when and about what has come as a relief to some EU negotiators.  The big clash that we feared isn't there,  said one senior official involved.  There's more or less agreement on the menu ... It's probably as good as we could have imagined.  That the British were ready to break negotiations down on the lines of priorities identified by Brussels implied, he said, a willingness to start a first phase of divorce talks before moving on next year to a second phase on the new free trade relationship May wants -- a  sequencing  London has disputed. Asked whether Davis had shifted his position, a British official referred to a statement released by Davis's ministry on Friday which repeated calls for the withdrawal terms and future relationship to be  agreed alongside each other . EU officials acknowledge that the agreements to be reached before Britain leaves in March 2019 can only be concluded as a whole package simultaneously but leaders have barred Barnier from talking about trade before he gets outline deals on the rights of expatriate citizens and how much Britain owes the EU. Diplomats played down the prospects for one day of talks.   Won't go into substance in five or six hours,  one EU official said.  But it's an important moment nonetheless.  For another, the combination of finally launching talks on Monday and May being at the summit on Thursday and Friday made the coming week a key opportunity to  rebuild trust  after tempers had boiled over on both sides in recent months. May has been under pressure since the election cost her her majority to consider  softer  Brexit options than the clean break she proposed from the EU single market and customs union. Her finance minister said at an EU meeting on Friday that a Brexit deal should put jobs and prosperity first. EU officials played down the importance of Britain's lack of a clear final plan, saying that talks on other issues can go ahead without deciding yet on a new relationship.

By John Lloyd June 16 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of anti-Putin protesters took to the streets this week, chanting “Russia will be free” as they demonstrated in major cities and medium-sized towns. Hundreds - many in their teens - were arrested; some were beaten. Alexei Navalny, the organizer and now undisputed leader of street-level opposition, was sentenced to 30 days in prison. These were the most widespread protests since Moscow put down the last lot in 2012 and passed tougher laws to stop them happening again. Since then, Russian President Vladimir Putin won another presidential election, invaded Crimea and saw his approval rating soar above 80 percent in spite of a falling Russian economy. The difference from those marches of five years ago is that they are directed more precisely at Putin in particular and corruption in general. Navalny has taken aim at Russian leadership before. Last September he circulated a drone-shot video showing Prime Minister Medvedev’s vast, luxurious estate - allegedly a gift from an admiring oligarch. Medvedev’s approval ratings declined, but the allegations against the prime minister did not touch the president's command of public trust. Now, however, Navalny - still little known beyond Moscow - has seen that the metropolitan young want a more powerful and visible target for their disillusionment - one who bears ultimate responsibility for the state of Russia. The Russian president doesn't get an 80 percent approval rating in the United States, but surprisingly his supporters extend beyond Donald Trump. A recent Gallup poll found that almost a quarter of Americans surveyed approved of the Russian president. One of these supporters, much in the news this month, is the film director Oliver Stone. Stone’s four-part interview with Putin, shot over the past two years and airing in the United States this week, has been criticized for being a homage more than a questioning. Stone’s appearance on Stephen Colbert’s show caused the audience to erupt in laughter when, asked what most surprised him about Putin, the director told his host “I think (he’s) devoted to his country and I’m amazed at his calmness, his courtesy - he never really said anything bad about anybody and, I mean, he’s been through a lot. He’s been insulted and abused … abused by the press, in the media.” Most reviewers of the lengthy interviews agree with Colbert in highlighting the softball nature of Stone’s questions - though the final interview did show a more inquiring side as Stone pushed Putin on the hacking, attributed to Moscow, of the Democratic National Committee’s emails before the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It wasn't too forensic, but it seemed to make Putin uncomfortable. It’s Stone who should be uncomfortable. A free and successful man in a democratic country with a strong civil society, he chose in his series to amplify Russian propaganda and to ignore the suppression of dissent, the choking of critical news media, the support for Ukraine secessionists trying to destabilize their country, Moscow’s enthusiastic efforts to win victory for the brutal regime of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, the kleptocratic nature of the Russian regime, Moscow’s funding of populist-nationalist parties in the European Union and what a Forbes writer describes as Putin’s success in showing “every budding autocrat in the region and beyond, how to roll back human rights and freedoms with impunity.” Putin was trained by the KGB, which he joined in 1975, to dissemble - to play a part. He emerged, or has developed, into a master actor. This week, he did one of his annual phone-ins, in which he described the demonstrations as “a provocation” by people who “only exploit problems.” He was calm, reassuring, even witty as he offered asylum to James Comey, the former FBI director fired by Trump over the investigation of Russia’s alleged election meddling. Putin also bragged about Russia’s minimal GDP growth after two years of recession. It may be that Putin’s acting is no longer as convincing as it was. Russia, unlike China or Iran, does not possess a religious or secular ideology that legitimizes authoritarian rule. It has depended on growth, on the “return” of Russian-majority areas outside the borders, on - until three years ago - rising living standards and an end to major conflict in Chechnya, where Putin has sanctioned the brutal and anti-gay rule of the region's president, Ramzan Kadyrov. Russia’s civil society is now more entrenched, more knowledgeable and more skeptical. It consists not of institutions like NGOs, but of a middle class that travels, goes online and talks without fear of the secret police. Many, especially the young, consider themselves European. Putin has granted enough freedom to keep that class quiescent. This week’s protests raise the question of whether that will continue. In London this week, I stood behind two young Russian women in the metro, overhearing their excited conversation about a lecture they had attended about Britain and Europe. I wondered whether this generation would see the questions which vex the West - the weakness of the European Union or the presidency of Donald Trump - as a sign of Western decadence. If they’d prefer the ordered universe the Russian media portrays, an order which has, among other freedoms, allowed them to travel and live abroad? Or would they see the many messy and politically fraught expressions of Western democratic societies, in which central issues are fought out in public, as preferable to the tightly managed politics and severely constricted civil society they have back home? Russia’s protesters, many with no direct experience of the Soviet Union, now face that choice. As, in a more existential way, does Vladimir Putin.

Based on income, 70.3 percent of the poorest families, or those earning less than $15,000 annually, spent more than 50 percent of their wages on rent or costs to own a home in 2015, according to the latest annual study.  Households paying half their incomes or more for housing have little money left over to cover other basic necessities,  Harvard researchers wrote. These low-income families on average spent 53 percent less than those without such cost burdens from housing in 2015, the report showed.  For example, when these households had children, they spent under $300 a month on food, compared with nearly $500 for households which were not spending more than half their income on housing. Meanwhile, the poorest seniors who spent more than half of their income on housing spent only $99 a month on medications and other healthcare services in 2015, compared with $263 a month among those who were not severely burdened by rent or expenses to own a home. This struggle has persisted even as the housing market has recovered during its second longest ever U.S. expansion. The fall in U.S. homeownership may have reached a bottom following 12 years of decline. Home prices surpassed the high of a decade ago in 2016, the Harvard report showed.  In the first quarter of 2017, the homeownership rate was 63.6 percent, up from the 62.9 percent in the second quarter of 2016 which the lowest since 1965. Families that own homes increased by 280,000 in 2016, the biggest total rise since 2006, but they were dwarfed by the growth in renters which rose by 600,000 last year, the Harvard study showed. The faster renter growth in recent years stemmed from a variety of factors including rising home prices and reluctance among millennials to buy a home, according to Chris Herbert, the housing studies center's managing director, in a panel about the latest study. Possible federal cuts in tax credits and subsidies to support affordable housing may worsen these households' predicament, said Terri Ludwig, president and chief executive of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit group that creates affordable homes.  Those budget cuts would be devastating,  Ludwig said. Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-housing-idUSKBN1971Y7"},

The contrast of the black Cincinnati night sky, combined with Lunken Airport airport's bright spotlights, made it nearly impossible to see anything that was happening as medical personnel carried Warmbier's limp body down the plane's steps, says Reuters photographer Bryan Woolston.    Student freed from North Korea has severe brain injuryRead the full story  That didn't stop Woolston from taking the shots that captured the world's attention this week, a series of photos which show Warmbier, held as a prisoner in North Korea for 17 months, being carried off the plane without the use of a stretcher. The photos brought home the disturbing news that the University of Virginia student was effectively comatose because of a brain injury.  More than any words that would be used to describe Warmbier's condition in clinical terms by doctors and government officials, Woolston's photographs told the stark story of his medical state with profound impact.  Not only was the photographer dealing with a night sky, several vehicles, including an ambulance, blocked his view. So he sprinted away from the pack of photographers and videographers he was in, running 100 yards along the airport fence.  There, he found an unobstructed sightline and used a 400-millimeter long-range telephoto lens, usually employed by photographers shooting sporting events.  That split-second decision to move away from the pack meant that five minutes later the world had its first pictures of the American student since we watched him plead to be released from a 15-year sentence of hard labor.

Diagrams in a brochure dated 2016 for Reynobond tiles reviewed by Reuters show how polyethylene (PE) core tiles are suitable only for buildings of up to 10 meters in height.  As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters' ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material,  the brochure says. The brochure was issued by French-based Arconic Architectural Products, which is responsible for the marketing in Europe of systems produced by U.S. company Arconic, which owns Reynobond. The Guardian and the BBC have reported in recent days that panels with a PE core were used in a refurbishment of the 24-storey tower bock that was completed last year.  Construction company Rydon Group, which undertook the work, and the local authority which owns Grenfell Tower declined to confirm whether the panels were PE.  Arconic did not respond to requests for comment. Rydon had earlier said the revamp  met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards .    Other diagrams in the Reynobond brochure show that panels with a fire retardant core -- the FR model, according to Arconic's website -- can be used for buildings of up to 30 meters tall. Above that height, it says, panels with a non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used.  Grenfell Tower is over 60 meters tall.    Documents submitted in 2015 by the local authority's property division to its planning division seeking approvals for the refurbishment said the concrete and brick building would be clad in Reynobond insulation panels. John Cowley, director of Omnis Exteriors which supplied the padding for the refurbishment but did not install it, told the Guardian that the company had been asked to supply the Reynobond PE variant. The newspaper said the PE panels were 2 pounds ($2.56) cheaper per square meter than the Reynobond FR option. Reuters has not been able to confirm independently whether the PE panels were ultimately used or whether the use of PE-core panels is legal in Britain.  Fire safety experts say polyethylene is generally avoided in tall buildings as it has been linked to a number of rapidly spreading fires at skyscrapers in Dubai and elsewhere.  Polyethylene is a thermoplastic material, which ... melts and drips as it burns, spreading the fire downwards as well as upwards,  architectural consultants Probyn Miers said in a note on insulation materials posted its website. Witnesses to Wednesday's blaze said the flames spread quickly up the building, which was left a charred shell. The London Fire Brigade has yet to say what the cause of the fire was. Building regulations documents did not specifically say PE-core panels should not be used, but three industry experts interviewed by Reuters said that did not mean builders were clearly permitted to use them. That is because British safety regulations across many industries are usually principles- rather than rules-based.  This means the law often requires companies to act safely without giving a specific definition of what this would involve, said Christopher Miers of Probyn Miers.  Firms are instead expected to be able to prove in court that they behaved in a way that their industry would consider safe, given current knowledge and technology, these experts added.

The greenback gave back most of the previous day's gains, easing toward levels from earlier this week that were the lowest since November. Disappointing economic readings and the lack of progress on fiscal stimulus from Washington have overshadowed the likelihood of more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The government said U.S. home construction fell in May for a third straight month, to its lowest in eight months. The University of Michigan said its gauge on consumer sentiment deteriorated in early June.  It raises some doubt on U.S. growth for the rest of the year,  said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. The dollar index .DXY was down 0.3 percent at 97.126, and on track for a 0.14 percent decline on the week. The dour U.S. data boosted the yen, which had slid to a two-week low versus the dollar.  The move in the yen very much coincided with a strengthening of bonds in the U.S., which also coincided with a selling off in (U.S.) equity markets,  said Axel Merk, president and portfolio manager at Merk Hard Currency Fund in Palo Alto, California.  My guess would be that the risk-off environment prevailed.  Earlier, the yen had weakened after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said there was  some distance  to achieving the BoJ's inflation target of 2 percent, and it was  inappropriate  to say how the Bank would exit its massive stimulus program as domestic inflation has remained sluggish. That ran contrary to market speculation in the past month that the BoJ could be considering its own plan for eventually withdrawing emergency stimulus for the world's third largest economy.  The euro rose 0.35 percent against the yen to 124.04 yen EURJPY= after touching a near two-week high earlier Friday. The common currency EUR= was up 0.4 percent versus the dollar at $1.1191, but about a cent below a seven-month peak of $1.1296 hit before the Fed's widely expected rate hike on Wednesday.

Based on income, 70.3 percent of the poorest families, or those earning less than $15,000 annually, spent more than 50 percent of their wages on rent or costs to own a home in 2015, according to the latest annual study.  Households paying half their incomes or more for housing have little money left over to cover other basic necessities,  Harvard researchers wrote. These low-income families on average spent 53 percent less than those without such cost burdens from housing in 2015, the report showed.  For example, when these households had children, they spent under $300 a month on food, compared with nearly $500 for households which were not spending more than half their income on housing. Meanwhile, the poorest seniors who spent more than half of their income on housing spent only $99 a month on medications and other healthcare services in 2015, compared with $263 a month among those who were not severely burdened by rent or expenses to own a home. This struggle has persisted even as the housing market has recovered during its second longest ever U.S. expansion. The fall in U.S. homeownership may have reached a bottom following 12 years of decline. Home prices surpassed the high of a decade ago in 2016, the Harvard report showed.  In the first quarter of 2017, the homeownership rate was 63.6 percent, up from the 62.9 percent in the second quarter of 2016 which the lowest since 1965. Families that own homes increased by 280,000 in 2016, the biggest total rise since 2006, but they were dwarfed by the growth in renters which rose by 600,000 last year, the Harvard study showed. The faster renter growth in recent years stemmed from a variety of factors including rising home prices and reluctance among millennials to buy a home, according to Chris Herbert, the housing studies center's managing director, in a panel about the latest study. Possible federal cuts in tax credits and subsidies to support affordable housing may worsen these households' predicament, said Terri Ludwig, president and chief executive of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit group that creates affordable homes.  Those budget cuts would be devastating,  Ludwig said. Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-housing-idUSL1N1JD17C"},

Diagrams in a brochure dated 2016 for Reynobond tiles reviewed by Reuters show how polyethylene (PE) core tiles are suitable only for buildings of up to 10 metres in height.  As soon as the building is higher than the fire fighters' ladders, it has to be conceived with an incombustible material,  the brochure says. The brochure was issued by French-based Arconic Architectural Products, which is responsible for the marketing in Europe of systems produced by U.S. company Arconic, which owns Reynobond. The Guardian and the BBC have reported in recent days that panels with a PE core were used in a refurbishment of the 24-storey tower bock that was completed last year. Construction company Rydon Group, which undertook the work, and the local authority which owns Grenfell Tower declined to confirm whether the panels were PE. Arconic did not respond to requests for comment. Rydon had earlier said the revamp  met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards . Other diagrams in the Reynobond brochure show that panels with a fire retardant core -- the FR model, according to Arconic's website -- can be used for buildings of up to 30 metres tall. Above that height, it says, panels with a non-combustible core -- the A2 model -- should be used. Grenfell Tower is over 60 metres tall. Documents submitted in 2015 by the local authority's property division to its planning division seeking approvals for the refurbishment said the concrete and brick building would be clad in Reynobond insulation panels. John Cowley, director of Omnis Exteriors which supplied the padding for the refurbishment but did not install it, told the Guardian that the company had been asked to supply the Reynobond PE variant. The newspaper said the PE panels were 2 pounds ($2.56) cheaper per square metre than the Reynobond FR option. Reuters has not been able to confirm independently whether the PE panels were ultimately used or whether the use of PE-core panels is legal in Britain. Fire safety experts say polyethylene is generally avoided in tall buildings as it has been linked to a number of rapidly spreading fires at skyscrapers in Dubai and elsewhere.  Polyethylene is a thermoplastic material, which ... melts and drips as it burns, spreading the fire downwards as well as upwards,  architectural consultants Probyn Miers said in a note on insulation materials posted its website. Witnesses to Wednesday's blaze said the flames spread quickly up the building, which was left a charred shell. The London Fire Brigade has yet to say what the cause of the fire was. Building regulations documents did not specifically say PE-core panels should not be used, but three industry experts interviewed by Reuters said that did not mean builders were clearly permitted to use them. That is because British safety regulations across many industries are usually principles- rather than rules-based. This means the law often requires companies to act safely without giving a specific definition of what this would involve, said Christopher Miers of Probyn Miers. Firms are instead expected to be able to prove in court that they behaved in a way that their industry would consider safe, given current knowledge and technology, these experts added.

But in an opposition brief filed Friday, members of the class suing Conagra over its “all-natural” labels contend the Supreme Court has already addressed the only real issue Conagra’s petition raises, in 2016’s Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo.  On the claims actually certified for classwide trial, this case is indistinguishable from Tyson,” wrote counsel of record Samuel Issacharoff of New York University. “How a claims process will function, and the level of proof required from claimants, are simply not relevant to establishing the scope of the defendant’s alleged wrongdoing.”  Conagra argued in its petition for certiorari that the federal circuits are intractably split on whether, in order to be certified to litigate as a class, lead plaintiffs must offer an administratively feasible plan to figure out who will ultimately be allowed to make claims. As you know, there’s no so-called ascertainability requirement in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for class actions, but the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals imposed one in 2012’s Marcus v. BMW of North America and subsequently reiterated the ascertainability rule in 2013’s Carrera v. Bayer.  In 2015, the 7th Circuit explicitly rejected ascertainability as a precondition for class certification. As of the date of Conagra’s petition, the 2nd, 4th and 11th Circuits were using ascertainability tests in line with the 3rd Circuit's. The 6th Circuit – and the 9th Circuit in the Conagra case – are in line with the 7th Circuit.  But according to the new brief in opposition from plaintiffs in the Conagra case, the circuit split is greatly exaggerated. The 3rd Circuit has backtracked on its own ascertainability rule and may undo it altogether in two upcoming cases, the brief said. Moreover, the other appellate courts that have sided with the 3rd Circuit did so before the Supreme Court’s Tyson ruling.  In the Tyson case, you’ll recall, the Supreme Court upheld a wage-and-hour jury verdict against Tyson on behalf of a class of employees at an Iowa meat-packing plant. Tyson argued, among other things, that the class should not have been certified because it contained workers who were not actually entitled to overtime wages and were thus not injured by the plant’s overtime rules. Tyson contended that plaintiffs should have been required to provide a reasonable mechanism for culling uninjured class members – which, as I wrote at the time, sounds an awful lot like ascertainability.  Though the Tyson majority opinion did not specifically address the ascertainability issue, class members in the Conagra case argue the decision holds that classwide liability is distinct from aggregated individual damages. Under that interpretation of Tyson, class actions like the consumer case against Conagra can determine the classwide scope of a defendant’s wrongdoing as a first step, then figure out who’s in the class later on.  The Conagra plaintiffs contend the 9th Circuit’s opinions in their case affirm their methodology for setting classwide damages on behalf of Wesson Oil purchasers in 11 states that allow aggregate consumer claims – exactly, they say, the approach the Supreme Court blessed in Tyson.  “How does (Conagra) distinguish Tyson? Simply by ignoring it,” the brief said. “Because Tyson controls here, and because the factual record supports the approaches below, the heightened ascertainability issue that (Conagra) seeks to raise is not properly presented. The acontextual question presented would not be reached under the facts of record.”  No one is better at fending off class action defendants at the Supreme Court than Issacharoff, who has already persuaded the justices to reject two previous calls for review of the ascertainability circuit split. On the other hand, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito signaled this week in Microsoft v. Baker that they’re concerned about uninjured class members, albeit in the context of constitutional standing, not damages. It’s going to be interesting to see if Conagra’s counsel from Jones Day and McGuireWoods can capitalize on that interest.  One fun piece of inside baseball: in addition to Issacharoff, Milberg and DiCello Levitt & Casey, the Conagra plaintiffs are represented by law professor Robert Klonoff of Lewis & Clark, who just helped revise the federal rules on class actions. Before Klonoff entered academia, he worked at Jones Day, which, as I mentioned, is representing Conagra.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-class-classaction-idUSKBN1972NL"},

According to the people, Cambuhy's staff led by banker Marcelo Medeiros are discussing a possible offer for the 86 percent stake that Brazil's billionaire Batista family has in Alpargatas. Cambuhy oversees the investments of another Brazilian billionaire family, the Moreira Salles. GP Investments, one of the largest Latin American buyout firms, is also eyeing Alpargatas, one of the people said, adding that other interested parties include a group of shareholders in Brazilian cosmetics maker Grupo Boticario. The people spoke under condition of anonymity because the processes remain private. J&F; Investimentos SA, the holding company running the Batista family's investments, declined to comment. Cambuhy, GP Investments and Grupo Boticário did not immediately comment. A sale of Alpargatas, which the Batistas bought late in 2015, comes as J&F; steps up asset divestitures to raise cash and help the Batistas pay for a 10.3 billion-real ($3.1 billion) leniency fine with Brazilian prosecutors. J&F;'s leniency fine, the world's biggest to date, was imposed after members of the Batista family admitted to bribing scores of politicians. The Batistas trumped Cambuhy and half a dozen rivals in the race for Alpargatas late in 2015, after presenting a 2.7 billion-real, all-cash offer for the maker of the Havaianas flip-flops worn by celebrities such as Kate Hudson and Gwyneth Paltrow. The family almost doubled the stake last year. Reuters reported on May 23 that the Batistas had considered partially or fully selling Alpargatas as well as dairy producer Fábrica de Produtos Alimentícios Vigor SA earlier this year. Brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, which negotiated the leniency deal, are conducting talks to sell Alpargatas themselves. Reuters reported earlier in the day that a unit of Chile's Empresas Copec SA has placed a bid for J&F-controlled; pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA.

The EPA and California Air Resources Board accused Fiat Chrysler in January of using undisclosed software to illegally allow excess diesel emissions in 104,000 U.S. 2014-2016 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks. Fiat Chrysler did not immediately comment on the public records. Byron Bunker, director of the EPA's Transportation and Air Quality compliance division, said in a January 2016 email to Fiat Chrysler obtained by Reuters under the Freedom of Information Act that he was  very concerned about the unacceptably slow pace of the efforts to understand the high NOx emissions.  NOx refers to the nitrogen oxides in polluted air. Bunker's email said the EPA had told Fiat Chrysler officials at a November 2015 meeting that at least one auxiliary emissions control device appeared to violate the agency's regulations. Mike Dahl, head of vehicle safety and regulatory compliance for Fiat Chrysler's U.S. unit, responded in a separate email that the company was working diligently and understood the EPA's concerns. He added that if the EPA declared vehicles to contain defeat devices, it would result in  potentially significant regulatory and commercial consequences.  The documents redacted the vehicles named, but two officials briefed on the matter said they referred to diesel models. At an event in Venice on Friday, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said he was  confident of the fact that there was no intention on our part to set up a defeat device that was even remotely similar to what (Volkswagen) had in their cars.  The Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler in May, saying it placed eight undeclared  defeat devices,  or auxiliary emissions controls, in 2014-2016 Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles that led to  substantially  higher than allowable levels of nitrogen oxide, which is linked to smog formation and respiratory problems. It has a separate ongoing criminal probe into the matter. Marchionne said on Friday he was  confident that we have a solution that is acceptable to EPA and (California) in terms of 2017 certification and as flashback mechanism on all the 2014 to 2016 cars.  The EPA notice was the result of a probe that arose out of regulators' investigation of rival Volkswagen AG's excess diesel emissions.

U.S. housing starts dropped 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units in May, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the lowest since September 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a rate of 1.22 million units.     Analysts said the data compounded concerns about the underlying health of the U.S. economy after government figures  on inflation and retail sales for May, released on Wednesday, fell well short of market expectations.     The data also reinforced traders' doubts, analysts said, that the Fed would be able to hike interest rates again this year, as the U.S. central bank projected Wednesday, when it raised rates for the second time in 2017.      If housing is weak, then economic growth is going to be weaker, too,  said Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.  The Fed may be a little more cautious hiking in that environment.      Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last up 2/32 in price to yield 2.155 percent, compared with 2.162 percent late Thursday. Two-year Treasuries were last up 2/32 in price to yield 1.319 percent, compared with 1.355 percent late Thursday.     Traders are particularly concerned about soft U.S. inflation readings, which have been viewed as an obstacle to the Fed's plan, outlined on Wednesday, to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, while raising rates for a third time this year.       Really, what’s causing the markets to be somewhat skeptical of the Fed’s hiking path is that inflation has been trending downwards,  said Praveen Korapaty, global head of rates at Credit Suisse in New York.      There is some weakness in other data as well, but from my perspective the critical thing is the trajectory of inflation.

The committee is discussing plans with rival Key Safety Systems Inc (KSS) which is negotiating to take control of the company. Any plan would require final approval from Takata's board before the air bag maker submits them as part of expected bankruptcy filings in the United States and Japan. Takata declined to comment on the plans. Takata is still building replacements required under a recall of around 100 million inflators that could detonate with excessive force after prolonged exposure to heat. Exploding Takata airbag inflators have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 150 injuries worldwide. Takata would stop producing airbag inflators after it completes production of replacement parts and fulfills existing supply contracts for them with automaker clients, the sources said. One source said existing contracts would likely end around 2020. Job cuts are also on the table, the sources said, including upper-level managers involved in manipulating inflator test results to conceal possible defects. Many plant managers would likely remain to ensure that production continues during the transition period. The plan is critical for a bankruptcy restructuring that could be launched as early as next week. Takata is hoping to erase billions in liabilities and resolve the recall of air-bag inflators. Any bankruptcy would pose limited risk to Takata's ability to supply the roughly 100 million replacement inflators required to complete the global recall, one of the sources familiar with the company's plans said. U.S. vehicle safety regulators are putting pressure on Takata and automakers to speed up the replacement of defective inflators in the United States. The plan would also have Takata air bags and seatbelts rebranded as KSS products after Takata emerges from bankruptcy.

The winner, by far, was abstention. Barely a third of the 1,803 registered voters in the working class neighborhood of Saint-Maurice bothered to cast a ballot at the school, which doubles up as a polling station.  The dismal turnout in the first round of the elections could spell trouble for President Emmanuel Macron, who was born and grew up in the northern city. While his party is forecast to win the second round run-off this Sunday easily, he will need all the support he can get to avoid street protests that could hinder his plans for far-reaching social and economic reforms. Local people who stayed at home last weekend spoke of their disillusionment with politics in a country where job creation has been slow and frustration with an election where the result already appears a done deal.  We're in deep shit already and we'll never get out of it, at least not for a long while, so what's the point in going to vote?  Amelie Leroy, a 25-year-old maternity ward worker, told Reuters on a quiet street of yellow and red brick houses. These are emotions felt across France, a country where  voter turnout is traditionally high but slumped to just 48.7 percent in the first round, the lowest for a parliamentary election in the country's modern history. Opinion polls project that the run-off - contested by the top two candidates from the first round in each constituency - will hand Macron's centrist Republic on the Move (LREM) party and its smaller ally as many as three quarters of the 577 seats in the lower house. That on paper would give Macron a powerful mandate for his reform plans that include cutting tens of thousands of public sector jobs and making it easier to hire and fire workers. But his party and its ally won just about a third of the low first round vote.  An OpinionWay poll on Thursday pointed to an even lower turnout of 46 percent in the run-off.  This high abstention rate shows Macron, a 39-year-old former banker, is struggling to rally the whole nation behind him. That means he will have to tread carefully in a country where muscular trade unions do not shy from calling strikes and where street protests have forced many a past government to dilute reforms. Leroy, who will stay at home again for the run-off, said she knew little about the candidates courting her vote, but did know about Macron's plans to relax labor laws. And they worry her. If he goes through with them, Leroy said, she would probably take to the streets in protest, or strike. A survey by Elabe pollsters showed not all of those who  abstained last Sunday did so in protest - 47 percent welcomed the outcome. But even the government has said the low turnout was a failure it needed to address.  That's what's at stake in this second round vote but also for our whole five-year term - reconciling the French with politics and bringing voters back to the ballot box,  said Nicolas Dumont, the 40-year-old candidate for Macron's party in the Amiens constituency where Leroy lives. Dumont got just 210 votes cast at the Saint-Maurice school, exactly the same as Francois Ruffin, a hard-left activist who he will face in the June 18 run-off. A woman walks past a train on a platform at the train station in the northern city of Amiens, France, June 14, 2017. Picture taken June 14, 2017.Benoit TessierMany local people are unconvinced by Macron, who became modern France's youngest president last month.  We elected a 39-year-old, a former Rothschild banker. How do you want this guy to put himself in the shoes of the average worker? That will never happen,  said 63-year-old retired factory worker Philippe Lamour, a far-right sympathizer.  Lamour, who usually votes, is boycotting what he calls a  moronic  parliamentary election this time because he feels a LREM victory is a foregone conclusion. After months of political campaigning marked by scandals, even Macron supporters are wary.  Sitting in the sun on the steps of her home, 72-year-old Amiens resident Francoise Granger said she is backing both Macron and Dumont. However, she is also worried by allegations of impropriety concerning two ministers in his government.  There needs to be full transparency,  she said. Slideshow (21 Images)No Blank Check The large parliamentary majority that is expected for LREM should not be interpreted as a blank check for Macron, said Yves-Marie Cann of Elabe.   It will not exempt the government from having to seek a wide majority for its projects, or else it would run the risk of angering part of the population and foster protests that could benefit from substantial support among the population.  Macron has said labor reform is one of his top priorities and has planned to ask the new assembly, which starts work on June 27, to let him to speed up its adoption via executive decrees rather than parliamentary votes. But, in an attempt to win backing for the reform, he has also planned a series of meetings with labor unions to discuss his plans. At this stage, the momentum behind Macron is such that active opposition to him is weak, Cann said. One in two of those voters who backed his main anti-establishment rivals for the presidency - hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon and far-right contender Marine Le Pen - didn't vote in the parliamentary election's first round. Generally, the lower a citizen's salary and educational levels, the higher the likelihood of abstention, an Ipsos Sopra Steria poll showed. Age also plays a role.      We know that it's the workers who won't go and vote, we know it's young people who won't go and vote,  said Ruffin, who came well behind LREM's Dumont in the Amiens constituency in the first round, with 24.32 percent versus 34.13 percent.     But in a city with a history of headline-grabbing industrial action, trade unionists said the apathy would not last.   It's not done yet. I hope he (Macron) is expecting tough protests when he puts his reform on the table,  said Frederic Chantrelle, a member of the CFDT union who has worked for 20 years at a local  tumble-drier factory.   (Corrects projected turnout to 46 percent in paragraph 9.)

Crew Group Inc has won the support of more than 50 percent of its term loan holders for a deal to trim its $2.1 billion debt load and push back deadlines to repay some of it by two years, the company said on Friday. The deal spares the New York-based company the fate of several of its retail peers that have filed for bankruptcy in the last 12 months amid fast-changing consumer tastes and the increasing popularity of internet shopping. To achieve the deal, J. Crew has outmaneuvered opposition from some of its lenders to placing its brand in a separate company to raise new debt by relying on the support of other creditors, in a strategy first reported last month by Reuters. J. Crew placed its intellectual property in a new subsidiary that will issue $250 million in new debt, which will be used to buy back existing bonds. These bonds currently have a nominal value of $567 million, so the swap will almost halve the burden of the bonds for J. Crew. Some J. Crew lenders opposed that move on the grounds that it removes collateral from the main company. They threatened to say the retailer defaulted, prompting J. Crew itself to file a pre-emptive lawsuit against them. The deal on Friday resolves this issue, because, by obtaining the support of more than 50 percent of the holders of its $1.5 billion term loan, J. Crew can secure a waiver to any legal challenge to the carve-out of its intellectual property. In return, J. Crew offered to retire $150 million of its term loan at par, financed with some new debt and cash from the private-equity owners. The deal already had support from major creditors GSO Capital Partners LP, the credit arm of buyout fund Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), and hedge fund Anchorage Capital Group LLC, which bought 28 percent of the term loan and 67 percent of the bonds.

The central bank this week switched to a hawkish stance after years of ultra-low interest rates and just months after saying more rate cuts were possible, raising the specter of higher debt burdens on heavily leveraged households. Canadian household debt has risen 51.5 percent since 2009, when the housing boom started, to C$2 trillion, and mortgages now account for about 66 percent of that, according to Statistics Canada. The debt-to-disposable income ratio is at a near-record 166.9 percent, meaning Canadians owe C$1.67 for every dollar of disposable income. With consumers already so leveraged, a small increase in rates could force the most highly leveraged consumers to sell their homes.  If we see a real slowdown in the housing market, individuals who bought in to a market that was very hot will have to unload their home at a reduced price and you're going to see significant financial issues in the market,  said Laurie Campbell, chief executive at Credit Canada, a credit counseling agency that is funded by banks, retailers and other lenders. The housing market has already begun to slow. Resales of Canadian homes dropped 6.2 percent in May from April, with Toronto sales plunging 25.3 percent, as new housing policy changes sideswiped demand. An interest rate rise will hit big loans hardest, and then trickle down to other consumer credit.  With a credit card, there is some flexibility - options for minimum payments - whereas with a mortgage the balance is big and you have to pay the whole amount every month, so it is a different story,  said Regina Malina, senior director of decision insights at Equifax Canada, a credit agency. Rate increases will hit real estate investors first.   As soon as the mortgage payments go up a bit and the rent no longer covers the mortgage payment, people are going to try to unload those in a hurry. And that's part of what could trigger a mini crash in the condo market,  said John Andrew, director of Queen's University Real Estate Roundtable.  Craig Wright, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, said he expects rates to rise only gradually, slowing housing and auto sales.  We borrowed a bit from the future so I would expect a cooling in housing as well as consumer more generally, including autos, partly because of rate increases but also because we brought forward activity and you get a bit of an air pocket after a while,  Wright said. David Macdonald, senior economist at the left-leaning Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said economic growth is a bigger worry than loan defaults.  Consumers retrench when they do not feel the wealth effect of ever increasing house prices,  he said.

So instead of putting that money into the economy, you spend it paying down debt and you see a widespread economic impact ... it spirals.

Officer Ray Tensing, 27, shot once, hitting 43-year-old Samuel DuBose in the head after stopping him for a missing front license plate on his car in July 2015, a body camera worn by Tensing showed.  Tensing, who is white, was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter in a retrial of the case. A mistrial was declared last November in the first trial after jurors could not agree on a verdict. DuBose's death added to the debate in the United States over the use of excessive force by police, especially against minorities.  During tearful testimony on Friday at the Hamilton County Courthouse in Cincinnati, Tensing, dressed in a dark suit, said that DuBose was evasive during the traffic stop and attempted to speed away.  He just mashed the accelerator to the floor,  said Tensing, who paused occasionally to wipe his eyes with a tissue.   I protected my life,  Tensing said when asked by prosecutors if he had served and protected DuBose. Tensing said repeatedly that he shot to  stop the threat.   Tensing has pleaded not guilty and is free on a $1 million bond. The university police fired him after he was charged.  Tensing's attorney, Stew Mathews, said in opening arguments on June 8 that his client did not anticipate DuBose was going to drive off with Tensing's arm in the car. Tensing was afraid he would be dragged and possibly killed.  This all happened so quickly that instinctively Ray Tensing did the only thing he could do to save his own life,  Mathews said. He said Tensing is not a racist and that if DuBose had cooperated during the stop he would not be dead. During the traffic stop, Tensing asked DuBose to remove his seat belt and tried to open the car door. DuBose did not comply and closed the door. The vehicle started slowly rolling forward  with Tensing's arm pinned against the steering wheel, his lawyer said. Tensing pulled his gun and fired once. Hamilton County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Stacey DeGraffenreid said in opening remarks that Tensing ignored his training when he reached into the car and that he was never in danger. She called what occurred  clearly a murder.  Closing statements in the trial are scheduled for Monday.

The committee is discussing plans with rival Key Safety Systems Inc (KSS) which is negotiating to take control of the company. Any plan would require final approval from Takata's board before the air bag maker submits them as part of expected bankruptcy filings in the United States and Japan. Takata declined to comment on the plans.  Takata is still building replacements required under a recall of around 100 million inflators that could detonate with excessive force after prolonged exposure to heat.  Exploding Takata airbag inflators have been blamed for at least 16 deaths and more than 150 injuries worldwide. Takata would stop producing airbag inflators after it completes production of replacement parts and fulfills existing supply contracts for them with automaker clients, the sources said. One source said existing contracts would likely end around 2020. Job cuts are also on the table, the sources said, including upper-level managers involved in manipulating inflator test results to conceal possible defects. Many plant managers would likely remain to ensure that production continues during the transition period. The plan is critical for a bankruptcy restructuring that could be launched as early as next week. Takata is hoping to erase billions in liabilities and resolve the recall of air-bag inflators. Any bankruptcy would pose limited risk to Takata's ability to supply the roughly 100 million replacement inflators required to complete the global recall, one of the sources familiar with the company's plans said. U.S. vehicle safety regulators are putting pressure on Takata and automakers to speed up the replacement of defective inflators in the United States. The plan would also have Takata air bags and seatbelts rebranded as KSS products after Takata emerges from bankruptcy. Michigan-based KSS, owned by Chinese supplier Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS), currently is a smaller competitor to Takata in airbags and seatbelts.

In a Friday securities filing, Copec and unit Arauco said they signed a non-disclosure agreement with Eldorado with the purpose of exploring a possible investment, without elaborating further. Earlier in the day, a person involved in the process told Reuters that Copec had already placed a bid for Eldorado. According to the person, who asked for anonymity as terms of the bid remain private, Eldorado is also a target of Brazilian rivals Suzano Papel & Celulose SA and Fibria SA , which were lured by potentially significant cost savings from an acquisition. Currently, Brazil's billionaire Batista family controls 81 percent of Eldorado through investment holding company J&F; Investimentos SA, with the rest being owned by two pension funds. Eldorado is among J&F;'s flagship assets put up for sale after agreeing to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion real ($3.2 billion) fine for its role in corruption scandals that threaten to topple President Michel Temer. That settlement followed testimony from J&F;'s owners Joesley and Wesley Batista that they spent 600 million reais to bribe nearly 1,900 politicians in recent years. Buying Eldorado could allow Copec to expand in Brazil, where lawmakers have discussed easing sales of land to foreign investors. Land in Brazil offers global pulpmakers strategic advantages, such as more productive soil than Scandinavia and Chile. Copec shed 0.4 percent to 7,840 Chilean pesos in midafternoon Friday trading, paring the stock's 2.3 percent gain since newspaper Valor Econômico reported the planned Eldorado bid earlier this week. A deadline for bids was unclear, the person said, although Copec's Arauco unit made an offer this week to the Batistas for their stake. The person added that exclusive talks could start over the weekend. Eldorado's debt hovers around 8 billion reais ($2.4 billion), and J&F; lenders are pressing for a sale, sources told Reuters last month. Fibria and J&F; declined to comment. Suzano did not have an immediate comment. Valor reported on Friday, citing a person familiar with the talks, that Copec's non-binding offer valued Eldorado at 11 billion reais. Exclusive Talks For years, family ownership of Brazilian pulp and paper companies has hindered a consolidation, as owners have resisted sharing control. Just seven pulp and paper M&A; deals have taken place in Brazil since the start of last year, compared with 11 each in Sweden and Indonesia and 54 in the United States, according to Thomson Reuters data. A decision on which company will hold exclusive talks with the Batistas for their stake is  around the corner,  the person said. Negotiating a deal could take a long time because a buyer  will not spare Eldorado from a rather stringent due diligence procedure,  the person added. One of the Batista brothers said in testimony that Brazilian President Michel Temer condoned use of bribes to silence a potential witness in a corruption scandal. Temer denies the accusations. This month the government ordered state-controlled lender Caixa Econômica Federal to stop providing financing to the Batista family, Reuters reported on June 7, citing people familiar with the decision, which a source called  retaliation.  Uncertainty surrounding the plea deal hampered Suzano's interest in Eldorado, Valor said. Fibria SA, the world's No. 1 eucalyptus pulpmaker, could bid for Eldorado as early as Friday, Valor reported, without saying how it got the information. The investment banking units of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA are advising Suzano on a bid for Eldorado, according to Valor. Morgan Stanley & Co is Fibria's advisor, the person said. Copec's Arauco is being advised by Banco Santander Brasil SA and law firms Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett LLP and Mattos Filho Advogados. The banks did not have an immediate comment. Valor said this week that Fibria seemed the least likely suitor because a key shareholder, state development bank BNDES, would not approve a deal that could shore up the Batistas. $1 = 3.29 reais Additional reporting by Antonio de la Jara and Felipe Iturrieta in Santiago; Editing by David Gregorio and Diane Craft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eldorado-brasil-ma-idUSL1N1JD0E7"},

After a tumultuous week that pitched Britain into its deepest political crisis since the Brexit referendum a year ago, May's future was uncertain, darkened by her botched gamble on a snap election and muted response to a deadly fire in London. Fighting for her political survival, May has been trying to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish Protestant party to avoid a second election that could delay Brexit talks and damage  the $2.5 trillion economy.  While she is ultimately expected to reach a deal, a source in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) told Reuters that an agreement to support her minority government was not likely before next week. The price of such a deal remains unclear.  If there is the expected positive outcome, it will be at least the start of next week before anything is signed off,  a DUP source told Reuters. Having lost a majority in parliament, May needs the DUP's 10 lawmakers to win any kind of vote, including on the pieces of legislation needed to enact Britain's divorce from the EU. When asked if a deal was in the making, DUP leader Arlene Foster told reporters in Dublin:  I think you know it takes two to tango and we're ready to dance.   Foster later said it was  right and proper  for the DUP to support May's legislative program, which is due to be announced next week and will be the first formal test of her ability to govern.  A source in May's Conservative Party said talks continued on Friday. The party has refused to give a time frame for reaching a deal, though May is due in Brussels for an EU summit on June 22-23 when she will want to show she has a solid grip on power. Related CoverageIrish, British PMs to meet to talk Brexit, Northern Ireland crisisIrish PM: Deal between DUP, UK PM must not hurt Northern Irish devolutionNorthern Ireland's DUP hoping to conclude deal with UK PM May as soon as possibleBesides forging a deal to keep her job and preparing for Brexit talks, May is grappling with a crisis over the breakdown in power-sharing between the pro-British DUP and the Catholic nationalist Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland's separate, devolved government. She is also trying to contain outrage at home over a London tower block fire which left at least 30 people dead.  Hundreds of protesters chanting  we want justice  stormed a local town hall on Friday afternoon and May had to leave a meeting with residents under heavy police guard.  After facing criticism for not meeting survivors on Thursday, May visited a hospital on Friday to speak to some of the people who escaped the fire. Leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill is greeted by Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar on the steps of Government buildings in Dublin, Ireland June 16, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneWhile European leaders try to gauge what to expect from the Brexit talks due to begin in Brussels on Monday, May is so weakened that her own Brexit strategy is the subject of public debate in her own party, and by her potential allies.  We want to see a Brexit that works for everybody, not just in Northern Ireland from my perspective but in the Republic of Ireland as well, so it is about a sensible Brexit,  Foster told reporters. Foster said the talks would not cover social issues. The DUP is one of the most socially conservative parties in Europe, having sought to maintain some of its strictest limits on abortion and consistently opposed gay marriage.  We're not going to get into - and I know there has been a lot of talk about our position in relation to social issues for example - those are matters for the Northern Ireland assembly - they are not matters for Westminster and therefore we will not be dealing with them at Westminster,  she told the BBC.   Sensible Brexit  Slideshow (2 Images)May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of the divorce. But her vulnerability at home means that her plan to leave the EU's lucrative single market and customs union in order to impose strict limits on immigration is under intense scrutiny. Prompted by her poor election showing, particularly among pro-EU young people who fear losses of jobs and opportunity for Brexit, some of her most senior ministers and two former Conservative prime ministers have called for a rethink. May's finance minister, Philip Hammond, said on Friday that Britain should prioritize protecting jobs and economic growth.  My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations,  Hammond told reporters before a meeting of the 28 EU finance ministers in Luxembourg.  Britain's Brexit ministry said on Friday that no deal could be struck on exiting unless the future relationship with the bloc was taken into account. EU leaders have given chief Brussels negotiator Michel Barnier no authority to so much as talk about future trade with Britain until he clinches outline deals on Brussels' priority issues, including London's exit bill. Addressing her party on Monday after one of its most memorable electoral failures, May said she would take a broader, more consultative approach to the Brexit talks. But after a generation of discord over Europe inside her party, May's future could depend on her ability to please both the eurosceptic and pro-European factions in her party.

McDonald's deal would have run through the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, and bowing out will likely to save it hundreds of million of dollars if it had continued into the next four-year Olympics cycle and beyond.  McDonald's has been trying to hold down costs as it invests in improving food quality, restaurant service and online ordering to woo back U.S. diners. Intense competition has gnawed away at sales.  We are reconsidering all aspects of our business and have made this decision in cooperation with the IOC to focus on different priorities,  said McDonald's Global Chief Marketing Officer Silvia Lagnado. The company, first involved with the games in 1968 and a sponsor since 1976, was the Olympics' food retail sponsor. Despite pulling out with immediate effect, McDonald's will continue at next year's Pyeongchang winter Olympics as a domestic sponsor. The company's move may also reflect a rising view among consumer brands that exclusive Olympics sponsorship deals do not offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC.  Moreover, in a trend that began after the Beijing games in 2008, shrinking television audiences for the games could be diminishing the value of sponsors' ads. With the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, many viewers turned to social media alternatives like Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).  In the United States, Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal said it had attracted 8.6 percent fewer eyeballs for Rio than it did for London in 2012. FILE PHOTO - Athletes line up at a McDonald's inside the Olympic village in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on August 1, 2016.Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoThe fast food chain has been part of the IOC's top sponsors program that contributes more than $1 billion in each four-year cycle for the games. While terms of Olympic sponsorship are not disclosed, a source who negotiated previous IOC sponsorship deals said that top global sponsors like McDonald's spend about $25 million a  year or about $100 million for a four-year period that includes a summer and winter games.     Reuters previously reported that the IOC had wanted to roughly double fees to $200 million per four year period starting in 2021. While it is unusual for an Olympic sponsor to leave early, sponsors change regularly within the IOC's top program. The most recent addition was China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), which signed a deal in January for a partnership through 2028.  The next three Olympics take place in Asia, and this could turn off U.S. sponsors trying to reach a U.S. audience. The U.S. Olympic Committee also has lost recent sponsors such as AT&T; (T.N) and Citigroup (C.N) ahead of the 2018 winter games in South Korea.  The IOC said it was not planning a direct replacement for McDonald's, but it is expected to announce a new global deal with Intel Corp (INTC.O) next week, according a source familiar with the matter. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Companies with a deep focus on technology are barging in while others migrate out,  said Peter Land, who works with Olympics and Paralympics sponsors for communications firm Finsbury.  The IOC has faced criticism from public health campaigners for allowing sponsors such as Coca-Cola (KO.N) and McDonald's to use the games to market their products, which are perceived to be unhealthy. John Lewicki, who oversees global Olympic sponsorship deals for McDonald's, said last year the company would reevaluate its Olympic relationship after changes to a rule that ended a marketing blackout for companies that sponsor athletes rather than the event itself. Shares of McDonald's rose $1.06, or about 0.7 percent on Friday. Reporting by Liana B.

The deal by Amazon, a proven retail disruptor, marked a major step by the internet retailer into the brick-and-mortar retail sector. Wal-Mart shares sank 5 percent, weighing the most on the S&P; 500 and the Dow. Shares of Target, CVS Health and Costco fell between 4 percent and 7 percent.  It's disrupting a number of industries here, and that's what's causing the market problems,  said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida. Amazon shares gained 3.6 percent, making the stock the biggest boost to the S&P; 500. Whole Foods shares surged 30 percent. The S&P; consumer staples sector fell 1.3 percent, by far the worst performing major sector. The S&P; 500 food and staples retailing index dropped 4.7 percent.

The technology sector fell 0.2 percent, continuing its recent slump. Tech has led the S&P; 500's 8.5 percent rally this year, but is on track for its second week of declines, prompting questions over whether investors are moving money into other sectors.  I think we need to see more of a pullback to say there is a serious rotation going on as opposed to just some profits coming off the top,  said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. Energy shares rose 1.1 percent, propping up the S&P; 500. Oil prices  edged up from 2017 lows as some producers cut back on exports. U.S. homebuilding fell for a third straight month in May to the lowest in eight months as construction activity declined broadly.

The Federal Reserve will provide specific examples from past years' problems with banks' capital planning practices, Yellen said in a letter dated June 16, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The letter was sent to Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer, who chairs a subcommittee overseeing financial institutions on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. The Federal Reserve would commit to publishing instructions for the stress tests at the same time as the supervisory scenarios, by Feb. 15, said Yellen, whose letter was a response to a May letter from the congressman, who had pressed for additional transparency around the annual stress tests. Yellen’s response comes after years of wrangling with Wall Street, lawmakers and even a federal watchdog about how transparent the stress tests should be. Last year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan entity that reviews government operations, recommended that the Fed should share more about its process with big banks. The banks had increasingly complained that stress tests were befuddling. The Fed has gradually eased off its black-box approach, but regulators maintain stress tests need to have some mystery so that banks cannot undermine the process. It has said it will tell banks more about the “qualitative” part of the exam, which examines concepts like risk management, and provide more feedback on the quantitative aspect. Still, officials say that releasing models publicly would allow banks to effectively work around the system. “We are concerned that releasing all details on the models would give banks an incentive to adjust their business practices in ways that could change the results of the stress test without changing the risks faced by the firms,” Yellen said in her letter. The Fed will release its 2017 test results beginning June 22. The results of its Comprehensive Capital Review and Analysis (CCAR) tests, which dictate whether banks can pursue capital distribution plans, will be released on June 28. Earlier this month, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said the Fed was committed to boosting transparency around the process. In a June 1 interview with CNBC, he said the Fed plans to give more granular information about how its model tests generic portfolios. Powell, a Republican, recently took the reins as chief regulatory official at the central bank.

Businessman Grigory Berezkin's ESN group said in a statement it has acquired a 65 percent stake in the RBC media holding, plus debt, from Onexim Group, which is controlled by metals magnate Mikhail Prokhorov. The completion of the deal marks the end of a seven-year period when RBC under the ownership of Prokhorov published hard-hitting investigations, including into the business affairs of Putin's inner circle. It stood out from most of the mainstream media in Russia, which are either controlled by the state or state-run companies, or tend to steer clear of topics which could anger powerful officials. Last year, according to several people familiar with the Kremlin's thinking, some figures close to Putin grew angry with RBC's coverage. Around the same time, Russian law enforcement officers in ski masks raided the offices of Onexim. Soon after, the media group's editor-in-chief left the country, and new senior managers were brought in from a state-run news agency. A large proportion of the group's journalists resigned, saying they anticipated restrictions on the topics on which they could report.  Apparently the asset became toxic, and they (the owners) wanted to get rid of it,  Elizaveta Osetinskaya, the former editor-in-chief, told Reuters on Friday. The Kremlin has always denied having pressured RBC over its reporting or being involved in Prokhorov's decision to sell.  The deal has been under negotiation for weeks. Financial details have not been disclosed. Berezkin, the new owner, already owns the Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid newspaper. Its pages are usually dominated by crime stories and celebrity gossip. Critical reporting on the president or his senior allies is rare in the newspaper. A spokeswoman for ESN group declined to comment on whether the new owner would change RBC's senior staff or editorial policy. Osetinskaya, the former editor, said that after her departure last year, RBC had continued to report independently. She said when it gave prominent coverage to anti-Kremlin protests in March, she thought that might lead to problems for the group.

After a tumultuous week that pitched Britain into its deepest political crisis since the Brexit referendum a year ago, May's future was uncertain, darkened by her botched gamble on a snap election and muted response to a deadly fire in London. Fighting for her political survival, May has been trying to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish Protestant party to avoid a second election that could delay Brexit talks and damage  the $2.5 trillion economy.  While she is ultimately expected to reach a deal, a source in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) told Reuters that an agreement to support her minority government was not likely before next week. The price of such a deal remains unclear.  If there is the expected positive outcome, it will be at least the start of next week before anything is signed off,  a DUP source told Reuters. Having lost a majority in parliament, May needs the DUP's 10 lawmakers to win any kind of vote, including on the pieces of legislation needed to enact Britain's divorce from the EU. When asked if a deal was in the making, DUP leader Arlene Foster told reporters in Dublin:  I think you know it takes two to tango and we're ready to dance.   Foster later said it was  right and proper  for the DUP to support May's legislative program, which is due to be announced next week and will be the first formal test of her ability to govern.  A source in May's Conservative Party said talks continued on Friday. The party has refused to give a time frame for reaching a deal, though May is due in Brussels for an EU summit on June 22-23 when she will want to show she has a solid grip on power. Related CoverageIrish, British PMs to meet to talk Brexit, Northern Ireland crisisIrish PM: Deal between DUP, UK PM must not hurt Northern Irish devolutionNorthern Ireland's DUP hoping to conclude deal with UK PM May as soon as possibleBesides forging a deal to keep her job and preparing for Brexit talks, May is grappling with a crisis over the breakdown in power-sharing between the pro-British DUP and the Catholic nationalist Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland's separate, devolved government. She is also trying to contain outrage at home over a London tower block fire which left at least 30 people dead.  Hundreds of protesters chanting  we want justice  stormed a local town hall on Friday afternoon and May had to leave a meeting with residents under heavy police guard.  After facing criticism for not meeting survivors on Thursday, May visited a hospital on Friday to speak to some of the people who escaped the fire. Leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland Michelle O'Neill is greeted by Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar on the steps of Government buildings in Dublin, Ireland June 16, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneWhile European leaders try to gauge what to expect from the Brexit talks due to begin in Brussels on Monday, May is so weakened that her own Brexit strategy is the subject of public debate in her own party, and by her potential allies.  We want to see a Brexit that works for everybody, not just in Northern Ireland from my perspective but in the Republic of Ireland as well, so it is about a sensible Brexit,  Foster told reporters. Foster said the talks would not cover social issues. The DUP is one of the most socially conservative parties in Europe, having sought to maintain some of its strictest limits on abortion and consistently opposed gay marriage.  We're not going to get into - and I know there has been a lot of talk about our position in relation to social issues for example - those are matters for the Northern Ireland assembly - they are not matters for Westminster and therefore we will not be dealing with them at Westminster,  she told the BBC.   Sensible Brexit  Slideshow (2 Images)May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of the divorce. But her vulnerability at home means that her plan to leave the EU's lucrative single market and customs union in order to impose strict limits on immigration is under intense scrutiny. Prompted by her poor election showing, particularly among pro-EU young people who fear losses of jobs and opportunity for Brexit, some of her most senior ministers and two former Conservative prime ministers have called for a rethink. May's finance minister, Philip Hammond, said on Friday that Britain should prioritize protecting jobs and economic growth.  My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations,  Hammond told reporters before a meeting of the 28 EU finance ministers in Luxembourg.  Britain's Brexit ministry said on Friday that no deal could be struck on exiting unless the future relationship with the bloc was taken into account. EU leaders have given chief Brussels negotiator Michel Barnier no authority to so much as talk about future trade with Britain until he clinches outline deals on Brussels' priority issues, including London's exit bill. Addressing her party on Monday after one of its most memorable electoral failures, May said she would take a broader, more consultative approach to the Brexit talks. But after a generation of discord over Europe inside her party, May's future could depend on her ability to please both the eurosceptic and pro-European factions in her party.

Although the U.S. team have the odds in their favor going into the first races of the 35th America's Cup starting on Saturday, the New Zealand crew may yet take the wind out of their sails. The U.S. holders of the oldest trophy in international sport not only go into the first-to-seven event with a bonus point for topping the qualifiers series, they are also racing on  home  waters, having based themselves in Bermuda since winning the sailing's most prestigious prize in San Francisco in 2013. But skipper Jimmy Spithill and his crew, although outwardly confident, will not be taking anything for granted in their quest for a third successive win after seeing how New Zealand have performed to become the challenger for the  Auld Mug , which was first claimed in 1851 by the schooner  America .  I think you’ve got two of the best teams in the world going head-to-head in a real heavyweight battle and man, ... I’m expecting it's going to be one hell of a fight,” Spithill said in a skippers press conference on Friday.  New Zealand's biggest shock so far was to introduce a revolutionary cycling system on their 50-foot (15 meter) catamaran, which allows  cyclors  rather than traditional  grinders  to generate the hydraulic power needed to operate its high-tech  foils  and towering  wing  sail. The U.S. team responded by introducing a hybrid position aboard its own boat, allowing tactician Tom Slingsby to pedal when needed to pump more oil into the hydraulic system. Aside from how they sail and who wins the tactical battles, there are other differences that could decide victory, including how they control their wings and foils, the hydraulic systems and the way the work is shared out between the six crew. Throughout the build-up to the America's Cup Match series, New Zealand's Peter Burling has looked the most relaxed helmsmen among the five challenger crews, although qualifying has been testing, and included a near-catastrophic capsize. “It's been a massive effort to get this far, we’ve faced a lot of adversity over the last couple of weeks with things like the capsize ... but our shore crew have really dug deep to get us a boat that’s very close to 100 percent for the finals,” Burling said on Friday. Burling's ease on the water may be because he has most time to sail the boat and focus on tactics. Sitting immediately in front of him is skipper Glenn Ashby, who may appear to be playing on a games console but is in fact operating the boat's giant  wing . Further along the narrow hull of the catamaran is Blair Tuke, Burling's Olympic partner in the 49er skiff, who both cycles and adjusts the rake of the foils which allow the boat to lift out of the water and  fly . Revenge Rematch This America's Cup is a revenge match for New Zealand, who lost in 2013 after seeing an 8-1 lead overturned. For one skipper who has raced against both teams, the final will be a battle between experience and determination against raw talent and confidence.  On paper Jimmy Spithill has a lot of skill for that (America's Cup racing) and it's very natural for him,  Groupama Team France skipper Franck Cammas told Reuters on Thursday.  But Peter Burling is young and he learns very quickly and he has a good boat ... he's very confident with the speed of his boat and with that you can compete better,  Cammas said, adding that Spithill's ability to come out fighting even when his back is against the wall will count for a lot.  It's important to have psychological stability and Jimmy looks like even if he's in a bad position, he can always come back,  Cammas said.

The report came a day after the government said that Peru's economy grew 0.17 percent in April compared with the same month a year earlier, the lowest monthly expansion since July 2009 amid declines in construction and manufacturing. In its quarterly report, the bank also raised its 2018 growth outlook to 4.2 percent from 4.1 percent previously. It raised its fiscal deficit estimate for both years, to 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2017 and 3.5 percent in 2018. The central bank also cut its 2017 inflation forecast to 2.2 percent on Friday, slightly below its previous estimate of 2.4 percent, and said 2018 inflation would be 2.8 percent. Central Bank President Julio Velarde said in a news conference that June inflation would likely be around zero or even negative. In the report the bank estimated Peru's 2017 current account deficit at 2.1 percent of gross domestic product versus a previous forecast of 2.6 percent. It said it expects the 2018 current account deficit at 2.0 percent of GDP, down from its previous estimate of 2.4 percent. The bank said it sees this year's trade surplus at $4.88 billion, up from $3.96 billion previously estimated. In a press conference, central bank chief Julio Velarde said the monetary authority would lower bank reserve requirements in July to 42 percent, from 44 percent currently, and would continue lowering them thereafter. He also did not rule out another interest rate cut to help boost the economy, but said it would need to be timed to have the greatest impact possible. The bank kept its interest rate on hold at 4 percent last week, after cutting rates in May for the first time in more than two years. Peru's opposition Popular Force party, which has a majority in Congress, meanwhile asked for Finance Minister Alfredo Thorne's resignation on Friday due to questions of his handling of an airport contract.

U.S. gold futures         settled up 0.2 percent at $1,256.50.     Gold was on track for a second weekly loss and has fallen more than 3 percent from a high of $1,295.97 on June 6 as investors braced for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and signal its policy outlook on Wednesday.     Bullion is sensitive to higher interest rates because they push bond yields higher, increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold, and tend to boost the dollar.       Gold has been spooked by the hawkish tone from the Fed,  which triggered some long liquidation both in futures and exchange-traded funds,  said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen.     Fears of more rate increases this year were heightened on Thursday by strong U.S. economic data, though housing numbers on Friday disappointed, pushing bond yields and the dollar lower.                                             If the Fed were to follow a more aggressive approach, this could preclude any significant rise in gold prices for the rest of the year,  Commerzbank analysts wrote in a note.     In other precious metals, silver        was 0.2 percent down at $16.68 an ounce after tapping a four-week low at $16.62 and heading for a weekly decline of about 2.6 percent, its biggest in six weeks.       Price action in both gold and silver of late seems to imply that traders still have plenty of short-term long positioning on their books,  said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.      Platinum        gained 0.5 percent to $924.50 an ounce, having touched its lowest in more than a month on Thursday at $913.50.      Latest jewelry import data from China suggests an improvement on a weak 2016. This is important as Chinese jewelry demand accounts for about 20 percent of total platinum use,  said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst for UBS Chief Investment Office.     South African mine supply, however, rose in the first quarter of 2017 and Staunovo said UBS trimmed its 6- and 12-month platinum price upside forecast to $1,000 an ounce from $1,050 an ounce previously.     Palladium        was down 0.3 percent at $867.20 and on track for its first weekly decline in four weeks.

Businessman Grigory Berezkin's ESN group said in a statement it has acquired a 65 percent stake in the RBC media holding, plus debt, from Onexim Group, which is controlled by metals magnate Mikhail Prokhorov. The completion of the deal marks the end of a seven-year period when RBC under the ownership of Prokhorov published hard-hitting investigations, including into the business affairs of Putin's inner circle. It stood out from most of the mainstream media in Russia, which are either controlled by the state or state-run companies, or tend to steer clear of topics which could anger powerful officials. Last year, according to several people familiar with the Kremlin's thinking, some figures close to Putin grew angry with RBC's coverage. Around the same time, Russian law enforcement officers in ski masks raided the offices of Onexim. Soon after, the media group's editor-in-chief left the country, and new senior managers were brought in from a state-run news agency. A large proportion of the group's journalists resigned, saying they anticipated restrictions on the topics on which they could report.  Apparently the asset became toxic, and they (the owners) wanted to get rid of it,  Elizaveta Osetinskaya, the former editor-in-chief, told Reuters on Friday. The Kremlin has always denied having pressured RBC over its reporting or being involved in Prokhorov's decision to sell.  The deal has been under negotiation for weeks. Financial details have not been disclosed. Berezkin, the new owner, already owns the Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid newspaper. Its pages are usually dominated by crime stories and celebrity gossip. Critical reporting on the president or his senior allies is rare in the newspaper. A spokeswoman for ESN group declined to comment on whether the new owner would change RBC's senior staff or editorial policy. Osetinskaya, the former editor, said that after her departure last year, RBC had continued to report independently. She said when it gave prominent coverage to anti-Kremlin protests in March, she thought that might lead to problems for the group.  Perhaps they did not restrain themselves sufficiently,  she said of RBC's current management.

Dan Bidondi, who identified himself as a reporter for the website that hawks extremist views and fake news, arrived with a video camera at the municipal center of Newtown, Connecticut, to cover a routine Board of Education meeting. Bidondi wasn't interested in hearing how a New England hamlet of 27,000 was dealing with bus schedules or budget priorities.  Instead, he was there to give a man from Florida a platform upon which to express his delirious beliefs. Wolfgang Halbig and a bevy of followers, including a man clad in 18th-century patriot garb, showed up to bully community leaders into proving the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School actually occurred. Halbig had developed a following with calls to exhume the bodies of the 20 first-graders killed that day and release police photographs of the grisly crime scene. On Sunday, Comcast's flagship network, NBC, will extend a similar courtesy to Infowars by airing a segment on Alex Jones, its founder and conspiracy theorist-in-chief. Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News anchor whom President Donald Trump accused of bleeding  from her wherever  when she challenged him during an election debate, interviewed Jones for her new prime-time program. It competes with CBS's vaunted, long-running newsmagazine  60 Minutes.  The decision unleashed a well-deserved backlash against NBC. Viewers are calling for boycotts. Petitions crawl across Facebook and Twitter demanding NBC withdraw the piece. JPMorgan Chase temporarily pulled advertisements, and others may follow. The furor forced Kelly to withdraw from a fundraiser on Wednesday for a charity led by parents who lost children at Sandy Hook, and one which I helped to found. Just a few weeks into her tenure, Kelly – who had been offered $20 million to stay at Fox News, according to media reports – has put NBC, a business that generates $10 billion a year in revenue, into a pickle that could have commercial ramifications for its parent company. If the broadcaster forges ahead with a segment that serves to legitimize Jones, Infowars and the falsifications they peddle, sponsors may further withdraw their custom as more affluent and educated viewers flee.  As Uber and other companies have learned, uprisings can mushroom quickly in the social-media age. In the short term, that would make Kelly's much-ballyhooed show a casualty, just as it did her former Fox News colleague Bill O'Reilly, who was pushed out earlier this year following an advertiser uprising over a sexual-harassment scandal that enveloped him. There's a bigger risk from Kelly's embrace of Jones for the $200 billion cable operator controlled and run by family scion Brian Roberts. The willingness to elevate a bonkers theory that Sandy Hook and other tragedies either didn't happen or was an elaborate hoax perpetrated by shadowy government actors to deprive Americans of their freedoms creates a false equivalency that threatens the mission at NBC, home to hit shows such as  Blindspot,   This Is Us  and  The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.  The network launched by David Sarnoff at the 1939 World's Fair in Queens prides itself as  a company uniquely positioned to inform, empower and inspire, we embrace the opportunity to create conversation and mobilize action to address some of the world's most critical issues.   To remain true to those values, Kelly and NBC really have but one option: the show must go on, and it must expose the real danger of the fake news Jones and his ilk pose not just to NBC's mission but to the wider American social fabric. She can start by revisiting video (here) from the Newtown Board of Education, where she will see Halbig and a procession of other adherents to Jones' conspiracies disrupting the normal course of business in a town traumatized by tragedy. To pull the broadcast would be far too damaging. It would suggest either a lack of editorial independence at NBC, or a failure to produce good work by Kelly – or perhaps both. Worse still, it would allow Jones to cry censorship by what he calls the  dying dinosaur media systems of information suppression.  That would only validate the warped worldview of his audience, and maybe even grow their numbers. Since releasing a trailer and a smiling selfie with Jones, Kelly and her producers have been scrambling to make their piece more critical of Jones and Infowars. In a series of phone calls on Wednesday evening, Kelly reached out to a handful of Sandy Hook parents. They repeated their demands that NBC not broadcast the interview, and declined to participate on camera.  Jones, perhaps sensing both opportunity and risk, released a video on Thursday night including audio recordings in which he claims Kelly can be heard promising him a fair shot:  It's not gonna be some gotcha hit piece.  Kelly and NBC News face an extremely high bar, with potential implications for the company's income statement. They can't withdraw and they can't produce a puff piece. If they fail to expose Jones' cruelty to the truth, they devalue the network.     There is a solution, albeit not a flashy one. NBC could run the video from when Infowars visited Newtown. It shows Halbig and the  patriot,  who identified himself as Melbourne Sann of Rome, New York, interrupting a meeting of unpaid volunteers, Republicans mostly and some Democrats, doing their best to provide a good education for children, some of whom were in the school when a gunman killed their peers and six of their teachers.  As they'll see, Halbig isn't particularly rude. Sann, who operates a daycare center in his town, is polite, too. And yet they embrace a fiction that Jones pioneered and parlayed into notoriety, a nod from Trump and White House press credentials for Infowars. That is what makes him so dangerous to the country, and perhaps even to Comcast's bottom line.  BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Although the U.S. team have the odds in their favor going into the first races of the 35th America's Cup starting on Saturday, the New Zealand crew may yet take the wind out of their sails. The U.S. holders of the oldest trophy in international sport not only go into the first-to-seven event with a bonus point for topping the qualifiers series, they are also racing on  home  waters, having based themselves in Bermuda since winning the sailing's most prestigious prize in San Francisco in 2013. But skipper Jimmy Spithill and his crew, although outwardly confident, will not be taking anything for granted in their quest for a third successive win after seeing how New Zealand have performed to become the challenger for the  Auld Mug , which was first claimed in 1851 by the schooner  America .  I think you’ve got two of the best teams in the world going head-to-head in a real heavyweight battle and man, ... I’m expecting it's going to be one hell of a fight,” Spithill said in a skippers press conference on Friday.  New Zealand's biggest shock so far was to introduce a revolutionary cycling system on their 50-foot (15 meter) catamaran, which allows  cyclors  rather than traditional  grinders  to generate the hydraulic power needed to operate its high-tech  foils  and towering  wing  sail. The U.S. team responded by introducing a hybrid position aboard its own boat, allowing tactician Tom Slingsby to pedal when needed to pump more oil into the hydraulic system. Aside from how they sail and who wins the tactical battles, there are other differences that could decide victory, including how they control their wings and foils, the hydraulic systems and the way the work is shared out between the six crew. Throughout the build-up to the America's Cup Match series, New Zealand's Peter Burling has looked the most relaxed helmsmen among the five challenger crews, although qualifying has been testing, and included a near-catastrophic capsize. “It's been a massive effort to get this far, we’ve faced a lot of adversity over the last couple of weeks with things like the capsize ... but our shore crew have really dug deep to get us a boat that’s very close to 100 percent for the finals,” Burling said on Friday. Burling's ease on the water may be because he has most time to sail the boat and focus on tactics. Sitting immediately in front of him is skipper Glenn Ashby, who may appear to be playing on a games console but is in fact operating the boat's giant  wing . Further along the narrow hull of the catamaran is Blair Tuke, Burling's Olympic partner in the 49er skiff, who both cycles and adjusts the rake of the foils which allow the boat to lift out of the water and  fly . Revenge Rematch This America's Cup is a revenge match for New Zealand, who lost in 2013 after seeing an 8-1 lead overturned. For one skipper who has raced against both teams, the final will be a battle between experience and determination against raw talent and confidence.

I wish other people were joining me in my dissents, I’ll say that,  Kashkari said in a phone interview with Reuters.  I think that there’s more sympathy for my views, but maybe people aren’t ready to take action.   Kashkari voted against the Fed's decision Wednesday to raise rates by a quarter of a percent. He also voted against the Fed's first rate hike this year, in March. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who unlike Kashkari does not vote on the Fed's monetary policy committee this year, has said for about a year that he believes rates do not need to rise in a low-growth environment like the current one.  He's looking pretty smart,  Kashkari said.  It was not clear if Kashkari was suggesting there were others besides Bullard at the Fed also advocating for a pause on interest-rate hikes, and he declined to discuss colleagues' views expressed behind closed doors. Minutes of the two-day meeting earlier this week will be published in about three weeks.  When Narayana Kocherlakota ran the Minneapolis Fed, he too  dissented against policy tightening, but Kashkari says he has not consulted with his predecessor, a PhD economist who now teaches at the University of Rochester.  My predecessor and I could not be more different,  said Kashkari, who has been an aerospace engineer, a Republican candidate for California governor, and the head of the U.S. government's bank bailout program in the financial crisis.  We could not be coming at this problem from more different starting points and yet we are ending up largely at the same place.   Kashkari detailed his reasons for dissent in an essay published earlier on Friday, saying they largely turned on his concern about falling inflation despite near-full employment in the U.S. economy. In the Reuters interview he said he believes his colleagues may be increasingly uncomfortable with low interest rates because they fear making the same mistake the Fed did in the 1970s, when it failed head off what became runaway inflation.  The risk of us being stuck at 1.5 percent inflation they probably feel like is not terrible,  Kashkari said. But in his view, he said, waiting to raise rates further is the less costly option.  We have plenty of time as a committee to respond  if inflation does begin to surge, he said.  Kashkari also said he would have liked to specify a date at which the Fed will begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, perhaps October 1 or November 1. By not doing so, he said, the Fed invites  unnecessary  market anxiety around the Fed's July and September meetings.   No Iceberg Ahead Still, Kashkari, who ran the Treasury's bank bail out program during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, said the level of concern he feels now is  no comparison  to the feeling he had back then.   If we are making a mistake, we are making a small mistake now that I think we can recover from,  Kashkari said in the interview.  I am not sounding an alarm bell like, 'Iceberg ahead!'    To Kashkari, years of missing on inflation forecasts does not mean that the Fed should raise its target for inflation, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday said should be considered by central banks globally.  I can't fathom how we could take that on at this minute,  Kashkari said, adding that as a longer-term, big-picture question it is a legitimate topic of study. But with inflation now falling to 1.5 percent by the Fed's preferred gauge,  even having that conversation right now makes no sense.  Nevertheless, he said, Yellen has been an  excellent  chair. Yellen's term ends in early February 2018 and earlier this week declined to talk about her plans after.  I really hope and believe she should be reappointed because there’s nobody I can think of that would do better,  Kashkari said.

Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said earlier he had a plan in place in case Thorne was forced to resign over accusations he improperly tried to influence an airport contract.

While the negotiations are still fluid, lead underwriter Deutsche Bank has told some accounts to expect the revolver to remain as originally structured, rather than be made pari passu with the proposed $870 million term loan B, and an increase in the spread on the term loan to as much as 450bp over Libor, from initial guidance of 375bp-400bp over Libor, two of the sources said. The 1% floor and 99.5 original issue discount on the loan would not be changed.  Deutsche plans to officially roll out the new terms on Monday, one of the sources said. Commitments were initially due June 15.  The financing currently consists of a $150 million five-year first-out revolver, the $870 million seven-year term loan B, and a $280 million eight-year second-lien term loan. The second-lien tranche, which is guided at 800bp-825bp over Libor with a 1% floor and a 99 offering price, was oversubscribed as of earlier this week. Several potential first-lien lenders committed conditionally upon a pari passu revolver, or alternatively, higher pricing.   The existing structure is particularly problematic for Collateralized Loan Obligations, which make up a large portion of the existing lender base, because the vehicles place capacity restrictions on junior-lien debt. Effectively, the first-out revolver turns the first-lien into a second-lien.  Securus is marketing the deal at 4.7 times first-lien leverage, including an anticipated $20 million draw on the revolver at close, and 6.0 times total leverage, based on pro forma adjusted Ebitda of $191 million for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, including $10 million of synergies. That degree of leverage has been deemed by some investors as too high, in light of ongoing regulatory risk.  New sponsor Platinum Equity is contributing $487 million in fresh equity, while management is rolling over about $35 million, for roughly 31% of capitalization.  The revolver is rated BB/B1 by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively. The first- and second-lien tranches are rated B/B2 and CCC+/Caa2. The issuer is rated B/B3. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined to comment. Platinum Equity did not respond to requests for comment.

Michelle Carter, now 20, cried and shook as Bristol County Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter for the series of texts and phone calls urging her 18-year-old boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to kill himself.  Roy and Carter had suffered emotional problems. Roy had previously attempted suicide and Carter had taken psychiatric medications, according to trial testimony. The case was the first in the state to consider manslaughter charges tied to texting, and defense attorneys had noted the two teens were 30 miles (48 km) apart at the time of Roy's death. He killed himself by running a generator in his truck as he sat in a parking lot about 60 miles (96 km) south of Boston. Moniz focused on Carter telling Roy to return to his truck when he was first overcome by fumes.  Instructing Mr. Roy to get back in the truck constituted wanton and reckless conduct by Ms. Carter, creating a situation where there is a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to Mr. Roy,  Moniz said. Observers, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, criticized the verdict as an overreach.  Carter's behavior was horrible, morally reprehensible, but I'm not sure that equates with legal responsibility,  said Daniel Medwed, professor of law at Northeastern University in Boston. He added that the verdict is likely to face appeal. While about 40 U.S. states have laws criminalizing encouraging another person to commit suicide, Massachusetts does not. Carter opted against a jury trial, leaving her fate in Moniz's hands. She could face up to 20 years in prison, although Moniz noted he considered her a  youthful offender.  Moniz will sentence Carter in August. During the trial, the judge heard extensive readings of text-message exchanges between the two, including one reading:  No more pushing it off. No more waiting.  Bristol County prosecutor Maryclare Flynn portrayed Carter as a manipulative person who enjoyed controlling Roy and hoped to win sympathy for herself. Defense attorney Joseph Cataldo portrayed Carter as not in control of her actions because of prescription medication. Moniz cited a 200-year-old case in which a prison inmate was found guilty for persuading an inmate in a neighboring cell to kill himself before being hanged.

It's baby bird season and it's very, very hard for us. We get over 50 birds a day. People find all these baby birds on the ground,  Oda said. Bird rehabilitators treat birds at the Wild Bird Fund, a non-profit animal medical group, for sick, injured or orphaned wildlife in New York City, U.S., June 14, 2017.Shannon Stapleton Right now, I believe that we have about 350 birds,  said Oda.  We get over 120 different species.  Rita McMahon, a co-founder and director of The Wild Bird Fund, started the organization in her Upper West Side brownstone in 2005. Funded by donations, it moved to 565 Columbus Avenue in 2012. It is the only facility of its kind in New York City and the Humane Society, ASPCA and other animal rescue organizations bring birds  to the Fund for treatment. Slideshow (16 Images) There is so much danger out there that birds can get into,  said Oda.  It is our responsibility as citizens in the city to rescue these animals. They are basically hurt by us and we'll do our best.  Oda said the Fund's location means pigeons, sparrows, and  starlings are the most common patients.  These are the city birds that often get into trouble,  he said. The neighborhood is also home to hawks, owls, Robins, doves, ducks, geese, and a host of other types of birds. During a recent visit, a hen shared space with a white swan named Willow that was found six months ago suffering from frostbite in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.   Once healthy, creatures like Willow are sent to sanctuaries in the Tri-State area. This weekend, Willow will go to a sanctuary called Zeze in upstate New York. Local birds are released back into the wild once they have been healed. As for Kash, Oda said,  I think maybe he turned a corner. Hopefully he'll be released. And if he is, I'm hoping to contact the person who brought in the bird.

The deal, which not only helps Amazon make deeper inroads into the grocery sector but also marks its big entry into the brick-and-mortar retail space, sent shock waves through the retail industry.  Implications ripple far beyond the food segment, where dominant players like Walmart ... and Target now have to look over their shoulders at the Amazon train coming down the tracks,  said Charlie O’Shea, retail analyst with Moody's. RBC Capital Markets said in a note the deal is surprising because the acquisition would be Amazon's largest to date by a factor of 10, and also because the online retailer has so far avoided having much of a physical presence. Amazon had established a tentative physical footprint with a small number of Amazon Book Stores. Shares of U.S., Canadian and European retailers and supermarket chains fell as investors fretted over the wide-reaching implications of the deal. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc were down 4.4 percent at $75.46 on Friday afternoon, while Target Corp shares were down 7.1 percent at $51.53. Supermarket chain Kroger Co was off 12.1 percent at $21.60, United Natural Foods Inc tumbled 8.6 percent to $36.35 and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc was down 5.8 percent at $21.13. The S&P; 1500 food and staples retailing index was off 4.3 percent. The fallout also spread to Europe. Shares of supermarket chain Tesco Plc were down 4.8 percent and Carrefour slipped 3.7 percent.      Amazon's got its tentacles everywhere and that's another place to go,  said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida.  Amazon sees that industry changing significantly – and they see that people don't necessarily go to the grocery store anymore.  Amazon shares were up 2.8 percent at $991.35 and Whole Foods shares were up 28.6 percent at $42.51 in afternoon trading. Canadian consumer staples stocks fell as much as 3.36 percent, their biggest fall since October 2008. Two of Canada’s largest grocery chain operators, Loblaw Companies Ltd and Metro Inc both fell more than 5.5 percent at one point.  Packaged food companies were also damaged by the specter of healthier food that is less expensive targeting their customer base.  Shares of Mondelez International Inc, the owner of Oreo cookies and the whole Nabisco brand, were down 1.1 percent while Kraft Heinz Co dropped 2.6 percent and Hershey Co was down 2.5 percent.     Food distributors were also punished, with the S&P; 1500 sector index down 3.9 percent and Sysco Corp down 3.5 percent at $53.57.

Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf said Djibouti's military were  on alert  and that it had lodged complaints with the United Nations and the African Union. The United Nations Security Council is due to discuss the situation behind closed doors on Monday, diplomats said. Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairperson of the African Union Commission, later posted on Twitter:  I told Djibouti's Ambassador Idris Farah the AUC will send a delegation to Djibouti border to monitor developments, work with all parties.  Qatar said it was pulling its contingent out on June 14, days after the two East African countries sided with Saudi Arabia and its allies in their standoff with Qatar. Doha's foreign ministry did not give a reason for the move but it comes as Doha faces a diplomatic crisis with some of its Arab neighbors. They cut ties a week ago, accusing Qatar of backing Islamist militants and Iran, something Doha strongly denies.   Qatari peacekeepers withdrew on June 12 and 13. On the same day, there were Eritrean military movements on the mountain,  Ali Youssouf told Reuters.   They are now in full control of Dumeira Mountain and Dumeira Island. This is in breach of the UN Security Council resolution,  he added, referring to areas that the neighbors dispute.  Authorities in Asmara were not immediately available for comment. Djibouti, a close Western ally, hosts French and U.S. military bases and is the main route to the sea for Eritrea's arch foe and Washington's top regional ally, Ethiopia. Eritrea has fractious ties with the West, which had previously accused it of backing Somali and other regional insurgents. Asmara denies the charges. Clashes broke out between the Horn of Africa countries in June 2008 after Djibouti accused Asmara of moving troops across the border, raising fears the spat could engulf the region. The dispute triggered several days of fighting in which a dozen Djiboutian troops died and dozens were wounded. Eritrea had initially denied making any incursions, accusing Djibouti of launching unprovoked attacks. The U.N. Security Council requested both sides withdraw,  before the neighbors accepted a Qatari request to mediate and deploy peacekeepers.

The discovery in a river of Gregory Villemin's body in October 1984, bound hand and foot, led to a revenge killing, and the murder has remained unsolved even though it has been reopened several times. Now the arrest of Jacqueline and Marcel Jacob, following forensic improvements in criminal investigation, has gripped the nation once more and is dominating newspapers and TV news bulletins even as France prepares for a final round of elections on Sunday.  Gregory's body was found in the Vologne river near his home in a remote village in eastern France.  The  Gregory Affair  case was reopened most recently in 2008, when French detectives found DNA traces on a letter, raising hopes that advances in DNA identification might help identify the killer at last. The letter in question was one of a series of anonymous and threatening ones sent to Gregory's parents before and after Gregory's death, claiming to be from the killer. From L-3rdR, General Olivier Kim, Jean-Jacques Bosc, Prosecutor at Dijon's Court of Appeals, and Colonel Dominique Lambert speak to journalists during a news conference about the unsolved murder of Gregory Villemin, 32 years after the crime, in Dijon, France, June 16, 2017.Robert PrattaJean-Jacques Bosc, prosecutor in Dijon, said that thanks to improved methods in the study of handwriting in conjunction with other evidence, the couple - aunt and uncle to Gregory's father - were now under investigation for  kidnapping leading to death.    The people who took part in that kidnapping are the authors of the crime,  Bosc told reporters at a news conference on Friday, adding that investigators believed the original suspect in the case, their nephew Bernard Laroche, now dead, was also involved. Slideshow (4 Images)Being put under formal investigation in France can be a step on the way to charges, but it does not necessarily lead to a trial. The couple's lawyers and a lawyer for Laroche's widow said their clients denied any involvement, and that they would contest the investigation. Laroche was charged with the murder of Gregory soon after it took place, but he was later freed after evidence against him was thrown out by prosecutors. Convinced that his cousin Laroche was the murderer, Gregory's father Jean-Marie Villemin shot him dead in 1985 and served four years in jail for the act. Gregory's mother, Christine Villemin also became a suspect because witnesses said they had seen her at the post office on the day that one of the mysterious letters was sent. She was placed under formal investigation but cleared in 1993. The case was reopened in 1999, and again in 2008.

The so-called IBC-Br index rose 0.28 percent from March after seasonal adjustments, compared to the median 0.30 percent analyst estimate.     The release added to a batch of data pointing to a slow economic recovery from Brazil's deepest recession in decades, which could allow the central bank to pursue a rapid pace of policy easing.     Rate futures yields indicated nearly consensual expectations of a 75-basis-point cut in the benchmark Selic rate, with a small probability of a steeper 100-basis-point reduction.      The move came as a reversal from the recent spike in rate future yields, erasing bets that the central bank could pursue a slower 50-basis-point pace of reductions as a political crisis threatened to delay President Michel Temer's reform agenda.     Trading volumes were thin, however, as many investors remained away from their desks between a local holiday and the weekend. The Brazilian real slipped 0.2 percent, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 0.8 percent.     Shares of meatpacker JBS SA dropped 1.5 percent after a source denied that Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co PJSC was arranging partners to make a bid for control of the world's largest meatpacker.     The Mexican peso strengthened 0.6 percent, tracking an increase in crude prices. Also supporting demand for emerging market assets were weaker-than-expected U.S. home start figures, which cast a shadow on expectations of two further U.S. rate hikes this year.

The Communications Security Establishment (CSE) agency said it had not detected any nation-state attempts to interfere in prior Canadian elections but saw risk from hacktivists.   CSE said Canada's 2015 federal election, which brought Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals to power, was targeted by  low-sophistication cyber threat activity  that did not affect the outcome of the election, according to a report it released on Friday.  CSE will be offering cyber advice and guidance to parliamentarians and to Canada's political parties,  CSE chief Greta Bossenmaier told a news conference.  Cyber security is a team imperative; no one organization can go it alone,  she added.  Worries about interference in democratic processes have come to the fore amid allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election last November and the French election in May.  Communications Security Establishment (CSE) Chief Greta Bossenmaier takes part in a news conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, June 16, 2017.Chris WattieU.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic Party emails as part of an effort to tilt the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump, something Russia denies. A British intelligence agency in March told political parties to protect themselves against potential cyber attacks, while the French government in March dropped plans to let its citizens abroad vote electronically in this month's legislative elections because of concern about the risk of cyber attacks.     Slideshow (2 Images)CSE said federal political parties, politicians and the media are more vulnerable to cyber threats than elections themselves, given that federal elections are largely paper-based. Cyber security lawyer Imran Ahmed of Miller Thomson said engaging with political parties was  a good first step  but the spy agency should have already had a plan in place including expected standards for political parties to meet.   We're two years away from 2019 and there's no timeline for what the next steps will be,  he said. CSE said it expects some hacktivist efforts in 2019 will be well-planned, with targets ranging from voter suppression and stealing party information to trying to discredit candidates.

The U.S. Justice Department sued FCA last month, accusing the Italian-American automaker of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014, in a move that could potentially lead to heavy fines. The company has proposed a software update as part of certifying 2017 diesel models to allow them to go on sale and then use that fix to update the 104,000 vehicles on the road. Asked whether it could take months to get U.S. authority approval for the software fix, as suggested by a U.S. Justice Department lawyer this week, Marchionne said  we are much closer than this .  When we made the proposal, we were ready to implement the fix immediately ... now it depends on them,  Marchionne told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting in Venice of the U.S.-Italy council.  We are talking to them ... we think we have a viable solution.       He said the company had not made any provisions for any potential fines, adding it was  impossible to try estimate . Part of the 2018 business plan, which is centered around the revamp of its Jeep, Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands, is erasing all debt and accumulating at least 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of cash by the end of next year.  After failing to strike a much sought alliance for FCA, Marchionne has made executing the 2018 plan his core ambition before he steps down at the end of his tenure early in the following year. When asked whether he could rethink his decision to quit in early 2019 given political and market uncertainties surrounding his company, Marchionne, who turns 65 on Saturday, said  No.  He said there was a  wide and deep bench  of possible internal candidates to succeed him, and did not exclude the possibility of his powers being divided among several managers, although added this would be up to the board to decide.  My job is not easy, it's a bit loaded,  he said.  Marchionne said the second quarter was going in line with expectations and confirmed the targets for the full year.  Widely credited with reviving one of Italy's top corporate names and rescuing U.S. Chrysler from bankruptcy, Marchionne has seen pressure mounting in recent months, with the U.S. market at its peak and legal challenges launched in the United States and in Europe over the company's emissions credentials.  His ambition to tie up with General Motors (GM.N) to share the costs of making cleaner and more autonomous vehicles has been repeatedly rebuffed. While Marchionne briefly flirted with the idea of a tie-up with Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), he reiterated on Friday that there were no talks with anyone at present. He stressed, however, that a merger for FCA was  ultimately inevitable  to be able to compete, although it might not happen during his tenure.   The only way you’re going to get that is by mass, there is no other solution,  he said.  Being small, cute is going to do nothing. Go home, go to a beauty parlor and do something else.  Asked whether FCA felt the same investor pressure that led to the sacking of his counterpart at U.S. rival Ford (F.N) or that which prompted GM to leave Europe, Marchionne said the 2018 plan would be his judge.  As long as we deliver on those commitments, you will not get pressured ... people will love you,  he said.  What they do to you in 2019 is a different story.

When we made the proposal, we were ready to implement the fix immediately ... now it depends on them,  Marchionne told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting in Venice of the U.S.-Italy council.  We are talking to them ... we think we have a viable solution.       He said the company had not made any provisions for any potential fines, adding it was  impossible to try estimate . Part of the 2018 business plan, which is centered around the revamp of its Jeep, Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands, is erasing all debt and accumulating at least 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of cash by the end of next year.  After failing to strike a much sought alliance for FCA, Marchionne has made executing the 2018 plan his core ambition before he steps down at the end of his tenure early in the following year. When asked whether he could rethink his decision to quit in early 2019 given political and market uncertainties surrounding his company, Marchionne, who turns 65 on Saturday, said  No.  He said there was a  wide and deep bench  of possible internal candidates to succeed him, and did not exclude the possibility of his powers being divided among several managers, although added this would be up to the board to decide.  My job is not easy, it's a bit loaded,  he said.  Marchionne said the second quarter was going in line with expectations and confirmed the targets for the full year.  Widely credited with reviving one of Italy's top corporate names and rescuing U.S. Chrysler from bankruptcy, Marchionne has seen pressure mounting in recent months, with the U.S. market at its peak and legal challenges launched in the United States and in Europe over the company's emissions credentials.  His ambition to tie up with General Motors (GM.N) to share the costs of making cleaner and more autonomous vehicles has been repeatedly rebuffed. While Marchionne briefly flirted with the idea of a tie-up with Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), he reiterated on Friday that there were no talks with anyone at present. He stressed, however, that a merger for FCA was  ultimately inevitable  to be able to compete, although it might not happen during his tenure.   The only way you’re going to get that is by mass, there is no other solution,  he said.  Being small, cute is going to do nothing. Go home, go to a beauty parlor and do something else.  Asked whether FCA felt the same investor pressure that led to the sacking of his counterpart at U.S. rival Ford (F.N) or that which prompted GM to leave Europe, Marchionne said the 2018 plan would be his judge.  As long as we deliver on those commitments, you will not get pressured ... people will love you,  he said.  What they do to you in 2019 is a different story.

The deal, which not only helps Amazon make deeper inroads into the grocery sector but also marks its big entry into the brick-and-mortar retail space, sent shock waves through the retail industry.  Implications ripple far beyond the food segment, where dominant players like Walmart ... and Target now have to look over their shoulders at the Amazon train coming down the tracks,  said Charlie O’Shea, retail analyst with Moody's. RBC Capital Markets said in a note the deal is surprising because the acquisition would be Amazon's largest to date by a factor of 10, and also because the online retailer has so far avoided having much of a physical presence. Amazon had established a tentative physical footprint with a small number of Amazon Book Stores. Shares of U.S., Canadian and European retailers and supermarket chains fell as investors fretted over the wide-reaching implications of the deal. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc were down 4.4 percent at $75.46 on Friday afternoon, while Target Corp shares were down 7.1 percent at $51.53. Supermarket chain Kroger Co was off 12.1 percent at $21.60, United Natural Foods Inc tumbled 8.6 percent to $36.35 and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc was down 5.8 percent at $21.13. The S&P; 1500 food and staples retailing index was off 4.3 percent. The fallout also spread to Europe. Shares of supermarket chain Tesco Plc were down 4.8 percent and Carrefour slipped 3.7 percent.  Amazon's got its tentacles everywhere and that's another place to go,  said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida.  Amazon sees that industry changing significantly – and they see that people don't necessarily go to the grocery store anymore.  Amazon shares were up 2.8 percent at $991.35 and Whole Foods shares were up 28.6 percent at $42.51 in afternoon trading. Canadian consumer staples stocks fell as much as 3.36 percent, their biggest fall since October 2008. Two of Canada’s largest grocery chain operators, Loblaw Companies Ltd and Metro Inc both fell more than 5.5 percent at one point. Packaged food companies were also damaged by the specter of healthier food that is less expensive targeting their customer base. Shares of Mondelez International Inc, the owner of Oreo cookies and the whole Nabisco brand, were down 1.1 percent while Kraft Heinz Co dropped 2.6 percent and Hershey Co was down 2.5 percent. Food distributors were also punished, with the S&P; 1500 sector index down 3.9 percent and Sysco Corp down 3.5 percent at $53.57.

While the negotiations are still fluid, lead underwriter Deutsche Bank has told some accounts to expect the revolver to remain as originally structured, rather than be made pari passu with the proposed $870 million term loan B, and an increase in the spread on the term loan to as much as 450bp over Libor, from initial guidance of 375bp-400bp over Libor, two of the sources said. The 1% floor and 99.5 original issue discount on the loan would not be changed.  Deutsche plans to officially roll out the new terms on Monday, one of the sources said. Commitments were initially due June 15.  The financing currently consists of a $150 million five-year first-out revolver, the $870 million seven-year term loan B, and a $280 million eight-year second-lien term loan. The second-lien tranche, which is guided at 800bp-825bp over Libor with a 1% floor and a 99 offering price, was oversubscribed as of earlier this week. Several potential first-lien lenders committed conditionally upon a pari passu revolver, or alternatively, higher pricing.   The existing structure is particularly problematic for Collateralized Loan Obligations, which make up a large portion of the existing lender base, because the vehicles place capacity restrictions on junior-lien debt. Effectively, the first-out revolver turns the first-lien into a second-lien.  Securus is marketing the deal at 4.7 times first-lien leverage, including an anticipated $20 million draw on the revolver at close, and 6.0 times total leverage, based on pro forma adjusted Ebitda of $191 million for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, including $10 million of synergies. That degree of leverage has been deemed by some investors as too high, in light of ongoing regulatory risk.  New sponsor Platinum Equity is contributing $487 million in fresh equity, while management is rolling over about $35 million, for roughly 31% of capitalization.  The revolver is rated BB/B1 by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively. The first- and second-lien tranches are rated B/B2 and CCC+/Caa2. The issuer is rated B/B3. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined to comment. Platinum Equity did not respond to requests for comment.

Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015, but a bitter row over his will, specifically what to do with the old family home, broke into full public view this week, prompting the eldest son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to issue a statement saying he was  disappointed  and  deeply saddened . Lee Kuan Yew moved into the five-bedroom house, formerly owned by a Jewish merchant, in 1945, as the Japanese Occupation ended and the island returned to British colonial rule.  Over the next decade 38 Oxley Road became a hub of political activity, and it was in the basement that the People's Action Party, which has led Singapore since independence, was conceived.  Four years before he died, LKY, as he was popularly known, said the bungalow should be demolished once he'd gone.  He said it lacked foundations, suffered from damp, had cracks in the walls and was costly to maintain.  But fortunately the pillars are sound,  he joked to the Singapore Straits Times. Related CoverageSingapore PM's sister-in-law changes job role amid family feudFeud within Singapore's first family leads to outpouring of concern on social mediaAccording to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's siblings, their older brother wants the house to be preserved as a symbol of modern Singapore's history. The prime minister said he had recused himself from all government decisions involving the house, but has raised questions over how his father's will was drawn up. The sister, 62-year-old Lee Wei Ling,  still lives in the bungalow, just a short walk from the city's main shopping district at Orchard Road. She and her brother, Lee Hsien Yang, insist it should be demolished in accordance with their late father's wishes, and have accused their elder brother of using  organs of the state  to intimidate them as the row, waged over social media and through the Singapore press, escalated this week. FILE PHOTO: Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong arrives at the Hangzhou Exhibition Center to participate in the G20 Summit, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, September 4, 2016.Etienne Oliveau/File PhotoTheir father, in the newspaper interview, had disdained the idea of tourists trickling through the tired, old house, with its retro furniture.  I've seen other houses, Nehru's, Shakespeare's. They become a shambles after a while. People trudge through,  Lee said. Not only that, he said the zoning regulations should be changed to let all owners on Oxley Road build higher than the current two-story limit to boost the value of the real estate. Private home prices in Singapore have risen 15 times compared to 1975, government data shows. The price of bungalows in the central region, like the Lees, have doubled in the last ten years, according to real estate services firm Cushman and Wakefield. Any demolition or redevelopment can happen only after the daughter moves out, so it could be years before any changes are made. As things stand, if the bungalow were to be knocked down, the property could only be redeveloped as a modern residential house, or a row of terrace houses, experts suggest. Estate agents estimated that the 12,060-square foot plot  was currently worth around S$24 million ($17 million).   You can't build 20 storeys on it, so that puts a cap on the land value,  said Ku Swee Yong, CEO of International Property Advisor Pte Ltd.  Depending on how you design the two-floor mixed-landed project the land value could be worth a little bit more, so let's say S$25 million.  Christine Li, director of research at Cushman, provided a similar valuation, but added that it could fetch more due to its  special address .  For instance, if it is sold through an auction, this address is likely to fetch a much higher value, just like how art does,” Li said.

The move comes amid an intensifying family feud over the will of the city-state's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, Lee Suet Fern's father-in-law, which has gripped the island this week.  Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said late on Thursday there were  deeply troubling circumstances  over how his father's will had been drawn up. The prime minister's younger brother and sister, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, said on Wednesday they had lost confidence in Lee Hsien Loong and feared that state organs would be used against them.  Lee Hsien Yang said he and his wife, Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and threatened.  The firm does not anticipate any material change in our Singapore team or practice,  Morgan Lewis said in a statement on Lee Suet Fern's role.  Suet-Fern Lee will continue to spend a significant amount of time in Singapore as well as travel to Hong Kong, as she already does in support of her strong client relationships there and as head of our International Leadership Team.  She sits on the board of Morgan Lewis, and the firm's international leadership team that she chairs oversees its non-U.S. offices. The prime minister on Thursday questioned the role his sister-in-law, Lee Suet Fern, may have played in his father's last will. He said that she  was involved in the preparation and/or signing of the Last Will  and that given her husband was a beneficiary this appeared to be a conflict of interest. The biggest issue has been over the future of the house that their father lived in for most of his life. Before Lee died in March 2015, he made it public that he wanted the home near the bustling Orchard Road shopping district to be demolished rather than turned into some kind of museum. But Lee Hsien Loong said in the six-page timeline that the fifth and sixth versions of the will had removed a clause about the demolition, and it was only reinserted in the final will, the seventh version. He questioned whether Lee Kuan Yew knew the clause had been re-inserted, saying there was no evidence that he did. Lee Hsien Yang said on social media his brother's allegations were false.  Hsien Loong raised no legal challenge to Lee Kuan Yew's will in the many months after it was read. Probate was granted in Oct 2015, so the will is full, final, and legally binding,  Lee Hsien Yang posted on Facebook.

The magazine report came a month after members of the billionaire Batista family, who control about 42 percent of JBS, signed a plea deal in a corruption probe in their native Brazil. Efforts to reach Mubadala's media office outside working hours were unsuccessful. The Batista family's investment holding company J&F; Investimentos SA, São Paulo-based JBS and Cargill did not have an immediate comment. Shares of JBS erased gains after the source denied the Exame report, falling 2 percent at 01:10 p.m. local time (1610 GMT). They rose as much as 5.9 percent to 7.16 reais earlier. Last month, the Batistas agreed to pay a record-setting fine of 10.3 billion reais ($3.1 billion) related to corruption and bribery allegations. Shares of JBS have shed 29 percent since May 16, when brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista admitted in separate plea deals to bribing over 1,800 politicians. Part of the testimonies in the plea deal implicated President Michel Temer, who Joesley Batista accused of working to obstruct a major corruption probe. Temer denies the accusations. State loans helped fuel growth at J&F; over the past decade, enabling it to keep control of JBS while expanding into fashion, dairy production, pulp processing and banking. JBS grew from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwest into one of the world's top-three food processing companies in over a decade through acquisitions backed in part by government funds.

The move comes amid an intensifying family feud over the will of the city-state's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, Lee Suet Fern's father-in-law, which has gripped the island this week. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said late on Thursday there were  deeply troubling circumstances  over how his father's will had been drawn up. The prime minister's younger brother and sister, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, said on Wednesday they had lost confidence in Lee Hsien Loong and feared that state organs would be used against them. Lee Hsien Yang said he and his wife, Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and threatened.  The firm does not anticipate any material change in our Singapore team or practice,  Morgan Lewis said in a statement on Lee Suet Fern's role.  Suet-Fern Lee will continue to spend a significant amount of time in Singapore as well as travel to Hong Kong, as she already does in support of her strong client relationships there and as head of our International Leadership Team.  She sits on the board of Morgan Lewis, and the firm's international leadership team that she chairs oversees its non-U.S. offices. The prime minister on Thursday questioned the role his sister-in-law, Lee Suet Fern, may have played in his father's last will. He said that she  was involved in the preparation and/or signing of the Last Will  and that given her husband was a beneficiary this appeared to be a conflict of interest. The biggest issue has been over the future of the house that their father lived in for most of his life. Before Lee died in March 2015, he made it public that he wanted the home near the bustling Orchard Road shopping district to be demolished rather than turned into some kind of museum. But Lee Hsien Loong said in the six-page timeline that the fifth and sixth versions of the will had removed a clause about the demolition, and it was only reinserted in the final will, the seventh version. He questioned whether Lee Kuan Yew knew the clause had been re-inserted, saying there was no evidence that he did. Lee Hsien Yang said on social media his brother's allegations were false.  Hsien Loong raised no legal challenge to Lee Kuan Yew's will in the many months after it was read. Probate was granted in Oct 2015, so the will is full, final, and legally binding,  Lee Hsien Yang posted on Facebook.

Not getting enough sleep can disrupt hormones and metabolism and is known to increase the risk of obesity, researchers write in the journal Sleep. “Short sleep, usually causing sleep debt, is common and inevitable in many cases, and is a risk factor for obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease, as well as mortality,” lead author Dr. Chang-Ho Yun of the Seoul National University Budang Hospital told Reuters Health by email. Sleeping in may be better than napping, as the sleep may be deeper and follows the body’s sleep-wake rhythms more closely, Yun said. To determine how weekend sleep is related to body weight, the researchers used data from a nationwide survey of more than 2,000 people who ranged in age from 19 to 82 years old.  In face-to-face interviews, researchers asked participants about their height and weight, weekday and weekend sleep habits, mood and medical conditions. The study team used this information to determine body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, and whether participants engaged in catch-up sleep on weekends. Weekend catch-up sleep was defined as sleeping more hours on weekend nights compared to weekday nights. On average, the participants slept 7.3 hours per night and had BMIs of 23, which falls in the healthy range. About 43 percent of people slept longer on weekends by nearly two hours than they did on weekdays. People who slept-in on weekends tended to sleep shorter hours during weekdays, but slept more hours overall across the week. The researchers’ analysis found that those who slept-in on weekends had average BMIs of 22.8 while those who didn’t engage in catch-up sleep averaged 23.1, which was a small but statistically meaningful difference. In addition, the more catch up sleep a person got, the lower their BMI tended to be, with each additional hour linked to a 0.12 decrease in BMI. “Short sleepers tend to eat more meals per day, snack more, engage in more screen time and may be less likely to move due to increased sensations of fatigue when not rested,” said Jean-Philippe Chaput of the University of Ottawa in Canada, who wasn’t involved in the study. Chaput noted that getting 30 minutes of heart-pumping exercise per day can help improve sleep.  “Sleep experts say that if people need an alarm clock to wake up it is a sign that they don’t sleep enough,” Chaput said by email. “The more good behaviors we can have every day (and sustain for the rest of our lives) the better it is for the prevention of chronic diseases and optimizing health. Sleep should be one of these priorities,” he said. “If you cannot sleep sufficiently on workdays because of work or social obligations, try to sleep as much as possible on the weekend. It might alleviate the risk for obesity.” “Weekend sleep extension could be a quick fix to compensate sleep loss over the week but is not an ultimate solution for chronic sleep loss,” Yun cautioned. “If average sleep duration over the week is far below the optimal amount even with weekend sleep extension, the benefits would likely dissipate,” Yun said.

The victim was Dominga Bautista Lora, 35, whose body parts were found on Monday in a bag dumped in a ravine in the province of Sanchez Ramirez. Her suspected killer has been arrested, according to local press reports.  The wave of femicides - the killing of a woman by a man because of her gender - in the Caribbean nation is  terrifying , said Janet Camilo, the country's minister for women. So far this year, 43 women have been killed in gender-based killings and six femicides have been reported this month alone, according to latest police figures, Camilo said.  We can't continue to protect these terrifying figures under the mantle of silence, a silence that makes us accomplices of humiliation, harassment, beatings and murders,  Camilo told reporters this week.  I ask myself, what kind of society are we becoming.  Femicide largely stems from the Dominican Republic's 'macho' culture, which tends to blame women for the violence inflicted on them and to condone it, campaigners say. Victims of femicide usually have a history of suffering domestic violence and killers are often the victims' current or former partners, sometimes motivated by jealously or because a woman has refused to go back with an ex-boyfriend, activists say. Latin America has the highest femicide rates in the world, according to U.N. Women.  The Dominican Republic, along with 15 other countries in Latin America, have passed laws in recent years that define and punish femicide as a specific crime. Earlier this month police reported another victim of femicide - Maria Cesarina Melo. She was strangled to death by a rope at the hands of her partner, who then committed suicide.  What we have been seeing in recent years is shocking figures in the Dominican Republic in terms of violence against women and girls, including femicide, and the lack of appropriate response from the authorities,  Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner at rights group Amnesty International, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Whole Foods' shares rose as much as 28 percent to $42.35, after Amazon said it would buy the company in a deal valued at about $13.7 billion, including debt. Short-sellers aim to make a profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. Friday's spike in Whole Foods Markets' shares cost them $251 million, more than doubling their year-to-date losses to $404 million, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners showed.  Shorts are basically taking it on the chin. They weren’t having a good year, and now their year has gotten decidedly worse,  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners. Whole Foods is the most heavily shorted name in the food retail space, with short interest of 28.1 million shares, or $1.2 billion, nearly as much as Kroger Co, Casey's General Stores Inc and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc combined, according to S3 Partners.     Shorts started raising bearish bets against Whole Foods after December, around the time Amazon opened its online grocery store in a challenge to supermarkets. By mid-April, short interest grew by two-thirds to a high of $1.4 billion.   I think short-investors thought Whole Foods would just be a casualty of Amazon's food retail expansion and then be bought on the cheap,  said Dusaniwsky. Short-sellers may have been hoping to make money as Whole Foods shares fell due to increased competition from Amazon and then snap up the grocery store's shares on the cheap as they waited for a buyer to emerge, Dusaniwsky said.  I don’t think the shorts thought Amazon would go brick-and-mortar.  In early April, JANA Partners, an activist hedge fund led by Barry Rosenstein, disclosed a nearly 9 percent stake in Whole Foods. One of the hedge fund’s suggestions was that the grocery store could put itself up for sale. The hedge fund held 26.1 million shares as of May 27.

Drillers added six oil rigs in the week to June 16, bringing the total count up to 747, the most since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday.  That compares with 337 rigs in the same week a year ago. The pace of those additions, however, has slowed over the past two months with the decline in crude prices. U.S. crude futures were trading near a seven-month low at around $44.70 a barrel on Friday, putting the front-month on track to decline for a fourth consecutive week, on widespread evidence of a fuel glut despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to tighten the market. [O/R] After agreeing in December to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January to June, OPEC and other producers on May 25 agreed to extend those cuts to the end of the first quarter. Growth in oil supply next year is expected to outpace an anticipated pick-up in demand that will push global consumption above 100 million bpd for the first time, the International Energy Agency said this week. The failure of those OPEC-led cuts to tighten the market and keep prices higher, however, has led shale drillers to reduce their hedges, leaving them vulnerable to falling oil prices. At the same time, prominent hedge funds said they have reduced the size of their positions in shale firms in the Permian, the largest oilfield in the United States.     U.S. shale oil production is expected to rise for a seventh consecutive month in July, according to a forecast this week from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Daily oil output in North Dakota, meanwhile, rose 2 percent in April. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading around $45 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching about $47 a barrel. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the total oil and gas rig count would average 883 in 2017, 1,101 in 2018 and 1,212 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas. That compares with an average of 809 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 forecast would be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes.

Beznau 1, which began producing electricity in 1969, has been offline since March 2015 because of maintenance issues. Last November Axpo submitted documents to ENSI seeking clearance for the reactor to be restarted this spring, but on Friday it said that ENSI has asked for supplementary reports and material tests, pushing back the restart target date to Oct. 31 at the earliest. The utility added that there is limited availability of external expertise over the summer to comply with ENSI's requests.  Axpo remains convinced that no safety-technical reservations exist for the continued operation of the plant,  the company said in a statement, adding that it expects that to be confirmed by the supervisory authority in due course.

Drillers added six oil rigs in the week to June 16, bringing the total count up to 747, the most since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday.  That compares with 337 rigs in the same week a year ago. The pace of those additions, however, has slowed over the past two months with the decline in crude prices. U.S. crude futures were trading near a seven-month low at around $44.70 a barrel on Friday, putting the front-month on track to decline for a fourth consecutive week, on widespread evidence of a fuel glut despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to tighten the market. [O/R] After agreeing in December to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January to June, OPEC and other producers on May 25 agreed to extend those cuts to the end of the first quarter. Growth in oil supply next year is expected to outpace an anticipated pick-up in demand that will push global consumption above 100 million bpd for the first time, the International Energy Agency said this week. The failure of those OPEC-led cuts to tighten the market and keep prices higher, however, has led shale drillers to reduce their hedges, leaving them vulnerable to falling oil prices. At the same time, prominent hedge funds said they have reduced the size of their positions in shale firms in the Permian, the largest oilfield in the United States.     U.S. shale oil production is expected to rise for a seventh consecutive month in July, according to a forecast this week from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Daily oil output in North Dakota, meanwhile, rose 2 percent in April. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading around $45 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching about $47 a barrel. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the total oil and gas rig count would average 883 in 2017, 1,101 in 2018 and 1,212 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas. That compares with an average of 809 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 forecast would be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes.

Whole Foods' shares rose as much as 28 percent to $42.35, after Amazon said it would buy the company in a deal valued at about $13.7 billion, including debt. Short-sellers aim to make a profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. Friday's spike in Whole Foods Markets' shares cost them $251 million, more than doubling their year-to-date losses to $404 million, data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners showed.  Shorts are basically taking it on the chin. They weren’t having a good year, and now their year has gotten decidedly worse,  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners. Whole Foods is the most heavily shorted name in the food retail space, with short interest of 28.1 million shares, or $1.2 billion, nearly as much as Kroger Co, Casey's General Stores Inc and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc combined, according to S3 Partners. Shorts started raising bearish bets against Whole Foods after December, around the time Amazon opened its online grocery store in a challenge to supermarkets. By mid-April, short interest grew by two-thirds to a high of $1.4 billion.  I think short-investors thought Whole Foods would just be a casualty of Amazon's food retail expansion and then be bought on the cheap,  said Dusaniwsky. Short-sellers may have been hoping to make money as Whole Foods shares fell due to increased competition from Amazon and then snap up the grocery store's shares on the cheap as they waited for a buyer to emerge, Dusaniwsky said.  I don’t think the shorts thought Amazon would go brick-and-mortar.  In early April, JANA Partners, an activist hedge fund led by Barry Rosenstein, disclosed a nearly 9 percent stake in Whole Foods. One of the hedge fund’s suggestions was that the grocery store could put itself up for sale. The hedge fund held 26.1 million shares as of May 27.

I've tried to use all the words I can think of to describe him,  manager Dave Roberts said. 3B Justin Turner, who got a semi-day off by serving as the designated hitter Thursday, singled in his final at-bat, in the ninth inning, to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. During his streak, Turner is batting .450 (18-for-40). LHP Alex Wood will start Friday in Cincinnati. In four career appearances against the Reds, Wood is 2-0 with a 2.95 ERA. RHP Ross Stripling was optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City. He's 0-3 with a 4.00 ERA in 21 appearances (36 innings) this season. 1B Adrian Gonzalez, who was placed on the disabled list June 13, received a second opinion on his back condition, which confirmed the original diagnosis, a herniated disc. There is no timetable for his return. LHP Rich Hill's inability to pitch deep into games is starting to become a concern. In his loss to Cleveland on Thursday, Hill threw 105 pitches but only made it through four innings, giving up seven runs and eight hits. It was Hill's eighth start of the season and he has not pitched more than five innings in any of them.  I just didn't pitch well. It's no fun not helping the team. I've got to get better results the next time,  Hill said. Manager Dave Roberts said,  Even when his stuff is good it seems like he has to work harder than he should. He can't get through five (innings) and we're counting on him for depth. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-dodgers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6GNGLP0H"},

He allowed five hits in the first inning, but a baserunning gaffe by St. Louis kept the damage down to two runs. Davies, whose ERA rose to 4.91 after this outing, will have to cut down the traffic on the bases and start hitting spots or he lose find his rotation spot. RHP Rob Scahill was assigned to Triple-A Colorado Springs on Thursday. Scahill, who was designated for assignment Tuesday, was 1-2 with a 3.57 ERA in 13 appearances for the Brewers this year. Scahill figures to be back with the team at some point, even if he has to wait until September when roster expand to 40 men, because of their difficulties in the bullpen. CF Keon Broxton unloaded the longest homer in Busch Stadium III history Thursday night with a 489-foot rocket about 15 rows to the bleachers in deep left-center. Broxton continues to punish Cardinals pitching as he's 13-of-30 in nine games with three homers and seven RBIs. The homer was his ninth of the year, matching his previous career high set last year. OF Ryan Braun (left calf strain) fielded fly balls during batting practice Thursday, but there remains no timetable for his return from the injury that landed him on the 10-day disabled list May 26. Braun was batting .262 with seven homers and 19 RBI in 30 games when he went on the shelf. With Milwaukee continuing to occupy first place in the NL Central, its fans are understandably eager for Braun to come back.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-brewers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6GNGLP0F"},

Brebbia also worked a 1-2-3 sixth inning and has permitted only two runs in his first 8 2/3 MLB innings. The former Yankee farmhand has displayed a nice sinker and poise in his brief big league exposure. 2B Paul DeJong was called up from Triple-A Memphis on Thursday and placed into the lineup, batting eighth and going 1-for-4. DeJong had his first stint in the majors from May 28-June 11, homering on the first swing as a big leaguer in Colorado. In 12 games, he batting .244 with four RBI while doing a credible job defensively, although he has fanned 15 times with no walks in 45 at-bats. 2B Kolten Wong (right triceps strain) is back on the 10-day disabled list for the second time in less than a month. Wong injured himself in Wednesday night's 7-6 loss to Milwaukee on a checked swing and was unable to throw the ball with any zip when removed from the game before the sixth inning.

RHP Michael Wacha failed to make it through the fifth inning for the fourth time in five starts and was no-decisioned. Wacha gave up seven hits and four runs in four-plus innings, issuing three walks and fanning five. The inability to finish off hitters was his big problem in this one as he threw 89 pitches to get only 12 outs. Wacha's next start is Wednesday night in Philadelphia. RHP Carlos Martinez gets the call Friday night when St. Louis opens a six-game road trip with the first of a three-game series in Baltimore. Martinez is coming off the first complete game of his career, a 7-0 shutout Saturday over Philadelphia in which he yielded only four hits and fanned 11.

Avila has played more games (43 to 36, although some have come at first base). Friday night he singled and walked in five trips to the plate. His single preceded 1B Miguel Cabrera's game-winning two-run home run.  Alex has had good at-bats all year,  manager Brad Ausmus said.  He's been one of our most consistent hitters. There might have been a little extra incentive because he and (losing RHP Tommy) Hunter were roommates in college. I'm sure Alex's full concentration was there.  1B Miguel Cabrera may not be a horse all the time these days, but he's not a dead horse either. Without a home run since May 20, Cabrera ended a 22-game drought with a walkoff two-run home run in the ninth Friday night that gave Detroit a 5-3 win over Tampa Bay. It was his sixth home run of the season and seventh career walkoff blast. The lack of home runs contributed to Cabrera driving in just 12 runs in those 22 games, but he still had a .316 batting average (25x79) with 10 doubles in that time. DH Victor Martinez left for a pinch-runner with two outs in the seventh inning Friday night, an inning or two earlier than manager Brad Ausmus normally runs for him in a close game.  He just wasn't feeling well,  Ausmus said.  In the middle of the game he started getting kind of cold sweats and dizzy and his heart started racing. It got to a point there where he felt he couldn't go any longer. That was the reason (he was taken out). It wasn't his legs or anything like that.  RHP Francisco Rodriguez has now given up seven home runs in 22 2/3 innings this season after yielding a solo blast to Steven Souza Jr. in the eighth inning of Detroit's Friday night 5-3 win over Tampa Bay. He continues to get backing from manager Brad Ausmus -- because Detroit needs him.  For us to win, we're going to need that third guy in that seventh- and eighth-inning role,  Ausmus said.  Because you can't consistently throw the same two guys (RHPs Shane Greene and Alex Wilson) out there night after night. They'll be done. Any hopes of making the playoffs will disappear in the last month and a half of the season because they won't be able to pitch. We need him to pitch well. He's got experience pitching in late innings in high leverage. This wasn't perfect. But we still need him.  RHP Justin Verlander pitched seven full innings Friday night, equalling his longest outings of the season. Pitch count and an inordinate number of foul balls are Verlander's latest issues. He worked on backing off on his slider a couple miles per hour, sacrificing some speed for greater depth.  It maybe was getting too much like my fastball (in mph),  Verlander said. He walked five but a couple of those were precautionary, pitching around one batter to get to another. He struck out six and gave up six hits and two runs.

Having recently had a stretch of their schedule in which they had three off days in the span of eight days, the Indians were able to get by with four starters, so Clevinger was sent to Columbus to start a game. DH Edwin Encarnacion has put his slow start behind him. Encarnacion belted a two-run homer in the second inning on Thursday, his 13th homer of the year. After hitting five home runs in his first 37 games, Encarnacion has hit eight homers in his last 24 games, batting .341 (29-for-85) in that stretch, with four doubles and 16 RBIs.

He's taking a lot of good swings,  manager Terry Francona said.  It's nice to get him going. We've got a lot of baseball coming up and him being hot is going to help.  RHP Josh Tomlin's streak of consecutive innings without a walk was snapped at 29 2/3 innings when he walked OF Chris Taylor leading off the game.  Give him credit. He laid off four pretty good pitches,  Tomlin said. It was Tomlin's first walk since May 12. On Thursday, he had two walks, snapping his franchise-record streak of 12 consecutive starts with one or no walks. Tomlin came into Thursday's game leading the majors with .5 walks per nine innings. OF Lonnie Chisenhall, a left-handed hitter, doesn't start against left-handed pitchers, but he's always available to pinch hit, a role in which he is flourishing. In the fifth inning Thursday, with the Indians clinging to a 5-4 lead, Chisenhall delivered a three-run, pinch-hit homer. Chisenhall, whose other pinch-hit homer this year was a grand slam on April 14, is batting .273 as a pinch hitter. He leads the American League in pinch-hit home runs (2) and RBIs (7).  The only way to learn how to do it is to do it a lot,  Chisenhall said.  For me, the key to pinch hitting is to embrace it. It's an adrenaline rush going up there, because it's usually at crunch time, so you try to take some hacks to help the team out.  OF Michael Brantley was not with the team Thursday. He was with his wife Melissa, who is about to give birth to the couple's fourth child.

Kohl died on Friday morning at his home in Ludwigshafen, according to German media. He was 87.     A bear of a man whose provincial accent and unvarnished folksy style led opponents to underestimate him in his early years, Kohl was a passionate advocate of European integration whose outlook was shaped by the two world wars that ravaged Europe and claimed the lives of his brother and uncle.     Together with French President Francois Mitterrand, the enigmatic socialist with whom he developed an unlikely personal bond, Kohl helped steer a peaceful course for the continent during the twilight years of the Soviet Union, when the foundations of Europe's post-war order crumbled and had to be reset.      By committing to anchor Germany within Europe under a common currency, he overcame resistance to reunification from Mitterrand, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister who feared the return of a powerful, united Germany.     In a 2012 tribute, former U.S. President Bill Clinton described Kohl as one of post-war Europe's defining statesmen.  His vision helped to usher the global community into the 21st century, to build bold and lasting relationships that endure to this day,  Clinton said.     For all his accomplishments as chancellor, Kohl's life was tinged by controversy and personal tragedy after he left office in 1998 as Germany's longest-serving leader since Bismarck. In 2000, he was forced to resign as honorary chairman of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the party he had led for 25 years, after admitting to receiving $1 million in illegal cash donations during his time as chancellor, which he doled out to local party organizations at his whim.      He refused to reveal where the money had come from, saying he had given the donors his  Ehrenwort , or word of honor, not to disclose their names. The scandal made him a virtual pariah in his own party for years.  Angela Merkel, the shy physicist from communist East Germany whom Kohl had plucked from obscurity to join his cabinet after the November 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, turned on him at a crucial moment during the scandal, ensuring his exile. Ties between the two had been frosty ever since. A year after he was dropped by the CDU, Kohl's first wife Hannelore, who suffered from a debilitating allergy to light, committed suicide. Shaped by War     Kohl was born on April 3, 1930, the youngest of three children, in Ludwigshafen on the Rhine, a center for the chemicals industry and one of the German cities most bombed during World War Two.     His father Johann, who worked in the local tax office, fought in both world wars. Returning from the front in Poland in 1940, he told his children:  If we ever get paid back for what we did there, we will never have anything to laugh about again.      Kohl's parents are described in Hans-Peter Schwarz's 2012 biography as skeptical of the Nazis in the early years of the regime and quiet critics later on. As practicing Catholics, they opposed Adolf Hitler's rejection of religion and persecution of minorities.     World War Two cast a dark shadow over Kohl’s youth. He recalled the death of his older brother Walter, killed in an aerial attack in Normandy in 1944, as a  life-changing experience  that shook the family.     Walter had been named after an uncle who died in World War One. Years later, when Kohl decided to give his first son the same name, his mother asked whether he wasn't tempting fate.      Mother, I promise you that he will not die in a war between European states,  Kohl recalled telling her. He often described his push for a united Europe as his way of delivering on this pledge.     Just 15 when the war ended, Kohl was drafted into the army and served briefly in a military training camp near Berchtesgaden but never saw combat. He returned to devastated Ludwigshafen and began history and law studies. In 1959 he was elected to the regional assembly in Rhineland-Palatinate and a decade later, at the age of 39, he became premier of the state.     In 1973, Kohl was elected chairman of the CDU, Germany's largest conservative party, and, after narrowly losing in his first attempt in 1976, he became chancellor of West Germany in 1982 when the ruling coalition of Social Democrats (SPD) and Free Democrats (FDP) under Helmut Schmidt collapsed.     At first, Kohl was ridiculed as a country bumpkin lacking the sophistication of predecessors such as Schmidt and Willy Brandt. Cartoonists depicted him as a giant pear, giving rise to his nickname  Birne . But Kohl soon showed himself to be a skillful tactician.     Defying the leftist German peace movement, he and his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, backed the deployment of U.S. intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Germany, winning friends in Washington. Kohl became known for wearing his opponents down by ignoring them, a strategy known in German as  aussitzen , which has been mimicked by Merkel since she became chancellor in 2005. Finest Hour     Kohl's finest hour came in the months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when he was able to overcome the hostility of Western allies to unify the communist east and capitalist west. FILE PHOTO -  Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sits in front of a large photograph of himself during a news conference to promote his new book  Erinnerungen 1982-1990  (Memories 1982-1990) in Berlin November 2, 2005.Tobias Schwarz/File PhotoThe breaching of the Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, caught the West German political establishment and the rest of the world off-guard.     Kohl was getting ready to sit down for a banquet dinner in Warsaw when he was alerted to the dramatic events by his office in Bonn. He flew to Berlin the next day and, sensing the euphoria at home, soon began work on a 10-point plan for German unification that he presented to the Bundestag on Nov. 28. The speech, typed by his wife Hannelore on a typewriter at home to prevent leaks to the media, came as a total surprise to Germany’s allies. U.S. President George H.W. Bush was supportive, but European partners seethed.      Your friend Kohl, your partner, is a hick from the countryside!  fumed Gorbachev in a private meeting with Mitterrand in Kiev a week later.     Thatcher was also furious.  Kohl is capable of anything,  she told France's ambassador to Britain.     Like the British leader, Mitterrand, a former prisoner of war under the Nazis, was worried about how far German ambitions might go.  Five years earlier in 1984, the French president had linked hands with Kohl on the battlefield near Verdun where Kohl's uncle had died in the First World War and Mitterrand had been taken prisoner in the Second, creating an iconic image of European reconciliation reprinted in countless history books. German reunification was another matter. For decades, French policy had been guided by Nobel prize-winning author Francois Mauriac's adage: “I love Germany so much I'm glad there are two of them.” Slideshow (5 Images)Nevertheless, Kohl was able to win over Mitterrand.     At a summit in Strasbourg a month after the Wall fell, described by Kohl as the most  tense and unfriendly  he had ever attended, he agreed to start serious negotiations on European monetary union, setting the stage for the creation of the euro. Kohl's commitment to anchor a united Germany within Europe, and his pledge months later to accept the Oder-Neisse line, the German-Polish border set after World War Two, ensured French support for unification. To convince Gorbachev, Kohl pledged billions of marks to pay for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Germany and the costs of resettling them at home.  Throughout 1989 and 1990, Helmut Kohl showed uncommon vision and courage when he seized on the fall of the Berlin Wall to work for German unification,  Bush said decades later.  Flourishing Landscapes      The fall of the Berlin Wall and the march toward unification were a political boon for Kohl, whose popularity had been slumping, forcing him to fight off a putsch attempt by CDU rivals in early 1989.     Ignoring warnings from the German Bundesbank, he rammed through a 1-to-1 conversion rate of east German wages and pensions into west German marks, and easily won re-election in 1990 as “the chancellor of unity”.  Kohl promised east Germans  flourishing landscapes  but the  Aufschwung Ost  - or eastern economic recovery - proved far slower and more painful than he had imagined. The conversion rate increased unemployment in the East, pushed up inflation in the West, and led to higher interest rates across Europe as Germany borrowed massively to finance reconstruction. The economic hangover from unification and policy inertia in the decade that followed had, by the end of the millennium, turned Germany into the  sick man of Europe . Kohl tried to win a fifth term in 1998 instead of making way for his groomed successor Wolfgang Schaeuble, who polls suggested had a better chance. He lost the election to Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, who was forced to introduce far-reaching reforms in response to Germany's economic woes. A year later, the party funding scandal erupted and Kohl was pushed out as honorary chairman of the CDU. His wife’s suicide the following year exposed him to accusations of neglect, including from his eldest son Walter, who later wrote a tell-all book about the family. Kohl suffered a bad fall in 2008 and from then on was confined to a wheelchair, and had trouble speaking. He rarely appeared in public and his second wife, Maike Kohl-Richter, was criticized in the German media for zealously shielding him from his sons and old friends.     Kohl's biggest achievement, German reunification, looks more of a success today than it did in its first decades. Eastern Germany still lags behind the west in many economic measures, but the gap is narrowing and cities such as Leipzig and Dresden are thriving. Twenty-seven years after east and west merged, Germany is prosperous and increasingly influential on the international stage.     Kohl's other landmark accomplishment, pushing through the euro despite widespread public reservations, was hailed as a triumph in the currency's first decade, but now looks less glorious after years of crisis.     Some in Germany now blame Kohl for pursuing the euro without insisting first on closer political and fiscal integration – a decision Merkel has denounced publicly as an epic mistake.     In his 2014 book  Out of Concern for Europe , Kohl blamed the single currency bloc's woes on Schroeder's decision to let Greece into the euro zone and his watering-down of EU budget rules.     In an appearance at the German Historical Museum in Berlin in 2012 to mark 30 years since he became chancellor, Kohl reminded his audience of why he had championed European unity and urged EU leaders to continue on the path of closer integration despite the crisis of the euro.      Europe can never sink into war again,  he said.  We need to press ahead with the unification of Europe. Let's make good use of the time we have.

Ecuador has been increasing its profile as a country open to foreign mining and has shifted its resource focus from oil and gas as its reserves dwindle and oil prices stagnate, analysts say. The world's biggest miner BHP  rated SolGold's mineral exploration prospects sufficiently highly to seek a deal but SolGold rebuffed it in favour of an agreement with Australian gold miner Newcrest Mining. According to a share placement announced on Friday, Newcrest will pay a further $40 million to increase the size of its stake to 14.54 percent as part of a placing to raise a total of $41.2 million. That adds to last October's agreement that Newcrest would spend $22.86 million buying new shares equivalent to 10 percent of SolGold, while private investment firm Maxit got 4.43 percent of the company for $10.1 million. CEO Nick Mather said the new placement at a 15.5 percent premium to Thursday's closing price and a discount to SolGold's peak share price of 46.75 pence in May this year was a vote of confidence. The share price rose nearly 10 percent on Friday and has climbed more than 64 percent this year. Mather said Ecuador was underexplored, especially compared with Chile, the world's biggest copper producer, where miners have been complaining about dwindling ore quality and rising costs. Abundant reserves of gold found in association with copper add to the appeal of mining in a more northerly country.  The great thing about the North Andean copper belt is it gets increasingly gold-rich,  Mather said.  The copper miners will say the gold will pay for the cost of producing copper and the gold miners will look at it vice versa.  SolGold's flagship project in Ecuador is named Cascabel and exploration so far implies it is a major new high-grade copper and gold find to rival some of the largest existing mines, such as Grasberg in Indonesia, controlled by Freeport McMoran Inc , and Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, controlled by Rio Tinto . With a market capitalisation of more than 500 million pounds ($639 million) on AIM, London's market for growing companies, SolGold is seeking to move to a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange. It is also seeking a listing in Toronto, which will be considered by the Toronto Stock Exchange on June 21.

The filings lodged at the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday did not identify Prime Minister Najib Razak or his wife Rosmah Mansor by name, but said the jewelry purchases were for the wife of  Malaysian Official 1.  Malaysian and U.S. government sources have previously confirmed that  Malaysian Official 1  refers to Najib. The diamond necklace set alone cost $27.3 million, according to the latest filings in a lawsuit that was launched last July. The accusations will provide further ammunition for Najib's political rivals, who often criticize his wife for lavish spending, and come at an awkward time for the Malaysian leader, as he had been expected to call a snap election later this year. Rosmah's aide did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The prime minister's office, in a statement early on Friday, said it was  concerned by the unnecessary and gratuitous naming of certain matters and individuals that are only relevant to domestic political manipulation and interference.   Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing.  A total of $4.5 billion have been misappropriated from 1MDB, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. The fund was set up by Najib in 2009 to promote economic development. The department is seeking to seize a total of about $1.7 billion in assets that were bought with misappropriated funds, including a Picasso painting that was given to actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the rights to two Hollywood films.  This money financed the lavish lifestyles of the alleged co-conspirators at the expense and detriment of the Malaysian people,  acting U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco said in a statement. The jewelry purchases were arranged by Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, who was also accused of gifting DiCaprio the $3.2 million Picasso. A spokesman for DiCaprio on Thursday said that the actor had  begun proceedings to transfer ownership of the Picasso to the U.S. government, having in July 2016  initiated the return  of gifts he had received from financiers connected to the 1MDB case. Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, could not be reached for comment. In an emailed statement through a representative, Low said the Justice Department's actions were  a further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case.   The U.S. Department of Justice's latest move continues its inappropriate efforts to seize assets despite not having proven that any improprieties have occurred,  the statement read. Rasky Partners, a public relations firm that emailed his statement, could not be immediately reached by phone. Najib's Bank Account  The lawsuits show the jewelry for Rosmah was bought with funds that passed through Najib's account. The jewelry, like the Picasso painting, was purchased with funds traceable to diverted proceeds from a 2013 bond offering by 1MDB, according to the filings. The diamond necklace was bought in 2013, just months after $680 million was transferred to the private bank account of Najib in Kuala Lumpur, the filings show. The Malaysian government says that money came from a member of the Saudi royal family. The necklace was purchased from New York jeweler Lorraine Schwartz, who has designed for Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Lopez and other stars of the entertainment world.  Need a 18 carrot (carat) pink heart diamond vivid or slightly short of vivid. On diamond necklace urgent,  Low said in a text message to Schwartz in June 2013, the filings said. A month later Schwartz showed the necklace in Monaco to a group of people, including Rosmah, onboard Topaz, one of the largest private yachts in the world.  Low had chartered the 147-meter yacht for seven days in early July 2013, according to the filings. Rosmah and Low again met with Schwartz at a U.S. hotel in September that year, when Najib was in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.     The necklace was eventually delivered to an unnamed friend of Rosmah's in 2014 in Hong Kong, who then handed it over to Rosmah in Kuala Lumpur, the filings said.     Low also arranged for the purchase of 27 pieces of jewelry – worth a total of $1.3 million – for Rosmah in 2014. The lawsuits also describe how Low spent about $9 million in 2014 buying jewelry for Australian model Miranda Kerr.      Low bought a necklace with a 11.72 carat heart-shaped diamond for $1.29 million, with Kerr's initials  MK  inscribed on the back. The necklace was given to Kerr as a Valentine's Day gift, according to the lawsuit.     Later that same year, Low bought a 8.88-carat pink heart diamond pendant worth $4.8 million, also as a gift for Kerr.  Representatives for Kerr, who married Snapchat cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel late last month, had no comment.

Fortress and Elliott were negotiating to buy some of the 26 billion euros ($29 billion) in bonds that Monte dei Paschi, Italy's fourth largest bank and the world's oldest, must sell to private investors as a condition of the bailout. Fortress and Elliott had backed out of the talks in a dispute over sale terms, said three sources familiar with the matter. The loans have a face value of 26 billion euros but the bank, brought low by years of poor lending and mismanagement, is looking to sell them for around a fifth of that. The funds' withdrawal not only threatens the government's efforts to save Monte dei Paschi, it could also complicate a separate and already-shaky plan by Rome to bail out two smaller troubled lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. Italy's banking shares fell on the news of the funds' withdrawal, with the sector index hitting a session low, down 1.7 percent. It closed down 0.5 percent. If Fortress and Elliott do not come back to the negotiating table, Monte dei Paschi and the two regional banks have only one willing investor to turn to: Italian banking industry bailout fund Atlante, set up a year ago with Rome's backing. Atlante is considering whether to press on as sole buyer of Monte dei Paschi's bad loans, the sources said. It has 1.7 billion euros in cash but has already committed to use 450 million euros to buy bad loans of the Veneto-based banks. Atlante declined to comment. Italy is scrambling to find private investors to help fund its 6.4 billion euros plan to bail out the two smaller regional lenders by the end of this month to avert them being wound down. Rome is even considering suspending a bond payment due by Veneto Banca on June 21, in order to prevent the plan being held hostage by a potential legal dispute. If Veneto Banca makes the payment, it could anger other bondholders who risk large losses under bailout rules. But if the bank does not pay back the bond, it could trigger a default. This month, the European Commission gave Italy a preliminary green light to bail out Monte dei Paschi, which needs to fill a capital shortfall of 8.8 billion euros. But the bank first needs a binding commitment from private buyers to take the 26 billion euros in bad loans off its balance sheet, sources have said. The European Central Bank  wants a binding commitment, they want visibility on the price in order to know what the loss will be for Monte dei Paschi,  one of the sources said. Monte dei Paschi had previously said it was in exclusive talks with Atlante and other investors to reach an accord by June 28. The bank will continue to negotiate with Atlante, having deemed the conditions set by the Elliott and Fortress as  unacceptable,  another source said.

Amazon shares were up 3.2 percent at $995.18, while Whole Foods surged 27 percent to $41.95.

The virtual currency relies on  mining  computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins. Bitcoin fell as low as $2,120 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp on Thursday and was last down 6 percent at $2,290. On the week, the currency has fallen about 22 percent, on track for its largest weekly slide since December 2013. On Monday, bitcoin hit a record just shy of $3,000. So far this year, bitcoin remains up 137 percent. Sharp losses such as Thursday's are par for the course for an asset like bitcoin, analysts said. Over the course of its eight-year history, Bitcoin has on a daily basis risen as much as 18 percent and fallen as much as 13 percent.

Jafari was  wary of a near-term top ahead of $3,134, adding that investors should consider re-establishing bullish exposure between $2,330 and no lower than $1,915.  Analysts also said investors were spooked by Chinese miner Bitmain's plan to undertake a  hard fork  of bitcoin if a code upgrade on the currency is activated late this summer. Under a  hard fork , Bitmain would create an entirely new version of the bitcoin blockchain, resulting in an entirely new bitcoin currency, separate from the original currency. Bitmain's move was in response to proposals that attempt to solve the bitcoin network's limitations in processing millions of daily transactions. Bitcoin's network has not kept pace with its growth and is unable to process all the transactions fast enough.  Traders are concerned with what a fork could do to their holdings and most likely now converting to fiat (government currencies) until some clarity about the scaling debate comes to light,  said BitMEX's Dwyer.

The filings lodged at the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday did not identify Prime Minister Najib Razak or his wife Rosmah Mansor by name, but said the jewelry purchases were for the wife of  Malaysian Official 1.  Malaysian and U.S. government sources have previously confirmed that  Malaysian Official 1  refers to Najib. The diamond necklace set alone cost $27.3 million, according to the latest filings in a lawsuit that was launched last July. The accusations will provide further ammunition for Najib's political rivals, who often criticize his wife for lavish spending, and come at an awkward time for the Malaysian leader, as he had been expected to call a snap election later this year. Rosmah's aide did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The prime minister's office, in a statement early on Friday, said it was  concerned by the unnecessary and gratuitous naming of certain matters and individuals that are only relevant to domestic political manipulation and interference.   Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing.  A total of $4.5 billion have been misappropriated from 1MDB, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. The fund was set up by Najib in 2009 to promote economic development. The department is seeking to seize a total of about $1.7 billion in assets that were bought with misappropriated funds, including a Picasso painting that was given to actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the rights to two Hollywood films.  This money financed the lavish lifestyles of the alleged co-conspirators at the expense and detriment of the Malaysian people,  acting U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco said in a statement. The jewelry purchases were arranged by Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, who was also accused of gifting DiCaprio the $3.2 million Picasso. A spokesman for DiCaprio on Thursday said that the actor had  begun proceedings to transfer ownership of the Picasso to the U.S. government, having in July 2016  initiated the return  of gifts he had received from financiers connected to the 1MDB case. Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, could not be reached for comment. In an emailed statement through a representative, Low said the Justice Department's actions were  a further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case.   The U.S. Department of Justice's latest move continues its inappropriate efforts to seize assets despite not having proven that any improprieties have occurred,  the statement read. Rasky Partners, a public relations firm that emailed his statement, could not be immediately reached by phone. Najib's Bank Account  The lawsuits show the jewelry for Rosmah was bought with funds that passed through Najib's account. The jewelry, like the Picasso painting, was purchased with funds traceable to diverted proceeds from a 2013 bond offering by 1MDB, according to the filings. The diamond necklace was bought in 2013, just months after $680 million was transferred to the private bank account of Najib in Kuala Lumpur, the filings show. The Malaysian government says that money came from a member of the Saudi royal family. The necklace was purchased from New York jeweler Lorraine Schwartz, who has designed for Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Lopez and other stars of the entertainment world.  Need a 18 carrot (carat) pink heart diamond vivid or slightly short of vivid. On diamond necklace urgent,  Low said in a text message to Schwartz in June 2013, the filings said. A month later Schwartz showed the necklace in Monaco to a group of people, including Rosmah, onboard Topaz, one of the largest private yachts in the world.  Low had chartered the 147-meter yacht for seven days in early July 2013, according to the filings. Rosmah and Low again met with Schwartz at a U.S. hotel in September that year, when Najib was in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.     The necklace was eventually delivered to an unnamed friend of Rosmah's in 2014 in Hong Kong, who then handed it over to Rosmah in Kuala Lumpur, the filings said.     Low also arranged for the purchase of 27 pieces of jewelry – worth a total of $1.3 million – for Rosmah in 2014. The lawsuits also describe how Low spent about $9 million in 2014 buying jewelry for Australian model Miranda Kerr.      Low bought a necklace with a 11.72 carat heart-shaped diamond for $1.29 million, with Kerr's initials  MK  inscribed on the back. The necklace was given to Kerr as a Valentine's Day gift, according to the lawsuit.     Later that same year, Low bought a 8.88-carat pink heart diamond pendant worth $4.8 million, also as a gift for Kerr.  Representatives for Kerr, who married Snapchat cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel late last month, had no comment.

The Senate bill, approved on Thursday by a margin of 98-2, includes new sanctions against Russia and Iran. Crucially, it foresees punitive measures against entities that provide material support to Russia in building energy export pipelines. Berlin fears that could pave the way for fines against German and European firms involved in Nord Stream 2, a project to build a pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic. Among the European companies involved in the project are German oil and gas group Wintershall, German energy trading firm Uniper, Royal Dutch Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman described the Senate bill, which must be approved by the House of Representatives and signed by President Donald Trump before it becomes law, as  a peculiar move . He said it was  strange  that sanctions intended to punish Russia for alleged interference in the U.S. elections could also trigger penalties against European companies.  That must not happen,  said the spokesman, Steffen Seibert. In an interview with Reuters, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said Berlin would have to think about counter-measures if Trump backed the plan.  If he does, we'll have to consider what we are going to do against it,  Zypries said. The sharp response from Berlin comes at a time of deep strains in the transatlantic relationship due to shifts in U.S. policy and a more confrontational rhetoric towards Europe under Trump. The new U.S. president has lambasted European partners for not contributing more to NATO, slammed Germany for running a large trade surplus with the United States and broken with allies on climate change with his decision to exit the landmark Paris agreement on combating greenhouse gas emissions. Ironically, the part of the Senate bill that targets Russia was introduced by some of the president's top critics, including Republican hawk John McCain. They are intent on limiting Trump's ability to forge warmer ties with Russia, a key foreign policy pledge during his campaign for the presidency, but one he has been unable to deliver on amid investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Dialogue Breaks Down Under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Washington and Europe coordinated closely as they ramped up sanctions against Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. But the dialogue has broken down under Trump, who considered easing sanctions against Russia when he first came into office, according to U.S. officials.  I regret that the joint approach of Europe and the United States on Russia and sanctions has been undermined and abandoned in this way,  Zypries told Reuters. France and the European Commission also urged the United States to coordinate with its partners on such matters.  For several years, we have underlined to the United States the difficulties that extraterritorial legislation spark,  a French foreign ministry spokesman told reporters. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, due to start pumping gas from Russia to Europe from 2019, has been dogged by controversy. Eastern European and Baltic states fear it will make them hostage to Russian gas and undercut Ukraine by depriving it of transit fees for Russian gas supplies to Europe. Nordic nations, meanwhile, have security concerns over the pipeline running through territorial waters, where Russia has bolstered its military presence in recent months. Some EU diplomats fear the threat of new measures out of Washington may harden Germany's defense of Nord Stream and complicate already difficult talks among EU nations over whether to seek joint talks with Russia over the pipeline.  This is not helpful now. It tends to stir up desires to protect our territorial space,  one EU diplomat said. The House of Representatives is expected to debate the Senate bill in the coming weeks but it is unclear whether it will come up for a final vote before lawmakers leave Washington at the end of July for their summer recess.

Yet several other everyday items also have dubious associations - including an increased risk of links to slavery - according to new research by a data intelligence company. A wide range of products, from pet food to toys, have previously been implicated in modern slavery through their complex global supply chains.  The illegal industry traps an estimated 46 million people globally, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, and produces profits of about $150 billion a year, according to the International Labour Organization. Risk analysis firm Polecat analyzed about 30 million social media posts and over 300,000 online sources daily, over the course of 90 days. In research released on Friday, it found tea, coffee, coal, sugar and tobacco are among the top eight products that have an increased risk of slavery links.  The analysis also references particular geographical hotspots, where the risk of slavery is higher. Topping the charts in social media was coal from North Korea, with 300 indications of risk-based language in the last 90 days, according to Polecat. The U.S. State Department's 2016 Trafficking in Persons report found that North Korea has an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 prisoners in remote political camps where all inmates, including children, are subject to forced labor, including mining.  Next came gold from Tanzania, a country with more than 4 million child laborers, according to a government survey released last year with the International Labour Organization.  Third was cotton in Uzbekistan, the world's fifth-largest cotton exporter but a position that rights campaigners say is maintained by a state-orchestrated forced labor system. In online articles, blogs and features, Polecat found that gravel in the United States was at the highest risk of slavery links, with 42 examples of risk-based language found. Earlier this year, local media in the U.S state of Tennessee reported a Guatemalan man and a pair of his ex-colleagues filed a lawsuit against a landscaping firm, accusing the company of trafficking and forced labor.  This was followed by cotton in Uzbekistan and tobacco in the United States.  Polecat co-founder Bronwyn Kunhardt told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the task of monitoring global supply chains for modern slavery is extremely complex and requires new approaches.  Interrogating social media and unstructured data plays a crucial role in identifying potential threats and red flags in real time,  said Kunhardt.  Few companies are doing this comprehensively today, so it seems unlikely that we've seen the last big scandal related to slavery and bad practices in the supply chain.

Croatian Vekic, who turns 21 later this month, reached the final of her first WTA Tour event in Tashkent in 2012 - the youngest player to do so for six years. The following year, still aged 16, she was runner-up at the Wimbledon warm-up event in Birmingham, prompting former American great Chris Evert to predict a top-10 career. She has never got close. There was one title in Kuala Lumpur in 2014 when she reached a career high 63 but she finished outside the top 100 for the past two years. Last year she fell in the first round of the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon and failed to qualify for the U.S. Open. Google her name and the results throw up endless stories about an unsavory incident in 2015 when Australian Nick Kyrgios made derogatory sexual remarks about her during a match against Swiss Wawrinka in Montreal, for which he was subsequently fined. There are signs, however, that Monte Carlo-based Vekic, now  older and wiser , might start making headlines again for the tennis ability that has been hibernating for a while. On Friday at the Nottingham Open she completed a third consecutive straight sets win, this time against Greek Maria Sakkari to move to within a victory of her fifth career final. Not quite in the same league as 32-year-old Wawrinka who has won two of his three grand slams since being romantically involved with Vekic, but she is still aiming high.

Vekic, coached by Nick Horvat and whose agent Lawrence Frankopan also looks after Wawrinka, said the hardest thing was watching other young players zoom past her. Britain Tennis - Wimbledon - All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club, Wimbledon, England - 28/6/16 Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka girlfriend Croatia's Donna Vekic gestures from the stands during his match against USA's Taylor FritzPaul Childs   Picture Supplied by Action Images I was playing those finals when I was 16 and 17 and it was more me who was putting pressure on myself, thinking OK I have to win every tournament now,  she said.  Then all the other young girls came up and like Belinda (Bencic) she was in the top 10 and I was thinking what am I doing wrong? But I wasn't really doing anything wrong.  It just takes time and I had fall to get back up. This will make me stronger. I went high then low. It was difficult for me because I was expecting the opposite.  But I'm happy that I am coming back.  Vekic said she takes heart from the likes of Jelena Ostapenko who won the French Open last week, aged 20. That was incredible and it showed everyone can do it and that women's tennis is so open,  she said.  To win a slam at any age is amazing, 20 or 30. I'll take either.

Russia has denied Western concerns that its Zapad 2017 war games will threaten stability in eastern Europe. NATO officials believe the exercises could involve more than 100,000 troops, the biggest such Russian manoeuvres since 2013.  When (Russia) went into Crimea, that was against the backdrop of an exercise. When they went into Georgia - that was an exercise , Lieutenant General Ben Hodges told Reuters.  Their history is full of examples where they don't live up to any treaties ... They routinely violate those things,  he said during a NATO exercise in Poland. Russia annexed Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and in August 2008 it sent troops into Georgia, saying it was protecting civilians in Georgia's South Ossetia region. The Crimea annexation has plunged East-West ties to their lowest levels since the Cold War, with Western governments imposing economic sanctions on Russia. NATO has sent troops to the Baltics and Poland to deter any possible Crimea-style land grab. Replying to a question, Hodges said he, like Lithuania, was concerned that the Russian exercises could lead to provocative action on Baltic borders. He said the United States would deploy three units of up to 600 airborne troops across the Baltic States for the duration of Zapad 2017.  We are all working hard to be at the highest levels of readiness during exercises like this,  Hodges said. Previous Russian large-scale exercises in 2013 employed special forces training, longer-range missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that were later used in Russia's annexation of Crimea, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and in its intervention in Syria, NATO diplomats said. Officials expect the exercise, in which Russian ally Belarus will also take part, could involve nuclear weapons training. Nuclear-capable mid-range modern Iskander missiles will be again deployed in the Russian Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad during the exercise, the officials said. Estonia's defence minister said in April that Russia may use Zapad to move troops permanently into Belarus later this year in a warning to NATO. Russia's defence ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment on the subject. Three U.S. exercises will be underway at the same time as Zapad, in Sweden, Poland and Ukraine, and a U.S. armoured brigade team is already deployed in Europe. U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis called the forthcoming Russian build-up  destabilising  last month, and officials suggested the U.S. army will be deploying a battery of Patriot missiles to Lithuania for two weeks in July.

Staley,BARCLAYS,QATAR/CHARGES,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is to announce on Tuesday whether it will bring criminal charges against Barclays and some of its former senior executives over a 2008 emergency fundraising from Qatar, according to a person familiar with the plans. The SFO has been investigating for nearly five years whether commercial agreements between banking group Barclays Plc and Qatari investors as part of a total 12 billion pound ($15 billion) fundraising at the height of the credit crisis breached UK law. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Barclays plans to plead guilty to charges that it failed to make proper disclosures about the fundraising and is braced for a fine, which would likely range from 100 million to 200 million pounds. Barclays and the SFO declined to comment on the Bloomberg report and on the timing of the charging announcement. Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested around 5.3 billion pounds ($6.7 billion) in Barclays in June and October 2008. Authorities have been examining whether payments from Barclays to Qatar at the same time, such as around 322 million pounds in  advisory services agreements  (ASA), alongside a multi-billion-dollar loan, were honest and properly disclosed. The inquiry is one of several legal issues inherited by Barclay's current Chief Executive Jes Staley that date back to the credit crisis. The bank already faces a proposed fine of about 50 million pounds for being  reckless  after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it did not disclose all  advisory services agreements  to Qatar, although that inquiry is ongoing.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/barclays-qatar-charges-idUSL1N1JD116"},

Abdullah al-Muhaysini appeared in an online video saying he was unhurt in the blast.  We got in the car and a man approached us wearing a suicide vest. He came close to the car and blew himself up,  he said.  Muhaysini did not say who he believed was behind the attack, which a war monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said took place after he left a mosque in Idlib. He is described as a terrorist by the Syrian government and its allies, as well as by the United States, which has launched air strikes against members of Tahrir al-Sham, the group he is associated with.  There has been fighting among Syrian rebels since early this year and opposition sources have said they fear the Gulf crisis involving Qatar could spark new bouts of that conflict. Photos on social media, which Reuters could not authenticate, showed an armored car with scorched and slightly crumpled bodywork but with its shape mostly intact and windows unbroken.      Since arriving in Syria in 2013, Muhaysini has become one of the best-known jihadists, partly thanks to his tireless social media presence.  He is a member of the Sharia council for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of jihadist rebel factions that includes the Nusra Front, a former al Qaeda group which Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse Qatar of funding. Doha denies it.   Saudi Arabia backed Syrian rebels early in the country's conflict and its top clerics pronounced the uprising a jihad in 2013, but the government has vehemently opposed any participation by Saudis.  Muhaysini's father was a well-known cleric from the ultra-conservative town of Bureidah, whose fiercely anti-Western views caused him trouble with the government.  His son boasts on his website of studying under Sulaiman al-Alwan, nicknamed  the al-Qaeda sheikh , who has been in prison in Saudi Arabia since 2004.   Martyrs or Victors  When he arrived in Syria, Muhaysini presented himself as a neutral arbiter between rival jihadist groups in Syria, and has often chastised them for their internal divisions.  The United States said in a sanctions listing in November he was in fact part of the  inner leadership circle  of the Nusra Front, something he has denied, but which many experts on Syria's jihad say they believe to be true. The Sharia council is responsible for religious and legal matters rather than military activities, but he has published videos of himself brandishing weapons with rebel fighters near front lines.  In his online videos, the young, bushy-bearded cleric apppears earnest and amiable while discussing politics and religion with comrades, but thunderous when denouncing enemies.   When the battle starts, we will not accept that you come back except as martyrs or victors,  he said in a speech to rebel fighters about to assault Aleppo last summer.  Other videos show him hugging suicide bombers before they leave for the front line, training children to use weapons and showering praise on Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of the former Nusra Front group.  On social media feeds, he sometimes uses an emoji of a raised forefinger, the universal jihadist salute.

Yet several other everyday items also have dubious associations - including an increased risk of links to slavery - according to new research by a data intelligence company. A wide range of products, from pet food to toys, have previously been implicated in modern slavery through their complex global supply chains.  The illegal industry traps an estimated 46 million people globally, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, and produces profits of about $150 billion a year, according to the International Labour Organization. Risk analysis firm Polecat analyzed about 30 million social media posts and over 300,000 online sources daily, over the course of 90 days. In research released on Friday, it found tea, coffee, coal, sugar and tobacco are among the top eight products that have an increased risk of slavery links.  The analysis also references particular geographical hotspots, where the risk of slavery is higher. Topping the charts in social media was coal from North Korea, with 300 indications of risk-based language in the last 90 days, according to Polecat. The U.S. State Department's 2016 Trafficking in Persons report found that North Korea has an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 prisoners in remote political camps where all inmates, including children, are subject to forced labor, including mining.  Next came gold from Tanzania, a country with more than 4 million child laborers, according to a government survey released last year with the International Labour Organization.  Third was cotton in Uzbekistan, the world's fifth-largest cotton exporter but a position that rights campaigners say is maintained by a state-orchestrated forced labor system. In online articles, blogs and features, Polecat found that gravel in the United States was at the highest risk of slavery links, with 42 examples of risk-based language found. Earlier this year, local media in the U.S state of Tennessee reported a Guatemalan man and a pair of his ex-colleagues filed a lawsuit against a landscaping firm, accusing the company of trafficking and forced labor.  This was followed by cotton in Uzbekistan and tobacco in the United States.  Polecat co-founder Bronwyn Kunhardt told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the task of monitoring global supply chains for modern slavery is extremely complex and requires new approaches.  Interrogating social media and unstructured data plays a crucial role in identifying potential threats and red flags in real time,  said Kunhardt.  Few companies are doing this comprehensively today, so it seems unlikely that we've seen the last big scandal related to slavery and bad practices in the supply chain.

Broomfield spent two years going through archives and speaking with people close to Houston, who began singing in a gospel choir in New Jersey at the age of 11 and was discovered in a nightclub in the 1980s by record producer Clive Davis who guided her career. She found global fame following smash hits such as  I Will Always Love You  - the theme song of what was her film acting debut in  The Bodyguard  opposite Kevin Costner in 1992 - and  The Greatest Love of All.

The S&P; 500 consumer staples index, down 1.6 percent, was the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P; 500 stock index.  Bucking broader declines on news of the deal, Amazon shares surged 3 percent while Whole Foods shot up 27.2 percent.  The uncertainty over the impact of Amazon on the food industry is upsetting the market,  said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida. Indeed, the deal sent shockwaves through the food distribution market, hurting stocks like Wal-Mart, which slid 5.3 percent, Kroger, which tumbled 13.1 percent, and Costco Wholesale, which fell 6.1 percent.  The Amazon news is significant because it could be a game changer in terms of how the food industry operates,  though the share price reaction of Wal-Mart and other stocks appeared overdone, Bittles said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.73 points, or 0.01 percent, to 21,357.17, the S&P; 500 lost 3.94 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,428.52 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 20.63 points, or 0.33 percent, to 6,144.87. MSCI's index of stock markets across the world inched up 0.2 percent, while European shares added 0.5 percent, rebounding from recent losses. In the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar fell against a basket of key currencies; it was down 0.3 percent after the day's data, which raised concerns about spending. U.S. homebuilding fell for a third month in May to the lowest in eight months as construction activity declined broadly, while the University of Michigan said its barometer on U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in early June. The Japanese yen reversed course against the dollar after earlier sliding to a two-week low, when the Bank of Japan left its mass money printing program unchanged, maintaining the contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which signaled further tightening this week. The weaker-than-expected U.S. data also weighed on U.S. Treasury yields as it fueled uncertainty about the U.S. rate outlook. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last up 2/32 in price to yield 2.153 percent, compared with 2.162 percent late Thursday. In commodities, oil edged up but remained on track for losses for the week on persisting worries over the glut in supply.

Fortress (FIG.N) and Elliott were negotiating to buy some of the 26 billion euros ($29 billion) in bonds that Monte dei Paschi, Italy's fourth largest bank and the world's oldest, must sell to private investors as a condition of the bailout. Fortress and Elliott had backed out of the talks in a dispute over sale terms, said three sources familiar with the matter. The loans have a face value of 26 billion euros but the bank, brought low by years of poor lending and mismanagement, is looking to sell them for around a fifth of that. The funds' withdrawal not only threatens the government's efforts to save Monte dei Paschi, it could also complicate a separate and already-shaky plan by Rome to bail out two smaller troubled lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. Italy's banking shares fell on the news of the funds' withdrawal, with the sector index .FTIT8300 hitting a session low, down 1.7 percent. It closed down 0.5 percent. If Fortress and Elliott do not come back to the negotiating table, Monte dei Paschi and the two regional banks have only one willing investor to turn to: Italian banking industry bailout fund Atlante, set up a year ago with Rome's backing. Atlante is considering whether to press on as sole buyer of Monte dei Paschi's bad loans, the sources said. It has 1.7 billion euros in cash but has already committed to use 450 million euros to buy bad loans of the Veneto-based banks. Atlante declined to comment. Italy is scrambling to find private investors to help fund its 6.4 billion euros plan to bail out the two smaller regional lenders by the end of this month to avert them being wound down. Rome is even considering suspending a bond payment due by Veneto Banca on June 21, in order to prevent the plan being held hostage by a potential legal dispute. If Veneto Banca makes the payment, it could anger other bondholders who risk large losses under bailout rules. But if the bank does not pay back the bond, it could trigger a default. This month, the European Commission gave Italy a preliminary green light to bail out Monte dei Paschi, which needs to fill a capital shortfall of 8.8 billion euros. But the bank first needs a binding commitment from private buyers to take the 26 billion euros in bad loans off its balance sheet, sources have said. The European Central Bank  wants a binding commitment, they want visibility on the price in order to know what the loss will be for Monte dei Paschi,  one of the sources said.     Monte dei Paschi had previously said it was in exclusive talks with Atlante and other investors to reach an accord by June 28. The bank will continue to negotiate with Atlante, having deemed the conditions set by the Elliott and Fortress as  unacceptable,  another source said.

Sterling surged to its highest in a week against the euro on Thursday after it emerged that the central bank's monetary policy committee had seen a 5-3 split on whether to raise interest rates immediately, amid rapidly increasing domestic consumer prices.  At a time when the BoE has blamed the rise in inflation past its 2 percent target mainly on a weak pound, traders read the split vote as a warning that officials could seek to defend the currency with rhetoric or action, even as the economy overall slows. The pound has fallen over 15 percent since last June's vote for Brexit, although it has recovered some ground since the 31-year lows hit in October and even popped above $1.30 last month on bets that the Conservative party would increase its parliamentary majority in elections held last week.  However, with no party taking a majority, the pound sank as investors worried that a minority government would bring turmoil and could weaken Britain's hand in exit negotiations with the European Union.  Canadian bank BMO on Friday said it was revising down its 12-month forecasts for the pound, to $1.32 from $1.37 before, and that it would fall further in the coming months.   We expect sterling to fall to $1.24 in three months and $1.23 in six months, on a combination of domestic political tensions, a rocky start to the Brexit negotiations and general dollar strength over the next few months,  BMO strategists wrote in a note to clients.

The mention of the Siemens equipment was buried inside technical documents for the plants posted on Russia's official procurement website last week - and cancelled seven days later. The project to build the plants in Crimea, the region Russia annexed from Ukraine three years ago, has hit obstacles because it cannot source the gas turbines it needs, sources familiar with the plans told Reuters in April. Though it has never been officially acknowledged, people close to the project say the plants were designed to use gas turbines made by Siemens. The company would be violating European Union sanctions on Russia and Crimea if it were to deliver the turbines. It said on Friday it was not supplying turbines for the Crimean plants. On June 8, Technopromexport, the Russian state company building the Crimean plants, issued a tender on the official public procurement website for bids on a contract to prepare technical documents for the plants. The tender identified the model of gas turbine planned for installation as  SGT-2000E  and the generators that work with the turbines as  SGen5-100A . Those models are manufactured by Siemens, according to the company's website. The tender was cancelled on June 15. Asked about the cancellation, a Technopromexport representative said it was because changes were needed in the technical documents. The representative declined to give more details. Russia's energy ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. It was not clear whether the plan to use the Siemens turbines was still in effect, or if Technopromexport was changing the type of gas turbines required. Siemens' Russian business said in a statement sent to Reuters that it abided by all export restrictions.  Therefore we are not supplying equipment for use or delivery to Crimea,  it said. The power plants are some of Russia's most high-profile infrastructure projects. They are needed to give Crimea stable supplies of electricity, but also to prove Russia can deliver high-technology projects despite Western sanctions. Russia has looked at alternative ways to get the turbines needed for the plants, which are to have a combined capacity of 940 megawatts and cost 71 billion roubles ($1.2 billion). Those have included changing the specifications so the plants can use Russian-made turbines, buying turbines from Iran, or using Western-made turbines already in Russia that are idle. However, there are doubts among engineers involved whether any of those options are feasible, and there is no consensus about how to proceed, according to the sources familiar with the project.

Sterling surged to its highest in a week against the euro on Thursday after it emerged that the central bank's monetary policy committee had seen a 5-3 split on whether to raise interest rates immediately, amid rapidly increasing domestic consumer prices.  At a time when the BoE has blamed the rise in inflation past its 2 percent target mainly on a weak pound, traders read the split vote as a warning that officials could seek to defend the currency with rhetoric or action, even as the economy overall slows. The pound has fallen over 15 percent since last June's vote for Brexit, although it has recovered some ground since the 31-year lows hit in October and even popped above $1.30 last month on bets that the Conservative party would increase its parliamentary majority in elections held last week.  However, with no party taking a majority, the pound sank as investors worried that a minority government would bring turmoil and could weaken Britain's hand in exit negotiations with the European Union.  Canadian bank BMO on Friday said it was revising down its 12-month forecasts for the pound, to $1.32 from $1.37 before, and that it would fall further in the coming months.   We expect sterling to fall to $1.24 in three months and $1.23 in six months, on a combination of domestic political tensions, a rocky start to the Brexit negotiations and general dollar strength over the next few months,  BMO strategists wrote in a note to clients.

British stocks sold off on Thursday as fears grew around the squeezed British consumer and the durability of stronger macroeconomic data which had spurred cyclical sectors higher. The main FTSE 100 benchmark was up 0.6 percent at 7,463.54 points at its close, while UK mid-caps pulled out of Thursday's nosedive to gain claw back 1.3 percent. Competition worries added to the woes of British retailers, in particular grocers, which sold off after news that U.S. giant Amazon was to buy U.S. organic supermarket chain Whole Foods. Shares in supermarket retailers Tesco, Sainsbury and Marks & Spencer all fell between 1.9 percent to almost 5 percent, while Morrison gained 1.1 percent. The latter was seen as somewhat protected against any Amazon incursion. This exacerbated the move in Tesco's shares, which had reversed course after weak international same store sales overshadowed the retailer's strongest UK sales growth in seven years. Much of the focus this week was on the more domestically exposed mid-cap companies, with concerns coming to a boiling point on Thursday when furniture store DFS warned on profit, triggering a sharp sell-off among consumer-exposed stocks. Investors said valuations among mid-caps, which hit a fresh record high as recently as two weeks ago, were also putting off prospective buyers.  It's not panic stations, but you can see why there might be a consolidation,  said Ian Williams, head of economics and strategy at Peel Hunt.  Mid-caps have held up a lot better than people thought they would. So although underlying earnings are good and the bottom up news is good, valuations mean there's not that many more compelling cheap opportunities,  he added. Uncertainty around UK politics, a week after a shock general election result, had also generated jitters around domestic stocks. Among sectors, energy stocks lent some support after oil edged up off its seven-week lows, while wealth manager St James's Place, paper firm Mondi and support services firm DCC were the top FTSE gainers. Driving the mid-cap recovery were industrials firms with less exposure to the domestic economy, with engineer Cobham the biggest gainer.

The presidents of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger and ministers from several other African nations met on Thursday in Ouagadougou to discuss sustainability and security on the continent, and the need to create land-based jobs for the booming youth population.  We need to focus on policies that reinvigorate agriculture, to make it more attractive for young people,  Noah Auta Dauda of Nigeria's interior ministry told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We want our youths to look inward, rather than towards Europe.   Climate shocks, deteriorating land and a lack of development are driving many young Africans to risk their lives trying to reach Europe, and pushing others into extremist groups, says the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Rising temperatures, increasingly erratic rainfall and growing desertification on a continent whose population is set to double to 2.4 billion by 2050 means the need to restore land and create rural jobs is more urgent than ever, experts say. More than 60 million people could leave sub-Saharan Africa's desertified areas for North Africa and Europe by 2020, according to the UNCCD. And by 2050, 200 million could be permanently displaced environmental migrants, the U.N. body says.  It is not just about creating jobs, but also focusing on approaches from early warning systems to better risk management to prepare for shocks like droughts and floods,  said Abdeladim Lhafi, Morocco's high commissioner for water and forests. One such project, the Great Green Wall, would see a 7,000 km (4,400 mile) strip of vegetation reaching west to east Africa, designed to trap the sands of the Sahara, halt the advance of the desert and restore 50 million hectares of land.  We must first restore and preserve the land before we can develop and invest in it,  he said by phone from Ouagadougou. Humanitarian and development agencies are also helping African migrants who return from Libya and Europe by investing in agriculture projects for them and their communities at home, giving them parcels of land, and providing tools and training.  Creating green jobs helps returning migrants to reintegrate, benefits their communities, and reduces the risk of them leaving again or becoming radicalized,  said Lavinia Prati of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Niger.

These results have a number of implications for monetary policy,  she said in the conclusion of a paper written with two other BoE researchers. Forbes's views on the factors driving inflation may have proven influential earlier this week when two other MPC members unexpectedly joined her in voting for higher interest rates - though the majority opted to keep rates at 0.25 percent.

The newspaper said its story was based on a reliable source and that the 32-year-old four-times world player of the year had already made up his mind to ask the club for a transfer. It said that Ronaldo was  deeply disenchanted  with the allegations against him. Record, another sports daily, carried a similar story.  Ronaldo's agents could not immediately be reached for comment. Spanish prosecutors have filed a lawsuit against the player accusing him of defrauding tax authorities of 14.7 million euros ($16.5 million) by hiding his image rights income between 2011 and 2014. Ronaldo has denied any wrongdoing. Real Madrid said on Thursday they were confident the Portuguese forward had acted legally. They could not immediately be reached on Friday to comment on the report. Ronaldo led Real Madrid to their 12th European Cup earlier this month after scoring two goals in a 4-1 victory over Juventus in the Champions League final, becoming the tournament's top scorer.  Ronaldo, Portugal's all-time leading scorer, is the latest in a long line of soccer players in Spain -- among them Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Neymar -- to be caught up in cases over tax or transfers. Ronaldo has completed eight seasons at Real Madrid since joining them from Manchester United in 2009 for a then world record fee of 96 million euros During that time, they have won the Champions League three times and La Liga twice. In November, he agreed to extend his contract until 2021. He is currently at the Confederations Cup in Russia with the Portuguese national team where his team mate Andre Silva said that Ronaldo was motivated for the tournament.

Mubadala spokesman Brian Lott told Reuters on Friday that a local media report saying that the fund has pulled out of Etisalat Nigeria was wrong and that several proposals are under discussion. He declined to elaborate on the options being considered but said he will know more next week. The Nigerian affiliate of Abu Dhabi-listed Etisalat has said it is in talks to restructure a $1.2 billion loan after missing a repayment, though sources have said that talks reached a deadlock on April 28. Ibrahim Dikko, vice president for regulatory affairs at Etisalat Nigeria, said on Friday that discussions with lenders have reached an advanced stage and he expects a deal to be reached next week. Sources have said that Etisalat Nigeria has asked its lenders to take equity in the business and convert the dollar portion of the loan to naira, which the banks rejected. The lenders have instead asked parent Etisalat to inject more cash, the sources said. Dikko said that the company was  considering a number of options and not taking anything off the table at this time . He said that Etisalat Nigeria is a viable business and recorded its best financial year in 2016. Etisalat, which owns 45 percent of the Nigerian company, is not willing to invest more after converting some of the affiliate's loans into equity and writing down its investment to $50 million, a source has said. Abu Dhabi's state-owned fund Mubadala owns another 40 percent. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, has been divesting some of its investments as crude prices have continued a lengthy slump. The chief executive of Mubadala, which owns 40 percent of Etisalat Nigeria, told Reuters in March that the state-owned fund could pare down its stakes in some companies. The loan that has proved so troubling for Etisalat Nigeria is a seven-year facility agreed with 13 local banks in 2013 to refinance a $650 million loan and fund expansion of its network. The company, however, is the biggest foreign-owned victim of dollar shortages plaguing Nigeria's financial system because of lower oil prices and economic recession, leaving it struggling to make the loan repayments. Nigerian regulators have agreed with local banks to pursue a default deal rather than receivership to avoid a wider debt crisis. But lenders, under pressure to avoid loan-loss provisions, are pushing to finalise the restructuring before half-yearly audits this month.  Parties are keen to ensure that the ongoing discussions and eventual outcome do not affect the day-to-day operations of the business whether now or after the announcement of our agreement,  Dikko said in a statement.

The greenback has hovered near its lowest since November as a batch of disappointing economic readings, together with the lack of progress on fiscal stimulus from Washington, have overshadowed the outlook on more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.     Earlier Friday, the government said U.S. home construction fell for a third consecutive month in May to its lowest in eight months, while the University of Michigan said its gauge on consumer sentiment deteriorated in early June.      It raises some doubt on U.S. growth for the rest of the year,  said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.     At 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), the dollar index was down 0.3 percent at 97.126, putting it on track for a 0.15 percent decline on the week.     Friday's dour U.S. data helped erase the greenback's initial gains against the yen, which had slid to a two-week low versus the dollar.     The yen weakened with the Bank of Japan nowhere close to the Federal Reserve's path to normalize monetary policy as domestic inflation has remained sluggish.     Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said there was  some distance  to achieving the BoJ's inflation target of 2 percent, and it was  inappropriate  to say how the Bank would exit its massive stimulus program.     That ran contrary to market speculation in the past month the BoJ could be considering its own plan for eventually withdrawing emergency stimulus for the world's third largest economy.      The yen was about half a percent lower to 111.41 per dollar in London before rebounding to 110.80 yen in later New York trading, Reuters data showed.      The theme continues to be the potential for further yen weakness because they (the BoJ) are still grappling with the deflationary mindset of the Japanese consumer,  said Martin Arnold, FX strategist at ETF Securities in London.     The euro was up 0.3 percent to 123.97 yen after touching a near two-week high at 124.45 yen earlier Friday.     The common currency was up 0.4 percent at $1.1191, but about a cent below a seven-month peak of $1.1296 hit before the Fed's widely expected rate hike on Wednesday. ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 11:50AM (1550 GMT)  Description      RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct Change     YTD Pct                                               Previous                   Change                                               Session                     Euro/Dollar      EUR=        $1.1187        $1.1143     +0.39%         +6.41%  Dollar/Yen       JPY=        110.8200       110.9100    -0.08%         -5.18%  Euro/Yen         EURJPY=     123.99         123.63      +0.29%         +0.69%  Dollar/Swiss     CHF=        0.9742         0.9750      -0.08%         -4.28%  Sterling/Dollar  GBP=        1.2776         1.2754      +0.17%         +3.57%  Dollar/Canadian  CAD=        1.3237         1.3268      -0.23%         -1.44%  Australian/Doll  AUD=        0.7620         0.7576      +0.58%         +5.61%  ar                                                                       Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=     1.0898         1.0868      +0.28%         +1.69%  Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=     0.8754         0.8737      +0.19%         +2.77%  NZ Dollar/Dolar  NZD=        0.7248         0.7206      +0.58%         +4.42%  Dollar/Norway    NOK=        8.4562         8.5054      -0.58%         -2.09%  Euro/Norway      EURNOK=     9.4596         9.4785      -0.20%         +4.11%  Dollar/Sweden    SEK=        8.7026         8.7500      -0.16%         -4.45%  Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=     9.7375         9.7528      -0.16%         +1.65%             (Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho in London, Tokyo Markets team; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Chris Reese)       ))","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL8N1JD3TE"},

While Whole Foods bonds bounced on news of the US$13.7bn takeover by one of the most famous companies in the world, most of the rest of retail took a pasting in bonds and equities alike. Amazon's peer Walmart saw its share price down more than 6% within an hour of the news, while stock in grocery chain Kroger was off more than 15%. On the fixed income side, bonds across the retail sector were thumped by news of the acquisition, which was expected to squeeze margins in a sector with precious little room to give. Kroger (Baa1/BBB) was one of the hardest hit in investment grade, as its bonds gapped out up to 29bp shortly after the news, according to MarketAxess data. In high yield, meanwhile, organic Whole Foods rival The Fresh Market's bonds fell as much as 3.8 points to 83.9 cents on the dollar. And there was plenty of hurt outside the grocery space, with outstanding bonds from clothing retailer JC Penney and pharmacy chains Rite-Aid and CVS also clobbered in secondary trade.  There is pressure on everybody,  said Renato Latini, a credit analyst at asset manager Brandywine Global.  Amazon are going to source products. If their technology applies down the supply chain - and to the extent that is proprietary - they could pinch the competition.  Retail of Woe Retail has been the only sector to have a negative return in the junk bond space this year, as consumers increasingly shun brick-and-mortar stores in favour of online shopping. According to data from JP Morgan, US retail high-yield bonds posted negative returns of 0.31% as of June 9, compared to gains of 4.58% for US junk bonds as a whole. While clothing retailers have suffered, the problems have also been acute for grocery chains, which have been dealing with fierce competition, falling food prices and declining same-store sales.  Retail is already a highly competitive sector with pretty thin margins, especially in the grocery space,  said Matt Kennedy, head of corporate credit at Angel Oak Capital Advisors. Before news of the acquisition broke on Friday, Whole Foods had been under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners, one of the largest shareholders with a roughly 8% stake. Whole Foods shares had been trading at about US$65 in October 2013, but plunged to around US$27 in September of last year. With Jana agitating for change, the company turned to investment bank Evercore Partners to advise on strategy, sources told IFR. According to a filing, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch provided a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility of up to US$13.7bn to help fund the acquisition. Some of that is expected to be taken out in the bond market. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2017. One head of bond syndicate at a Wall St bank, not directly involved in the financing, said it may be a few weeks before a bond deal is launched. And while much of the retail sector was pounded on the news, Amazon saw its shares up 3% while Whole Foods shares jumped more than 27%. The only outstanding Whole Foods bonds, a US$1bn 5.2% 2025 issue, was quoted more than 100bp tighter after the deal was announced. Whole Foods sits on the cusp of junk status with a Baa3 rating from Moody's and a BBB minus from S&P.; But the agencies have differing views on Amazon, rated Baa1 by Moody's and AA- by S&P.;  They are being bought by Amazon, which you can consider a Single A credit,  one trader told IFR.  It's one of the best-run companies on the face of the earth.

Amazon announced before markets opened that it was purchasing the U.S. organic supermarket chain for $13.7 billion, including debt, marking its biggest foray into the brick-and-mortar retail sector. The Canadian consumer staples sector tumbled as much as 3.36 percent in its sharpest fall since October 2008 before it pared losses to 2.3 percent. The country's largest grocery chain operators all declined sharply. Loblaw Companies Ltd, which has more than 2,300 corporate, franchised and associate-owned grocery stores and pharmacies across Canada, was down 3.8 percent to C$72.61, after falling as much as 5.8 percent. Empire Company Ltd, which has about 1,500 Canadian stores operating under banners including Sobeys and FreshCo, fell 3.3 percent to C$18.80.

Trump is expected to outline moves meant to reverse the trade-and-travel rapprochement by the Obama administration that will enrich Cuba's  oppressive regime,  senior White House officials said. The new policy will ban most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, including the hotel and hospitality industry, but make some exceptions, including air and sea travel, the officials said. This should shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island. Cruise operator Carnival Corp downplayed any impact from the policy change, saying it was  pleased  its ships could continue to sail to Cuba. American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc , United Continental Holdings Inc and Southwest Airlines Co all declined to comment until Trump makes a formal announcement on Friday afternoon in Miami. JetBlue Airways Corp will review the policy once it becomes formal, but planned to  operate within the policies set by the government.  Obama's initial opening prompted a dash to launch flights into Cuba in mid-2016. Some early entrants, including smaller carriers Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways and Spirit Airlines Inc, have pulled out. Larger U.S. carriers have pared back flights to smaller Cuban cities to focus on the capital, Havana. American, Delta, United, Southwest and JetBlue want to increase the number of flights to Havana. The requests are pending the administration's review. U.S. cruise operators and airlines could lose around $712 million in annual revenues if the Trump administration fully reinstates restrictions on travel, Washington lobby group Engage Cuba said in a recent report. While Trump's new policy avoids the worst-case scenario of cancelling all commercial flights or severing diplomatic relations, it will still be a blow to a travel sector betting on Cuba as a new high-growth market.  It's a huge island,  David Scowsill, chief executive officer of the World Travel & Tourism Council, told reporters before the White House detailed the new policy.  There's lots of potential for U.S. businesses to do business, and of course it's a great leisure destination in the Caribbean for people to go on vacation.  Marriott International Inc on Friday urged the White House to improve relations with post-Castro Cuba and recognize tourism as a strategic tool in the effort. Marriott, the world's biggest hotel chain, operates the Gaviota 5th Avenue Hotel, which is owned by the Cuban military, under its Four Points Sheraton brand. The Trump administration has criticized the Cuban military as repressive and vowed to crack down on financial ties between U.S. businesses and Cuban armed forces. James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, said on Thursday it would be  insane  to revert to policies that could cripple the ability of U.S. businesses to operate on the island, calling it a  betrayal  of Trump's  America First  agenda.  This is bad policy, bad politics and bad for U.S. business,  Williams said.

CIAM said its complaint lodged with a criminal court in Paris on Friday referred to the treatment by Altice of an 80 million euro ($89.4 million) antitrust fine, an office move and its plan to ditch the SFR brand.  We want the court to recognise there has been misuse of the corporate assets to the detriment of minority shareholders,  CIAM managing partner and co-founder Anne-Sophie d'Andlau told Reuters. The court could not be reached for comment outside of business hours. SFR said it had learnt of the complaint through media reports and that it has no merit.  The issues that are allegedly mentioned have been dealt with in accordance with the law, abiding by applicable governance rules,  an SFR spokesman told Reuters. Altice, which owns 91 percent of SFR shares, declined to comment. CIAM owns less than one percent of SFR shares. Activists often take a relatively small stake in the company to give them a platform to argue for change. French antitrust officials imposed a fine last year after it said Altice's Numericable business had taken control of SFR before the deal had been cleared by competition authorities. CIAM said the fine should have been split equally between SFR and Altice and argued that Altice did not pay enough towards the bill. CIAM also cited a decision to give up a 12-year lease on an SFR office building early in favour of a move to a more expensive office in Paris owned by French billionaire and Altice founder Patrick Drahi through a holding company. The move, to be completed by the middle of next year and designed to put all Altice and SFR activities under one roof, would see the rental payments jump from 490 euros per square metre per year to 725 euros per square metre per year, CIAM said. The hedge fund also said it objected to a planned substitution of the SFR brand for the  unknown  Altice brand, which will involve SFR paying an unspecified amount of money to Altice for the use of the brand. The move to rebrand was announced in May and will see SFR and other recent Altice acquisitions, including Portugal Telecom and U.S. cable operators Cablevision and Suddenlink under one unified brand.

Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, the U.N. special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, said the Dominican Republic is a child sex tourism hotspot.   The people who go there for that purpose know that they can do this in relative impunity. That it's easy to get access to children,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation following her first visit to the Caribbean nation last month.  Tourists say, 'well it's easy there, why not.'   Adult prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic. But it is illegal to force, deceive or coerce any adult or child into sexual exploitation - also known as human trafficking -  and the crime carries a prison sentence of up to 30 years. In recent years, the government has stepped up efforts to prosecute tourists and Dominicans for child sex exploitation. But convictions remain low. According to the U.S State Department, government authorities convicted 20 people for human trafficking in 2015. Top Tourist Destination The island's palm-fringed white beaches attract about 6 million visitors a year and tourism is an engine of the economy.  The government's target is to reach 10 million visitors by 2022, and with record high tourist numbers more children could fall prey to sexual exploitation, driven by demand from tourists mainly from the United States, Canada and Europe.  What's really missing is a decisive policy of the government to put this issue of child protection at the core of their tourism strategy,  said de Boer-Buquicchio, who will present her recommendations on combating child sex tourism in the country to the U.N. Human Rights Council next year.  What is really important is that the minister of tourism gets actively involved in this. And that's really the first recommendation.  The Dominican tourism ministry did not respond to requests for an interview. Beach Resorts The Dominican Republic, which shares the Hispaniola island with impoverished Haiti, sees Haitian children crossing the porous border and they are at high risk of being sexually exploited, de Boer-Buquicchio said. Dominican teenagers, mostly aged 15 to 17, who sell food and souvenirs on the beaches of Boca Chica and Sousa are also at risk.  On the beach where I was in Sousa it was really striking .. all you could see there were middle-aged men drinking beer or whatever in the afternoon,  de Boer-Buquicchio said.  There were no families, there were no women. It was just these middle-aged men waiting till it gets dark so that they can conduct their dirty business.  Poor children can be pushed into the sex trade by their own families and local pimps, taxi and motorbike taxi drivers are known to bring children to sex tourists.  I saw it happen with the taxi drivers .. they make money out of it,  the U.N. expert said.  It's all relatively easy.  Underground Motels A 2015 report by rights group, International Justice Mission, found that one in four sex workers in the Dominican Republic on street corners, beaches and parks was under 18.  Despite concern in the government and police force about children being sold for sex, there is a lack of funding, training and staff to tackle the crime, de Boer-Buquicchio said. The hotel industry has signed a code of conduct to prevent adults and children being sexually exploited. At resort receptions it is common to see signs saying:  It is prohibited to take minors into hotel rooms.  But the sexual abuse of children often takes place in private apartments and motels, known as cabanas, where customers can pay for rooms by the hour.  That's a big problem,  de Boer-Buquicchio said.  What I think is necessary for the ministry of tourism to do, is to regulate effectively all commercial activities of the sector.

Housing starts weakened despite a dearth of properties on the market, which is hurting sales and boosting prices. Economists blame shortages of labor and land for the downturn. Demand for housing remains strong, underpinned by a tightening labor market.  The recent stall in homebuilding is bad news for growth,  said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh.  A shortage of construction workers may be weighing on the construction industry, and in some parts of the country short supply of land to build on is also a factor.  Housing starts dropped 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and confounded economists' expectations for a rise to a 1.22 million-unit pace.  Homebuilding fell 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis. Building permits last month fell 4.9 percent to a pace of 1.17 million units, the lowest level since April 2016.  The housing data added to weak reports on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation in tempering expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter. Another report on Friday showed a dip in consumer sentiment in early June. Housing has contributed to gross domestic product for two straight quarters. The Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its estimate for second-quarter GDP to a 2.9 percent annualized rate from a 3.2 percent pace. The economy grew at a 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter. U.S. government bond prices were trading higher, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. The PHLX housing index .HGX dropped 0.23 percent, with shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton(DHI.N), declining 1.12 percent.  U.S. stocks fell as shares of Wal-Mart (WMT.N) and other retailers were hammered after Amazon.com (AMZN.O) announced its entry into the brick-and-mortar retail business with its $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods (WFM.O). FILE PHOTO: A construction worker builds a single family home in San Diego, California, U.S. on February 15, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoBroad Weakness Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, decreased 3.9 percent to a 794,000 unit-pace last month, also the lowest level in eight months. Single-family home construction has lost momentum since racing to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family building permits fell 1.9 percent to a 779,000 unit-rate. The third straight monthly decline in permits left them below the housing starts level, suggesting single-family homebuilding may remain weak in the coming months. Economists blame the moderation on supply constraints rather than demand for housing, which remains underpinned by a strong labor market. With the unemployment rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, workers' wages are gradually rising.  While mortgage rates have risen, they remain low by historical standards. A survey on Thursday showed a dip in homebuilder confidence in June, with homebuilders expressing frustration over ongoing shortages of skilled labor and building lots.   Ongoing job growth, rising demand and low mortgage rates should keep the single-family sector moving forward this year, even as builders deal with ongoing shortages of lots and labor,  said Granger MacDonald, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders. In May, single-family starts surged in the Northeast and  Midwest, but tumbled in the South and West. House completions rose 5.6 percent to a 1.16 million-unit rate, still below the 1.5 million to 1.6 million units range that realtors say is needed to address the chronic housing shortage. There were 1.93 million previously owned houses on the market in April. The demand and supply gap could keep house prices elevated.  Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment also fell in May, declining 9.7 percent to a rate of 298,000 units. It was the fifth straight monthly decline.  With rental increases appearing to have leveled off after strong gains in the last few years, there is likely limited room for strong growth in the construction of multi-family homes. Multi-family permits plunged 10.4 percent to a pace of 389,000 units in May.

The Senate bill, approved on Thursday by a margin of 98-2, includes new sanctions against Russia and Iran. Crucially, it foresees punitive measures against entities that provide material support to Russia in building energy export pipelines. Berlin fears that could pave the way for fines against German and European firms involved in Nord Stream 2, a project to build a pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic. Among the European companies involved in the project are German oil and gas group Wintershall, German energy trading firm Uniper, Royal Dutch Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman described the Senate bill, which must be approved by the House of Representatives and signed by President Donald Trump before it becomes law, as  a peculiar move . He said it was  strange  that sanctions intended to punish Russia for alleged interference in the U.S. elections could also trigger penalties against European companies.  That must not happen,  said the spokesman, Steffen Seibert. In an interview with Reuters, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said Berlin would have to think about counter-measures if Trump backed the plan.  If he does, we'll have to consider what we are going to do against it,  Zypries said. The sharp response from Berlin comes at a time of deep strains in the transatlantic relationship due to shifts in U.S. policy and a more confrontational rhetoric towards Europe under Trump. The new U.S. president has lambasted European partners for not contributing more to NATO, slammed Germany for running a large trade surplus with the United States and broken with allies on climate change with his decision to exit the landmark Paris agreement on combating greenhouse gas emissions. Ironically, the part of the Senate bill that targets Russia was introduced by some of the president's top critics, including Republican hawk John McCain. They are intent on limiting Trump's ability to forge warmer ties with Russia, a key foreign policy pledge during his campaign for the presidency, but one he has been unable to deliver on amid investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Dialogue Breaks Down Under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, Washington and Europe coordinated closely as they ramped up sanctions against Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. But the dialogue has broken down under Trump, who considered easing sanctions against Russia when he first came into office, according to U.S. officials.  I regret that the joint approach of Europe and the United States on Russia and sanctions has been undermined and abandoned in this way,  Zypries told Reuters. France and the European Commission also urged the United States to coordinate with its partners on such matters.  For several years, we have underlined to the United States the difficulties that extraterritorial legislation spark,  a French foreign ministry spokesman told reporters. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, due to start pumping gas from Russia to Europe from 2019, has been dogged by controversy. Eastern European and Baltic states fear it will make them hostage to Russian gas and undercut Ukraine by depriving it of transit fees for Russian gas supplies to Europe. Nordic nations, meanwhile, have security concerns over the pipeline running through territorial waters, where Russia has bolstered its military presence in recent months. Some EU diplomats fear the threat of new measures out of Washington may harden Germany's defense of Nord Stream and complicate already difficult talks among EU nations over whether to seek joint talks with Russia over the pipeline.  This is not helpful now. It tends to stir up desires to protect our territorial space,  one EU diplomat said. The House of Representatives is expected to debate the Senate bill in the coming weeks but it is unclear whether it will come up for a final vote before lawmakers leave Washington at the end of July for their summer recess.

The SFO has been investigating for nearly five years whether commercial agreements between banking group Barclays Plc and Qatari investors as part of a total 12 billion pound ($15 billion) fundraising at the height of the credit crisis breached UK law. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Barclays plans to plead guilty to charges that it failed to make proper disclosures about the fundraising and is braced for a fine, which would likely range from 100 million to 200 million pounds. Barclays and the SFO declined to comment on the Bloomberg report and on the timing of the charging announcement. Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested around 5.3 billion pounds ($6.7 billion) in Barclays in June and October 2008. Authorities have been examining whether payments from Barclays to Qatar at the same time, such as around 322 million pounds in  advisory services agreements  (ASA), alongside a multi-billion-dollar loan, were honest and properly disclosed. The inquiry is one of several legal issues inherited by Barclay's current Chief Executive Jes Staley that date back to the credit crisis. The bank already faces a proposed fine of about 50 million pounds for being  reckless  after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it did not disclose all  advisory services agreements  to Qatar, although that inquiry is ongoing.

Related: * Supermarket stocks fall on announcement   * Competition worries hit Europe grocers * BreakingViews: Amazon checks out * Short sellers hit as Whole Foods shares soar  * Amazon and Whole Foods gain, U.S. supermarkets feel the pain Comments: BRIAN CULPEPPER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT JAMES ADVANTAGE FUNDS, ALPHA, OHIO:  This is a purchase of the distribution network, not the stores. You might still have people who like to physically go to a Whole Foods and pick out their produce, but if Amazon can figure out a way to deliver fresh organic produce at a price that is better than Kroger’s it will hard for others to compete. This also looks like a way to compete with the Blue Aprons and Hello Freshes of the world.... This makes the multiple for every other consumer stock go down. Amazon is slowly dominating every spectrum right now. We think that big box stores might be able to survive, because people still like to go out and touch a new TV or new stereo before they buy it, even if they aren’t getting the best price.  Culpepper owns shares in Wal-Mart and Kroger, and that Kroger “looks to be a pretty good bargain here” after its steep declines this morning. SCOTT CROWE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CENTERSQUARE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, A REAL ASSET INVESTMENT UNIT OF BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP, PHILADELPHIA: “The toughest component of e-commerce is that last mile of distribution, particularly as consumers expect a shorter and shorter window between ordering something online and getting it delivered. So Whole Foods has very insular locations, it has inventory, it has inventory management, it has all the things you need to satisfy the last mile of distribution for Amazon.  What probably has happened is that as Amazon has invested in the business of Amazon Fresh and this concept, they figured out physical retailing is not easy, and there’s value in it, and they were probably looking at lot of what Whole Foods is doing and trying to mimic it and probably decided it was easier to buy Whole Foods because assembling a real estate footprint is a business, it’s s full-time job and it takes a skill set.   This is unequivocally good for retail real estate values, but really selectively. It reinforces the value of better real estate, and it reinforces this bifurcation between better real estate and low quality. “You’ve had the biggest disruptor of physical retail real estate now make a multi-billion dollar investment in physical locations and what it shows you is there is a huge synergy to be had between e-commerce and physical stores, but only for the very best real estate locations.  Retail has value, but for the better-located retail that has value, in order to optimize an e-commerce strategy you need that physical real estate because it’s the way in which you physically interact with your customer. If you look at the U.S. retail market that really only applies to about one-third of the retail real estate market in the United States. At the same time the bottom third is increasingly becoming obsolete.” FOOD AND WATER WATCH, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON CLEAN WATER AND HEALTHY FOODS, WASHINGTON, D.C. - STATEMENT: “Today, Amazon announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Too few companies already exert outsized influence over our food choices. This is extreme consolidation of the food system in action, which will lead to higher prices, fewer choices for consumers, and bigger profits for billionaires like its owner, Jeff Bezos. “The top four grocery retailers already control 62 percent of food sales, raising prices and reducing choices for consumers. This nearly $14 billion takeover would combine the dominant online retailing giant with one of the country’s ten biggest supermarket chains. “Consumers already face substantially reduced options for grocery shopping because of a wave of mega-mergers that have swept the supermarket and grocery manufacturing industry. In recent years, more than 4,000 grocery stores were joined under two owners after the Albertsons-Safeway and Ahold-Delhaize mergers. The proposed Amazon-Whole Foods deal only further curtails consumer choices and raise prices. “The Federal Trade Commission must block this merger to protect consumers from the anti-competitive practices and higher prices of retail grocery monopolies.” AJAY JAIN, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIVOTAL RESEARCH GROUP, NEW YORK  We have felt that the only scenario in which Whole Foods would be acquired was if the acquirer was not valuation sensitive. Clearly Amazon fits that profile. Although Amazon had reportedly taken a look at Whole Foods before and walked away, we feel that the Whole Foods management team is clearly under siege and may have been more receptive to partner with a retailer so admired as Amazon.  Based on the extremely negative sentiment recently expressed by Whole Foods CEO, John Mackey in comments regarding JANA, this outcome is very beneficial to the Whole Foods management team. The buyout avoids a lengthy and highly contentious proxy bottle. In terms of governance issues, John Mackey will retain his leadership position. All of the boxes appear to be checked off from the standpoint of Whole Foods.  We feel that the valuation is more than fair (especially based on Whole Foods’ rapidly deteriorating fundamentals). We will have more comments after digesting these developments further, but the fate of United Natural Foods Inc (SELL) is very shaky under this transaction based on any change of control provisions for Whole Foods under UNFI’s existing supply agreement. We think this is a dream come true for Whole Foods investors. Without the sale to Amazon, we believe that the outlook for Whole Foods would have been increasingly troubled. We don’t see any other obvious strategic buyers coming to the table.  KIM FORREST, SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, PITTSBURGH:  I think supermarkets should be very very worried. It has not been a particularly good decade for them because of deflation.   Look at Kroger's results and it tells you about the deflation. I liked Target last fall with their new emphasis on kids clothing. The part of their business that is grocery made me stay away. It’s really difficult to overcome deflationary effects.   Amazon is going to deliver. This is the thing they've been missing, an ability to get fresh food closer to people. Whole Foods is everywhere Amazon wants to be in cities where people spend money.   They're going to use Whole Foods as a distribution method to get fresh food to the home.   They're trying to replace Fedex and UPS. They should be trading down even lower. You’re going to use Whole Foods as distribution for not only food. You're going to send along that phone or sweater too.   Look for the sickest (supermarkets) and those are likely the ones that are least well off because of this deal. The one that comes to mind is Supervalu. Kroger has some issues too. The sick ones become poison. They're getting thrown out of people's portfolios today.   Packaged food has had a tough time. Nobody shops in the middle of the supermarket any more. This has everything to do with sending fresh food out to people. This just hastens their demise.  “Investors care about novelty. Investors are going to flock to this because this whole idea is novel.  CHRIS SAGERS, TEACHES LAW AT THE CLEVELAND-MARSHALL COLLEGE OF LAW, CLEVELAND, OHIO: “As a matter of policy, should this be blocked? If I'm queen for a day, there should be a challenge to this because there should be a strong presumption against growth by acquisition and in fact there is supposed to be such a presumption in our law. It's what Congress intended.” “Will the Trump administration challenge it? I think the answer is very unlikely.” BRUCE BITTLES, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO, SARASOTA, FLORIDA:  The markets are down, and it looks like the uncertainty over the impact of Amazon on the food industry is upsetting the market. I think that's what's happening this morning. How far and how long that's going to go on, I have no idea. I'm surprised Amazon is up this much because they're going into a business where margins are so slim and we're not really sure if consumer behavior is going to change all that much.   But it certainly is very disruptive for Wal-Mart and Target and some others, and I think that's causing the decline today. Wal-Mart is a big food seller and so the Amazon news is significant because it could be a game changer in terms of how the food industry operates. But it may be an overreaction here because Wal-Mart customers are very different from Whole Foods' customers. So I think (the move) is overdone in probably both Wal-Mart and Target.   It's also a reflection of the whole industry, and how that's all changing because of Amazon and technology.   It's disrupting a number of industries here, and that's what's causing the causing the market problems here.   Amazon's got its tentacles everywhere and that's another place to go. Amazon sees that industry changing significantly – and they see that people don't necessary go to the grocery store anymore.   David Tawil, President, Maglan Capital, New York:  At least as it relates to groceries, we now have an answer that Amazon is serious. And when Amazon is serious, frankly there is no limit to what they can do in terms of disrupting the space... essentially relegating everything that currently exists in the business obsolete.   Everybody orders from Amazon right - it crosses all socio-economic lines. But Amazon doesn't have a particular emphasis on the luxury consumer, and maybe they want that exposure   Who knows what else they (Amazon) might introduce into the stores... those other grocers are just grocers.  TRIP MILLER, MANAGING PARTNER, GULLANE CAPITAL PARTNERS, MEMPHIS, TENN: “I think the first reaction is that this deal is good for Amazon, but bad for everybody else who sells food in a store, which is a pretty obvious first reaction. While we knew that Amazon was interested in getting into the food business and having more brick and mortar locations – they had been testing out grocery stores – this shows a large commitment from them to food and having physical drop off points and distribution points for other products they sell to consumers.  I think this deal helps Amazon potentially in the long term on their shipping side, as Whole Foods locations will provide drop off and pick up points for centralized delivery. I think it’s an interesting fit for Amazon. There is such a focus on healthier, more local food and Amazon is a cutting edge modern company. This puts them right in the forefront of the space.”           JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF RETAIL CONSULTANCY J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WWE IN NEW YORK:   I think that I would not like to be somebody playing in the grocery space right now.  Whole Foods has given up a lot of market share because they didn't capitalize on being the leader in organic, but they still have a footprint. It's a little different when you're Amazon. Whole Foods has to make money, Amazon doesn't have to make money. All Amazon's got to is grow. And now they've got a platform for doing that!  I think we'll see very aggressive pricing out of Amazon in grocery, which will include the Whole Foods component.  ANDREA MURINO, AN ANTITRUST EXPERT WITH THE LAW FIRM GOODWIN PROCTER LLP IN WASHINGTON D.C.:   “You can't think of this as a traditional antitrust problem because people who go to Whole Foods to touch the produce and get the freshest asparagus are not going to shop at Amazon... I don't think there's any direct Amazon Whole Foods direct competition. My guess is that this will get through. On how the Federal Trade Commission responds: “There's an efficiency there but there are big questions about what does it all mean? There are some emerging competition issues here about how Amazon is delivering your life, (even) bringing your news. I just think there will be some curiosity here.”  STAN SHIPLEY, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST AT EVERCORE ISI IN NEW YORK: “There’s a lot of liquidity in capital markets, a lot of money floating around. Whole Foods, which had a failed business model, is vulnerable to being gobbled up by companies with a successful business model a la Amazon.” CHARLIE O’SHEA, LEAD RETAIL ANALYST AT MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE:  Amazon’s announcement this morning that it had agreed to acquire Whole Foods Markets for around $14 billion is a transformative transaction, not just for food retail, but for retail in general.  Implications ripple far beyond the food segment, where dominant players like Wal-Mart, Kroger, Costco, and Target now have to look over their shoulders at the Amazon train coming down the tracks, but also the potential for multi-channel, which Amazon up until now has largely eschewed.   FERNAND DE BOER, ANALYST AT PETERCAM IN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, WHICH HAS A BUY ON DUTCH GROCER AHOLD: “This comes at a moment when the sector is very sensitive to bad news. You had the Kroger profit warning, and people are worried about the entrance of Lidl. So people are very nervous. And then they see this and they think – 'If online is going to kill offline, what am I doing in the sector? Sell.' Whether the reaction is exaggerated or not - it feels exaggerated. When sentiment settles a bit people are going to realize that Ahold can compete just fine.” PHIL BAK, CEO OF ACSI FUNDS, ASSET MANAGER BASED IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, WHICH HAS HOLDINGS OF AMAZON AND WHOLE FOODS:  There is really no limit to how far they (Amazon) can take Whole Foods. What Amazon has proven time and again is that they know how to connect the buying experience with what resonates with customers and with what customers will appreciate and want to continue to return to.  Again we see Amazon leading, and other supermarkets following. How they plan to implement technology in the buying experience remains to be seen.      NEIL SAUNDERS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBALDATA RETAIL IN NEW YORK:  I think it is surprising because it comes out the blue. But I think there is a lot of logic in the deal for both parties. I think for Amazon it gives a real foothold now in the food market which is what they have wanted for a very long time and which to do on their own to build up a substantial presence is very difficult. It gives them that opportunity to really grow their presence in grocery which is what they wanted to do all along.          For Whole Foods it brings an opportunity to really increase operating discipline, to really try to digitalize the offer and to bring technology into stores to increase efficiency which is something they really need to do, because their sales margins are waning and there is an opportunity here for Amazon to bring its expertise and logistics and help them turn around their business.  I think that Amazon has come to the rescue of a retailer in distress.    BRIAN REYNOLDS, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT NEW ALBION PARTNERS, A BROKER DEALER IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK:      If a stock price goes down, like Whole Foods did, that's going to attract activist investors. The deal is not (valued at) the highest price Whole Foods has ever traded at, but it's going significantly above the lows. That illustrates the trend of activists helping to put a floor under stock prices. If the CEO can't get a stock price up, activists will come in to try and do it. That's a huge change from two decades ago. This will put more pressure on grocery stores, especially their CEOs.  TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK:  “That was rumored, I totally dismissed it. Wow. Amazon can pour money into any investment and they don’t need to make money. Investors are used to them not making money. It is $13.7 billion but it is still small relative to the size of the whole company.   It seems like a bit of an odd purchase because it is brick-and-mortar retail. On the other hand it gives them a distribution footprint to deliver goods in a short time frame. Perishable goods and food aren’t always the best when delivered by FedEx. Obviously canned goods are.   It gives them a presence, the stores can be expanded to do other things. Amazon has talked about having a brick-and-mortar retail presence where perhaps people just go in to look at things.   This could be part of that strategy – you take part of a Whole Foods Store and you add in Echo and all the other Amazon products. More and more we will see Amazon brand products as they work to create their own brand at retail.” Reporting By Sam Forgione, Charles Mikolajczak, Jonathan Spicer, Caroline Valetkevitch, Sinead Carew, Herbert Lash, David Randall in New York; Diane Bartz in Washington; Ross Kerber in Boston; Toby Sterling in Amsterdam; Natalie Grover, Anya George Tharakan, Siddharth Cavale, Rishika Sadam, Sruthi Ramakrishnan, Gayathree Ganesan in Bangalore; Editing by Daniel Bases and David Gaffen.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-whole-foods-m-a-amazon-com-views-idUSKBN1971S9"},

Despite that recent stumble, MSCI's gauge of world stock markets is less than 1 percent below its record highs and investors continue to pump money into shares. In the week to Wednesday, global equity funds pulled in $24.6 billion, according to the latest data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and EPFR. That was the biggest week of equity inflows since the U.S. election in November.  Stocks are still attractive. There's still money on the sidelines,  said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Noting that the market has recently weathered lower inflation numbers, a more hawkish Fed and less rosy economic data, he said:  That's indicative that people who are in don't necessarily want to get out.  The June swoon had threatened to put stocks on track for their worst two-week run since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election with pledges of tax cuts and infrastructure spending that enthused investors. Several aspects of that global reflation trade have already unwound -- inflation expectations have fallen, the dollar has given back its post-Trump gains against major currencies, and commodities -- led by oil -- are on the back foot. European and Japanese shares, the darlings at the start of 2017, have reversed all of their outperformance versus other regions, while the sell-off in tech stocks that began with U.S. bellwethers such as Apple and Amazon, was seen by some as a sign of wider problems. Investors put the recent falls at broad index levels down to significant churn between sectors and geographies as funds lock in profits in certain richly valued segments of the market, such as tech, and look to pick up bargains in laggards. But double-digit earnings growth and attractive dividend yields backed by a broadly upbeat global economy are enough to underpin demand for equities, analysts and investors say, adding that any market wobbles into the summer will be a good opportunity to put more cash to work. Not a Damp Cloth Global stocks currently trade at about 16 times forward earnings, in line with their average over the past two decades. Corporate profits, meanwhile, are expected to grow 13 percent over the next year, which is the brightest outlook globally in six years, according to Thomson Reuters data. But patchy U.S. economic data, a more aggressive tightening stance from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, and worries about valuations in stocks most closely geared to economic growth have spurred some shifts in allocations.  Beneath the surface a more nuanced and multi-layered investment backdrop is emerging,  said Michael Ho of UBS Asset Management. Underscoring both the shifts in allocations and wide divergence within regions, a league table of global stock market performance so far in 2017 throws up a contrasting picture compared to previous years. Turkish stocks, beaten down last year over political risks, are the world's best performing major market in U.S. dollar terms. Greek and Spanish stocks, which bore the brunt of concerns around the euro zone a few years ago, are meanwhile battling it out for top spot in Europe, according to BAML. In terms of sectors, the weakness in tech and segments such as industrials, chemicals and capital goods, which are sensitive to the broad economic outlook, has led to a pick up in other, less favoured stocks. Safe-haven sectors such as food and beverages or consumer staples, sometimes considered bond proxies because of their reliable, coupon-like dividend payments, are back in favour. Procter & Gamble shares have rebounded nearly 5 percent over the past month, while in Europe shares of Unilever and Nestle are close to record highs and still comfortably outpacing the broader market's gains. Those moves echo recent warnings by brokers including Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan on valuations on European cyclical stocks. They recommend investors look into buying dividend-yielding telecoms and real estate instead. After a brief hiccup, financials stocks, often with large weightings across global markets, are back in favour. In the United States, a combination of an expected pick-up in lending and lighter regulatory and compliance requirements have made the sector attractive, said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York. Worries that tighter Fed monetary policy might upset the optimism over equities are being set aside for now, with some saying a backdrop of healthy corporate earnings mean investors may view rising interest rates as a sign of a strong economy. “We think as the Fed gets more active it’s going to throw gasoline on a fire and not a damp cloth,” Chiavarone said.

Housing starts weakened despite a dearth of properties on the market, which is hurting sales and boosting prices. Economists blame shortages of labor and land for the downturn. Demand for housing remains strong, underpinned by a tightening labor market.  The recent stall in homebuilding is bad news for growth,  said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh.  A shortage of construction workers may be weighing on the construction industry, and in some parts of the country short supply of land to build on is also a factor.  Housing starts dropped 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and confounded economists' expectations for a rise to a 1.22 million-unit pace.  Homebuilding fell 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis. Building permits last month fell 4.9 percent to a pace of 1.17 million units, the lowest level since April 2016.  The housing data added to weak reports on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation in tempering expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter. Another report on Friday showed a dip in consumer sentiment in early June. Housing has contributed to gross domestic product for two straight quarters. The Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its estimate for second-quarter GDP to a 2.9 percent annualized rate from a 3.2 percent pace. The economy grew at a 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter. U.S. government bond prices were trading higher, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. The PHLX housing index .HGX dropped 0.23 percent, with shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton(DHI.N), declining 1.12 percent.  U.S. stocks fell as shares of Wal-Mart (WMT.N) and other retailers were hammered after Amazon.com (AMZN.O) announced its entry into the brick-and-mortar retail business with its $13.7 billion deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods (WFM.O). FILE PHOTO: A construction worker builds a single family home in San Diego, California, U.S. on February 15, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoBroad Weakness Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, decreased 3.9 percent to a 794,000 unit-pace last month, also the lowest level in eight months. Single-family home construction has lost momentum since racing to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family building permits fell 1.9 percent to a 779,000 unit-rate. The third straight monthly decline in permits left them below the housing starts level, suggesting single-family homebuilding may remain weak in the coming months. Economists blame the moderation on supply constraints rather than demand for housing, which remains underpinned by a strong labor market. With the unemployment rate at a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, workers' wages are gradually rising.  While mortgage rates have risen, they remain low by historical standards. A survey on Thursday showed a dip in homebuilder confidence in June, with homebuilders expressing frustration over ongoing shortages of skilled labor and building lots.   Ongoing job growth, rising demand and low mortgage rates should keep the single-family sector moving forward this year, even as builders deal with ongoing shortages of lots and labor,  said Granger MacDonald, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders. In May, single-family starts surged in the Northeast and  Midwest, but tumbled in the South and West. House completions rose 5.6 percent to a 1.16 million-unit rate, still below the 1.5 million to 1.6 million units range that realtors say is needed to address the chronic housing shortage. There were 1.93 million previously owned houses on the market in April. The demand and supply gap could keep house prices elevated.  Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment also fell in May, declining 9.7 percent to a rate of 298,000 units. It was the fifth straight monthly decline.  With rental increases appearing to have leveled off after strong gains in the last few years, there is likely limited room for strong growth in the construction of multi-family homes. Multi-family permits plunged 10.4 percent to a pace of 389,000 units in May.

Police barred their way and scuffles broke out, a Reuters reporter said. They chanted:  We want justice ,  bring them out  and  shame on you . A larger crowd of people remained outside. Some people then left the building though others remained inside. Tensions in the local community have grown since Wednesday's deadly blaze at the Grenfell Tower in north Kensington which provided social housing for some 600 people. There have been demands for answers as to how the blaze was able to engulf the 24-storey building along with complaints that not enough was being done to provide assistance for those left homeless or information about those still missing. British Prime Minister Theresa May visited the injured in hospital on Friday but is herself under mounting criticism for not meeting victims of the blaze sooner. Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, London mayor Sadiq Khan, Prince William and Queen Elizabeth, 91, have all visited the local area and anger has been growing in the community. While the disaster has prompted an outpouring of generosity, there was also fury at the authorities as the charred tower was cast as a deadly symbol of a divided society.

Though large, e-commerce still only represents a small fraction of overall grocery shopping. South Koreans do the most shopping online, according to a report last year by Kantar Worldpanel, which said online accounted for 17 percent of overall grocery sales there. Japan and Britain are No. 2 and 3, both clocking in at around 7 percent.

Kemal Kilicdaroglu, 68, head of the secularist Republican People's Party (CHP), set out on the march on Thursday after Enis Berberoglu was jailed for 25 years on spying charges. He was seen off by thousands of supporters and has garnered much attention in a country where government dominates the media. Kilicdaroglu trudged along a highway outside Ankara on Friday dressed in dark slacks and blue shirt. Sunburned and wearing a cap, he carried a sign that said  Justice .     Rights groups and government critics, including members of Kilicdaroglu's CHP, say Turkey is sliding toward authoritarianism, citing a crackdown that followed last year's failed coup that has seen more than 50,000 people jailed and  150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs.  I advise Kilicdaroglu to desist from this act,  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters.  Justice cannot be sought on the streets, Turkey is a state of law... Even if we don't like a court's ruling, we have to respect it.  Berberoglu was accused of giving the Cumhuriyet newspaper a video it used as the basis of a May 2015 report that alleged trucks owned by the state intelligence service (MIT)were stopped and found to contain arms and ammunition headed for Syria.  Berberoglu is the first CHP lawmaker to be jailed in the government crackdown, which has seen eleven members of parliament from the pro-Kurdish opposition party jailed.

It is not possible to break the balance of the scales of justice by walking on roads,  Bekir Bozdag said.  Erdogan acknowledged the trucks belonged to the MIT but said they carried aid to ethnic Turkmens battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State, and not weapons for rebels. Erdogan accused Cumhuriyet's editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul of undermining Turkey's reputation and vowed Dundar would  pay a heavy price .  Last year, Dundar and Gul were sentenced to at least five years jail in a related case. The prosecutor is now seeking another 10 years for the two over the report on the trucks.

The proposed changes have proved divisive in the ex-Soviet nation ahead of a parliamentary election next year, when parties who favor closer integration with the European Union will fight it out with pro-Moscow rivals. At the moment, Moldova elects its parliament under a proportional representation system. The ruling pro-European Democratic Party wants a mixed system, with some lawmakers elected, as now, on party lists, and others running in first-past-the-post constituency races. On Friday, the Venice Commission, a body that rules on rights and democracy disputes in Europe, decided to accept the conclusion of external experts, who said the new system could be susceptible to undue influence by vested interests. Their report  raises 'significant concerns' including the risk that constituency members of parliament would be vulnerable to being influenced by business interests,  the commission said in a statement. Like neighboring Ukraine, Moldova has become the subject of a tug of war for influence between Russia and the West. It has a trade pact with the European Union and its government says it wants even closer integration, but President Igor Dodon, a frequent visitor to Russia, has said Moldova should focus instead on building ties with Moscow. Earlier in June, Andrian Candu, the speaker of the Moldovan parliament and a member of the Democratic Party, told Reuters he disagreed with the conclusions of the experts' report, but would work with the Venice Commission on its technical recommendations.  European member states of the commission are committed to respecting its decisions, but Candu said the body should  not ... interfere in what we consider to be the sovereign choice of the country.  Supporters of the electoral change say having legislators represent particular constituencies would enhance the link between parliament and voters. Opponents say it is an attempt to skew the electoral system in favor of the Democratic Party. Last Sunday, several thousand people took part in demonstrations across Moldova, protesting both in favor of and against the proposed changes. Moldova has seen three governments fall since 2015, after the disappearance of $1 billion from the banking system plunged the country, Europe's poorest, into political and economic chaos.

It is nearing conclusion,  the U.S. administration official told Reuters of the investigation, ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump in April under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The law, which has been used twice before - to investigate oil in 1999 and iron and steel in 2001 - allows the president to impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. The administration says the lack of domestic producers could impede U.S. defense procurement for its armed forces as well as for strategically important infrastructure. Foreign steel companies have been concerned the probe may be aimed at shoring up American producers and cutting out foreign competition. The protectionist move would also shore up jobs, a Trump campaign pledge. Administration officials are expected to brief the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees on the  context and process  of the inquiry before its findings are released. European steel association (Eurofer) chief Axel Eggert said the European Commission was concerned that EU steel exports could be included in the broad scope of the investigation. He said the association was exploring options, including submitting a complaint to the World Trade Organization.  The EU is a NATO partner of the U.S., therefore this doesn't make sense. The EU should have a full exemption from 232 measures,  Eggert told Reuters.  We fear there could be a broad application of section 232 that would be reason enough to provoke a reaction from the EU under WTO rules. The Commission is looking into all the options,  he added. Possible Tariffs There has been concern that Chinese producers have routed steel and aluminum through countries such as Vietnam to avoid U.S. duties and scrutiny. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire businessman who made part of his fortune investing in steel, coal and autos, said the investigation had been spurred by the fact that Chinese exports of steel made up 26 percent of the U.S. market for the metal. China is the largest national steel producer and makes far more of the metal than it consumes. It sells excess output overseas, often undercutting the prices offered by producers in the importing nations, according to U.S. steel companies and officials. Ross has said that if the Commerce inquiry finds the U.S. steel industry has been hurt by excessive steel imports, he would recommend retaliatory measures that could include tariffs. Still, Tu Xinquan, a trade expert at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics, said the United States was not a major export market for Chinese steel.  China does not have to worry about it so much,  Tu said,  there are many other countries which will be even more angry than us.  Deborah Elms, who runs the Asian Trade Centre consultancy from Singapore, said U.S. retaliatory steps would hurt American firms.  The collateral damage is going to be very significant,  said Elms,  It will probably hurt the Americans in ways they don't seem to grasp and catch firms that are paying absolutely no attention at all completely by surprise.  U.S. steel companies' share prices have dropped off since the euphoria of Trump's win in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. In the month following his victory, the S&P; 1500 steel index surged 36 percent. The index has given up the bulk of those gains, and is now up about 5 percent since early November, underperforming a 13.7 percent advance in the broader U.S. stock benchmark, the S&P; 500. Earnings from U.S. Steel Corp have disappointed as well, and the outlook from Nucor Corp was downbeat.

Despite improved survival rates overall, the rise in new diagnoses of liver cancer means that death rates are still increasing faster than for any other cancer type, the study team writes in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.  “Liver cancer is one of the few cancers for which death rates are increasing, even though many of the risk factors for the disease are avoidable or treatable. It also continues to be one of the most fatal cancers, with only about 1 in 5 patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis,” study author Kimberly Miller told Reuters Health by email. “Large racial and socioeconomic disparities in liver cancer death rates still exist, reflecting differences in the prevalence of risk factors and, to some extent, inequalities in access to high quality care,” added Miller, an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society in Atlanta. The researchers examined nationwide data on incidence, mortality and survival rates for cancers of the liver and bile duct between the years 1990 and 2012, and focused on differences in these categories by region, race or ethnicity.  Rates of death from liver cancers ranged from 5.5 per 100,000 population in non-Hispanic whites to 11.9 per 100,000 in American Indians/Alaska Natives, the study found.  The lowest death rates were in North Dakota, at 3.8 per 100,000, and the highest were in the District of Columbia with 9.6 per 100,000. “The rise in rates of new liver cancer cases has been largely driven by the higher hepatitis C virus prevalence among baby boomers (those born between 1945 and 1965),” Miller noted. “However, the obesity epidemic and rising diabetes prevalence among the general population have also likely contributed.” Death rates are rising because liver cancer continues to be a highly fatal disease, she said.  Racial disparities in liver cancer rates are largely driven by differences in risk factor prevalence, but also in part by healthcare inequalities, she added. “For example, while some risk factors (like hepatitis B and C virus infections) can be treated, these treatments are not always affordable for the populations that are most likely to be affected.” It is particularly striking that while a similar proportion of liver cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage among blacks and whites, overall liver cancer survival is notably lower in blacks, who have been shown in studies to be much less likely to receive surgical treatment and liver transplantation for early stage disease, even when they are eligible, Miller said. In addition to chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection, factors that increase liver cancer risk include cigarette smoking, metabolic disorders (such as type 2 diabetes and obesity), and heavy alcohol use, she said. “Many of these risk factors are avoidable or treatable. It is important to be aware of what your risk factors are and to talk to your health care provider about what you can do to lower your risk.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends one-time hepatitis C virus testing for those who were born between 1945 and 1965, but only 14 percent of baby boomers have been tested, Miller noted. “I agree and support most of the result and the conclusion,” said Dr. Ping Gu, an oncologist at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.  Gu, who sees a diverse population of patients, says he saw a least 50 liver cancer patients last year. Hepatitis B is the main cause of liver cancer for the Asian population, he added. As far as prevention, hepatitis B vaccinations are extremely helpful, and tougher screening tests on blood donations have virtually eliminated the risk of hepatitis C from transfusions, Gu said. Another preventable risk factor is obesity, which Gu said he sees “more and more” among Hispanic patients, and smoking, which is still too common in Asian communities. “I would say in Asian population, especially in Japan, Korea, and the Chinese, the male smoking rate is very high,” he said.

After a tumultuous week that pitched Britain into its deepest political crisis since the Brexit referendum a year ago, May's future was uncertain due to her botched gamble on a snap election and a muted response to a deadly fire in London. Fighting for her political survival, May has been trying to strike a deal with a small Northern Irish Protestant party to avoid a second election that could delay Brexit talks and damage the $2.5 trillion economy. While she is ultimately expected to reach a deal, a source in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) told Reuters that an agreement to support her minority government was not likely before next week. The price of such a deal remains unclear.  If there is the expected positive outcome, it will be at least the start of next week before anything is signed off,  a DUP source told Reuters. Having lost a majority in parliament, May needs the DUP's 10 lawmakers to win any kind of vote, including on the pieces of legislation needed to enact Britain's divorce from the EU. When asked if a deal was in the making, DUP leader Arlene Foster told reporters in Dublin:  I think you know it takes two to tango and we're ready to dance.  A source in May's Conservative Party said talks continued on Friday. The party has refused to give a time frame for reaching a deal, though May is due in Brussels for an EU summit on June 22-23 when she will want to show she has a solid grip on power. Besides forging a deal to keep her job and preparing for Brexit talks, May is also grappling with a crisis over the breakdown in power-sharing between the pro-British DUP and the Catholic nationalist Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland's separate, devolved government. She is also trying to contain outrage at home over a London tower block fire which left at least 30 people dead. After facing criticism for not meeting survivors on Thursday, May visited a hospital on Friday to speak to some of the people who escaped the fire. While European leaders try to gauge what to expect from the Brexit talks due to begin in Brussels on Monday, May is so weakened that her own Brexit strategy is the subject of public debate in her own party, and by her potential allies.  We want to see a Brexit that works for everybody, not just in Northern Ireland from my perspective but in the Republic of Ireland as well, so it is about a sensible Brexit,  DUP leader Foster told reporters.  Sensible Brexit  May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of the divorce. But her vulnerability at home means that her plan to leave the EU's lucrative single market and customs union in order to impose strict limits on immigration is under intense scrutiny. Prompted by her poor election showing, particularly among pro-EU young people who fear losses of jobs and opportunity for Brexit, some of her most senior ministers and two former Conservative prime ministers have called for a rethink. May's finance minister, Philip Hammond, said on Friday that Britain should prioritise protecting jobs and economic growth.  My clear view, and I believe the view of the majority of people in Britain, is that we should prioritise protecting jobs, protecting economic growth, protecting prosperity as we enter those negotiations and take them forward,  Hammond said.  As we enter negotiations next week, we will do so in a spirit of cooperation, taking a pragmatic approach, trying to find a solution that works both for the UK and the European Union 27,  he told reporters before a meeting of the 28 EU finance ministers in Luxembourg. Britain's Brexit ministry said on Friday that no deal could be struck on exiting unless the future relationship with the bloc was taken into account.  Our view is that a withdrawal agreement and terms of the future relationship must be agreed alongside each other,  a spokesman for Britain's Brexit ministry said.  We believe that the withdrawal process cannot be concluded without the future relationship also being taken into account. The withdrawal and future are intimately linked.  EU leaders have given chief Brussels negotiator Michel Barnier no authority to so much as talk about future trade with Britain until he clinches outline deals on Brussels' priority issues, including London's exit bill. Addressing her party on Monday after one of its most memorable electoral failures, May said she would take a broader, more consultative approach to the Brexit talks. But after a generation of discord over Europe inside her party, May's future could depend on her ability to please both the eurosceptic and pro-European factions in her party.

The stock weighed the most on the S&P; 500 and the Dow.  Dominant players like Wal-Mart, Kroger, Costco, and Target now have to look over their shoulders at the Amazon train coming down the tracks,  said Charlie O'Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody's Investors Service. Kroger was the biggest loser on the S&P; 500, down 14 percent; while Sprouts Farmers Market was off nearly 10 percent.  I would not like to be somebody playing in the grocery space right now,  said Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of retail consultancy firm J. Rogers Kniffen WWE in New York. The S&P; 500 consumer staples tumbled 1.7 percent - its biggest drop since November last year. At 11:03 a.m. ET (1503 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 35.58 points, or 0.17 percent, at 21,324.32, the S&P; 500 was down 7.48 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,424.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 32.00 points, or 0.52 percent, at 6,133.50. Six of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower. Technology was the second-biggest loser after consumer staples, led by losses in Microsoft and Apple. The sector, which had surged 17.4 percent in 2017, is on track for its second straight week of decline as investors booked profits amid worries of stretched valuations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,547 to 1,171. On the Nasdaq, 1,769 issues fell and 872 advanced.

Islamic State snipers are shooting at families trying to flee on foot or by boat across the Tigris River, it said.  These civilians are basically held as human shields in the Old City,  said the UNHCR representative in Iraq, Bruno Geddo, referring to Mosul's historic district where the militants are besieged by Iraqi government forces.   There is hardly any food, water, electricity, fuel. These civilians are living in an increasingly worsening situation of penury and panic because they are surrounded by fighting.  The offensive to retake Mosul, Islamic State's de facto capital in Iraq, started on Oct. 17 with air and ground support from a U.S.-led international coalition.  Iraqi government forces regained eastern Mosul in January, then a month later began the offensive on the western side that includes the Old City. The Old City  is a very dense labyrinth, a maze of narrow alleyways where fighting will have to be done on foot, house by house,  said Geddo. Displaced civilians walk towards the Iraqi Army positions after fleeing their homes due to clashes in the Shifa neighbourhood in western Mosul, Iraq June 15 2017.Erik De Castro ISIS (Islamic State) snipers continue to aim at people trying to flee because there is this long-standing policy of executing people trying to flee the territory of the caliphate,  he said. The fall of Mosul would, in effect, mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate  that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared in a speech from an historic mosque in the Old City three years ago, covering parts of Iraq and Syria. Moscow said on Friday its forces may have killed Baghdadi in an air strike in Syria last month, but Washington said it could not corroborate the death and Western and Iraqi officials were skeptical. About 200,000 people were estimated to be trapped behind Islamic State lines in Mosul in May, but the number has declined as government forces have thrust further into the city. About 800,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war population of the northern Iraqi city, have fled, seeking refuge with friends and relatives or in camps. UNHCR has provided many with shelter, food and other necessities.  Geddo voiced deep concern about  collective punishment  of families whose relative may have been an IS fighter.  Collective punishment means in a deeply tribal society that you see evictions, destruction of property, confiscation of property for families perceived as being associated with ISIS because one family member might have been having that link.  This is a very critical point for the future of Iraq.  Because it is essential to uphold the rule of law, to pursue those who committed crimes through the court system, the judicial system, rather than applying tribal custom,  he said.

Most euro zone yields were a touch lower on the day after heavy selling on Thursday on the prospect of tighter monetary policy in the United States and Britain. The spotlight was back on the bloc after a late deal on Thursday that allows indebted Greece to avoid a default on bailout repayments due next month. Some analysts said the agreement could open the door for the European Central Bank to start buying Greek government bonds under its stimulus scheme in the coming weeks, and possibly pave the way for a return to markets. The ECB needs more clarity on what kind of debt relief Greece will get from its international creditors if it is to buy Greek bonds as part of its stimulus programme, a source close to the matter said on Friday. A French proposal to help bridge differences on debt relief is expected to underpin further euro zone discussions and the International Monetary Fund said it would join the existing bailout, offering Athens a standby arrangement of less than $2 billion.  This is a major step forward, in our view, coming after many months of uncertainty,  HSBC European economist Fabio Balboni said.  The deal should pave the way for the ECB to include Greece in its QE (quantitative easing) programme, which in turn should unlock access to markets for Greece, putting the country on the right track towards exiting the bailout programme next year.  Greek 2-year bond yields fell 20 basis points to 4.76 percent, their lowest level since October 2014, while 10-year yields fell a similar amount to a low of 5.64 percent, the lowest since May 22. In Athens, the benchmark stock index rose more than 1 percent to its highest level since June 2015 at one stage and was up 0.8 percent at the close. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Friday the deal strengthened confidence in markets, while a German government spokesman said it would help restore Greek competitiveness. Greece will return to markets once its borrowing costs drop below 5 percent, sources told Reuters this month. That could happen if the ECB includes Greek bonds in the 2.3 trillion stimulus scheme. Still, some analysts were sceptical about Greece's inclusion in the programme.  If the ECB started buying GGBs (Greek government bonds), this would fuel another tightening leg in the bond market,  Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger said.  But as this process will likely drag into the ECB's tapering phase, I'm sceptical whether they will be buying GGBs at all while QE is still on.  Outside Greece, bond yields were slightly lower towards the end of the day, with German 10-year government bond yields down a basis point at 0.28 percent.

However, Wal-Mart's shares fell about 7 percent to $73.65 in morning trading after Amazon unveiled a $13.7 billion deal to buy upmarket grocer Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O). A slew of other retailers' shares also fell on the news, including shares of Kroger Co (KR.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Europe's Tesco Plc (TSCO.L) and Carrefour (CARR.PA).  When Amazon is serious, frankly, there is no limit to what they can do in terms of disrupting the space ... essentially relegating everything that currently exists in the business obsolete,  said David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital. Amazon's deal to buy Whole Foods comes as Wal-Mart is engaged in a price war with rivals such as Aldi and Kroger in the grocery segment, which makes up about 56 percent of Wal-Mart's revenue. Amazon's move only adds to the pressure on Wal-Mart, as over time, the convenience and grocery delivery offered by the e-commerce giant would likely cut into Wal-Mart's sales, said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics. However, analysts said other retailers such as Kroger would be hit harder by Amazon's latest bet.

Online Shopping Spree Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, has been beefing up its online presence to better compete with online rival Amazon. Wal-Mart bought internet retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion last year in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. In the first three months of 2017, Wal-Mart snapped up online women's fashion retailer ModCloth, outdoor clothing and gear retailer Moosejaw and footwear retailer Shoebuy. Wal-Mart said Bonobos's clothes and accessories will be offered on Jet.com. The acquisition is expected to close toward the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third quarter of Wal-Mart's fiscal year ending January 2018, the company said. Technology news website Recode reported in April that Wal-Mart was in talks to buy Bonobos and that the company generated $100 million to $150 million in annual revenue.

Housing starts dropped 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units in May, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the lowest since September 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a rate of 1.22 million units.     Analysts said the data compounded concerns about the underlying health of the U.S. economy after government figures  on inflation and retail sales for May, released on Wednesday, fell well short of market expectations.     The data also reinforced traders' doubts, analysts said, that the Fed would be able to hike again later this year, as the central bank projected Wednesday, when it raised interest rates for the second time in 2017.      If housing is weak, then economic growth is going to be weaker, too,  said Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.  The Fed may be a little more cautious hiking in that environment.      Benchmark 10-year Treasuries were last up 2/32 in price to yield 2.153 percent, compared with 2.162 percent late Thursday. Two-year Treasuries were last up 2/32 in price to yield 1.319 percent, compared with 1.355 percent late Thursday.      Traders are particularly concerned about soft U.S. inflation readings, which have been viewed as an obstacle to the Fed's plan, outlined on Wednesday, to start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, while raising rates for a third time this year.       Really, what’s causing the markets to be somewhat skeptical of the Fed’s hiking path is that inflation has been trending downwards,  said Praveen Korapaty, global head of rates at Credit Suisse in New York.      There is some weakness in other data as well, but from my perspective the critical thing is the trajectory of inflation.      Korapaty said, however, that he expects inflation to recover and that Credit Suisse expects the Fed to start paring its balance sheet in September and increase rates again in December.     Yields on Treasuries maturing between two and 30 years were set for weekly declines after rising the previous week. Benchmark 10-year yields were set to fall about five basis points for the week.

However, Wal-Mart's shares fell about 7 percent to $73.65 in morning trading after Amazon unveiled a $13.7 billion deal to buy upmarket grocer Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O). A slew of other retailers' shares also fell on the news, including shares of Kroger Co (KR.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Europe's Tesco Plc (TSCO.L) and Carrefour (CARR.PA).  When Amazon is serious, frankly, there is no limit to what they can do in terms of disrupting the space ... essentially relegating everything that currently exists in the business obsolete,  said David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital. Amazon's deal to buy Whole Foods comes as Wal-Mart is engaged in a price war with rivals such as Aldi and Kroger in the grocery segment, which makes up about 56 percent of Wal-Mart's revenue. Amazon's move only adds to the pressure on Wal-Mart, as over time, the convenience and grocery delivery offered by the e-commerce giant would likely cut into Wal-Mart's sales, said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics. However, analysts said other retailers such as Kroger would be hit harder by Amazon's latest bet.  Wal-Mart has prepared for this day,  said Michelle Grant, head of retailing at Euromonitor International. A Wal-Mart cart is seen at the parking lot of a Wal-Mart market in Miami, Florida May18, 2010.Carlos BarriaWhole Foods customers had been happy to shop at other retailers including Wal-Mart, for similar products at lower prices, but it was unlikely that a Wal-Mart customer would shop at Whole Foods, even if the upmarket grocer were to cut prices, Grant said. Online Shopping Spree Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, has been beefing up its online presence to better compete with online rival Amazon. Wal-Mart bought internet retailer Jet.com for about $3 billion last year in the largest-ever deal for an e-commerce startup. In the first three months of 2017, Wal-Mart snapped up online women's fashion retailer ModCloth, outdoor clothing and gear retailer Moosejaw and footwear retailer Shoebuy. Wal-Mart said Bonobos's clothes and accessories will be offered on Jet.com. The acquisition is expected to close toward the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third quarter of Wal-Mart's fiscal year ending January 2018, the company said. Technology news website Recode reported in April that Wal-Mart was in talks to buy Bonobos and that the company generated $100 million to $150 million in annual revenue.

The deal, which puts a 27 percent premium on Whole Foods' closing share price on Thursday, would could give the grocer a major competitive edge by allowing it to tap into Amazon's massive power to buy and sell goods at a lower cost. Whole Foods recently had come under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, prompting it to overhaul its board.  I think that this takes all of the pressure off Whole Foods and gives Whole Foods the opportunity to revitalize that business and of course it stems the criticism from all of these activist investors,  said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail in New York. The deal values Whole Foods at $42 per share. The shares were trading just under that level in early trading, while Amazon's shares were up 0.9 percent at $997.41. Excluding debt, the deal is valued at $13.39 billion, based on 318.9 million diluted shares outstanding as of April 9. The grocer will continue to operate stores under the Whole Foods Market brand, the companies said. John Mackey will continue as chief executive of Whole Foods, and the company's headquarters will remain in Austin, Texas.

The e-commerce titan is going whole hog for U.S. groceries with the $13.7 billion acquisition of upscale chain Whole Foods Market. Amazon's comfort with low margins and savvy in logistics make it so fearsome a rival that investors in the sector ran for cover.   A relentless focus on the long-run opportunity of selling practically everything to everyone has been the hallmark of Amazon founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. For most of its history, the nearly half-trillion-dollar company has been run at break-even with its prodigious cash flow plowed back into price reductions, expansion into new areas and investment to ensure faster delivery.  Groceries are therefore a natural target. Americans spend about $800 billion a year on their Cheerios, kale and ground beef, according to Cowen research. It’s also a business whose profitability is notoriously low. Whole Foods, for example, generated a net margin of 3.2 percent last year. That's astronomical by Amazon's standards. Its own margin was 1.7 percent.   The deal nevertheless marks some seismic shifts. For one thing, it is Amazon's biggest acquisition ever by a considerable sum. While Bezos has been tinkering with rolling out bookshops, Whole Foods vastly increases Amazon's bricks-and-mortar presence with 460 stores. And the deal expands Amazon's workforce by about a quarter.  In exchange for this strategic deviation, Amazon gets access to a slew of wealthy customers and information about their food-buying habits. Bezos could easily extend the benefits of his company's popular Prime membership into goods and services at grocery stores, thus giving them additional reason to buy even more from Amazon. It also has been trying to shrink shipping costs. Amazon lost $7 billion subsidizing deliveries last year. Having customers pick up their purchases in Whole Foods stores might help.  There's a strong sense from investors that Amazon is upending the entire business. Its own market value increased by $15 billion on the news. More significantly, it caused some $30 billion to disappear from Costco, Wal-Mart Stores, Kroger, Supervalu and other grocery vendors. Fears of Amazon's domination went global, with UK supermarket chains getting hit, too. And it's possible that delivery startups such as Instacart may be affected. Groceries aren't a winner-take-all proposition, but Amazon may be about to eat a lot of lunches.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The Fed, he said, may be  erroneously  forecasting an increase in inflation based on tight labor markets, making a mistake that could lock the U.S. economy into lower inflation for longer.  On Wednesday the Fed lifted its target for short-term borrowing costs by a quarter of a percent. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she expects inflation, which dipped lower in recent months, to move back up toward the Fed's 2-percent target over the medium term. Tighter labor markets, she said, would put that needed upward pressure on inflation.  Kashkari, in his essay, said that in effect he does not share that expectation.

The central bank trimmed the key rate to 9.00 percent from 9.25 percent, in the third consecutive cut this year. Presenting the decision, Central Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said annual inflation had neared its long-awaited goal of 4 percent as inflationary expectations among households had fallen to an all-time low in May.  It is important to form trust among all economic agents in our capability to ensure that inflation stays close to the 4 percent target for a long time,  Nabiullina said, describing the rate decision as unanimous.  That is why our approach to lowering the key rate will remain considered and cautious,  said Nabiullina, who for years has successfully shrugged off numerous calls from business leaders and policymakers for deeper rate cuts to kick-start the economy. Analysts had been split between predicting a rate cut of 25 or 50 basis points: Fifteen out of 23 analysts and economists polled by Reuters this week said they expected the central bank to cut the key rate to 8.75 percent. The rest saw a 25 basis point cut, however. Nabiullina said she would not rule out putting the rate-cutting cycle on hold for more than one board meeting.  Comments from the Russian central bank today appear to be aimed at dampening hopes that the pace of monetary easing might be stepped up,  analysts at Capital Economics said in a research note. While the policy rate is likely to be cut in small steps, inflation at post-Soviet lows paves the way for a lengthy easing cycle, they said. The central bank said in its statement it saw room for cutting the key rate in the second half of 2017. By the end of the year, the central bank is expected to bring the key rate to 8-8.25 percent, according to a Reuters poll. The central bank's monetary policy chief Igor Dmitriev told Reuters this month that market expectations about rate cuts generally matched the bank's own view. The central bank also said on Friday a possible tax manoeuvre by the government and a recovery in consumer demand carried upside risks for inflation, strengthening the case for prudent easing. Lower interest rates could support an economic recovery by making lending cheaper, while also depriving the rouble of support from carry trade operations where investors borrow dollars cheaply and buy into high-yielding rouble assets. The rouble firmed briefly to 57.6 versus the dollar after the rate decision before falling back to the level of 57.7 seen before the move. Also on Friday, the central bank increased its economic growth forecast to 1.3-1.8 percent in 2017 from 1.0-1.5 percent growth predicted earlier. It also stuck to its forecast that prices for oil would average $50 per barrel this year, before sliding to $40 in the future. The central bank's next rate meeting, which will not be accompanied by a Nabiullina press conference, is scheduled for July 28.

F1 is not an environment where anyone can say loudly, 'I'm safe'. To a certain degree there are two questions. There is Jo, and there is a second driver. Right now my focus is on Jo. Jo has to deliver.  The fact is that Jo has a car which is a point-scoring car, and he has to enter into the points. Full stop.  Renault are currently seventh in the championship and Abiteboul said he hoped to go into the August break, after four more races, having moved up to sixth. The Frenchman set a pre-season target of finishing the year in the top five with possible podium finishes. Hulkenberg has scored points in four races so far since moving to Renault from Force India at the end of last year with a best of sixth in Spain. He was eighth in Canada last weekend.  We see that there is a very substantial gap between Nico and Jo in qualifying, and in the race,  said Abiteboul.  We are discussing on a regular basis obviously with Jo to see how he can improve.  Renault tested their ex-driver Robert Kubica in Spain, with the Pole, who has not raced in Formula One since he partially severed his forearm in a 2011 rally crash, making a good impression and doing 115 laps. They also have Russian Sergey Sirotkin as a development driver.

World Cup holders Germany and the six winners of FIFA confederations descend on Russia for the two-week tournament that will allow the hosts to assess the readiness of four of its World Cup venues and its ability to handle fans from overseas. Russia is set to host the 2018 World Cup in 12 stadiums spread across 11 cities, including Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi. Russia take on New Zealand in St. Petersburg in the first match of the eight-nation Confederations Cup on a pitch that had to be hastily relaid after football officials deplored its quality when it cut up badly during a match there in April.   The preparations are now complete. Russia is ready,  Colin Smith, director of competitions for global soccer body FIFA, said at a news conference in St. Petersburg on Friday.   It's a useful test, as are any of our tournaments, to streamline our processes and operations.   Smith acknowledged that Russia had done  some intense fine-tuning  ahead of the tournament.

A huge amount of preparatory work has been done,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday.

Related: * Supermarket stocks fall on announcement   * Competition worries hit Europe grocers * BreakingViews: Amazon checks out * Short sellers hit as Whole Foods shares soar  * Amazon and Whole Foods gain, U.S. supermarkets feel the pain Comments: BRIAN CULPEPPER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT JAMES ADVANTAGE FUNDS, ALPHA, OHIO:  This is a purchase of the distribution network, not the stores. You might still have people who like to physically go to a Whole Foods and pick out their produce, but if Amazon can figure out a way to deliver fresh organic produce at a price that is better than Kroger’s it will hard for others to compete. This also looks like a way to compete with the Blue Aprons and Hello Freshes of the world.... This makes the multiple for every other consumer stock go down. Amazon is slowly dominating every spectrum right now. We think that big box stores might be able to survive, because people still like to go out and touch a new TV or new stereo before they buy it, even if they aren’t getting the best price.  Culpepper owns shares in Wal-Mart and Kroger, and that Kroger “looks to be a pretty good bargain here” after its steep declines this morning. SCOTT CROWE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CENTERSQUARE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, A REAL ASSET INVESTMENT UNIT OF BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP, PHILADELPHIA: “The toughest component of e-commerce is that last mile of distribution, particularly as consumers expect a shorter and shorter window between ordering something online and getting it delivered. So Whole Foods has very insular locations, it has inventory, it has inventory management, it has all the things you need to satisfy the last mile of distribution for Amazon.  What probably has happened is that as Amazon has invested in the business of Amazon Fresh and this concept, they figured out physical retailing is not easy, and there’s value in it, and they were probably looking at lot of what Whole Foods is doing and trying to mimic it and probably decided it was easier to buy Whole Foods because assembling a real estate footprint is a business, it’s s full-time job and it takes a skill set.   This is unequivocally good for retail real estate values, but really selectively. It reinforces the value of better real estate, and it reinforces this bifurcation between better real estate and low quality. “You’ve had the biggest disruptor of physical retail real estate now make a multi-billion dollar investment in physical locations and what it shows you is there is a huge synergy to be had between e-commerce and physical stores, but only for the very best real estate locations.  Retail has value, but for the better-located retail that has value, in order to optimize an e-commerce strategy you need that physical real estate because it’s the way in which you physically interact with your customer. If you look at the U.S. retail market that really only applies to about one-third of the retail real estate market in the United States. At the same time the bottom third is increasingly becoming obsolete.” FOOD AND WATER WATCH, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON CLEAN WATER AND HEALTHY FOODS, WASHINGTON, D.C. - STATEMENT: “Today, Amazon announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Too few companies already exert outsized influence over our food choices. This is extreme consolidation of the food system in action, which will lead to higher prices, fewer choices for consumers, and bigger profits for billionaires like its owner, Jeff Bezos. “The top four grocery retailers already control 62 percent of food sales, raising prices and reducing choices for consumers. This nearly $14 billion takeover would combine the dominant online retailing giant with one of the country’s ten biggest supermarket chains. “Consumers already face substantially reduced options for grocery shopping because of a wave of mega-mergers that have swept the supermarket and grocery manufacturing industry. In recent years, more than 4,000 grocery stores were joined under two owners after the Albertsons-Safeway and Ahold-Delhaize mergers. The proposed Amazon-Whole Foods deal only further curtails consumer choices and raise prices. “The Federal Trade Commission must block this merger to protect consumers from the anti-competitive practices and higher prices of retail grocery monopolies.” AJAY JAIN, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, PIVOTAL RESEARCH GROUP, NEW YORK  We have felt that the only scenario in which Whole Foods would be acquired was if the acquirer was not valuation sensitive. Clearly Amazon fits that profile. Although Amazon had reportedly taken a look at Whole Foods before and walked away, we feel that the Whole Foods management team is clearly under siege and may have been more receptive to partner with a retailer so admired as Amazon.  Based on the extremely negative sentiment recently expressed by Whole Foods CEO, John Mackey in comments regarding JANA, this outcome is very beneficial to the Whole Foods management team. The buyout avoids a lengthy and highly contentious proxy bottle. In terms of governance issues, John Mackey will retain his leadership position. All of the boxes appear to be checked off from the standpoint of Whole Foods.  We feel that the valuation is more than fair (especially based on Whole Foods’ rapidly deteriorating fundamentals). We will have more comments after digesting these developments further, but the fate of United Natural Foods Inc (SELL) is very shaky under this transaction based on any change of control provisions for Whole Foods under UNFI’s existing supply agreement. We think this is a dream come true for Whole Foods investors. Without the sale to Amazon, we believe that the outlook for Whole Foods would have been increasingly troubled. We don’t see any other obvious strategic buyers coming to the table.  KIM FORREST, SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, PITTSBURGH:  I think supermarkets should be very very worried. It has not been a particularly good decade for them because of deflation.   Look at Kroger's results and it tells you about the deflation. I liked Target last fall with their new emphasis on kids clothing. The part of their business that is grocery made me stay away. It’s really difficult to overcome deflationary effects.   Amazon is going to deliver. This is the thing they've been missing, an ability to get fresh food closer to people. Whole Foods is everywhere Amazon wants to be in cities where people spend money.   They're going to use Whole Foods as a distribution method to get fresh food to the home.   They're trying to replace Fedex and UPS. They should be trading down even lower. You’re going to use Whole Foods as distribution for not only food. You're going to send along that phone or sweater too.   Look for the sickest (supermarkets) and those are likely the ones that are least well off because of this deal. The one that comes to mind is Supervalu. Kroger has some issues too. The sick ones become poison. They're getting thrown out of people's portfolios today.   Packaged food has had a tough time. Nobody shops in the middle of the supermarket any more. This has everything to do with sending fresh food out to people. This just hastens their demise.  “Investors care about novelty. Investors are going to flock to this because this whole idea is novel.  CHRIS SAGERS, TEACHES LAW AT THE CLEVELAND-MARSHALL COLLEGE OF LAW, CLEVELAND, OHIO: “As a matter of policy, should this be blocked? If I'm queen for a day, there should be a challenge to this because there should be a strong presumption against growth by acquisition and in fact there is supposed to be such a presumption in our law. It's what Congress intended.” “Will the Trump administration challenge it? I think the answer is very unlikely.” BRUCE BITTLES, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO, SARASOTA, FLORIDA:  The markets are down, and it looks like the uncertainty over the impact of Amazon on the food industry is upsetting the market. I think that's what's happening this morning. How far and how long that's going to go on, I have no idea. I'm surprised Amazon is up this much because they're going into a business where margins are so slim and we're not really sure if consumer behavior is going to change all that much.   But it certainly is very disruptive for Wal-Mart and Target and some others, and I think that's causing the decline today. Wal-Mart is a big food seller and so the Amazon news is significant because it could be a game changer in terms of how the food industry operates. But it may be an overreaction here because Wal-Mart customers are very different from Whole Foods' customers. So I think (the move) is overdone in probably both Wal-Mart and Target.   It's also a reflection of the whole industry, and how that's all changing because of Amazon and technology.   It's disrupting a number of industries here, and that's what's causing the causing the market problems here.   Amazon's got its tentacles everywhere and that's another place to go. Amazon sees that industry changing significantly – and they see that people don't necessary go to the grocery store anymore.   David Tawil, President, Maglan Capital, New York:  At least as it relates to groceries, we now have an answer that Amazon is serious. And when Amazon is serious, frankly there is no limit to what they can do in terms of disrupting the space... essentially relegating everything that currently exists in the business obsolete.   Everybody orders from Amazon right - it crosses all socio-economic lines. But Amazon doesn't have a particular emphasis on the luxury consumer, and maybe they want that exposure   Who knows what else they (Amazon) might introduce into the stores... those other grocers are just grocers.  TRIP MILLER, MANAGING PARTNER, GULLANE CAPITAL PARTNERS, MEMPHIS, TENN: “I think the first reaction is that this deal is good for Amazon, but bad for everybody else who sells food in a store, which is a pretty obvious first reaction. While we knew that Amazon was interested in getting into the food business and having more brick and mortar locations – they had been testing out grocery stores – this shows a large commitment from them to food and having physical drop off points and distribution points for other products they sell to consumers.  I think this deal helps Amazon potentially in the long term on their shipping side, as Whole Foods locations will provide drop off and pick up points for centralized delivery. I think it’s an interesting fit for Amazon. There is such a focus on healthier, more local food and Amazon is a cutting edge modern company. This puts them right in the forefront of the space.”           JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF RETAIL CONSULTANCY J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WWE IN NEW YORK:   I think that I would not like to be somebody playing in the grocery space right now.  Whole Foods has given up a lot of market share because they didn't capitalize on being the leader in organic, but they still have a footprint. It's a little different when you're Amazon. Whole Foods has to make money, Amazon doesn't have to make money. All Amazon's got to is grow. And now they've got a platform for doing that!  I think we'll see very aggressive pricing out of Amazon in grocery, which will include the Whole Foods component.  ANDREA MURINO, AN ANTITRUST EXPERT WITH THE LAW FIRM GOODWIN PROCTER LLP IN WASHINGTON D.C.:   “You can't think of this as a traditional antitrust problem because people who go to Whole Foods to touch the produce and get the freshest asparagus are not going to shop at Amazon... I don't think there's any direct Amazon Whole Foods direct competition. My guess is that this will get through. On how the Federal Trade Commission responds: “There's an efficiency there but there are big questions about what does it all mean? There are some emerging competition issues here about how Amazon is delivering your life, (even) bringing your news. I just think there will be some curiosity here.”  STAN SHIPLEY, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST AT EVERCORE ISI IN NEW YORK: “There’s a lot of liquidity in capital markets, a lot of money floating around. Whole Foods, which had a failed business model, is vulnerable to being gobbled up by companies with a successful business model a la Amazon.” CHARLIE O’SHEA, LEAD RETAIL ANALYST AT MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE:  Amazon’s announcement this morning that it had agreed to acquire Whole Foods Markets for around $14 billion is a transformative transaction, not just for food retail, but for retail in general.  Implications ripple far beyond the food segment, where dominant players like Wal-Mart, Kroger, Costco, and Target now have to look over their shoulders at the Amazon train coming down the tracks, but also the potential for multi-channel, which Amazon up until now has largely eschewed.   FERNAND DE BOER, ANALYST AT PETERCAM IN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, WHICH HAS A BUY ON DUTCH GROCER AHOLD: “This comes at a moment when the sector is very sensitive to bad news. You had the Kroger profit warning, and people are worried about the entrance of Lidl. So people are very nervous. And then they see this and they think – 'If online is going to kill offline, what am I doing in the sector? Sell.' Whether the reaction is exaggerated or not - it feels exaggerated. When sentiment settles a bit people are going to realize that Ahold can compete just fine.” PHIL BAK, CEO OF ACSI FUNDS, ASSET MANAGER BASED IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, WHICH HAS HOLDINGS OF AMAZON AND WHOLE FOODS:  There is really no limit to how far they (Amazon) can take Whole Foods. What Amazon has proven time and again is that they know how to connect the buying experience with what resonates with customers and with what customers will appreciate and want to continue to return to.  Again we see Amazon leading, and other supermarkets following. How they plan to implement technology in the buying experience remains to be seen.      NEIL SAUNDERS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBALDATA RETAIL IN NEW YORK:  I think it is surprising because it comes out the blue. But I think there is a lot of logic in the deal for both parties. I think for Amazon it gives a real foothold now in the food market which is what they have wanted for a very long time and which to do on their own to build up a substantial presence is very difficult. It gives them that opportunity to really grow their presence in grocery which is what they wanted to do all along.          For Whole Foods it brings an opportunity to really increase operating discipline, to really try to digitalize the offer and to bring technology into stores to increase efficiency which is something they really need to do, because their sales margins are waning and there is an opportunity here for Amazon to bring its expertise and logistics and help them turn around their business.  I think that Amazon has come to the rescue of a retailer in distress.    BRIAN REYNOLDS, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT NEW ALBION PARTNERS, A BROKER DEALER IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK:      If a stock price goes down, like Whole Foods did, that's going to attract activist investors. The deal is not (valued at) the highest price Whole Foods has ever traded at, but it's going significantly above the lows. That illustrates the trend of activists helping to put a floor under stock prices. If the CEO can't get a stock price up, activists will come in to try and do it. That's a huge change from two decades ago. This will put more pressure on grocery stores, especially their CEOs.  TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK:  “That was rumored, I totally dismissed it. Wow. Amazon can pour money into any investment and they don’t need to make money. Investors are used to them not making money. It is $13.7 billion but it is still small relative to the size of the whole company.   It seems like a bit of an odd purchase because it is brick-and-mortar retail. On the other hand it gives them a distribution footprint to deliver goods in a short time frame. Perishable goods and food aren’t always the best when delivered by FedEx. Obviously canned goods are.   It gives them a presence, the stores can be expanded to do other things. Amazon has talked about having a brick-and-mortar retail presence where perhaps people just go in to look at things.   This could be part of that strategy – you take part of a Whole Foods Store and you add in Echo and all the other Amazon products. More and more we will see Amazon brand products as they work to create their own brand at retail.” Reporting By Sam Forgione, Charles Mikolajczak, Jonathan Spicer, Caroline Valetkevitch, Sinead Carew, Herbert Lash, David Randall in New York; Diane Bartz in Washington; Ross Kerber in Boston; Toby Sterling in Amsterdam; Natalie Grover, Anya George Tharakan, Siddharth Cavale, Rishika Sadam, Sruthi Ramakrishnan, Gayathree Ganesan in Bangalore; Editing by Daniel Bases and David Gaffen.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/whole-foods-ma-amazoncom-views-idUSL1N1JD0PY"},

Banks in Britain and throughout the European Union generally place their loan and derivatives contracts under English law, but under EU reciprocity rules any judgement is instantly enforceable in any EU jurisdiction. A British exit from the EU's single market would also mean leaving the so-called Brussels convention that requires recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements in all EU states. The vast majority of derivatives and the contracts that underpin them are now handled in London, where an average of 885 billion euros of euro-denominated derivative trades are cleared every day, according to figures from the Bank of International Settlements. Banks are already examining reworking contracts so their EU entities would be named as the involved bank not their UK ones. That task would become more complicated if they had to change the law they were written under or find a workaround so they could still be enforced in the EU but arbitrated in London. France's financial markets law committee has sent a proposal to the Justice Ministry suggesting the establishment of special courts which would rule on matters under English common law and in English. Under EU codes, rulings would be enforceable instantly across the EU.  We would need to recruit judges that have experience in common law,  Christian Noyer, a former Bank of France chief now tasked with winning business from London, told Reuters. Banks have been developing plans for how to cope with a  hard  Brexit, which would see Britain leave the single market and customs union, and have considered varying degrees of upheaval to their British-bases businesses. The Brexit process may have been complicated by May's botched election gamble, which has led to calls in her party for a more business-friendly and softer tack to Britain's departure.  The enforcement of judgements rendered in the UK will not be as swift, cost-free and automatic as it is today unless new rules are agreed between the UK and the EU,  said Valentin Autret, a litigation counsel at Skadden, based in Paris.  Companies will consider strongly bringing action before courts in EU member states in order to benefit from EU rules on the recognition and enforcement of judgements,  Autret added. In the race to win new business after Britain's exist, Paris faces competition from European financial centres such as Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Dublin.  A bank needs to know that if it submits a case to a judge, the decision will be implemented as soon as possible,  said Gérard Gardella, secretary general of France's financial markets law committee. The Justice Ministry did not respond to emails and calls for comment. The committee proposes creating an international court within the Paris Commercial Court and a parallel court at the Paris Appeals court. Hearings, the examination of evidence, the exchange of papers and debates would all take place in English. Some lawyers have, however, expressed scepticism.  Any new French system is likely to rely on French judges only,  said Erwan Poisson at law firm Allen Overy.  Resorting to foreign judges can obviously pose a problem in terms of sovereignty. But not doing so could make the new system less popular,  he said. Other options are available to companies. The Netherlands is launching an international commercial court this year which would settle Dutch legal proceedings in the English language. Depending on the assets involved and the cost of litigation, banks could also opt to seek arbitration.

Kemal Kilicdaroglu, 68, head of the secularist Republican People's Party (CHP), set out on the march on Thursday after Enis Berberoglu was jailed for 25 years on spying charges. He was seen off by thousands of supporters and has garnered much attention in a country where government dominates the media. Kilicdaroglu trudged along a highway outside Ankara on Friday dressed in dark slacks and blue shirt. Sunburned and wearing a cap, he carried a sign that said  Justice .     Rights groups and government critics, including members of Kilicdaroglu's CHP, say Turkey is sliding toward authoritarianism, citing a crackdown that followed last year's failed coup that has seen more than 50,000 people jailed and  150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs.  I advise Kilicdaroglu to desist from this act,  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters.  Justice cannot be sought on the streets, Turkey is a state of law... Even if we don't like a court's ruling, we have to respect it.  Berberoglu was accused of giving the Cumhuriyet newspaper a video it used as the basis of a May 2015 report that alleged trucks owned by the state intelligence service (MIT)were stopped and found to contain arms and ammunition headed for Syria.  Berberoglu is the first CHP lawmaker to be jailed in the government crackdown, which has seen eleven members of parliament from the pro-Kurdish opposition party jailed.

'Democracy'  We have been, and will be, calling and defending justice, justice, justice, and democracy, democracy, democracy,  he told reporters during his march.  No matter what they say.

It is not possible to break the balance of the scales of justice by walking on roads,  Bekir Bozdag said.  Erdogan acknowledged the trucks belonged to the MIT but said they carried aid to ethnic Turkmens battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State, and not weapons for rebels. Erdogan accused Cumhuriyet's editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul of undermining Turkey's reputation and vowed Dundar would  pay a heavy price .

Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, said Pope Francis was concerned that any harm to the environment will be like a  boomerang that will come back ... especially to poor people  with ever worsening effects.  Trump said on June 1 he was pulling the United States out of the 195-nation Paris climate agreement, the first to oblige all nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, saying he wanted to create jobs in the U.S. fossil fuel industry. Trump said participating in the pact would undermine the U.S. economy, wipe out jobs, weaken national sovereignty and put his country at a permanent disadvantage.  This is to go back to the past and not to see the future,  Sanchez Sorondo, an Argentine like the pope, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said future energy jobs would be in renewables, such as wind or solar power, rather than coal. Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement  is a disaster for this country (the United States) and also for all the world , he said, echoing remarks he made to an Italian newspaper just before Trump's announcement. Many other leaders have expressed dismay and anger at Trump's withdrawal and pledged to push ahead with the Paris accord. Among them, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged action to protect  Mother Earth . Science Teaching FILE PHOTO: Pope Francis gestures during the inauguration of the new headquarters of the Scholas Occurrentes in Rome, Italy, June 9, 2017.Filippo Monteforte/Pool/File PhotoThe 2015 Paris Agreement aims to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century to limit a rise in average temperatures to  well below  2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The pope has urged Trump to be a peacemaker and gave him a signed copy of a 2015 encyclical about the environment in a meeting in the Vatican last month. Sanchez Sorondo said he had not heard if Trump had read the document. FILE PHOTO: Dump trucks haul coal and sediment at the Black Butte coal mine outside Rock Springs, Wyoming, United States, April 4, 2017.Jim Urquhart/File PhotoSanchez Sorondo criticized what he called the poor level of teaching of science in the United States, compared to many European countries such as Germany.  The German people are more educated in sciences and believe in science,  he said.   The real situation of the Earth today, of the planet, is described by scientists,  he said. To anyone on the surface the Earth can seem flat but scientific findings mean  it's difficult to say the Earth is not round,  he said. The Vatican has embraced climate change science in recent years, a quicker acceptance than in some other areas. Pope John Paul acknowledged only in 1996, for instance, that Charles Darwin's 1859 theory of evolution was  more than a hypothesis . During his campaign, Trump dismissed man-made climate change as a hoax. By contrast, a U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent probable that most warming since the 1950s is caused by human activities. Sanchez Sorondo will attend a meeting in Oslo on Monday of faith leaders to discuss how to protect tropical rainforests such as in the Amazon or Congo basins. Protecting forests fits into religious traditions that humans are stewards of the planet, not just exploiting nature, he said.  This was an idea of the Bible but also an idea of the Greeks and all civilizations,  he said.

Money would go to 35,508 victims from 123 countries whose total losses exceeded $6.5 billion. Their claims were deemed valid in early June by the Department of Justice, whose fund is overseen by former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden. More than 26,000 of the 35,508 eligible victims have received nothing since Madoff's fraud was uncovered in December 2008. Payouts could begin as soon as late October, a person close to the process said. In an online update posted late Thursday, Breeden said about 98 percent of eligible victims invested indirectly through Madoff, such as through  feeder funds.  They have been unable to recover any funds in the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, in which court-appointed trustee Irving Picard is paying only former Madoff customers. He has approved 2,612 claims.  We are currently planning on a first distribution of cash prior to the end of this year,  Breeden wrote.  We are very optimistic we will succeed.  Breeden declined to comment on Friday. The fund was set up in November 2013, mostly with settlement money from Madoff's bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), and the estate of former Madoff investor Jeffry Picower. Criticism over the lack of payouts was fueled by published reports last month that Breeden's firm had billed the government millions of dollars for its services. The review process took over three years, during which about 50 people, including some with bank examination experience, assessed 65,500 petitions with millions of pages of paperwork. Hedge funds and other third parties that bought claims from victims are ineligible to recover, unlike in the Madoff firm's liquidation, in which Picard is paying on such claims. Picard has recovered $11.6 billion and paid out more than $9 billion. The payout process for the fund Breeden oversees came up on Tuesday when Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama questioned it during a Justice Department budget hearing.  Obviously they're not working because there are no distributions,  he said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein replied that reimbursing victims was important, and said  we should do it as quickly as possible.  He pledged to look into the matter.  Will you get back to the committee on that?  Shelby asked.  Yes sir,  Rosenstein responded.

Traders said the debt sale reduced the level of naira liquidity in the money market and pushed up the overnight interbank lending rate to 15 percent, up from 6.7 percent where it closed the previous day. Nigeria is battling a currency crisis brought on by low oil prices which tipped its economy into recession and created chronic dollar shortages. The central bank has been intervening on the official market in the last few months to try to narrow the spread between rates on the official market and black market - where the local currency trades around 30 percent weaker. It has sold about $5 billion since February. The bank drained 200 billion naira on Friday in a 181-day special treasury bill auction at 16 percent, traders said. That sale was followed by an additional auction of 85.78 billion naira worth of 305-day treasury bills at 18.60 percent. It also sold 1.05 billion of 174-day paper at 18 percent. Traders said around 205 billion naira matured open market operation (OMO) bills were repaid on Thursday, which initially forced down the cost of borrowing among commercial lenders, but this was reversed following Friday's auctions.  We expect the interbank lending rate to open next week at today's closing level and subsequently rise gradually as the central bank sells more dollars on the foreign exchange market,  one trader said.

Euro zone governments threw Greece another credit lifeline on Thursday and sketched some new detail on possible debt relief as the IMF finally offered to join the bailout after two years of hesitation. The 8.5 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of new loans from the euro zone's 18 other states lets Athens avoid defaulting on bailout repayments next month and recognises the unpopular cuts and reforms the left-wing government has made. Berlin backed the loans even though it is wary of easing terms for Greece ahead of a German election in September. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hailed the deal on Friday as Greece's 10-year government bond yield fell to its lowest for almost a month on the news.  It was a decisive step, for the country exiting from this crisis. It was a clear step of confidence for the markets,  Tsipras said. But the deal was not enough for the European Central Bank to include Greece in its government bond-buying program for now, as the ECB needed more clarity on what kind of debt relief Greece will get from its international creditors.  It’s a very positive step in the right direction but you need to see more clarity on debt to include Greece,  an official close to the issue said.  Euro zone ministers, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, said on Thursday they could in 2018 extend the average maturities of Greek loans and grace periods by up to 15 years. The average maturity now is 30 years. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (L) welcomes French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire at his office in Maximos Mansion in Athens, Greece, June 12, 2017.Costas BaltasBut this was not enough for either the IMF or the ECB, with the Fund deciding to wait with disbursements to Greece until the euro zone provides more clarity on debt relief. New Obstacles Spanish Finance Minister Luis De Guindos unexpectedly cast a pall over the agreement on Friday by saying Madrid would block the disbursement to Greece unless Athens grants immunity to privatization agency officials from Spain, Italy and Slovakia, charged over a sale and lease-back deal of 28 state-owned buildings in Greece in 2015.  If there's not a definitive solution for the situation of these three experts, the Eurogroup will block the payment,  de Guindos said in Luxemburg where European Union finance ministers hold monthly talks. EU officials said they were convinced the issue would be resolved quickly and not impact the disbursement after all, but they also noted that euro zone ministers stood behind Spain, Italy and Slovakia on the issue. A senior lawmaker from Germany's center-left Social Democrats also added to the uncertainty by calling for a full parliamentary debate on the deal, in a challenge to Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble who deems such a debate unnecessary. Social Democrat lawmaker Johannes Kahrs believes the IMF's decision to delay its own disbursements despite joining the bailout is a major change to the deal and needs the approval of the whole German parliament. Schaeuble said on Thursday that it would be up to the budget committee of the Bundestag to decide whether full parliamentary approval was needed, but that he did not believe the deal was a substantive change.  A vote in the Bundestag could embarrass conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel as some of her lawmakers oppose aid to Greece ahead of German elections in September. Altogether 63 German conservative lawmakers voted against the third bailout for Greece in August 2015 and a further three abstained.

Violent clashes between left-wing and right-wing groups at rallies and protests around the country have increased since the election of President Donald Trump in November.  Experts say detecting and heading off anti-government attacks from people driven by political ideology is increasingly difficult because of the abundance of partisan rancor, particularly on social media.  Hodgkinson wrote a series of strident messages against Trump and other Republicans on his Facebook account. But so have many other Americans as politics have become more polarized in recent years, particularly since the divisive 2016 presidential election campaign. None of Hodgkinson's posts suggested he would end up opening fire at a baseball field outside Washington on Wednesday morning. He wounded a top Republican lawmaker, a Congressional aide, a lobbyist, and a Capitol police officer before being shot himself. He later died from his wounds. In one Facebook post, Hodgkinson wrote:  Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It's Time to Destroy Trump & Co.  However, there is no evidence so far that he was linked to any radical or violent groups. Like millions of other Americans, he supported Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the Democratic presidential nomination and condemns violence. Steve Bongardt, who worked until 2015 as an FBI special agent focusing on threat detection, said traditional counter-terrorism tools such as behavioral profiling and surveillance are less effective because so many otherwise harmless people  post virulent messages on social media.   The problem isn't that behavioral profiles don't work. The problem is the utility of them, because they give us so many false positives,  said Bongardt, who now heads The Gyges Group, a security firm. Intense Emotions James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois is seen in this undated photo posted on his social media account.   Social Media via REUTERSMark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow in the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said the intensity of  emotions on both sides of the political divide could be dangerous.  When you have people with basically mainstream opinions so worked up that they're willing to commit acts of actual violence, it illustrates in a very stark way how divided our country is right now,  Pitcavage said. A spokesman for the Justice Department said the department is considering a possible statute to target  ideologically motivated crimes of violence  from radical groups or individuals inside the country. Jerry Boykin, executive vice president of the conservative Family Research Council, which a gunman attacked in 2012 over its opposition to same-sex marriage, said Wednesday's shooting showed that both sides need to  tone down their rhetoric.   This is an opportunity for a fresh start for everybody in a position of leadership, all the way up to the president,  Boykin said. Most political violence in the United States still comes from right-wing groups, according to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.  However, the United States also has a history of violence from left-wing groups such as the Weather Underground, which was active in the 1970s. It then eased substantially over the past three decades but has risen again in recent years with violence at protests against globalization, police brutality and the Trump administration, Levin said. Left-wing extremists  might be the junior varsity, but they're now on the radar screen,  he said. It is too early to say if Hodgkinson's attack was part of a post-election trend of left-wing violence, said J.J. MacNab, a fellow specializing in anti-government extremism at George Washington University's Center for Cyber and Homeland Security.  We are a cycle-of-violence country. It looks like we may be going into a left-wing phase now, but I'm not sure the violent right-wing is ready to shut up yet,  MacNab said.

When the members of the Republican team were announced at Nationals Park, mention of Scalise's name drew a standing ovation from the areas designated for Republican, Democrat and nonpartisan fans alike. President Donald Trump did not attend but in a video address shown on the stadium's giant screen praised the friendly nature of the annual charity event. David Bailey, a Capitol Hill police officer who was part of Scalise's security detail and helped bring down the shooter, also was injured in the Wednesday incident but had recovered enough to throw the game's ceremonial first pitch. The Democrats won the game, 11-2, but loaned the trophy to the Republicans until Scalise is better.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stood side by side to shout: “Let’s play ball!” and the crowd chanted  U-S-A!

He was hit in the left hip, suffering injuries to internal organs, broken bones and severe bleeding, in Wednesday's shooting. For the game, which began in 1909, members of the Senate and House of Representatives donned uniforms representing teams from their constituencies, and many topped them with hats from Louisiana State University, Scalise's alma mater, as a tribute. In addition to Scalise, a police officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist were shot on Wednesday morning when a man opened fire as the Republican lawmakers practiced for the game in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia.  Slideshow (14 Images)Nearly 25,000 tickets were sold for the game and it was on track to raise more than $1 million, roughly double what it did last year, organizers said. Ticket sales picked up after Wednesday's shooting, eventually setting an attendance record, the organizers said, as attendees such as Alexander Hilten, 16, of Arlington, Virginia, decided to come to the game for the first time.  A lot of times in politics we have divisions but it shouldn't come to violence,  he said.  It's cool that they're putting it on even after the shooting. It just shows how resilient these politicians are.  The Capitol Police Memorial Fund was added to the list of charities that will receive money raised by the game in honor of two members of Scalise’s security detail who were at the Wednesday practice session and returned fire. The Washington Nationals Dream Foundation, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington and the Washington Literary Center are the game’s other beneficiaries.

They face the death penalty if convicted. Malaysian prosecutors have handed defense lawyers 44 documents including toxicology, autopsy, arrest reports, the suspects' statements and photographs, the lawyers told a hearing on Friday. Gooi Soong Seng, Aishah's lawyer, said some of the documents would be sent to experts in Denmark and other countries to get assessments on the alleged use of VX agent. In the post-mortem ... they have confirmed that the cause of death was by VX. So we will be looking thoroughly at the VX aspect,  Gooi told reporters.

The increased significance of tech comes on the heels of an around twenty percent gain in the sector this year which led to a pullback over the last week. FTSE Russell finalizes its annual refresh of its widely-followed indexes on June 23, a move that prompts fund managers to adjust their portfolios to reflect new weightings. Largecap tech is expected to see a more than 3 percent weighting increase in Russell's growth index, a major benchmark for portfolio managers. After a brief classification as a partial value stock last year, Apple Inc is set to be once again classified as 100 percent growth. Some managers may be uncomfortable about having such a heavy growth weighting in tech, but they will have little leeway if they are benchmarked to a universal index.     At the other end of the spectrum, largecap healthcare and consumer discretionary are expected to see the biggest weighting bumps in Russell's value category according to Jefferies, with increases of 2.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.   If you think of style, you think of whatever has worked in the year goes back to growth and whatever hasn’t worked goes back to value,  said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York.  It’s not a fair assessment, but at the margin that is kind of the driver.    Investors looking to trade on volatility may find some relief on June 23 when Russell's refresh typically drives the largest trading day of the year. Credit Suisse currently anticipates roughly $49 billion in share turnover for this year's rebalance.  FTSE Russell maintains some of the most widely followed benchmarks in the United States with $8.6 trillion in assets tracking or invested in products that follow its indexes, according to the firm.   On an individual basis, nearly 400 companies will be affected by the rebalance, according to Ivan Cajic, head of index research at ITG in New York.   This year there are 10 additions and 2 deletions from the Russell 1000 so it is a much larger trade in the Russell 1000 space,  said Cajic.   Unlike Standard & Poor's, which refreshes its indexes on a rolling basis, Russell's reconstitutes its indexes just once a year.  As the CBOE volatility index has languished below 20 since the U.S. Presidential election, investors will also welcome the boost in liquidity the rebalance provides.  You might not necessarily have only indexers present in this year’s rebalance and the days leading up to it,  Cajic said.   One widely-followed stock that will not be joining a Russell index yet is Snap Inc. Due to the company's unusual share structure, Russell is withholding a decision until after the rebalance until an analysis and comment period from the investment community is completed.   We need to look at it because there is a potentially a trend for these types of offerings, particularly technology companies,  said Mat Lystra, senior research analyst at FTSE Russell in Seattle.

Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, said Pope Francis was concerned that any harm to the environment will be like a  boomerang that will come back ... especially to poor people  with ever worsening effects.  Trump said on June 1 he was pulling the United States out of the 195-nation Paris climate agreement, the first to oblige all nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, saying he wanted to create jobs in the U.S. fossil fuel industry. Trump said participating in the pact would undermine the U.S. economy, wipe out jobs, weaken national sovereignty and put his country at a permanent disadvantage.  This is to go back to the past and not to see the future,  Sanchez Sorondo, an Argentine like the pope, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said future energy jobs would be in renewables, such as wind or solar power, rather than coal. Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement  is a disaster for this country (the United States) and also for all the world , he said, echoing remarks he made to an Italian newspaper just before Trump's announcement. Many other leaders have expressed dismay and anger at Trump's withdrawal and pledged to push ahead with the Paris accord. Among them, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged action to protect  Mother Earth . Science Teaching FILE PHOTO: Pope Francis gestures during the inauguration of the new headquarters of the Scholas Occurrentes in Rome, Italy, June 9, 2017.Filippo Monteforte/Pool/File PhotoThe 2015 Paris Agreement aims to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century to limit a rise in average temperatures to  well below  2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The pope has urged Trump to be a peacemaker and gave him a signed copy of a 2015 encyclical about the environment in a meeting in the Vatican last month. Sanchez Sorondo said he had not heard if Trump had read the document. FILE PHOTO: Dump trucks haul coal and sediment at the Black Butte coal mine outside Rock Springs, Wyoming, United States, April 4, 2017.Jim Urquhart/File PhotoSanchez Sorondo criticized what he called the poor level of teaching of science in the United States, compared to many European countries such as Germany.  The German people are more educated in sciences and believe in science,  he said.   The real situation of the Earth today, of the planet, is described by scientists,  he said. To anyone on the surface the Earth can seem flat but scientific findings mean  it's difficult to say the Earth is not round,  he said. The Vatican has embraced climate change science in recent years, a quicker acceptance than in some other areas. Pope John Paul acknowledged only in 1996, for instance, that Charles Darwin's 1859 theory of evolution was  more than a hypothesis . During his campaign, Trump dismissed man-made climate change as a hoax. By contrast, a U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent probable that most warming since the 1950s is caused by human activities. Sanchez Sorondo will attend a meeting in Oslo on Monday of faith leaders to discuss how to protect tropical rainforests such as in the Amazon or Congo basins. Protecting forests fits into religious traditions that humans are stewards of the planet, not just exploiting nature, he said.  This was an idea of the Bible but also an idea of the Greeks and all civilizations,  he said.

A Negative Outlook has been assigned. Fitch has also affirmed the Viability Rating (VR) of the bank at 'ccc'. At the same time Fitch has withdrawn the bank's ratings for commercial reasons. Fitch will no long provide rating and analytical coverage of AK BARS Bank. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The downgrade of ABB's IDRs reflects the extended weak record of support provided to the bank by its majority shareholder Republic of Tatarstan (RT, (BBB-/Stable)), which has been insufficient to materially improve the bank's credit profile, as reflected in the VR of 'ccc'. Fitch placed ABB on RWN on 16 December 2016 due to potential negative implications for its standalone credit profile and future support from the failure of Tatfondbank's (TFB), in which RT controlled a significant stake. TFB's default seems to have had limited direct impact on ABB's credit profile as, according to ABB's management, this has not caused either RT, ABB or its borrowers to incur material losses. However, regulatory oversight over banks in the region has increased following the failure of TFB and some smaller lenders. In Fitch's view, this may make it more difficult for ABB to defer recognition of losses on high-risk assets and hence material capital support may be required, while RT's own capacity to provide this is limited. The Negative Outlook on the bank's ratings reflects uncertainty over RT's ability to help clean up the bank's balance sheet and improve its solvency and therefore the risk of regulatory intervention. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATINGS The IDRs, Support Rating and senior debt ratings continue to reflect potential support the bank may receive from RT. This view factors in the majority ownership; the supervision over the bank and the close association of the bank with the regional authorities, through the representatives of the shareholder sitting in ABB's Board of Directors; the bank's notable systemic role in the region; and the large share of funding from the budget of RT and public sector entities (37% of the bank's liabilities at end-1Q17). RT currently controls - directly or indirectly - a more than 80% stake in the bank, including as a result of the recent share issue acquired by two RT-owned entities, PAO Tatneft (BBB-/Stable) and JSC Svyazinvestneftekhim (SINEK, BB+/Stable). However, Fitch now views the probability of support to be limited, as reflected in 'B' Long-Term IDRs of the bank. This view takes into account (i) the so far weak track record of capital support provided to the bank, as this has been either in non-cash form or did not result in genuine de-risking of the balance sheet due to the emergence of new high-risk assets, (ii) a significant volume of high-risk assets and the bank's weak core performance, which could make support costly and less politically acceptable; (iii) the limited flexibility of the budget to provide support promptly, and (iv) the indirect ownership of the bank (the direct share of the RT is only 20%). VR ABB's VR reflects the bank's weak asset quality and core profitability and limited capitalisation. It also factors in the bank's moderate liquidity position, supported by funding from entities related to RT. The amount of high-risk assets net of reserves remained significant at RUB106 billion or 2.5x of Fitch Core Capital (FCC) at end-2016, albeit reduced from RUB141 billion or 4.6x FCC at end-2015. The decrease of RUB35 billion is smaller than the total proceeds from the sale of RUB32 billion of high-risk assets to the Housing Fund under the President of RT (HFPT) and to other RT-affiliated entities and RUB19 billion of extra provisions created in 2016. This is because (i) some of the sold loans were issued in 2016, (ii) some new high-risk loans were issued; and (iii) Fitch reassessed risks on some exposures. The net amount of high-risk assets at end-2016 included: -RUB19.5 billion (0.5x FCC) of receivables from an RT-related company in the form of listed shares; -RUB5.6 billion (0.1x FCC) of investments in promissory notes of a SINEK-affiliated company; -RUB31.3 billion (0.8x FCC) of long-term construction/real estate exposures (with considerable non-completion risk) related to the bank, or the local business elite; -a RUB9.9 billion (0.2x FCC) loan to HFPT to purchase high-risk real estate from the bank; -RUB3.9 billion (0.1x FCC) of unsecured or weakly secured loans to investment companies; -RUB22 billion (0.5x FCC) of other related-party/relationship loans and/or high-risk exposures; -RUB13.5 billion (0.3x FCC) of investment property/non-core assets, mostly comprising land and commercial real estate in RT. Capitalisation remains weak in the context of these high-risk exposures. The FCC ratio was 9.4% at end-2016 and the regulatory Tier 1 ratio was 8% at end-April 2017, only moderately above the regulatory minimum level of 7.25%, including buffers. The recently registered RUB10 billion equity injection should raise capital ratios by approximately 2 ppts, but this would only moderately improve the bank's loss absorption capacity, allowing ABB to reserve about 16% of its high risk exposures without breaching minimum regulatory capital requirements. ABB's pre-impairment profit net of one-offs and revaluation results was equal to a low 0.5% of average loans in 2016, which means that the bank will not be able to strengthen its solvency through internal capital generation. After material deposit outflows in 1Q17 due to the instability caused by Tatfondbank's default, ABB's liquidity position stabilised, helped by funding support from RT and two organisations close to the budget of Tatarstan. As a result, the share of the budget of RT and of the two public sector entities in the bank's funding increased to 37% at end-1Q17 from 18% at end-2015. The bank is therefore dependent on this funding, as the liquidity buffer (of cash, net short-term interbank placements and unpledged liquid securities) net of near-term wholesale obligations was sufficient to withstand only about 20% outflow of customer funding (16% of liabilities) at end-April 2017. SUBORDINATED DEBT ABB's 'old-style' (without mandatory conversion triggers) subordinated debt is rated two notches below the bank's Long-Term IDR. This reflects Fitch's view of weak recovery prospects in case of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES Not applicable.

Whole Foods' shares rose as much as 28 percent, to $42.35, after Amazon said it would buy the company in a deal valued at about $13.7 billion, including debt. Short sellers aim to make a profit by selling borrowed shares on the hope of buying them back later at a lower price.

Forty rebels from the group, which is led by Joseph Kony, kidnapped 61 civilians in a June 7 raid in the Tanganyika mining area near the Garamba National Park in Haut-Uele province, the report said, citing local civil society and aid workers.  The civilians were released after being forced to move goods and food looted by the LRA, and an unknown number of villagers subsequently fled to the nearby town of Gangala Nabodio. There had been no LRA-related displacement for more than five years in the province, the U.N. said. But aid workers were now worried about the safety of people across a vast area.   Since the end of the mission of the Regional Task Force (RTF), which was mandated to eliminate the LRA, the security situation has seriously deteriorated in the Garamba National Park,  the U.N. report said.  One international non-governmental organization involved in protecting civilians had canceled its missions this week due to insecurity, it said.  The U.N. has reported a surge this year in LRA abductions of girls and boys around the ages of 12 or 13, as well as elephant poaching in Garamba National Park. A clash with Congolese armed forces in March killed one army officer and three LRA fighters. Kony's rebels battled Ugandan forces for about two decades, becoming notorious for their brutality and for kidnapping children for use as fighters and sex slaves.  In about 2005, they were ejected from bases in northern Uganda and what is now South Sudan, and retreated to an area of jungle straddling the borders of South Sudan, Congo and Central African Republic, where the task force continued to track them. The United States said in March it was switching to a broader African security mission and removing U.S. special forces specifically focused on fighting the LRA, declaring  success  in reducing the group to under 100 active members.  The African Union asked the United Nations to take on the hunt for the LRA and the U.N. Special Representative for Central Africa, Francois Lounceny Fall, has said the LRA may thrive after the U.S.-backed force leaves.  “I am concerned about the impact of this withdrawal as it will create a security vacuum that may be exploited by the LRA and other armed groups operating in the region,” he told the U.N. Security Council this week.   Uganda's military began withdrawing from Central African Republic in April, saying it had accomplished its mission - although Kony, who has been indicted by the Hague-based International Criminal Court, remained at large.

May, already under pressure after a botched snap election, is facing widespread criticism for her response to the blaze. She has promised to set up a public inquiry and pledged 5 million pounds ($6.40 million) to help the victims. Separately, hundreds of protesters stormed the local town hall chanting:  We want justice.  May has outlined a series of measures to help those left homeless by the devastating fire which engulfed the 24-storey apartment block on Wednesday. But fury has grown in the local community at what people say is the slow response from authorities to the fire and a failure to inform families and friends about the fate of loved ones. Media reports have said about 70 people are expected to have been killed, although police have not confirmed this.   Local residents also say they are angry that their safety concerns had been ignored and that people had been told to stay in their flats in the event of a fire. May, who on Thursday met emergency services at the fire site but did not meet locals, visited residents, volunteers and community leaders at a nearby church on Friday and was rushed away afterwards by police as an angry crowd outside shouted  Coward  and  You're not wanted . A couple of miles away in west London, several hundred protesters stormed Kensington and Chelsea council town hall. The protesters barged their way through an automatic door at and sought to gain entry to an upper floor. Police barred their way and scuffles broke out, a Reuters reporter said. The protesters chanted:  We want justice ,  bring them out  and  shame on you . The protesters were angered when no one from the council came out to address their concerns, reporters said. Related CoverageMaker of panels at London Tower cautioned on high-rise fire riskMissing: The desperate hunt for lost relatives after London tower block fireProtesters storm local town hall after deadly London fireThe local authority, which owns the tower block where families rent their homes, says it is doing all it can to support the victims and to help the relief operation.  It issued a statement before the protest to try to address the concerns of residents.  We entirely support the calling of the public inquiry and will cooperate in whatever way we can with it so that local people have all the answers about what has happened,  the council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said. Divided Society While the deadly blaze at the Grenfell Tower in north Kensington has prompted an outpouring of generosity, it has also unleashed rage at the authorities as the charred tower was cast as a deadly symbol of a divided society. The block, which housed some 600 people in about 120 apartments, is in a low-rent housing estate next to one of the most affluent areas of Britain. There have been demands for answers as to how the blaze was able to engulf the building, trapping many on the upper floors. Exterior cladding that was added during a recent refurbishment might have played a part, local residents have said.

Social media viaCourtesy ÒRACHEL LUCAS / 5 NEWSÓThe fire broke out less than a week after a election in which May lost her parliamentary majority.  The criticism over the blaze has added to pressure on May who is trying to strike a deal with a Northern Irish party to stay in power. Her government is also due to launch difficult Brexit talks with the European Union on Monday. Earlier on Friday, May met victims privately at a central London hospital.  I spoke with people who ran from the fire in only the clothes they were wearing,  she said in a statement.  They have been left with nothing – no bank cards, no money, no means of caring for their children or relatives. One woman told me she had escaped in only her top and underwear.  She has promised those left homeless by the blaze would be rehoused locally within weeks, and the 5 million pound fund would pay for emergency supplies, food, clothes and other costs. But even those within her own party said May should have faced the locals herself earlier. Slideshow (17 Images) She should have been there with the residents. You have to be prepared to receive people's emotions, and not be so frightened about people,  former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo told the BBC.  Queen Visits London Mayor Sadiq Khan wrote to May on Friday, saying residents felt increasingly enraged and frustrated by the slow response from the authorities.  The local community feels their grief has been made worse by the lack of information about their missing family members and friends,  he wrote. Residents in other blocks with the same exterior cladding as Grenfell Tower were concerned, he wrote.   People are terrified that the same thing could happen to them,  said Khan.      However, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who was London mayor until last year, took to Facebook to attack opposition Labour politicians for  political game playing . Queen Elizabeth, 91, and her grandson Prince William also visited residents and emergency workers on Friday.   That's one of the most terrible things I have ever seen,  William said of the tower's blackened shell. Some desperate residents pleaded to speak to the queen and her grandson about their plight and the fate of missing children as they left the site, with William promising he would return.  London police said an investigation, led by a detective from its homicide and major crime unit, would examine whether criminal offences had been committed although they said there was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately. Commander Stuart Cundy said they had been able to remove the remains of only 12 victims from the building.  Sadly, it is expected that the total will rise and it is not expected that any survivors will be found,  he said. Police have said it could take months to search the building and some victims might never be identified.

Liverpool unveiled its bid on Friday saying the opening ceremony and rugby sevens would be held at Liverpool FC's Anfield Stadium. The initial bid plan, submitted on Friday, also includes a link-up with neighboring Manchester which would host Twenty20 cricket at Old Trafford cricket ground and cycling at the Manchester Velodrome. Most of the Games will be held at existing venues but a new 50-metre swimming pool will be built within the city center dock system, while triple jump, long jump and pole vault are proposed to be held on the dockside by Mann Island in 'City Games' style. The new Everton stadium, at Bramley-Moore Dock, close to the city center, would host athletics events and would also have  the Athletes Village close by. The city's Arena and Convention Centre (ACC) would host a number of indoor events including Artistic Gymnastics and Badminton. Everton's current stadium, Goodison Park, would host the boxing finals.  What we have unveiled is truly transformational. We are utilizing our existing, world-class venues ... as well as facilities linked to the massive regeneration that is already taking place in the Bramley-Moore Dock area,  Liverpool bid Chairman Brian Barwick said. The 2022 Commonwealth Games were originally handed to Durban in South Africa but the city was stripped of hosting rights by the Commonwealth Games Federation in March after the plan hit financial problems. Another English city, Birmingham, is also bidding for 2022 along with Victoria in western Canada. Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia has said it is interested in hosting the event, along with several Australian venues. But Liverpool is confident it can secure the backing of the Commonwealth Games Federation.  If Birmingham can come up with a better masterplan and vision than this then they will deserve it but I think they are going to have to go far beyond the realms of possibility,  said Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson. He said the plan would encourage faster regeneration of the waterfront area of the city and bring a host of benefits.  The economic impact, the jobs impact, skills, health and well-being, the whole branding of the city and the waterfront, it would be absolutely madness not to do it,  he added. Liverpool born boxer Tony Bellew, who is backing the bid, said the Games would provide a major economic boost for the city and help raise its profile.  Every business in Liverpool will thrive from this and that is something that is deserved because we are not very fortunate to gain exposure being up north, it is usually all down south. So it will be nice for this (event) to come up north to such a multicultural city,  he said.

Dockers will strike on alternate hours for 48-hour periods between June 26 and 28, June 29 and July 1, July 3 and 5 and July 6 and 8, the UGT worker union said. Spanish port terminals have already been hit by major disruptions as container shipping companies re-routed their cargos to avoid strikes in the country, opting for Portugal, Malta or Morocco instead. Dockers are angry over reform of port labour practices passed by Spanish lawmakers in mid-May, which aimed to crack down on closed-shop hiring in a heavily unionised sector. Subsequent negotiations over how to implement the new rules between employers and workers broke down in a dispute over how to safeguard 6,000 jobs. The strikes had so far caused losses of 110 million euro ($123 million) to Spain's economy, the public works ministry said in a statement adding that this was due to business being diverted elsewhere. The southern Spanish port of Algeciras is particularly vulnerable to the strikes as much of the goods traffic that passes through it is not ultimately destined for Spain. It is used by companies transferring cargos from one boat to another. Exports have helped underpin Spain's economic recovery over the past four years. Some 80 percent of imports and 60 percent of exports are handled by Spanish ports. Aside from the new strikes called on Friday, further industrial action has already been set for June 19, 21 and 23. $1 = 0.8956 euros Reporting by Robert Hetz, Writing by Sarah White, Editing by Sonya Dowsett and Richard Balmforth","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/spain-ports-idUSL8N1JD3MV"},

Related: * Supermarket stocks fall on announcement * Competition worries hit Europe grocers * BreakingViews: Amazon checks out COMMENTS: JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF RETAIL CONSULTANCY J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WWE IN NEW YORK:  I think that I would not like to be somebody playing in the grocery space right now.  Whole Foods has given up a lot of market share because they didn't capitalize on being the leader in organic, but they still have a footprint. It's a little different when you're Amazon. Whole Foods has to make money, Amazon doesn't have to make money. All Amazon's got to is grow. And now they've got a platform for doing that!  I think we'll see very aggressive pricing out of Amazon in grocery, which will include the Whole Foods component.  ANDREA MURINO, AN ANTITRUST EXPERT WITH THE LAW FIRM GOODWIN PROCTER LLP IN WASHINGTON D.C.: “You can't think of this as a traditional antitrust problem because people who go to Whole Foods to touch the produce and get the freshest asparagus are not going to shop at Amazon... I don't think there's any direct Amazon Whole Foods direct competition. My guess is that this will get through. On how the Federal Trade Commission responds: “There's an efficiency there but there are big questions about what does it all mean? There are some emerging competition issues here about how Amazon is delivering your life, (even) bringing your news. I just think there will be some curiosity here.” STAN SHIPLEY, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST AT EVERCORE ISI IN NEW YORK: “There’s a lot of liquidity in capital markets, a lot of money floating around. Whole Foods, which had a failed business model, is vulnerable to being gobbled up by companies with a successful business model a la Amazon.” CHARLIE O’SHEA, LEAD RETAIL ANALYST AT MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE:  Amazon’s announcement this morning that it had agreed to acquire Whole Foods Markets for around $14 billion is a transformative transaction, not just for food retail, but for retail in general.  Implications ripple far beyond the food segment, where dominant players like Wal-Mart, Kroger, Costco, and Target now have to look over their shoulders at the Amazon train coming down the tracks, but also the potential for multi-channel, which Amazon up until now has largely eschewed.  FERNAND DE BOER, ANALYST AT PETERCAM IN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, WHICH HAS A BUY ON DUTCH GROCER AHOLD: “This comes at a moment when the sector is very sensitive to bad news. You had the Kroger profit warning, and people are worried about the entrance of Lidl. So people are very nervous. And then they see this and they think – 'If online is going to kill offline, what am I doing in the sector? Sell.' Whether the reaction is exaggerated or not - it feels exaggerated. When sentiment settles a bit people are going to realize that Ahold can compete just fine.” PHIL BAK, CEO OF ACSI FUNDS, ASSET MANAGER BASED IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, WHICH HAS HOLDINGS OF AMAZON AND WHOLE FOODS:  There is really no limit to how far they (Amazon) can take Whole Foods. What Amazon has proven time and again is that they know how to connect the buying experience with what resonates with customers and with what customers will appreciate and want to continue to return to.  Again we see Amazon leading, and other supermarkets following. How they plan to implement technology in the buying experience remains to be seen.  NEIL SAUNDERS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBALDATA RETAIL IN NEW YORK:  I think it is surprising because it comes out the blue. But I think there is a lot of logic in the deal for both parties. I think for Amazon it gives a real foothold now in the food market which is what they have wanted for a very long time and which to do on their own to build up a substantial presence is very difficult. It gives them that opportunity to really grow their presence in grocery which is what they wanted to do all along.   For Whole Foods it brings an opportunity to really increase operating discipline, to really try to digitalize the offer and to bring technology into stores to increase efficiency which is something they really need to do, because their sales margins are waning and there is an opportunity here for Amazon to bring its expertise and logistics and help them turn around their business.  I think that Amazon has come to the rescue of a retailer in distress.  BRUCE BITTLES, SARASOTA, FLORIDA-BASED CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT BROKERAGE AND RESEARCH FIRM R.W. BAIRD & CO:  Amazon's got its tentacles everywhere and that's another place to go. Amazon sees that industry changing significantly – and they see that people don't necessary go to the grocery store anymore.  BRIAN REYNOLDS, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT NEW ALBION PARTNERS, A BROKER DEALER IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK:  If a stock price goes down, like Whole Foods did, that's going to attract activist investors. The deal is not (valued at) the highest price Whole Foods has ever traded at, but it's going significantly above the lows. That illustrates the trend of activists helping to put a floor under stock prices. If the CEO can't get a stock price up, activists will come in to try and do it. That's a huge change from two decades ago. This will put more pressure on grocery stores, especially their CEOs.  TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK: “That was rumored, I totally dismissed it. Wow. Amazon can pour money into any investment and they don’t need to make money. Investors are used to them not making money. It is $13.7 billion but it is still small relative to the size of the whole company.  It seems like a bit of an odd purchase because it is brick-and-mortar retail. On the other hand it gives them a distribution footprint to deliver goods in a short time frame. Perishable goods and food aren’t always the best when delivered by FedEx. Obviously canned goods are.  It gives them a presence, the stores can be expanded to do other things. Amazon has talked about having a brick-and-mortar retail presence where perhaps people just go in to look at things.  This could be part of that strategy – you take part of a Whole Foods Store and you add in Echo and all the other Amazon products. More and more we will see Amazon brand products as they work to create their own brand at retail.” Reporting By Sam Forgione, Charles Mikolajczak and Jonathan Spicer in New York, Diane Bartz in Washington, Toby Sterling in Amsterdam, and Natalie Grover, Anya George Tharakan and Siddharth Cavale in Bangalore","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/whole-foods-ma-amazoncom-views-idUSL1N1JD0M1"},

Pakistan, the lowest-ranked team at the Champions Trophy tournament, upset host and favourites England to set up a final with defending champions India, feeding a frenzy for a game that commands a fanatical following in the region and among its diaspora. A 30-second spot during the final to be broadcast by Rupert Murdoch's Star Sports is expected to cost nearly 10 million rupees ($155,267), far higher than the 1 million rupees that advertisers pay on average for most Indian shows, said a person involved in buying ads. Most of the TV spots for the final, to be played in London, were pre-booked with firms such as Nissan Motor, Intel Corp, Emirates, Chinese mobile maker Oppo and Indian tyre maker MRF signed up as commercial partners for the tournament. Fewer than 10 percent of the slots are left for the final, a person in the sports broadcasting industry said. Companies still wanting to air their ads will be paying a higher rate than those who pre-booked, said the person, who did not want to be named, citing business confidentiality.  India v Pakistan Final... !!!!!!!! All TV execs around the world are now cracking a nice bottle open to celebrate,  tweeted former England captain Michael Vaughan. India captain Virat Kohli is the only cricketer among the world's 100 highest-paid sportsmen, ranking 89th with annual income of $22 million, according to a list compiled by Forbes. Before the Champions Trophy, the last time India and Pakistan played a one-day international was during the 2015 World Cup. That game, won by India, was one of the top-six most viewed sporting events, along with the soccer World Cup final and Usain Bolt's 100-metre sprint at the 2012 Olympic Games, the sports broadcasting industry source said.  That was a league game, this is the final,  the person said.  You can expect this to be even bigger.  India and Pakistan have already met during the tournament's group stage, with India winning easily. More than 200 million people watched that game, according to Indian media, citing BARC India. For Sunday's final, viewership is expected to be 30-40 percent higher. Troubled History Cricket between the neighbours and rivals has been limited because of their longstanding political problems. They last played a bilateral series in 2012-13, when Pakistan toured India for two Twenty20 games and three one-day internationals. It was their first series since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when Pakistani militants went on a killing spree that left 166 people dead in India's financial capital. India has since refused to play Pakistan outside International Cricket Council events. In disputed Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan, the cricket tournament has already caused discord. Residents of Indian Kashmir, many of whom support the Pakistani team, lit fire-crackers to celebrate Pakistan's victory over Sri Lanka earlier in the tournament. Later that night, residents in a village in south Kashmir accused Indian army soldiers of beating them and smashing their cars and windows to punish them for celebrating. $1 = 64.4050 Indian rupees Additional reporting by Doug Busvine and Amit Ganguly in NEW DELHI, Sudipto Ganguly in MUMBAI, Fayaz Bukhari in SRINAGAR, Jatindra Dash in BHUBANESHWAR; Editing by Ian Geoghegan","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-championstrophy-final-tv-idUSL3N1JD3M3"},

Over the last decade, foreign recruiters and employers from the Middle East have increasingly turned to the east African nation for cheap labour. Thousands are already there working as waitresses, domestic servants, store clerks and in other jobs. Milton Turyasiima, commissioner of employment services in the labour ministry, said a hospital in Benghazi, Libya's second biggest city, had approached Uganda to supply health workers.  We are now doing underground work. Our diplomatic people are trying to first establish the safety of the workers, the working conditions in Benghazi,  he told Reuters.  If they finish that work today or tomorrow, then we'll be ready to send these people,  Turyasiima said, adding they would include a mix of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel. The workers will be moving to a country plagued by widespread insecurity since its former leader Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011, with rival governments and armed alliances now competing for power. Ugandan health activists have also criticised the plan since the country itself needed to increase workers to revitalise its failing healthcare system. Years of underfunding, corruption and neglect have meant that the sector is largely dysfunctional, government critics say. Most public hospitals - often dilapidated and short of vital medical equipment - are understaffed, while drugs are frequently out of stock.  Health worker shortage kills Ugandans unnecessarily every day,  said Asia Russell, executive director of the public health pressure group Health GAP.  This outrageous plan will make an already dire situation worse, intensifying suffering and preventable death.  Russell said the government should instead lift its freeze on public sector recruitment so that additional healthy workers are absorbed and  deployed with tools to do their jobs where they are needed most.

But the cost of housing remained heavy burden for many Americans, according to the latest annual study. In the first quarter of 2017, the homeownership rate was 63.6 percent, flat from two years ago, according to the report.  Early indications in 2017 suggest that the upturn is continuing,  Harvard researchers wrote. The homeownership rate hit 62.9 percent in the second quarter of 2016, which was the lowest since 1965. Families that own homes increased by 280,000 in 2016, the biggest rise since 2006, but they were dwarfed by the growth in renters which rose by 600,000 last year, the Harvard study showed. Based on the assumption that the homeownership rate will stabilize at current levels, the number of families that own homes could grow by 8.9 million in 2015-2025, while the number of renters could increase by 4.7 million. On the other hand, if homeownership rate were to decline further, the number of homeowner households would rise by 4.9 million by 2025 and renter households would grow by 8.7 million in 2015-2025. Meanwhile, the cost for shelter remained high for many U.S. families, albeit the number of them has declined modestly for five straight years, Harvard researchers said. Based on the 30-percent-of-income affordability standard, the level of cost-burdened households fell to 38.9 million in 2015 from 39.8 million in 2014, they said. Those families which were severely burdened or paid more than 50 percent of their incomes for housing slipped to 18.8 million in 2015 from 19.3 million in 2014. Severely burdened renters stood at 11.1 million in 2015, up by 3.7 million in 2001, while severely burdened homeowners totaled 7.6 million, 1.1 million higher than levels seen in 2001, the study showed. Based on income, 70.3 percent of the poorest families, or those earning less than $15,000 annually, spent more than 50 percent of their wages on shelter. On a geographical basis, 45 percent of renters in U.S. metro areas could afford the monthly payments on a median-priced home in their area, while in several high-cost metro areas of the Pacific Coast, Florida, and the Northeast, that share is less than 25 percent, according to the study.

Donnie Rowe, 43, and Ricky Dubose, 24, were apprehended following a car chase with police about an hour's drive southeast of Nashville, said Stephen Emmett, a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Atlanta.  Authorities were responding to a report of a home invasion in the area of Shelbyville, Tennessee. The fugitives entered the home of an elderly couple, tied them up and stole their car, leading police on a car chase, Emmett said. The fugitives then crashed the car on Interstate 24 and fled on foot into a wooded area before entering a property in the area of the community of Christiana, outside of Murfreesboro, Emmett said.  The pair were eventually taken into custody by Tennessee authorities, he said, adding he was not aware of any injuries to law enforcement during the pursuit or arrests.

The secretive Islamic State leader has frequently been reported killed or wounded since he declared a caliphate to rule over all Muslims from a mosque in Mosul in 2014, after leading his fighters on a sweep through northern Iraq. If the report does prove true, it would be one of the biggest blows yet to Islamic State, which is trying to defend its shrinking territory against an array of forces backed by regional and global powers in both Syria and Iraq. But in the absence of independent confirmation, some U.S. officials said U.S. agencies were skeptical of the report. Several Iraqi security officials said Iraq was doubtful as well.  His death has been reported so often that you have to be cautious till a formal Daesh statement comes,  a European security official said, using an Arabic acronym for the group.  U.S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said:  We have no information to corroborate those reports.  A senior Trump administration official noted “a number of infirmities” in the reports, which have given U.S. officials reason to question their accuracy. “Some of those infirmities suggested that this happened at the end of May and that there were upwards of 300 or more soldiers killed in that strike,” said the official, who asked not to be identified. “A strike of that size and that claim that would have happened that long ago without any knowledge is something that made me curious,” the official added. The Russian Defence Ministry said on its Facebook page that it was checking information that Baghdadi was killed in the strike on the outskirts of Raqqa in Syria, launched after Russia received intelligence about a meeting of Islamic State leaders.  On May 28, after drones were used to confirm the information on the place and time of the meeting of IS leaders, between 00:35 and 00:45, Russian air forces launched a strike on the command point where the leaders were located,  the statement said.  According to the information which is now being checked via various channels, also present at the meeting was Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was eliminated as a result of the strike,  the ministry said. Operating Cautiously However, a colonel with the Iraqi national security service told Reuters Baghdadi was not believed to have been in Raqqa at the time of the strike in late May. One of Baghdadi's aides may have been killed rather than Baghdadi himself, the colonel said. He said that Baghdadi was believed to be operating cautiously in the border area between Iraq and Syria with just a handful of close aides, and avoiding using telecommunications equipment to evade surveillance. Another Iraqi intelligence official said the Russians had not shared any information with Iraqi authorities to indicate Baghdadi was killed. Iraq was checking the report and would announce his death if it received  solid confirmation . Hoshiyar Zebari, a long-serving former Iraqi foreign minister and now a senior adviser to the government of the Kurdish autonomous region, also told Reuters there was no confirmation of Baghdadi's death. The Russian defense ministry statement said the strike was believed to have killed several other senior leaders of the group in addition to Baghdadi, as well as around 30 field commanders and up to 300 of their personal guards. The IS leaders had gathered at the command center, in a southern suburb of Raqqa, to discuss possible routes for the militants' retreat from the city, the statement said. The United States was informed in advance about the place and time of the strike, the Russian military said. Close to Defeat  Islamic State fighters are close to defeat in the twin capitals of the group's territory, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, after nearly three years ruling over millions of people in a wide swathe of territory in both countries. Russia supports the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which is fighting against Islamic State fighters, one front in a multi-sided civil war. The United States supports Kurdish and Arab fighters in Syria who are separately planning an assault on Raqqa. In Iraq, the U.S.-backed government has been battling to recapture Mosul since October last year after driving the group out of most of the rest of the territory it had seized. The last public video footage of Baghdadi shows him dressed in black clerical robes declaring his caliphate from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque back in 2014. Born Ibrahim al-Samarrai, Baghdadi is an Iraqi in his mid-forties, who broke away from al Qaeda in 2013 after years participating in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq and the Iraqi government. The U.S. State Department has offered a $25 million reward for information leading to his arrest. A number of senior IS figures have been killed in air strikes or special forces raids since the United States launched its campaign against the group in 2014, including Baghdadi's deputy Abu Ali al-Anbari, the group's  minister of war  Abu Omar al-Shishani, and its media director Abu Muhammad al-Furqan. Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, cast doubt on the report Baghdadi may have been killed. He said that according to his information, Baghdadi was located in another part of Syria at the end of May. “The information is that as of the end of last month Baghdadi was in Deir al-Zor, in the area between Deir al-Zor and Iraq, in Syrian territory,” he said by phone.

Partly a response to Moscow's actions in Poland's eastern neighbor Ukraine, the  Concept of Defense of the Republic of Poland  aims to enable Warsaw to resist any possible Russian aggression without having to rely so much on help from the thousands of U.S. and other NATO troops already based in Poland.     But the plan risks alienating Poland's allies, could allow Russia to exploit new weaknesses and may prove financially ruinous for Warsaw, NATO diplomats, security analysts and some in the Polish military and government say.     In no more than 12 years Poland will be able to defend itself with its own armed forces,  Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said when presenting the strategy in late May. The right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) government's strategy essentially focuses on what it sees as Russia's goal to  create a new international order . It assumes a prolonged  aggressive stance  from Moscow towards Poland and its allies. Macierewicz has accused Poland's previous centrist government of underestimating threats from Russia, which in 2014 annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. He has also stressed the need to boost the domestic defense industry, scrapping some earlier plans to buy equipment including drones from abroad.  Absolutely Unrealistic  About a quarter of the Polish top brass has quit since PiS swept to power in late 2015, citing disagreements with Macierewicz over personnel and other decisions. Even within the government not all are convinced by the new military strategy and its emphasis on Poland's ability to defend itself, alone if necessary, from foreign aggression.   Self-sufficiency? How? This is absolutely unrealistic,  one government official told Reuters.  Do we really want to send a message to our NATO allies that we don't care about them?  In Brussels, the NATO alliance has not publicly commented  on Poland's change of tack but privately officials are wary, with one saying:  No one can stop any member country from shooting itself in the foot. The consequences of that will be apparent when something really collapses.  Poland's armed forces have suffered from decades of under-investment and some two-thirds of their equipment still dates from the Soviet era, but Macierewicz scrapped much of the previous government's modernization program. That program had envisaged, among other things, buying 70 multi-task helicopters, with deliveries starting next year.      FILE PHOTO: U.S. soldiers attend welcoming ceremony for U.S.-led NATO troops at polygon near Orzysz, Poland, April 13, 2017.Kacper Pempel/File PhotoBut the PiS government broke off a 13.5 billion zlotys deal signed with European planemaker Airbus to supply some of those helicopters. It now says they are no longer a priority. The government still expects by the end of 2017 to sign a $7.6 billion deal with U.S. firm Raytheon to buy eight Patriot missile defense systems, but a person close to the talks said the deadline was no longer realistic.      The lack of army modernization is the biggest problem right now,  Waldemar Skrzypczak, a general who resigned as an adviser to the defense ministry earlier this year, told Reuters.  The government has also dismayed some military experts by taking the unusual step of moving its modern, German-made battle tanks away from its western border and sending them to Warsaw, closer to Russia. In their place are now ageing Soviet-era tanks that regularly break down and are difficult to maneuver.  U.S. soldiers attend the final day of NATO Saber Strike exercises in Orzysz, Poland, June 16, 2017.Ints KalninsMoving the German-made tanks to Warsaw requires equipping the base there with the infrastructure and trained personnel to operate them. That would take about two years and means that in case of a sudden attack, Poland would not be able to use them, the experts said.     Moscow strongly denies any plans to invade Poland or the Baltic republics and instead accuses NATO of threatening stability in Europe with its troop maneuvers in the region. More Cash Poland, already one of only five NATO members to meet the alliance's defense spending target of 2 percent of national output, now aims to raise spending to 2.5 percent by 2030, assuming positive economic growth. That would mean a near doubling in real terms to about 80 billion zlotys ($21.50 billion).     Such an ambition is likely to impress Trump when he visits Warsaw next month. At a NATO summit last month the U.S. president was publicly critical of allies who fail to meet the 2 percent target. Among several planned new acquisitions, Warsaw aims to buy two squadrons of Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters that each costs at least $100 million.    Critics of the Polish government's ambitious plans say they lack a clear time frame and proper costing. Poland is required along with other European Union member states to keep its budget deficit under 3 percent of national output, but Macierewicz's ministry has proposed a draft bill that would not limit how much is spent on specific programs.  Is this all realistic? Absolutely not,  said Marek Swierczynski, a security analyst at Polityka Insight, a pro-European think-tank based in Warsaw.      If we added up all the items on the wish list we would be talking about a colossal amount.

That is about to change, as Nepal's Supreme Court, in response to a petition by rights group Forum for Women, Law and Development (FWLD), last month ordered the government to amend the law to ensure victims of acid attacks and burning receive immediate compensation and critical care.  Once the law is reformed, at least victims of future burning and acid attacks will benefit,  Sabin Shrestha at FWLD told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Magar risks losing her eyesight if she does not receive urgent treatment, and will probably not benefit even if the law were to be amended, Shrestha said. There are about 40 reported cases of burns and acid attacks every year in Nepal, with nearly three-quarters of the victims women, according to New York-based charity Donor Direct Action, citing non-profit Burns Violence Survivors Nepal. Globally, as many as 1,500 acid attacks are recorded every year. However, many attacks go unreported because victims are afraid of reprisals from their abusers.  In many of these cases, victims are blinded or disfigured by jilted partners or relatives for not bringing adequate dowry, for refusing a man's advances or in property related disputes. Under current Nepali law, anyone found guilty of such a crime can be sentenced to up to eight years in jail and a fine or victim compensation of up to 300,000 Nepali rupees ($2,900).  In reality, only a small amount is given to a victim, and never before a final decision is made, which can take years.     Meanwhile, victims may not be able to afford the medical care they need, and risk permanent damage, Shrestha said. Officials say changing the law may take time because of political uncertainty in Nepal, with a new constitution prepared in 2015 rejected by some ethnic groups, and a new prime minister taking office just this month.      We have not received a formal court order yet,  said Dilli Raj Ghimire, a spokesman for the law ministry.       Drafting the changes and completing parliamentary procedures before they become law will take time,  he said, without specifying a time frame. Campaigners say they would also like to see the government close a loophole that denies compensation to acid attack and burn victims in some cases, including those related to their attackers.      This is a landmark judgment, but more needs to be done,  Donor Direct Action said on its website.

The 2-year spread narrowed 2.7 basis points to -41.6 basis points, its smallest gap since Feb. 24, as Canadian government bonds underperformed their U.S. counterparts in anticipation of a rate hike from Canada's central bank this year.     Chances of a rate increase by December have surged to 90 percent from less than one-in-four before stronger-than-expected jobs data one week ago.                Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, edged up from 2017 lows but remained on track for a fourth consecutive week of losses because of excess supplies.           U.S. crude        prices were up 0.79 percent at $44.81 a barrel.     At 9:24 a.m. ET (1324 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3242 to the greenback, or 75.52 U.S. cents, up 0.2 percent. The currency traded in a range of C$1.3222 to C$1.3272.     It touched its strongest in 3-1/2 months on Wednesday at C$1.3165, while it is on track for a 1.7 percent advance this week, its biggest since early December.     Gains for the loonie came as Canadian lender Home Capital Group Inc          took steps towards recovery by agreeing to settle a regulatory investigation and lining up new funding.                  Investors have fretted over how the near-collapse of the company could affect the country's real estate market.     Foreign investment in Canadian securities slowed in April as investors scooped up bonds but sold their equities holdings, data from Statistics Canada showed.                  International investors bought C$10.60 billion in Canadian securities in the month, while Canadians reduced their holdings in foreign securities by C$9.87 billion after four consecutive months of acquisitions.     In other domestic data, lending to small Canadian businesses picked up in April, suggesting growth in the broader economy was gaining momentum. The PayNet Small Business Lending index rose to 120.1 from 118.7 in March.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 0.5 Canadian cent to yield 0.915 percent and the 10-year             falling 8 Canadian cents to yield 1.540 percent.     On Thursday, the 2-year yield touched its highest in nearly 2-1/2 years at 0.937 percent.

Even low-intensity exercise, such as walking with a baby stroller, was linked to a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms in new mothers, researchers found. “The negative consequences of postpartum depression not only affect the mother but also the child, who can suffer poor emotional and cognitive development,” said study co-author Celia Alvarez-Bueno of the University of Castilla-La Mancha in Cuenca, Spain. Postpartum depression, the most common complication of bearing a child, affects 1 in 9 women, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can include anxiety attacks, insecurity, irritability, fatigue, guilt, fear of harming the baby and a reluctance to breastfeed.  The symptoms start within four weeks of delivery and are considered severe when they last for more than two weeks, the study team writes in the journal Birth. “That’s why it’s important to test the most effective strategies to prevent this disorder or mitigate the consequences,” Alvarez-Bueno told Reuters Health by email. The study team analyzed data from 12 controlled trials of exercise interventions during or after pregnancy between 1990 and 2016 that addressed the effects of physical activity on postpartum depression. The studies included a total of 932 women and all examined the severity of postpartum depression as well as including basic information about the length, frequency, type and intensity of the exercise. The exercises used in the various studies included stretching and breathing, walking programs, aerobic activity, Pilates and yoga. Compared to women who didn’t exercise, those who did had lower scores on depression symptom tests during the postpartum period, the researchers found. The apparent benefit of having fewer depression symptoms was seen even among women who did not meet the cutoff for a depression diagnosis. “We expected that physical activity could reduce postpartum depressive symptoms,” Alvarez-Bueno said. “However, we were pleasantly surprised when we found that exercise after pregnancy also reduced depression among the women who didn’t have diagnosable symptoms.” Most intervention programs lasted for three months or longer and recommended three to five exercise sessions per week, but the current study didn’t draw conclusions or provide recommendations about the type or length of exercise that would be most beneficial. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommended in 2009 that pregnant and postpartum women engage in 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week.  “We know that exercise is just as effective as anti-depressants for adults. The trick is to get them to do the physical activity,” said Beth Lewis of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who wasn’t involved with the study. “With postpartum depression, it’s even more complicated due to the increased stress and sleep deprivation after having a baby,” she told Reuters Health. “We’re starting to learn more about exercise and how it helps.” Future studies should include more data about the types of physical activity programs that could reduce depression, the study authors write. Health providers should know more about the duration, intensity and frequency of exercise to recommend to new mothers, Alvarez-Bueno noted. “It remains unanswered how these characteristics improve postpartum depression prevention,” she said. “More research addressing this issue is urgently necessary because of the influence on both the mother and child.” Lewis and colleagues are conducting a randomized trial that analyzes home-based exercise and home-based wellness programs among 450 mothers with a history of depression. In another study, they’re analyzing exercise programs among low-income women at risk for postpartum depression. “Exercise is often the first thing that gets crossed off the list when there’s a new baby,” Lewis said. “It’s important to take care of yourself through exercise to keep that wellbeing high.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sEmX20 Birth, online June 7, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-fitness-postpartum-depression-idUSKBN1971UM"},

BAIRD & CO:  Amazon's got its tentacles everywhere and that's another place to go. Amazon sees that industry changing significantly – and they see that people don't necessary go to the grocery store anymore.  BRIAN REYNOLDS, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT NEW ALBION PARTNERS, A BROKER DEALER IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK:  If a stock price goes down, like Whole Foods did, that's going to attract activist investors. The deal is not (valued at) the highest price Whole Foods has ever traded at, but it's going significantly above the lows. That illustrates the trend of activists helping to put a floor under stock prices. If the CEO can't get a stock price up, activists will come in to try and do it. That's a huge change from two decades ago. This will put more pressure on grocery stores, especially their CEOs.  TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK: “That was rumored, I totally dismissed it. Wow. Amazon can pour money into any investment and they don’t need to make money. Investors are used to them not making money. It is $13.7 billion but it is still small relative to the size of the whole company.  It seems like a bit of an odd purchase because it is brick-and-mortar retail. On the other hand it gives them a distribution footprint to deliver goods in a short time frame. Perishable goods and food aren’t always the best when delivered by FedEx. Obviously canned goods are.  It gives them a presence, the stores can be expanded to do other things. Amazon has talked about having a brick-and-mortar retail presence where perhaps people just go in to look at things.  This could be part of that strategy – you take part of a Whole Foods Store and you add in Echo and all the other Amazon products.

Early on Friday a public service vehicle was blown up by an improvised explosive device (IED) between Fino and Sheikh Barow, Mandera County Commissioner Frederick Shisia said.

We suspect it is al Shabaab militants, as they are the ones who are behind planting of IEDs in the area.

The queen met locals on her way into the Westway Sports Centre, which has been turned into a makeshift shelter after the blaze on Wednesday morning engulfed a 24-storey tower block and killed at least 30 people. As the royals were leaving the centre, they were met with cheers but also anguished cries for help from a crowd of about 40 people. One man held a poster of a missing person, and shouted that he wanted to speak to the queen about lost children. The queen waved to the crowd, and then hesitated before getting into her car. Some continued to shout in desperation prompting William to respond:  I'll come back, I'll come back.  Inside the sports centre, which has become a major hub for the relief effort and a shelter for those displaced in the fire, the queen and prince met volunteers and emergency services.  It's come over very strongly how good the community has been to help,  the queen said. The fire in the block in west London burned for hours, and authorities fear that the official death toll of 30 is likely to rise, with many of the dead unlikely ever to be identified. London Fire chief Dany Cotton said that the intensity of the blaze was unlike anything she had ever seen, sentiments echoed by the prince.

Shenzhen-based Vanke has been in discussions with the Hopu-Hillhouse consortium for a couple of weeks, said one source, adding that the bidding group was talking to at least two other potential investors from China. The consortium, also backed by the Singapore-listed firm's CEO Ming Mei, plans to set up an investment fund for its bid, two sources said. Potential new backers, including Vanke, are considering joining the race as limited partners (LPs) of the fund, rather than potential equity holders in GLP.  All the sources, familiar with the talks, declined to be named because the information was not public.  Vanke, Hopu, GLP declined to comment while Hillhouse did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  GLP, which is backed by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Ltd and whose customers include Amazon.com (AMZN.O)  and JD.com (JD.O), said last week that it had asked short-listed bidders to present firm proposals by the end of June.  Private equity firms Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] and Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) are among the bidders that were picked by GLP to move to a new phase of the bidding process and examine the company's financials, Reuters reported in February. GLP, which has a market capitalization of about $10 billion, earns two-thirds of its revenue from China, where it has 15.8 million square meters of leasable or completed logistics facilities on lease.  Vanke's interest in GLP stems from the fact that it has also been diversifying into warehousing over the past two years as the property development business struggles amid intensifying competition. The company, which has a logistics joint venture with Blackstone, posted a lower first-quarter profit.  Vanke has yet to finalise the terms with the Hopu-Hillhouse consortium and the composition of the bidders could be subject to changes later, two sources said.

For banks, the priority is to stabilise the regulatory framework. We thus must finalise Basel III,  Villeroy said in reference to the talks by international bank supervisors. Basel III, written by the global Basel Committee, tightens capital requirements after the 2007-09 financial crisis. The bulk of the rules are being implemented, but final elements are gridlocked. The discussions have stumbled over a proposed  floor  which would mean capital cannot fall below 75 percent of the  standard  approach set out by regulators and used by most lenders, while big banks use models to add up risks instead. Speaking as the head of the French financial sector regulator, Villeroy told a conference in Paris that an output floor at that level was unacceptable and a deal was needed at a lower level but with more strict supervision of banks' internal models.  I read or hear negotiating advice from the banking industry and from French banks in particular. A bit of control would not hurt, and our aim is not to defend sector interests,  Villeroy said.  If an output floor at 75 percent is unacceptable, it’s because this threshold and therefore the standard model would become the constraint for half of international banks,  he said. Germany, the Netherlands and the European Union's executive European Commission held the same view, he said. The Basel Committee met on Wednesday and Thursday, and in a statement on Friday said it continues to make progress in reaching agreement on the output floor.  Importantly, there is a keen desire among all Basel Committee of Banking Supervision member organisations to bring this to a conclusion as soon as possible,  the committee's chair, Stefan Ingves, said in a statement. Unilateral Usa The U.S. Treasury published a review of regulation on Monday which recommended delaying two core Basel III rules already agreed. Villeroy said the review could call into question the two rules just as the EU begins a process for implementing them.  A unilateral deregulation would only be a lose-lose game with grave consequences both for the stability of the global financial system and for competition between American and European banks,  Villeroy said. When Europe comes to implementing an eventual deal on Basel III, it should pay particular attention to what's happening in the United States, Villeroy said. International regulatory cooperation is a  shared asset  and vital for the future, he said.  The temptation to row back is very dangerous. It would increase the probability that a new financial crisis erupts. In this regard, the situation in the United States is worrying.  In its review, the U.S. Treasury made a point of backing the proposed output floor because, it said, in some cases non-U.S. banks have significantly lower capital requirements. U.S. lenders have complained that European rivals are allowed to hold less capital. A banking source said those comments from the Treasury may have soured the mood at this week's Basel meeting.  The Europeans don't want the United States to use Basel to punish them,  the banker said.

Banco Popular was wound down by European authorities following a run on the bank, wiping out shareholders and junior bond holders, last week. As part of the rescue, Spain's largest bank Banco Santander acquired the troubled lender for a nominal 1 euro. During Ron's time as chairman from 2004 to 2017, shares in Popular lost around 95 percent of their value as the lender struggled to rid its books of toxic real estate assets. Angel Ron's lawyer Maria Begona de la Fuente Fernandez was not immediately available to comment. According to the documents from the Madrid regional court, Ron was earning 105,077 euros ($117,434) a year when he became general manager of the lender in 1998. Before his ousting in February, he was earning 106,282 euros a month. The banker, who had also accumulated rights for a pension of 24.2 million euros, has defended himself by saying that the bank was solvent when he left. Retail investors have begun filing lawsuits to determine the responsibility of the last and previous chairman and some board members of Popular.

But emerging markets fund managers who bought Russian equities in January will have seen the MSCI Russia equity index tumble more than 15 percent in dollar terms since then.  It fell as much as 2 percent at one point on Thursday, hitting 15-month lows and has fared worse this year than even Qatar, which is locked in a high-profile spat with its Gulf neighbors:     Russia's setback is part of a global cooling of 'Trump trades'. These were mainly based on hopes that President Donald Trump would boost the U.S. - and global - economy through spending increases.  But he was also expected to repeal sanctions imposed in 2014 to punish Russia for its role in the Ukraine crisis. As a result, most foreign investors were overweight Russia until this month, holding more Russian stocks than the country's share in the benchmark indexes, according to data from Renaissance Capital.  This seemed obvious as an apparent  bromance  between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin promised a thaw in diplomatic ties. But far from lifting sanctions, U.S. lawmakers this week voted for fresh, stickier, curbs while preventing Trump from easing existing ones.   The two theses behind the overweight have both collapsed - oil prices and Trump,  said David Hauner, head of emerging markets cross-asset strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.   People were bullish on oil, which turned out to be wrong, and there were hopes on sanctions relief, which also turned out to be wrong.   Hauner, among those bullish on Russia in January, advised clients in March to reduce exposure to the stock market and has since cut Russian bonds too, citing worries over how heavily foreigners were positioned in both markets.  Crude futures meanwhile were near six-month lows, despite repeated supply cuts and price forecasts have fallen each month in 2017. Oil revenues make up almost half the government budget revenues while six of the 10 biggest Russian stocks by market capitalization are energy firms.  The latest steep losses mean state shipping firm Sovcomflot - specializing in transporting oil and gas - will delay a planned share sale which had been planned for this week, a source told Reuters on Thursday.  Rouble Stronger  On the domestic front, things are looking up. The economy should grow 1.5 percent in 2017 after two years of contraction while company earnings have improved.  Russian earnings-per-share (EPS) have on average bounced 27 percent from troughs hit in 2016 and should expand 7-9 percent in the coming six months, noted Michael Bolliger, head of emerging market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management.   That part of the Russia story is intact,  Bolliger said but admitted the decision to overweight Russian stocks had proved  painful .  We are having discussions on how to reposition.   Russian bond investments have fared better, earning dollar-based returns of over 10 percent this year, thanks to a conservative central bank that has cut interest rates very slowly. It is expected to ease policy on Friday by 50 basis points but has pledged to keep rates well above inflation.  But high interest rates have lured record fund inflows into Russia's domestic bonds, in turn boosting the rouble 8 percent against the dollar until this week RUB=.  That has effectively severed a long-standing correlation between the currency and oil. So while crude slid 11 percent off May peaks, the rouble lost 1.2 percent, Christopher Granville, managing director at consultancy TS Lombard said in a note this week.   The rouble's de-coupling from oil compounds the blow for Russian oil stocks,  Granville said, advising clients to re-focus on domestically oriented sectors such as retail and avoid energy stocks that face oil price weakness and rouble strength.

The dinar traded at 121.94 against the euro at 1244 GMT, up 0.2 percent, even though it was off 121.86 touched earlier, its strongest level since January last year.     Two and a half months after winning presidential elections and quitting the post of prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic named his successor, Ana Brnabic, late on Thursday.     Little is known about the political preferences of Brnabic but she is expected to keep to investor-friendly policies.      She will be remotely controlled (by the president) and her job will be not to deviate an inch from present policies that have been agreed with the World Bank and the IMF,  Sasa Djogovic at the Belgrade-based Institute for Market Research said.       Blue Bay Asset Management analyst Timothy Ash said the nomination  shows the strength of Vucic's own domestic political position - given his three straight election wins now, and also likely his own confidence in the abilities of Brnabic .        Central Europe's main currencies also strengthened, regaining some of the ground that they lost after Wednesday's hawkish Federal Reserve comments triggered dollar buying.     The dinar escaped Thursday's selling wave.     While domestic markets are illiquid, euro supply is boosted by Serbians living abroad returning for holidays, Djogovic said.     The fundamental support to the dinar is the fiscal reforms which secured a budget surplus worth 1.2 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2017 instead of a deficit agreed with the International Monetary Fund.      Serbia's central bank continued euro buying interventions in the market on Friday to stem the gains of the dinar, dealers said. The bank bought about 250 million euros this year until Thursday.     Both Standard & Poor's and Fitch are due to review their credit ratings to Serbia on Friday.      S&P; has had Serbia on positive outlook since the last year while strong fiscal consolidation and political commitment to deepening the reform zeal are likely to win Serbia one notch upgrade,  Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note.      Meanwhile, Fitch would be likely to upgrade its outlook to positive for the same reasons,  he said.

Again. Euro zone governments threw indebted Greece another credit lifeline worth 8.5 billion euros on Thursday, offered further clarity on a roadmap to possible debt relief and the International Monetary Fund said it might join a bailout program after sitting on the fence for two years.  What's the big deal? Is it going to change the real problem of more than a million unemployed Greeks?  said Maria Papadia, 42, jobless for four years.  Do they understand the pain when you can't find a decent job for so long and your measly unemployment benefit runs out after 12 months?  Greece's unemployment rate -- pumped up by years of austerity demanded by the lenders -- is still running above 23 percent, with youth unemployment around 45 percent. Related CoverageGerman budget committee to discuss Greek compromise deal on Weds - sourcesTaking a drubbing in opinion polls, leftist Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the deal was a  decisive step  towards the country emerging from the debilitating crisis which has pushed more of a third of the population into poverty, and  turned thousands of Greeks into economic migrants.  His finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, declared:  There is now light at the end of the tunnel.   A pro-government newspaper, Avgi, called it  The beginning of the end to the Greek drama,  saying that the euro zone's s decision forms a strong basis for Greece to leave its bailouts behind from August next year. A man reads newspaper headlines in Athens, Greece June 16, 2017.Costas BaltasGreece has had their bailouts since 2010 and came close in 2015 to crashing out of the euro zone. No Debt Relief An elderly Greek man shops at the main food market in central Athens, Greece June 16, 2017.Costas BaltasCentre-right Eleftheros Typos daily was less upbeat, saying the closure of the country's bailout review, which led to pension cuts and higher taxes, did not bring any substantive benefit other than the disbursement of the next loan tranche.  Debt relief is put off for the summer of 2018 while the country's inclusion in the ECB's quantitative easing program was not secured,  it said, referring to the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme, The mood on the streets of Athens on Friday was also more subdued.  I think the climate could change, not immediately though,  said Dimitris Kokkotos, 57. In a nation battered by unemployment where elderly pensioners are called to support their jobless offspring, discussion on whether, or when the country might be given relief to taper a mountain of debt reaching 180 percent of output was of secondary importance. And the anger remains over what is widely seen as too stringent demands by lenders that have driven the country into poverty.   I'm fed up of being fooled. Its nerve wracking,  said Mary Koutra, 59.  Lenders have put us in a snake pit ... they just want slaves, not individuals displaying initiative, or dignity.

It was set to be the second week of falls for MSCI's widely tracked world index, although Wall Street and Europe, which has been the star performer in the first half of the year, were trying to end it on an upnote. London, Frankfurt and Paris climbed between 0.3 and 0.5 percent, futures pointed to a stable restart for Apple and the like and euro the pound and the Swiss franc rose against the dollar in the currency market. Greece's 10-year government borrowing costs fell to their lowest since 2014 in bond markets as well, as euro zone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund approved a long-delayed 8.5 billion euro lifeline for Athens, albeit keeping them hanging on for debt relief.  The things that we were worried about at the start of the year which were French elections and potentially a Greek deal not getting done, we have had all the good news on that now,  said State Street Global Markets' strategist Michael Metcalfe. He said the dollar's rise for the week suggested markets had now priced in that positive news - France's new President Emmanuel Macron is expected to get a parliamentary majority at the weekend too - and were thinking where to go next. The Japanese yen hit a two-week low against the dollar after the Bank of Japan left its mass money printing programme unchanged, maintaining the contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which signalled further tightening this week. It was trading 0.4 percent lower at 111.35 yen per dollar, while the euro was buying $1.1170 compared with almost $1.13 earlier in the week. The yen's drop helped Japan's Nikkei advance 0.7 percent, narrowing its loss for the week to 0.3 percent.  The market was relieved that there was no mention of an exit strategy, at least for now,  said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Submerging Markets MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down roughly 0.85 percent for the week though for emerging markets more broadly it was looking like being the worst week of the year so far. Russian stocks steadied on Friday but have been hammered more than 4 percent this week and the rouble is down for a third straight week, on talk of increased Western sanctions and as oil prices have stumbled back again. The tech-heavy Nasdaq whose big names like Apple and Alphabet led Wall Street lower again on Thursday after more bearish analysts' reports, pointed to a stablisation in U.S. trading rather than a rebound.  Basically these stocks looks stretched. We have seen some really strong gains this year and we really haven't seen a significant pull back,  said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.  If you look at a stocks like, Amazon they are trading 90 pct above 200-week moving average. Sorry but that it just absurd.  U.S. data also continues to come in mixed. U.S. homebuilding fell to the lowest level in eight months figures showed ahead of the Wall Street restart, dampening the mood again after better-than-expected unemployment claims numbers and a survey on business conditions on Thursday. Back in Europe, Britain's sterling added almost 0.2 percent to $1.2775 having jumped as high as $1.2795 the previous day after a Bank of England decision to kept UK rates at a record low was much closer than expected. In commodities, oil remained subdued on continued worries over rising U.S. gasoline inventories adding to already elevated global supply. Global benchmarks Brent and U.S. crude ticked up to $47.34 and $44.74 a barrel, on track for 2.4 and 2.8 percent drops for the week respectively. It will also be their fourth consecutive week of falls. The dollar's strength kept gold flat at $1,255 an ounce, failing to make up Thursday's 0.6 percent drop. It is poised to close the week with a 1 percent loss, its second weekly decline.

Prime Minister Theresa May wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the EU before Britain leaves in March 2019, followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of Brexit.  As we set out in the Article 50 letter, our view is that withdrawal agreement and terms of the future relationship must be agreed alongside each other,  a spokesman for Britain's Brexit ministry said.  We believe that the withdrawal process cannot be concluded without the future relationship also being taken into account,  the spokesman said.  The withdrawal and future are intimately linked.  While May has repeatedly said she wants a special and deep partnership with the club Britain joined in 1973, she has also laced her assurances with threats that a breakdown of talks could harm security cooperation. Since her gamble on a snap election failed a week ago, May has come under pressure from some in her own party to change her approach to Brexit talks. Her spokesman said Britain would not change its stance on Brexit, though May told her lawmakers she would seek a broader consensus in the party on her approach. The Brexit ministry said it wanted to move ahead on securing the rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom and UK citizens in the European Union.  That has always been our first aim and that is what we will do,  the spokesman said.  We want to end the anxiety facing 4 million citizens.

The Circuit de la Sarthe, hosting the 85th edition of the French classic, has a history of heartbreak and five times runners-up Toyota know all about that. Only one Japanese manufacturer has ever won Le Mans - Mazda in 1991 with a rotary-engined car - but Toyota had looked like ending that last year until some last lap drama handed the race to Porsche. Kazuki Nakajima had been heading for the checkered flag when he reported a problem with five minutes remaining. The Japanese slowed, coming to a halt as Porsche celebrated their 18th victory. Nakajima, who put Toyota on pole in 2014 only to retire while leading in a race won by Audi, is back on the front row with a score to settle after qualifying the number eight Toyota alongside pole-sitter Kobayashi in the number seven car. Kobayashi's fastest lap on Thursday was more than two seconds quicker than the previous record and at an average speed of 251.9 kph (156 mph). Toyota had already put down a marker in pre-race testing earlier in June, when their cars filled the top three places, and they are leading the FIA world endurance championship after two wins in two rounds.  After the test it is difficult to say that we are not favorites,  Toyota technical director Pascal Vasselon said recently.  That is what we have been working for.  Having already destroyed the lap record, and with fine weather predicted all weekend, Toyota could also break Audi's 2010 record for the longest distance covered in 24 hours if all goes to plan.  The record will probably be broken because back then our car was running five to six seconds slower than today's cars,   French driver and 2010 winner Romain Dumas told the www.lemans.org website. With Audi pulling out after last year's race, Porsche are Toyota's only rivals for overall victory and they have their two cars on the second row in third and fourth places as they chase a third straight win. Porsche also have five previous winners in their two crews with New Zealander Brendon Hartley the odd man out - although he did win the world endurance championship in 2015. Toyota's third car qualified fifth with the only other entry in the top LMP1 category, the privately-run ByKolles team's sole entry, lining up sixth. Others in the 60-car field include Brazilian former F1 driver Rubens Barrichello, making his debut in a Dallara LMP2 car at the age of 45, and Indy Car compatriot Tony Kanaan, filling in for the injured Sebastien Bourdais in a Ford GT.

The rating actions are as follows: Suffixes of 'emr' have been assigned to ratings of issues with ISIN numbers XS0355551291, XS0347741455, XS0371238469 and XS0315425701 to reflect embedded market risk in determination of their coupon amounts. Ratings on these four issues were upgraded to 'A' from 'A-' in a separate rating action today along with ratings of other structured notes issued by Deutsche Bank AG that do not require 'emr' suffixes under Fitch's Global Bank Rating Criteria. Issues with ISIN numbers XS0313629387, XS0313979527, XS0208740315, XS0440245511, XS0219357430, XS0231649061 and XS0320166779 have been withdrawn because they are not principal-protected and, therefore, should not be rated according to Fitch's Global Bank Rating Criteria with respect to ratings of structured notes. The 11 issues were of small amounts (all but one was for USD50 million or less) and none were benchmark issues. This type of issue is typically in response to reverse enquiry (requested by private or institutional investors as bespoke products). KEY RATING DRIVERS During a review of Deutsche Bank's rated structured notes with respect to the ranking of these in insolvency following a change in German law, Fitch identified that its changes to criteria in 2010 and 2011 with respect to rating structured notes had not been applied to these issue ratings, all of which were initially assigned prior to 2010. The applicable criteria were revised in August 2010 to adopt 'emr' suffixes and in August 2011 to no longer assign ratings to issues that were not principal-protected. RATING SENSITIVITIES Ratings of issues with ISIN numbers XS0355551291, XS0347741455, XS0371238469 and XS0315425701 are primarily sensitive to (1) changes in Deutsche Bank AG's IDRs, (2) our assessment of the volume of subordinated and non-preferred senior debt buffers relative to the recapitalisation amount likely to be needed to restore viability and prevent default on preferred obligations, (3) subsequent changes to the resolution regime or Fitch's expectation of how resolution would be implemented in practice, and (4) subsequent changes to the resolution regime altering the hierarchy of the various instruments. The required amount of subordinated and senior vanilla debt buffers is sensitive to increases in Deutsche Bank AG's capital requirements, in particular of the individual pillar 2 regulatory requirements, as we assume that these determine the level to which the bank would have to be recapitalised upon resolution. Furthermore, the ratings are sensitive to Fitch's assumptions regarding the individual points of non-viability at which the regulator is likely to require a recapitalisation by way of bail-in of junior and standard senior instruments. We expect the European Commission's (EC) proposal to amend Directive 2014/59/EU by introducing a new class of non-preferred senior debt, if and when implemented in German law, to leave the subordination of outstanding non-preferred senior debt intact. However, the EC's proposal could trigger a downgrade of the ratings of issues with ISIN numbers XS0355551291, XS0347741455, XS0371238469 and XS0315425701 if its transposition into German law reduces the buffer of junior and non-preferred senior debt or modifies the ranking of senior instruments.

This is the first fatal incident involving a Malaysian-owned Hawk 108 since 2003. The RMAF has ordered a temporary suspension of its Hawk 108 fleet pending an investigation. Malaysia's plans to upgrade its ageing fleet of fighter jets have been complicated by defence budget cuts, as Prime Minister Najib Razak grapples with growing public discontent over the rising cost of living.

Technology stocks, including those of Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, were slightly higher in premarket trading as investors likely hunted for bargains. The S&P; 500 technology sector, which had surged 17.4 percent in 2017, is on track for its biggest weekly decline since June last year.

So I think investors are still willing to come in and buy the dips,  said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, Illinois.  Technology has been on the top of the pile for the past six to nine months, which is unusual. So we will likely continue to see this sector rotation.

The UK prime minister is in talks to form a government with Northern Ireland’s main pro-British political party. Brexit was always likely to put immense pressure on Northern Ireland, and a pact between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party could make things even more tense. Why is Northern Ireland so important? Talks on Britain’s exit from the European Union are due to begin next week. All sides have agreed that Northern Ireland is one of the red-line issues that must be addressed before the substance of Brexit can be discussed – along with the size of the so-called Brexit bill, the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa. Northern Ireland is no simple matter, though. It has the UK’s only land border with another EU member state, the Republic of Ireland, so the impact of any post-Brexit restriction in trade or movement of people will be significant. Residents on both sides of the Irish-UK border remember decades of violence between pro-UK unionists and Irish republicans that came to an end with the Good Friday agreement of 1998. The physical divide between the north and the south of Ireland is largely invisible today, yet it remains the most politically sensitive border in Europe. The main objective is thus to avoid a “hard” Irish divide at all costs. What happens when the region leaves the EU? Northern Ireland faces big Brexit risks. Take funding from Brussels. For every 10 pounds earned by Northern Ireland’s farmers, the Common Agricultural Policy accounts for 8.70 pounds. The EU has financially underwritten the north’s peace process for decades. Northern Ireland sends a fifth of all its exports south of the border to the Republic of Ireland, so tariffs and the introduction of new red tape would hurt. All-island supply chains and production processes are enmeshed. And curbs on free movement of people would add disruption for the 30,000 people that cross the border daily for work. How might the DUP play its hand? The Democratic Unionist Party is in favour of Brexit and union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, but it doesn’t want a hard border. Now it has leverage over a Conservative party that has at times treated it cavalierly. In addition to maintaining the roughly 9 billion pound annual fiscal transfer from Westminster that props up the region’s sickly economy, the DUP is likely to ask for additional monies for infrastructure and health spending, devolved powers to lower Northern Ireland's corporate tax rate, and a generous package for farmers. That is the easy part. While the DUP wants the post-Brexit border to remain as open as possible, its priority is to veto any assignation of special status to Northern Ireland in the Brexit negotiations. Meanwhile, the DUP’s nationalist opposite, Sinn Fein, is using Brexit as a way of pushing for a united Ireland. What’s so bad about special treatment? Were Northern Ireland to be subject to different rules from Britain, the DUP thinking goes, it would undermine the idea of United Kingdom unity. That takes one potential remedy for Northern Ireland’s Brexit problems squarely off the table: membership of the European Economic Area. Being part of that grouping, which includes non-EU members like Iceland and Liechtenstein, might allow trade and people to flow freely between the north and south. Still, without access to the EU customs union or structural funds, it is no perfect solution. Another good option for Northern Ireland would be for the UK to remain in the customs union and there has been speculation that the DUP could press May for a softer Brexit. A more cynical view is that the unionists could live with a hard border provided they get what they want in other areas. The trouble is, currently Brexit negotiations can’t begin in earnest until progress is made on Northern Ireland. And any progress that requires clarification of Britain’s relationship with Europe is therefore, by definition, impossible. Can this have a happy ending? May faces at least four competing interests in trying to cobble together a solution for Northern Ireland: Europe, the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland’s unionists and nationalists. The region’s nationalist and unionist communities have diametrically opposed views on Brexit. Bringing the DUP into the heart of 10 Downing Street has already aggravated nationalist parties. But it’s not a given that Ireland and its European partners will agree either. However, it can only be a good thing for the Northern Ireland question to finally be getting airtime in London's corridors of power. Clear-eyed reflection on the practical implications of a hard Brexit is now that bit more difficult to avoid. And the folly of May’s desire for both a hard Brexit and open border won’t stand up to close scrutiny. There are no easy solutions for Northern Ireland. At worst, that might leave Brexit talks in a quagmire. Still, forcing some serious debate about the challenges ahead may turn out to be the best outcome of the whole complex affair.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Takata, one of the world's biggest automotive suppliers, has been working for months to complete a deal with Key Safety. A person briefed on the matter told Reuters Key was expected to acquire Takata assets as part of a restructuring in bankruptcy. The Nikkei business daily reported that a new company created under Key will purchase Takata operations for about 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) and continue supplying air bags, seat belts and other products, leaving liabilities behind in a separate entity. Takata declined to comment. Michigan-based Key, owned by Chinese supplier Ningbo Joyson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said on Friday it had suspended trading in shares of Takata following media reports of preparations for a bankruptcy filing. At its previous close, it had a market value of $360 million.  Also at stake is $850 million owed by Takata to major global automakers under a settlement agreed to earlier this year stemming from the automotive industry's largest ever safety recall. Sources familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said a final deal with Key may not be reached before Takata files for bankruptcy. The company plans to begin proceedings in both the United States and Japan, the sources said.  Major global car manufacturers have expressed concern about the company filing for bankruptcy without a deal in place because of disruption it could cause to the production of replacement air bag inflators. More than 65 percent of 46.2 million recalled Takata air bag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Takata Corp is seen on its display at a showroom for vehicles in Tokyo, Japan, February 9, 2017.Toru Hanai/File PhotoA U.S. judge said earlier this year the costs of replacing all of the faulty Takata inflators could be $8 billion. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. In January, Takata agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and to pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into ruptures of its air bag inflators linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. They also have been blamed for more than 180 injuries worldwide. Slideshow (2 Images)A federal grand jury in January indicted three former Takata executives for criminal wrongdoing in connection with the safety defect. Takata has already paid a $25 million fine and $125 million to a victims' compensation fund, including for future incidents. Takata has until early 2018 to pay the $850 million owed to automakers, or within five days of securing a financial backer.     Then-U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said in January that if Takata filed for bankruptcy, the Justice Department would be a creditor in the restructuring. Key was chosen by Takata earlier this year as the favored buyer for the company. Since then, Key has been working with Takata on a restructuring plan.  Inflator recalls began around 2008 and involve around 100 million inflators around the world used in vehicles made by 19 automakers, including Honda Motor Co, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Tesla Inc. Recalls are to continue through at least the end of 2019. Last month, four automakers including Toyota Motor Corp agreed to a $553 million settlement to address class-action economic loss claims covering owners of nearly 16 million recalled vehicles with Takata inflators.

To go ahead, the new pipeline would need to receive bids for long-term contracts to supply 7.5 billion cubic metres of gas, or 75 percent of the pipeline's capacity, Soeren Juel Hansen, chief consultant at Danish gas system operator Energinet, said. On June 6, Poland and Denmark, the project's main partners, launched a so-called Open Season, which consists of two bidding phases for gas shippers in order to check market demand. Phase one closes on July 25. Energinet would proceed with economic tests that could lead to construction agreements  if the bids are sufficient from 7.5 bcm and more  in phase one of that process, he said, adding most bids would have to be for 15-year contracts. Poland's state-run PGNiG, which has indicated it would book most of the pipeline's capacity, said it would place bids in the next six weeks.  We expect to be the key shipper in this project,  Marek Woszczyk, the head of PGNiG's Norwegian subsidiary, told Reuters, adding the pipeline's transport cost were a key factor.  The tariffs will define the business case for the shippers,  Woszczyk said. Energinet's Hansen said market participants had indicated in a 2016 study that the tariff levels on offer were attractive. He did not say at what level they would be set. In addition to Poland, the pipeline could supply Ukraine and other nations, via Poland's onshore gas infrastructure. The estimated 2 billion euro pipeline cost includes enhancing Poland's gas network.  The current planned reinforcements of the Polish system is sufficient to allow for exports to Ukraine,  Hansen said, adding Germany, Sweden and Denmark could also receive gas from the pipeline. Discussions for the pipeline first began in 2001 and have been held on and off since then. During that period, Poland signed a supply contract with Gazprom.  This is the first serious attempt (to build such a pipeline) in 15 years and probably a once in a lifetime opportunity,  Hansen said. $1 = 0.8954 euros Editing by Gwladys Fouche and Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/norway-gas-europe-idUSL8N1JC4SM"},

The cost may be reduced even further, said Murat Zhurebekov, chief executive of PSA LLC, a unit of state energy firm KazMunayGaz tasked with representing the Central Asian nation in some of its largest joint ventures with global majors. Zhurebekov did not say how the costs estimate had been revised, but said the review reflected lower crude prices. Kazakhstan is seeking $1.6 billion from the consortium of foreign investors operating Karachaganak, according to a 2016 report by Lukoil. The Astana government has said the dispute was about calculations of the parties' shares in the field's output. But Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev, who spoke to reporters separately on Friday, said the dispute, which Kazakhstan has taken to international arbitration, would have no effect on the project which aims to ensure that the field maintains its peak output for a longer period.  I have met a delegation of the Karachaganak consortium today,  he said.  They do not link these two issues.  Eni and Royal Dutch Shell each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, which they jointly operate. Kazakh state-owned KazMunayGaz owns 10 percent, Chevron Corp 18 percent and Lukoil 13.5 percent. One of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, Karachaganak contains 1.2 billion tonnes of oil and gas condensate and more than 1.35 trillion cubic metres of gas. It produced 139.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2016, down 1.4 percent from a year earlier.

After May suffered a shock loss of her parliamentary majority last week, businesses are becoming more vocal about how the government should handle the talks, hopeful their views will carry more weight than before the election. Nicole Sykes, the head of EU negotiations at Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents the country's biggest companies, said the election result should lead to a  reset  in the way the government approaches the talks. She said Britain should grant the 3 million EU nationals already living in Britain the right to remain, say there will be no return to border controls in Northern Ireland, and prioritise jobs and the economy.  There is a lot to get done and the clock is ticking,  she said.  Let's make sure we get the tone right.  Britain is preparing for the start of the negotiations that are arguably its most important since World War Two and that will have the potential to define its relationship with its biggest trading partner for generations. Businesses sense an opportunity to change the UK's negotiating stance after May signalled before the vote she favoured a departure from the European customs union as well as the single market, and a focus on controlling immigration. John McFarlane, who chairs lobby group TheCityUK as well as Barclays, favoured the same concessions as the CBI and said Britain should offer to have joint regulatory oversight of EU-related financial activity in Britain and agree to resolve any legally binding financial commitments.  Create the goodwill and certainty on things that are going to be done anyway,  McFarlane told Reuters.  It creates a better environment for agreement on other things that they don't want.  Peter Hargreaves, the billionaire who founded stockbroker Hargreaves Landsdown and the biggest donor to the leave campaign, also backs guaranteeing the rights on EU nationals to remain working in Britain.  There are lots of people who have come here, they work hard, they contribute to the economy, they have families here, why would you want to get rid of them?  he told Reuters.  We should just make the gesture and let the EU respond.  Pay Op Ahead of the talks, EU negotiators also say that May should agree to pay Britain's bills to the European Union and drop threats to walk out without a legal deal. Other finance executives in Britain who have interacted with the British and the European Union said, meanwhile, that Europe's officials were much better prepared and organised for the divorce talks. The executives said EU officials were asking much more detailed, technical questions about the impact of Britain's departure that will give the bloc an advantage in the talks.  At the moment it's like putting a featherweight up against a heavyweight,  one executive said. (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-business-idUSL3N1JD3MD"},

While none of Frontline's own vessels are currently used for this purpose, independent shipbrokers estimate that around 10 of the world's very large crude carriers (VLCCs) have recently been contracted for oil storage.  It sounds correct, and the number is rising,  Frontline Chief Executive Officer Robert Macleod said.  It's always an option,  he added. Frontline has 20 VLCCs, each of wich can carry around 2 million barrels of oil. VLCC spot rates are currently below Frontline's cash break-even level of $22,300 per day, trading at just $15,000-20,000 and making storage relatively inexpensive for those who think oil prices will rise. Later in the year, the cost of renting ships will likely rise however as the demand for crude picks up.  We expect a seasonal improvement in third quarter.

The special anti-terrorism court said the six had transported weapons and planted bombs, which targeted landmark buildings in the financial hub, including the main stock exchange. A seventh man was acquitted on a lack of evidence.  Investigators had said the bombs were ordered by India's most-wanted man, gangster Dawood Ibrahim, to avenge the demolition of the historic Babri mosque in north India by Hindu hardliners in 1992, during a period of religious conflict. All of the seven men are Muslim and were arrested between 2003 to 2010. Arguments to decide on the sentences will begin on Monday, said Deepak Salvi, special prosecutor for the Central Bureau of Investigation, India's federal police, who said he would seek the maximum penalties available for each of the convicted men. The maximum penalty is death.  It's a victory for the CBI, Mumbai police and the people of India who trust in justice,  Salvi told Reuters. The six convicted men were Abu Salem, Mustafa Dossa, Feroz Abdul Rashid Khan, Taher Merchant, Riyaz Siddiqui and Karimullah Khan. Lawyers for the men were not immediately reachable. Legal proceedings against those accused of being involved in the bombings have resulted in more than 100 convictions, most of which are still winding their way through the legal system because of appeals and commutations of sentences.  One suspect in the case, Yakub Memon, was hanged in 2015. Several people suspected to have been involved in the bombings have yet to be arrested, including Ibrahim, who is believed to be hiding in Pakistan. Pakistan denies that.

Two heads of district environmental protection branches got jail time for ordering staff from national monitoring stations to falsify data, according to the ruling by a court in the central city of Xian, Xinhua said. The court found them guilty of  damaging the computer information system , it added, without elaborating.

Five others were also sentenced, among them two heads of the monitoring stations. It was not possible for Reuters to reach the seven individuals for comment. Falsifying monitoring data has become a crime as severe as creating the pollution itself, under laws that took effect in 2015, though there have been few high-profile prosecutions yet.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Instinct Loans, the bank’s electronic loan trading platform that kicked off June 16, 2016, touts increased liquidity and has won over many initial skeptics in the private loan market where trades typically take place over the phone. Since inception, the bank has done almost US$5bn in loan trade volume electronically. In the last three months, transactions on Instinct have made up about 17% of trade volume in the loans offered on the system, according to data compiled by the bank.  We're very pleased with the success of the platform during its first year,  Brian Callahan, head of electronic initiatives and US par loan trading at the bank, said in a statement.  We look forward to helping our clients and the broader loan market increase the liquidity of leveraged loans.  Electronic trading platforms have blossomed in the wake of regulatory pressure that has forced banks to cut back on market-making. The systems promise investors improved liquidity by facilitating multiple offers for the debt.  Trade volume in the loan market, which provides financing to back acquisitions, has skyrocketed, hitting US$174.5bn in the first three months of the year, according to IHS Markit, the second most active quarter since 2012. The Instinct platform allows multiple participants to bid on a specified number of loans during two daily trading periods. Recent sessions have included more than 200 loans totaling more than US$385bn of debt, according to the bank. Five of BAML’s top 10 most active loan trading clients completed an average of 32% of their activity electronically, the bank said. BAML reached its first US$1bn of pure electronic trade volume on August 30, according to a September 19 e-mail to clients, LPC reported at the time. The bank’s trading desk sets fixed, mid-market prices for large syndicated loans and hosts a matching session where clients can bid or offer against that mid price. When two participants match, the trade is completed. The mid price is set once per session and does not fluctuate with market activity outside the session.  The bank continues to make markets and trade loans through traditional trading.

The world's largest automaker's core division is being restructured with thousands of job cuts and retrenchments in parts and vehicle development as it struggles to fund a post-dieselgate shift to electric cars and new technologies. More than 10 new models launched this year including the top-of-the-line Arteon fastback and a redesigned Polo subcompact, one of VW's all-time bestsellers, would stoke demand and underpin the turnaround, VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told Reuters on Friday.  We are making good progress,  Diess said during an event to present the next-generation Polo.  2018 will be a strong year for VW,  he said, adding a new product always helped margins. VW brand's operating margin jumped to 4.6 percent in the first quarter from 0.3 percent a year earlier, still lagging French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA) but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent. Diess said VW had a goal for 2017 to maintain the brand's first-quarter performance when operating profit surged to 869 million euros from 73 million a year ago.  The most important thing is the product offensive in coming months,  Diess said. Herbert Diess, chairman of the board of Volkswagen, speaks during the World premiere of Volkswagen's new Polo in Berlin, Germany June 16, 2017.Stefanie LoosWolfsburg-based VW is counting on the larger, technology-packed Polo model to revive its sluggish sales in the core European market where the brand's deliveries slid 0.2 percent in the January-to-May period to 726,000 cars. The new Polo, priced from 12,975 euros ($14,500) and due to hit showrooms in October, will be the main volume product VW launches this year, preceding the all-new T-Roc, a Golf-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) which is due out later in 2017. Slideshow (15 Images)A spokesman declined to specify the new Polo's on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and whether they met EU targets, saying VW at this point only had emissions estimates for the model which cannot be disclosed. The advent of the new Polo will intensify the struggle for dominance in Europe's crowded subcompact segment where the VW model is going up against a redesigned Ford (F.N) Fiesta and an upgraded Renault (RENA.PA) Clio, all vying for the top spot. Research firm IHS Markit expects the VW model to win easily. European deliveries of the Polo may jump a quarter to 368,158 cars by 2025 from 293,700 this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain to 328,846 models for the Fiesta and a 32 percent plunge to 185,525 cars for the Clio, according to IHS. Registrations of the Peugeot (PEUP.PA) 208 model may surge a fifth to 277,067 cars, IHS said.

Housing starts dropped 5.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the lowest level since September 2016. April's sales pace was revised down to 1.16 million units from the previously reported 1.17 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking activity rising to a rate of 1.22 million units last month. Homebuilding fell 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, decreased 3.9 percent to a pace of 794,000 units last month, also the lowest level in eight months. Since racing to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, single-family home construction has lost momentum.  Economists blame the moderation on supply constraints rather than demand for housing, which remains underpinned by a strong labor market. The unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, which is a 16-year low, is gradually lifting wages for workers. While mortgage rates have risen, they remain low by historical standards.  A survey on Thursday showed a dip in homebuilder confidence in June, with homebuilders expressing frustration over ongoing shortages of skilled labor and building lots.  In May, single-family starts surged 12.5 percent in the Northeast and jumped 9.5 percent in the Midwest. But they tumbled 8.9 percent in the South and dropped 4.9 percent in the West.  Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment declined 9.7 percent to a rate of 298,000 units. Multi-family housing starts have now declined for five straight months.  With rental increases appearing to have leveled off after strong gains over the last few years, there is probably limited room for strong growth in the construction of multi-family homes. Building permits last month fell 4.9 percent to a pace of 1.17 million units, the lowest level since April 2016. That suggests homebuilding could remain weak in the coming months.

VLCC spot rates are currently below Frontline's cash break-even level of $22,300 per day, trading at just $15,000-20,000 and making storage relatively inexpensive for those who think oil prices will rise.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Instinct Loans, the bank’s electronic loan trading platform that kicked off June 16, 2016, touts increased liquidity and has won over many initial skeptics in the private loan market where trades typically take place over the phone. Since inception, the bank has done almost US$5bn in loan trade volume electronically. In the last three months, transactions on Instinct have made up about 17% of trade volume in the loans offered on the system, according to data compiled by the bank.  We're very pleased with the success of the platform during its first year,  Brian Callahan, head of electronic initiatives and US par loan trading at the bank, said in a statement.  We look forward to helping our clients and the broader loan market increase the liquidity of leveraged loans.  Electronic trading platforms have blossomed in the wake of regulatory pressure that has forced banks to cut back on market-making. The systems promise investors improved liquidity by facilitating multiple offers for the debt.  Trade volume in the loan market, which provides financing to back acquisitions, has skyrocketed, hitting US$174.5bn in the first three months of the year, according to IHS Markit, the second most active quarter since 2012. The Instinct platform allows multiple participants to bid on a specified number of loans during two daily trading periods. Recent sessions have included more than 200 loans totaling more than US$385bn of debt, according to the bank. Five of BAML’s top 10 most active loan trading clients completed an average of 32% of their activity electronically, the bank said. BAML reached its first US$1bn of pure electronic trade volume on August 30, according to a September 19 e-mail to clients, LPC reported at the time. The bank’s trading desk sets fixed, mid-market prices for large syndicated loans and hosts a matching session where clients can bid or offer against that mid price. When two participants match, the trade is completed. The mid price is set once per session and does not fluctuate with market activity outside the session.  The bank continues to make markets and trade loans through traditional trading.

The latest modifications to the world's largest airliner will be announced at next week's Paris Airshow, they said, proceeding with a program of efficiency improvements first reported by Reuters in March.  We have always said the A380 has further efficiency upside potential,  an Airbus spokesman said, declining further comment. The A380 has suffered a dearth of sales as airlines switch to slightly smaller models with two engines, which are easier to fill and cheaper to maintain. FILE PHOTO: An employee works on an Airbus A380 plane inside the Air France KLM maintenance hangar at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Roissy, near Paris, France, May 31, 2016.Philippe Wojazer/File PhotoThe project to make the double-decker A380 more attractive to buyers has already led to the scrapping of its  grand staircase  in favor of a more compact structure, leaving more room for seats. The combination of the improved aerodynamic wing performance and increased seating to more than 600 would lower the operating cost per seat, a key barometer for airlines. Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier confirmed last week that Airbus was considering improving the A380 with winglets to make it cheaper to fly. Such devices cut fuel consumption by reducing drag, but they can involve a weight penalty because the wing may have to be strengthened. Industry sources have estimated that the overall makeover would improve fuel efficiency by about 2 percent.

The latest modifications to the world's largest airliner will be announced at next week's Paris Airshow, they said, proceeding with a program of efficiency improvements first reported by Reuters in March.  We have always said the A380 has further efficiency upside potential,  an Airbus spokesman said, declining further comment. The A380 has suffered a dearth of sales as airlines switch to slightly smaller models with two engines, which are easier to fill and cheaper to maintain. FILE PHOTO: An employee works on an Airbus A380 plane inside the Air France KLM maintenance hangar at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Roissy, near Paris, France, May 31, 2016.Philippe Wojazer/File PhotoThe project to make the double-decker A380 more attractive to buyers has already led to the scrapping of its  grand staircase  in favor of a more compact structure, leaving more room for seats. The combination of the improved aerodynamic wing performance and increased seating to more than 600 would lower the operating cost per seat, a key barometer for airlines. Airbus Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier confirmed last week that Airbus was considering improving the A380 with winglets to make it cheaper to fly. Such devices cut fuel consumption by reducing drag, but they can involve a weight penalty because the wing may have to be strengthened. Industry sources have estimated that the overall makeover would improve fuel efficiency by about 2 percent.

But Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reassured markets the BOJ will still lag well behind the Federal Reserve in dialing back its massive stimulus program, with inflation far from reaching his 2 percent target. He also shrugged off the need to scrap the BOJ's pledge to increase its bond holdings at 80 trillion yen ($729 billion) per year, even though recent purchases have slowed significantly.  There's some distance to achieving 2 percent inflation, so it's inappropriate to say now specifically how we will exit our ultra-loose monetary policy, and how that could affect the BOJ's financial health,  Kuroda told a news conference.  We will debate an exit strategy only after 2 percent inflation is achieved and price growth stays there stably.  As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero under its yield curve control (YCC) program. Relishing recent bright signs in the economy, the central bank upgraded its view on private consumption for the first time since December 2016 to say it has shown  increased resilience.  That was a more upbeat view than the previous meeting in April, when it said spending was resilient. The BOJ revised up its assessment of global growth and reiterated its optimistic view that Japan's economy was heading for a moderate expansion.  The BOJ has grown confident on the economy, although it is fully aware inflation remains low despite a tightening labor market,  said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.  Unless inflation accelerates unexpectedly, the BOJ will likely stand pat on policy at least until next April when Kuroda serves out his current term.  Consumption has been a soft spot in Japan's otherwise strengthening economy, with its weakness blamed for keeping inflation subdued by discouraging companies from raising prices.  Stealth  Tapering? People walk past the Bank of Japan building in Tokyo, Japan June 16, 2017.Toru HanaiGrowing signs of life in Japan's economy have presented a fresh communication challenge for the BOJ, pushing it to be clearer with markets on how it might withdraw its stimulus - without sounding as if such an action is imminent. Inflation remains disappointingly low, making BOJ officials wary of releasing too much detail on how the bank may exit its ultra-loose policy in the future. Kuroda conceded that it was taking longer than expected to achieve his inflation target because prolonged periods of deflation have accustomed the public to acting on the assumption that inflation and wage growth won't accelerate. But he shrugged off calls from critics of his radical stimulus program to abandon the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target or dial back monetary support. Slideshow (3 Images) I know there are various discussions on the pros and cons of prolonged easing. But what's most important is to achieve price stability and maintain it,  Kuroda said. He also rebuffed the view the BOJ ought to slow purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF), which it accelerated last year to fend off damage from the market disruption caused by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.  We don't buy these assets to manipulate stock prices to a certain level. We buy them to achieve our 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible,  Kuroda said. After years of heavy money printing failed to drive up prices, the BOJ last year added YCC to its massive asset-buying program, under which it buys government bonds and risky assets such as ETFs. While it now targets interest rates instead of the pace of money printing, the BOJ has maintained a loose pledge to increase its bond holdings at 80 trillion yen per year to appease proponents of aggressive asset purchases on its board. But with this prodigious buying drying up market liquidity, the BOJ has slowed its bond purchases considerably in recent months. Analysts expect the BOJ to slow its buying to around 60 trillion yen by year-end and omit the 80-trillion-yen pledge from its policy statement. Kuroda, however, said he saw no reason to remove the pledge because the pace of bond buying could fluctuate from time to time.  The amount we buy would be determined based on how much is necessary to guide interest rates appropriately,  he said.

Figures from the U.S. bank which tracks investment flows from Wednesday to Wednesday showed $17 billion had gone into Wall Street equity funds over the last week, second only to a $35.5 billion one back in December 2014. It fuelled a $24.6 billion global increase into stocks as a $26.3 billion surge into exchange traded funds saw no impact from the week's sell-off in tech stocks and was only trimmed fractionally by a $1.7 billion outflow from mutual funds. Investors also continued to pile into  high-yielding  fixed income such as emerging market bonds and high-yield debt too, taking inflows over the past four weeks to $35 billion, the fastest pace since Feb. 15. In the tug of war between deflation and inflation, government bonds, seen as a deflation asset, saw the largest inflows in 20 weeks at $1 billion whereas inflation-linked U.S. 'TIPS' saw minor outflows for a forth week in five. There was also a warning about the recent rise in stocks. BAML analysts said an  end of an era  was looming with the world's big central banks, that have flooded $10.8 trillion into financial markets since the collapse of Lehman Brothers and spent $1.5 trillion this year alone, set to become sellers of assets in the coming years.

The Senate approved on Thursday the sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and other activities not related to the international nuclear agreement.  The U.S. Senate’s move is unquestionably in breach of both the spirit and the letter of the nuclear deal,  Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was reported by media as saying on Friday.  The Iranian committee tasked with monitoring the accord will certainly examine the congressional move and come up with a decent response.  The U.S. legislation still must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law.  Trump has in the past called the nuclear agreement between Tehran and the major powers  the worst deal ever negotiated . Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. The United States and its regional ally Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of subverting regional security. Iran also accuses its arch foes, Washington and Riyadh, for promoting Islamist militancy in the region.

Transport Minister Graziano Delrio said he had tried to negotiate with union leaders, but  sadly, it will be a black Friday .

A dam was constructed here after the Wajir County Assembly passed a climate change act in 2016, one of the first in Kenya, freeing up government funds for projects chosen by local people. The people of Wajir-bor, 40 km (25 miles) west of the border with Somalia and inhabited mainly by the Degodia clan of the Somali ethnic group, decided on the water pan, which provides water for domestic use and for livestock to drink.  With the money, they also installed a water tank and a diesel generator to pump water into an animal trough, and fenced off the shallow reservoir to keep it clean. Wajir’s Climate Change Fund, set up through the act, is resourced with 2 percent of the county’s development budget. The money is set aside for efforts to adapt to climate change impacts such as worsening drought.  The fund can also harness finance from international sources, and has received about 62.7 million Kenyan shillings ($606,000) from the UK government.  Wajir residents have chosen community members to represent them on the local adaptation committees that shape the projects, with women making up at least a third.  This system gives a voice to ethnic Somali women who are traditionally excluded from leadership roles in their patriarchal communities, experts say.  In Wajir-bor, five of the 13 committee members are women. A water users association was also established, led by an elected board of 12, including three women whose job it is to manage the water pan on a daily basis.  Women Decide Ahmed Abdi, CEO of Arid Lands Development Focus Kenya (ALDEF Kenya), said women now have a chance to influence decisions that affect their livelihoods, particularly on issues of grazing pastures and water.  “Traditionally, women only had more say when there was water scarcity,” said Abdi. “It is then they can decide that the little water that is available near the homestead will not be used for livestock but for domestic use.”  In that case, men are forced to search for water further away, he added.  But now women are starting to gain more power over the wider water situation. “After the recent rainfall, there is still water in various smaller pans and earth dams where the livestock graze,” explained Amina Mohamed, 50, a committee member for the Wajir-bor water association. “This dam will be opened for use when the livestock have exhausted water in other dams.” She also works to maintain the fence around the water pan, and prevent people and animals from trespassing.  “We asked the county to build the fence so that livestock do not walk into the dam when drinking, making the water dirty,” she said.  The watchman keeps them out during the day but Mohamed said a herder recently got in with his animals when the guard was off-duty.  “We investigated and found out the person who broke in and he has since been arrested,” she said. The committee will ensure the trespasser pays for the fence repairs, setting an example to others.  Thirsty Giraffes El-Ben dam is another water project paid for by Wajir’s Climate Change Fund. Hebla Hussein, 52, a mother of nine, helps manage the local water users association. Its committee of 12 members includes five women.  Hussein is also involved in the day-to-day running of the water pan, which has been fenced off due to the menace of wildlife like thirsty giraffes and hyenas.  “Giraffes are strong and can damage the fence and get into the dam to drink, especially when it is dry,” said Hussein.  The El-Ben water users association has already reported the invasions to the Kenya Wildlife Service, asking it to provide water for the wild animals. Women’s involvement in climate change adaptation committees is a step forward but it is not yet enough, experts say, as they do not yet have equal representation in most cases.  ALDEF Kenya’s Abdi said it is just as important to select female members who are well-equipped to push forward the concerns of other women when it comes to climate change.  “It is not about numbers but about getting the right person,” he said. “If you get a few women who are able to articulate their issues, even among many men, then they will be able to represent themselves.” ($1 = 103.4500 Kenyan shillings) Reporting by Anthony Langat; editing by Megan Rowling.

Apple <AAPL.O., Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Facebook (FB.O), the five largest U.S. technology stocks, have seen their combined market capitalization fall by about $120 billion since last Thursday.  By Thursday the S&P; 500 technology index .SPLRCT had seen its largest five-day drop in a year.  The slide was again led by sector heavyweights Apple and Alphabet, as investors moved away from what had been the year's best-performing sector and rotated portfolios into stocks that pay higher dividends amid some signs that U.S. economic weakness.  “I think it’s a perfectly normal backing off. Tech has done really well. All of sudden everyone wakes up and says, ‘Holy cow, maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves,’ and backs off a little bit,  said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts.     Among technology stocks hit, shares of Google's parent Alphabet fell 0.8 percent Thursday after broker Canaccord Genuity downgraded its rating of the stock to  hold  from  buy.  The broker downgrade triggered a broader technology sector selloff according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.   Apple shares slid 0.6 percent on Thursday, extending their five-day decline to 6.9 percent. Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote that Apple is near the peak valuation levels in its iPhone 6 cycle which  could mean a bumpy ride lower  if the prospects for sales of its next phone disappoint.  Shares of social media company Snap Inc (SNAP.N) closed at their initial public offering price of $17 for the first time. Some investors were selling technology shares to rotate into other sectors, such as beaten-down energy stocks, said Russ Koesterich, co-portfolio manager of BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund. “It’s more the winners into the losers, rather than a broader move toward safety,” he said. The recent decline notwithstanding, the technology sector remains the best performing so far this year, up 17.4 percent versus the overall S&P; 500 index gain of 8.6 percent. FILE PHOTO --  The audience assembles before the start of Apple's annual developer conference in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017.Stephen Lam/File PhotoRotation to Value Amid Weak u.s. Economic Data  Companies including Apple and Google parent Alphabet have seen their stock prices soar in 2017, and their heavy weightings in benchmark stock indexes prompted concerns that overall market gains are too concentrated in a handful of large technology firms.   We had sensed over the last 4-5 weeks that clients were becoming uncomfortable with the clustering of returns to the S&P; 500 , said Julian Emanuel, executive director of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at UBS Securities.  It felt to us that you had the elixir for a correction in the (technology) sector.  Concern over the earlier gains in technology stocks this year has been compounded by some recent weak U.S. economic data. Last month, the U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs, well below the expected gain of 185,000. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.3 percent in May, marking the largest one-month decline since January of last year. Also, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month, the second drop in inflation in three months. In the 12 months through May, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since last November. U.S. Treasury yields tumbled to their lowest since early November on Wednesday on the weak data.  Tech is one of the losing sectors when the interest rate trade is dominating because rates are falling,  said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Investments, an affiliate of Nuveen, because investors need to look for higher yield in dividend paying stocks. Resilience in S&P; 500 Benchmark Despite the 3.7 percent drop for technology stocks .SPLRCT over the past five sessions, the S&P; 500 .SPX index has barely budged, slipping just 0.05 percent over the same period. The resilience in the S&P; 500 benchmark has resulted from investors rotating their portfolios into other sectors such as financials and the more defensive sectors like real estate .SPLRCR.   It definitely feels like a rotation that's gone on for a few days with tech being weakened,  said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.  What's done well in the last few days is the more bond-like plays.

ALDEF Kenya’s Abdi said it is just as important to select female members who are well-equipped to push forward the concerns of other women when it comes to climate change.  “It is not about numbers but about getting the right person,” he said. “If you get a few women who are able to articulate their issues, even among many men, then they will be able to represent themselves.” ($1 = 103.4500 Kenyan shillings) Reporting by Anthony Langat; editing by Megan Rowling.

FireEye said it believes that a single hacker or hacking group that it dubbed FIN10 is behind the breaches due to similarities in method: how they broke into corporate systems, stealing gigabytes of sensitive data and demanding ransom paid in Bitcoin, and publicizing the stolen information by alerting bloggers. While FireEye declined to identify victims by name, the methods described in their report echoed those used in attacks on Goldcorp, the world's third-biggest gold miner by market value, smaller operator Detour Gold, and the Casino Rama Resort. FireEye said FIN10's degree of operational success makes more campaigns  highly probable  and that it had evidence suggesting the group had targeted additional victims. FireEye said FIN10 used the moniker Angels_of_Truth at least once, claiming to attack in retaliation for Canadian sanctions against Russia. More often, it borrowed the name Tesla Team from a group of Serbian hacktivists. FireEye believes FIN10 was flying 'false flags' with those names, with no backing from a nation-state or affiliation with organized criminals. Angels_of_Truth was the name used by hackers who contacted a databreaches.net blogger between April and June 2015 claiming credit in Russian and English for the Detour intrusion. The same blogger, alerted to a breach at Goldcorp in April 2016, published details on the Daily Dot website before Goldcorp acknowledged the compromise. The Vancouver-based miner has since modified its IT processes, increased network security protocols, and worked to educate its staff about cyber risks, a spokeswoman said. After that breach, a mining industry group formed a network to share information on cyber threats. At least six members, including Teck Resources Ltd, will take the project live next month. FIN10 is still in contact with some victims and more targets may  become aware of the threat in the coming weeks or months,  said Charles Carmakal, vice president at FireEye's Mandiant unit. Detour Gold did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did Casino Rama, which said in November that sensitive customer, employee and vendor data had been stolen. Some was reportedly later posted online, and they now face a class action lawsuit over the breach.

The proposal would allow Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) to make a play for secondary listings from Chinese firms such as Alibaba Group and Baidu Inc that have been drawn to New York due to less stringent rules on profitability and share structures. The HKEX said the move was necessary to increase its exposure to new high-growth sectors, but the proposal is likely to stoke renewed fears over corporate governance standards following a series of scandals and short-sell attacks in the financial hub.  The opening up of our market to secondary listings of Chinese companies is a big part of what we aim to do,  Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX told a news conference on Friday.  There's no reason why Hong Kong can't become a secondary listing market for major U.S. companies.  The proposed new board would exclusively list 'new economy' companies in sectors such as internet and biotech. There would be a  pro  segment for start-ups with no financial track record open only to professional investors, and a  premium  segment for established companies accessible to all investors, the bourse said. Both segments would allow weighted voting rights and waive rules that have prevented Chinese companies already listed in an overseas markets to pursue a secondary listing in Hong Kong. The proposal follows the high profile loss of Alibaba's record $25 billion IPO to the NYSE in 2014 after the HKEX was unable to grant the company dual class shares - sparking a fierce debate over Hong Kong's ability to attract Chinese tech listings. Despite being home to one of the world's largest technology companies by market value, Tencent Holdings, Hong Kong has failed to attract a significant volume of listings from software makers, online businesses and other fast growing firms. Tech firms' fundraising accounted for an average 2.5 percent of all Hong Kong IPOs since the global financial crisis compared with 13.6 percent at the NYSE, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Hong Kong securities regulator in 2015 rejected a HKEX proposal to introduce dual class shares to the main board, but the HKEX hopes by restricting them to a specific segment it may have more success persuading the SFC this time round. Corporate Governance Fears The proposals come, however, amid intense debate over corporate governance problems in the Hong Kong market, following a series of scandals at companies including Hanergy Thin Film and Huishan Dairy. The HKEX on Friday attempted to address some of these concerns by tightening listing rules for its Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), or second board, which has seen high levels of price volatility due to very concentrated shareholdings. Bankers and corporate governance experts said the new board may still struggle to attract new economy companies while at the same time lowering corporate governance standards in the city.  The GEM has not been a great success and we have doubts about the third board,  said Jamie Allen, secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association.  The feedback we get is that companies want to be on the main board and have a premium listing - and we remain against dual class shares as we fear this could be the thin end of the wedge,  he added. The new board would need additional safeguards to protect investors, including greater accountability for directors and a tougher delisting regime, said Nelson Tang, partner at Hogan Lovells in a statement. The consultation closes on Aug. 18 and the exchange hopes to finalise the new rules by 2018. $1 = 7.8001 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Elzio Barreto; reporting and writing by Michelle Price; Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Elaine Hardcastle","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/hkex-regulations-listing-idUSL3N1JD2YV"},

MacKenzie, 53, succeeds Jac Nasser from Sept. 1, after activist shareholders have challenged the world's biggest miner to revamp its structure and improve returns. Investors welcomed the appointment of MacKenzie, who said he plans to meet shareholders in the coming weeks to listen to their views. He was seen as one of Australia's most successful chief executives in his 10 years of running Amcor Ltd. Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at Legal and General Investment Management - the fifth biggest shareholder in BHP's London listing with 2.48 percent - said he welcomed the announcement of  a forward-thinking chairman .   We will continue our discussions on the prospects of the business,  he said. Canadian-born MacKenzie presided over a long stretch of prosperity at Amcor, which makes packaging for food producers, industrial companies and pharmaceutical firms, that coincided with the end of a boom period for mining companies. Hedge fund Elliott Management has fired a barrage of criticism at Nasser and BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie since releasing a roadmap of changes it wants at the company, most notably an exit from U.S. oil and shale businesses. Elliott also wants BHP to collapse its dual listing, and earlier this week called for a board shake-up, blaming long-tenured directors for bad investments and ill-timed share buybacks.  That could place MacKenzie, who joined BHP's board only last year, in good standing. Focused on capital discipline, he replaced 75 percent of Amcor's top 80 managers in his first two years at the company.

BHP/Handout viaFile PhotoOn Friday, Elliott said it supported the appointment of MacKenzie as a  constructive step in bringing much needed change to the direction of BHP.  Portfolio managers at another activist shareholder, Tribeca Investment Partners, were not available to comment. Nasser has defended the company's $20 billion investment in shale acquisitions in 2011 against Elliott's criticism.   BHP also faces a significant juncture in the Samarco mine dam liability saga in Brazil, which is meant to be settled in September. In late 2015, a burst dam at Samarco, a joint venture between BHP and Brazil's Vale, killed 19 people and caused the country's worst environmental disaster as mud and waste destroyed a village and polluted the Rio Doce river. Shaw and Partners mining analyst Peter O'Connor said MacKenzie would face a chorus of shareholders seeking change and rejuvenation of the board.  He really needs to hit the ground running,  he said. Despite being the world's biggest mining house, BHP has a history of appointing executives from outside the sector as chairs. Since 1984 only two out of six chairmen had mining  backgrounds. BHP's shares were little changed on Friday but have suffered a stretch of underperformance against arch rival Rio Tinto. The stock is down about 18 percent from its 2017 peak in late January. additional reporting by Barbara Lewis in London; Editing by Richard Pullin and Adrian Croft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bhp-billiton-chairman-idUSKBN19631R"},

Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015, but a bitter row over his will, specifically what to do with the old family home, broke into full public view this week, prompting the eldest son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to issue a statement saying he was  disappointed  and  deeply saddened . Lee Kuan Yew moved into the five-bedroom house, formerly owned by a Jewish merchant, in 1945, as the Japanese Occupation ended and the island returned to British colonial rule.  Over the next decade 38 Oxley Road became a hub of political activity, and it was in the basement that the People's Action Party, which has led Singapore since independence, was conceived.  Four years before he died, LKY, as he was popularly known, said the bungalow should be demolished once he'd gone.  He said it lacked foundations, suffered from damp, had cracks in the walls and was costly to maintain.  But fortunately the pillars are sound,  he joked to the Singapore Straits Times. Related CoverageSingapore PM's sister-in-law changes job role amid family feudFeud within Singapore's first family leads to outpouring of concern on social mediaAccording to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's siblings, their older brother wants the house to be preserved as a symbol of modern Singapore's history. The prime minister said he had recused himself from all government decisions involving the house, but has raised questions over how his father's will was drawn up. The sister, 62-year-old Lee Wei Ling,  still lives in the bungalow, just a short walk from the city's main shopping district at Orchard Road. She and her brother, Lee Hsien Yang, insist it should be demolished in accordance with their late father's wishes, and have accused their elder brother of using  organs of the state  to intimidate them as the row, waged over social media and through the Singapore press, escalated this week. FILE PHOTO: Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong arrives at the Hangzhou Exhibition Center to participate in the G20 Summit, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, September 4, 2016.Etienne Oliveau/File PhotoTheir father, in the newspaper interview, had disdained the idea of tourists trickling through the tired, old house, with its retro furniture.  I've seen other houses, Nehru's, Shakespeare's. They become a shambles after a while. People trudge through,  Lee said. Not only that, he said the zoning regulations should be changed to let all owners on Oxley Road build higher than the current two-story limit to boost the value of the real estate. Private home prices in Singapore have risen 15 times compared to 1975, government data shows. The price of bungalows in the central region, like the Lees, have doubled in the last ten years, according to real estate services firm Cushman and Wakefield. Any demolition or redevelopment can happen only after the daughter moves out, so it could be years before any changes are made. As things stand, if the bungalow were to be knocked down, the property could only be redeveloped as a modern residential house, or a row of terrace houses, experts suggest. Estate agents estimated that the 12,060-square foot plot  was currently worth around S$24 million ($17 million).   You can't build 20 storeys on it, so that puts a cap on the land value,  said Ku Swee Yong, CEO of International Property Advisor Pte Ltd.  Depending on how you design the two-floor mixed-landed project the land value could be worth a little bit more, so let's say S$25 million.  Christine Li, director of research at Cushman, provided a similar valuation, but added that it could fetch more due to its  special address .  For instance, if it is sold through an auction, this address is likely to fetch a much higher value, just like how art does,” Li said.

Portfolio managers at another activist shareholder, Tribeca Investment Partners, were not available to comment. Nasser has defended the company's $20 billion investment in shale acquisitions in 2011 against Elliott's criticism.   BHP also faces a significant juncture in the Samarco mine dam liability saga in Brazil, which is meant to be settled in September. In late 2015, a burst dam at Samarco, a joint venture between BHP and Brazil's Vale, killed 19 people and caused the country's worst environmental disaster as mud and waste destroyed a village and polluted the Rio Doce river. Shaw and Partners mining analyst Peter O'Connor said MacKenzie would face a chorus of shareholders seeking change and rejuvenation of the board.  He really needs to hit the ground running,  he said. Despite being the world's biggest mining house, BHP has a history of appointing executives from outside the sector as chairs. Since 1984 only two out of six chairmen had mining  backgrounds. BHP's shares were little changed on Friday but have suffered a stretch of underperformance against arch rival Rio Tinto. The stock is down about 18 percent from its 2017 peak in late January. additional reporting by Barbara Lewis in London; Editing by Richard Pullin and Adrian Croft","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bhp-billiton-chairman-idUSL3N1JC5U1"},

In remarks on Wednesday, Yellen called an emerging debate over raising global inflation targets  one of the most important questions facing monetary policy,  as central bankers grapple with an economic rut in which low growth, low interest rates and weak price and wage increases reinforce each other. The aim would be a change of households' and businesses' psychology, convincing them that prices would rise fast enough in the future that they would be better off borrowing and spending more today. Success in anchoring inflation in the 1980s and 1990s defined central banking throughout the developed world. It has  become a core aim of the Fed and an article of faith for Germany's Bundesbank and later the European Central Bank, founded in 1998 with the mandate of maintaining price stability defined as inflation under 2 percent. That 2 percent target, which translates into prices doubling roughly every 35 years and is considered both offering stability and a sufficient buffer from deflation, is now common for the developed world's central banks. Raising that target to 3 or even 4 percent as some economists have suggested would shift the outlook of firms in particular, allowing them to charge more for goods and pay more for labor without the fear that a central bank would step on the brakes. To be effective, the Fed would have to back that new target with a slower pace of any rate increases than it would otherwise deem appropriate. That could prove risky for the central bank that has repeatedly missed its present target and conditioned people to expect subdued price and wage increases, said Moody's Analytics analyst Ryan Sweet.  The Fed would have to clearly and convincingly communicate the rationale for raising the inflation target and the potential economic benefits. Otherwise the central bank will lose in the court of public opinion.  In a sense, the Fed may be a victim of its own success and Yellen in the past has been sceptical the Fed could change expectations that were anchored by its ability to keep actual inflation low for years by simply raising its goal.  It's a paradox,  said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  There is less response of inflation when the Fed is successful.  By allowing inflation to run higher, the Fed would create more room for nominal interest rates to rise later without crimping economic growth, advocates say. With rates expected to remain historically low, Yellen and her peers are worried that even a mild recession will force them to cut interest rates to zero and deploy crisis-era tools, such as asset purchases, something they could avoid if rates in general were higher. Skeptics, however, question whether lifting the inflation target would have any lasting effect on economic activity. To Lift or Not to Lift During the current eight-year recovery the Fed has steadily marked down its estimates of U.S. economic potential, the interest rate needed to achieve it, and generally failed to get inflation back to 2 percent. Yellen on Wednesday said it may be time for a rethink.  We've learned a lot,  Yellen said about the time since 2012 when the Fed set the inflation target. One conclusion was that interest rates will be stuck at historically low levels unless something changes. Whether to raise the inflation target hoping it could be a catalyst of change  is one of our most critical decisions,  she said in what was the clearest indication of a debate taking shape inside the Fed. Central bankers in Europe, Japan, Britain and elsewhere have begun exploring the option as well, while the Bank of Canada reviews its inflation target every five years Any move is unlikely in the near term. Policymakers may not like missing their targets, but they also recognize the benefits of only modest price increases brought by central bank policies and a globalizing world economy that helped drive manufacturing costs down. Since the early 1990s median U.S. household income and overall consumer inflation have marched in virtual lock step. Health care and education cost have grown faster, but prices for clothes, furnishings and food have generally increased less or no more than household incomes - benefiting the poor who suffered the most during bouts of high inflation. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2t6NKld) But that may also have created a  sticky  psychology. Modern monetary policy rests heavily on a central bank’s ability to shape expectations, and the Fed and others have been so successful in keeping inflation down that now they seem unable to shift sentiment in the opposite direction. The Fed is also no longer quite sure about how some basic aspects of the economy are working these days. At 4.3 percent, the jobless rate is at a 15-year low, yet wage growth is weak and inflation has recently slipped further away from the Fed's goal. Quite how far it is prepared to go will depend on what Yellen noted was an assessment of  the potential costs that could be associated  with a higher inflation target. Such assessment, however, probably will not be ready during her term, which ends in February 2018.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-inflation-idUSL1N1JD0D5"},

A person familiar with the talks told Valor that Copec's Arauco unit valued Eldorado at 11 billion reais ($3.36 billion) in a non-binding offer sent to Brazil's billionaire Batista family, Valor said. The Batistas' investments are overseen by J&F; Investimentos SA, which owns 81 percent of Eldorado. Copec's Arauco is being advised by Banco Santander Brasil SA and law firms Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett LLP and Mattos Filho Advogados, Valor said. A transaction could be announced as early as Friday or over the weekend, the newspaper added. A representative of Santiago-based Copec could not be immediately reached for comment.

Trump will lay out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami that will roll back parts of former President Barack Obama's opening to the communist-ruled island after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes. Taking a tougher approach against Havana after promising to do so during the presidential campaign, Trump will outline stricter enforcement of an existing ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists and will seek to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the new U.S. administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. The new policy will ban most U.S. business deals with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, but make exceptions related to air and sea travel, the officials said. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines now serving the island. But even as he curbs Obama’s détente with Cuba, Trump will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, U.S. officials said. He will also leave in place some other tangible measures implemented by his Democratic predecessor, including the resumption of direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights, though Trump’s more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties overall. And, according to one White House official, the administration does not intend to “disrupt” existing business deals such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a historic Havana hotel. There are also no plans to reinstate the limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the island’s coveted rum and cigars that American can bring home for personal use, one White House official said. As a result, the changes – though far-reaching – appear to be less sweeping than many pro-engagement advocates had feared. Human Rights Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obama’s measures to a large extent on human rights grounds. His aides contend that Obama’s easing of U.S. restrictions has done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. Saying that the aim was to repair what Trump has called a “bad deal” struck by Obama with Havana, one U.S. official said the new administration would leave the door open to improved relations if Cuba undertakes democratic reforms such as allowing free and fair elections and the release of political prisoners. FILE PHOTO: Tourists pass by the U.S. Embassy in Havana, February 18, 2016.Alexandre MeneghiniInternational human rights groups say, however, that reinstating a U.S. policy of isolating the island could make the situation worse by empowering Cuban hardliners. The Cuban government has made clear it will not be pressured into political reforms in exchange for diplomatic engagement. At home, Trump’s critics have questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for its human rights record while insisting that in other parts of the world it will not lecture other countries on the issue. Trump will issue a presidential memorandum when he delivers his speech at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami’s Little Havana district, the heart of America’s Cuban-American and Cuban exile community. The venue is named after a leader of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 against Fidel Castro’s revolutionary government. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who was played a key role in pushing for Trump’s changes, was expected to attend along with U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart and other Cuban-American lawmakers. Under Trump’s order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations and they will not take effect until they are complete. Under the revised travel policy, U.S. officials say there will be tighter enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the 12 authorized categories they claim to be traveling under, which could spook many visitors, wary of receiving a hefty fine. While tourism to Cuba is banned by U.S. law, the Obama administration had been allowing people to travel to Cuba as part of “people to people” educational trips for visitors, a classification that a White House official said was “ripe for abuse” by those looking for beach vacations. Trump’s new policy will eliminate such visits by individuals while still allowing them to be done as group tours, and also retaining individual travel under other authorized categories such as religious, artistic and journalistic activities, the official said. But Trump’s planned rollback of Obama’s policy has drawn opposition from American businesses and the travel industry, which have begun making inroads on the island, as well as many lawmakers, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans. The new policy has come together after contentious meetings within the administration. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant in winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community.

The program, which was announced by President Barack Obama in 2014, never took effect because it was blocked in federal court. Obama had hoped that overhauling the U.S. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy. However, President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. The plan unveiled by Obama intended to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. However, it was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued Obama had overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress. A federal appeals court blocked the program, and the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand in a 4-4 split decision last year. Kelly said in a statement on Thursday he was rescinding the initiative, known as DAPA, because  there is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy.  An earlier program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), offers some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children the chance to attend school and to work. Trump has previously said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA, but no formal changes have been announced.  They shouldn't be very worried,  Trump said of DACA recipients in a January ABC News interview.  I do have a big heart. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-idUSL1N1JD0CZ"},

Mubadala spokesman Brian Lott told Reuters on Friday that a local media report saying that the fund has pulled out of Etisalat Nigeria was wrong and that several proposals are under discussion. He declined to elaborate on the options being considered but said he will know more next week. The Nigerian affiliate of Abu Dhabi-listed Etisalat has said it is in talks to restructure a $1.2 billion loan after missing a repayment, though sources have said that talks reached a deadlock on April 28. An Etisalat representative could not be reached for comment. Sources have said that Etisalat Nigeria has asked its lenders to take equity in the business and convert the dollar portion of the loan to naira, which the banks rejected. The lenders have instead asked parent Etisalat to inject more cash, the sources said. Etisalat, which owns 45 percent of the Nigerian company, is not willing to invest more after converting some of the affiliate's loans into equity and writing down its investment to $50 million, a source has said. Abu Dhabi's state-owned fund Mubadala owns another 40 percent. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, has been divesting some of its investments as crude prices have continued a lengthy slump. The chief executive of Mubadala, which owns 40 percent of Etisalat Nigeria, told Reuters in March that the state-owned fund could pare down its stakes in some companies. The loan that has proved so troubling for Etisalat Nigeria is a seven-year facility agreed with 13 local banks in 2013 to refinance a $650 million loan and fund expansion of its network. The company, however, is the biggest foreign-owned victim of dollar shortages plaguing Nigeria's financial system because of lower oil prices and economic recession, leaving it struggling to make the loan repayments. Nigerian regulators have agreed with local banks to pursue a default deal rather than receivership to avoid a wider debt crisis. But lenders, under pressure to avoid loan-loss provisions, are pushing to finalise the restructuring before half-yearly audits this month.

Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said there was  some distance  to achieving the BoJ's inflation target of 2 percent, and it was  inappropriate  to say how the Bank would exit its massive stimulus programme. That ran contrary to market speculation in the past month that the BoJ could be considering its own plan for eventually withdrawing emergency stimulus for the economy. This dragged the yen nearly half a percent lower to 111.415 per dollar by afternoon trade in London.  The theme continues to be the potential for further yen weakness because they (the BoJ) are still grappling with the deflationary mindset of the Japanese consumer,  said Martin Arnold, FX strategist at ETF Securities in London.  I think safe-haven trade is the only light at the end of the tunnel - there has to be some sort of significant (risk) event to light a spark under the yen.  The yen's moves came as the dollar edged lower from two-week highs hit since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and stuck to its guns on the likelihood of further moves this year. The index that measures the greenback's broader strength was 0.1 percent lower on the day at 97.340, but still set for its second weekly gain on the trot. A round of poor economic data has undermined market expectations for the scale of future U.S. rate rises and is likely to continue to weigh on the greenback.  I hear nothing from the Fed that seeks to dissuade the market from thinking that we're heading towards an extremely low peak in rates. And I think that's what's going to cap the dollar now,  said Kit Juckes, currency strategist with Societe Generale in London.  The more interesting question is, will the communication be that there's another one (hike) coming in the fall.  The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.1174, but still more than a cent below a seven-month peak of $1.1296 hit before the Fed's decision on Wednesday. Thursday's run of U.S. economic data gave dollar bulls some reason for cheer. The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, lower than the 242,000 that economists had forecast.  The USD appears to be driven by some reassessment of this week’s FOMC (Federal Open Markets Committee) decision as well some upbeat U.S. manufacturing survey data on Thursday,  Credit Agricole strategists wrote in a note.

Shenzhen-based Vanke has been in discussions with the Hopu-Hillhouse consortium for a couple of weeks, said one source, adding that the bidding group was talking to at least two other potential investors from China. The consortium, also backed by the Singapore-listed firm's CEO Ming Mei, plans to set up an investment fund for its bid, two sources said. Potential new backers, including Vanke, are considering joining the race as limited partners (LPs) of the fund, rather than potential equity holders in GLP.  All the sources, familiar with the talks, declined to be named because the information was not public.  Vanke, Hopu, GLP declined to comment while Hillhouse did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  GLP, which is backed by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Ltd and whose customers include Amazon.com (AMZN.O)  and JD.com (JD.O), said last week that it had asked short-listed bidders to present firm proposals by the end of June.  Private equity firms Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] and Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) are among the bidders that were picked by GLP to move to a new phase of the bidding process and examine the company's financials, Reuters reported in February. GLP, which has a market capitalization of about $10 billion, earns two-thirds of its revenue from China, where it has 15.8 million square meters of leasable or completed logistics facilities on lease.  Vanke's interest in GLP stems from the fact that it has also been diversifying into warehousing over the past two years as the property development business struggles amid intensifying competition. The company, which has a logistics joint venture with Blackstone, posted a lower first-quarter profit.  Vanke has yet to finalise the terms with the Hopu-Hillhouse consortium and the composition of the bidders could be subject to changes later, two sources said.

The blast came a day after authorities said they had arrested a suspect in connection with last month's explosion at a military-run hospital in Bangkok that wounded more than 20 people.  It was in a plastic bag hidden in a bush and city cleaning staff went to pick it out and opened it, that was when it exploded,  Kajornpong Jitpakpoom, the police commander in the city's Thonglor district, told Reuters.  It doesn't appear to be a deliberate attack,  he added.  It could be related to students, who sometimes use small bombs like this and hide them.  The devices are known as  ping pong  bombs as they are about the size of a table tennis ball. Police bomb squad officers were at the scene, the team's chief said, adding it was too early to provide details. No group has claimed responsibility for several small blasts in Bangkok in recent months, but they have fueled speculation that opponents of military rule are making a show of defiance. The military seized power from an elected government in May 2014, saying it had to step in to end months of at times bloody anti-government protests. The military has promised to hold an election next year, but critics say it is intent on using a new constitution to maintain  control over civilian governments. 'Hates Soldiers' Earlier on Friday, the military government suggested opposition to its rule was behind the hospital bomb attack last month, on the third anniversary of the coup.  He hates soldiers,  Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters, referring to the arrested suspect, whom he blamed for bomb attacks in Bangkok three or four times since 2007. The 62-year-old former electrical engineer was interrogated earlier on Friday at Bangkok's 11th Army Circle base, used by the military as a temporary prison. He has now been charged with premeditated murder, causing injury to others, and illegal possession of explosive materials and weapons.  Reuters was unable to contact the suspect and police said they were unable to comment on whether he had been granted a lawyer. The military has the power to detain civilians at military camps without charge and rights activists say some face unfair trials in military courts, which the junta has designated for cases involving national security. In August last year, explosions in several tourist towns on the same day killed four people and wounded dozens. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks, which some in the military government blamed on groups opposed to the junta.  Separatist insurgents in Muslim-majority provinces in the south also set off bombs, but rarely outside their region. The hospital bombing followed a small blast that wounded two people on May 15 outside Bangkok's National Theater and an explosion on May 5 in the city's historic quarter.  The arrested suspect was involved in the two incidents as well as the hospital bombing, police chief Chakthip Chaijinda said late on Friday.     Junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha has said more attacks and unrest could delay the general election, tentatively set for late 2018. Thailand has been roiled for more than a decade by a struggle between populist political forces supported by poorer voters, and the old military-led establishment, largely backed by better-off voters based in Bangkok.

Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said security had been tightened in the cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro and the authorities there were on the lookout for suspicious characters who might  attempt to sow some confusion or sow terror .  We're not denying that there's probably a few who may have slipped along with the evacuees from Marawi going to Iligan and Cagayan de Oro,  he told reporters in Manila, while OV-10 aircraft in Marawi pounded an area where militants have been holed up since May 23. The military says that up to 200 fighters, most of them from local insurgent groups that have pledged allegiance to Islamic State but also some foreign fighters, are holding out, using civilians as human shields and mosques as safe havens. The attempt by hundreds of well-armed militants to overrun and seal off the city has alarmed governments across Southeast Asia, which fear that Islamic State - losing ground in Iraq and Syria - is trying to establish a foothold in their region that could bring a rash of extremist violence. The defense ministers and military chiefs of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines will meet in the Indonesian town of Tarakan, on Borneo island, on Monday to discuss the threat and agree on steps to coordinate better to confront terrorism.

Philippines military spokesman Padilla told reporters that talk of fighters planning attacks in neighboring towns was based on  misinformation that's being spread by the enemies  and in fact their capacity was severely reduced.  Slideshow (11 Images)In a battle assessment on Friday, the military said those still in the town were also weakening.  Enemy resistance continues to dwindle and enemy-held areas continues to get smaller as troops advance,  it said, but giving no indication of how long it might take to retake the town. Previous deadlines to defeat the insurgents were missed. More than 300 people have been killed in the battle for Marawi, according to official estimates, including 225 militants, 59 soldiers and 26 civilians. A politician who has led rescue and relief efforts said on Thursday that residents fleeing Marawi had seen at least 100 dead bodies in an area where the fighting had been fierce. The military said it could not confirm that number.

But slower growth this year will cause a higher loan-to-GDP ratio, which is a concern.  Turnover on Friday was 966.4 million rupees ($6.3 million), above this year's daily average of 899.4 million rupees. Foreign investors were net buyers of 63.3 million rupees worth of shares, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 20.71 billion rupees. Inflation could rise in the short term, especially due to crop damage and difficulties in distributing fresh-food produce and staple food items, analysts said, after the recent floods and landslides, caused by the worst torrential rains in 14 years. Shares in Hemas Holdings Plc ended up 4.2 percent, while Ceylon Tobacco Company Plc rose 1.2 percent.

Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015, but a bitter row over his will, specifically what to do with the old family home, broke into full public view this week, prompting the eldest son, current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to issue a statement saying he was  disappointed  and  deeply saddened . Lee Kuan Yew moved into the five-bedroom house, formerly owned by a Jewish merchant, in 1945, as the Japanese Occupation ended and the island returned to British colonial rule. Over the next decade 38 Oxley Road became a hub of political activity, and it was in the basement that the People's Action Party, which has led Singapore since independence, was conceived. Four years before he died, LKY, as he was popularly known, said the bungalow should be demolished once he'd gone. He said it lacked foundations, suffered from damp, had cracks in the walls and was costly to maintain.  But fortunately the pillars are sound,  he joked to the Singapore Straits Times. According to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's siblings, their older brother wants the house to be preserved as a symbol of modern Singapore's history. The sister, 62-year-old Lee Wei Ling,  still lives in the bungalow, just a short walk from the city's main shopping district at Orchard Road. She and her brother, Lee Hsien Yang, insist it should be demolished in accordance with their late father's wishes, and have accused their elder brother of using  organs of the state  to intimidate them as the row, waged over social media and through the Singapore press, escalated this week. Their father, in the newspaper interview, had disdained the idea of tourists trickling through the tired, old house, with its retro furniture.  I've seen other houses, Nehru's, Shakespeare's. They become a shambles after a while. People trudge through,  Lee said. Not only that, he said the zoning regulations should be changed to let all owners on Oxley Road build higher than the current two-story limit to boost the value of the real estate. Private home prices in Singapore have risen 15 times compared to 1975, government data shows. The price of bungalows in the central region, like the Lees, have doubled in the last ten years, according to real estate services firm Cushman and Wakefield. Any demolition or redevelopment can happen only after the daughter moves out, so it could be years before any changes are made. As things stand, if the bungalow were to be knocked down, the property could only be redeveloped as a modern residential house, or a row of terrace houses, experts suggest. Estate agents estimated that the 12,060-square foot plot was currently worth around S$24 million ($17 million).  You can't build 20 storeys on it, so that puts a cap on the land value,  said Ku Swee Yong, CEO of International Property Advisor Pte Ltd.  Depending on how you design the two-story mixed-landed project the land value could be worth a little bit more, so let's say S$25 million.  Christine Li, director of research at Cushman, provided a similar valuation, but added that it could fetch more due to its  special address .  For instance, if it is sold through an auction, this address is likely to fetch a much higher value, just like how art does,” Li said.

A full list of rating actions is in the Rating Action Report available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link above. All other ratings of the issuers in this Rating Action Commentary and in the accompanying Rating Action Report are unaffected by the rating actions. The rating action follows Fitch's review of the expected ranking of these notes in a resolution scenario given their structural features. The upgrade to one notch above the banks' respective Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) reflects Fitch's view that the terms of these notes are commensurate with  preferred  treatment under Germany's revised resolution regime in force since 1 January 2017. DB's and Aareal's statutorily preferred senior unsecured debt would be protected from default in a resolution scenario by large buffers of junior and statutorily non-preferred senior debt. The rating action extends the considerations previously applied only to notes classified as market-linked by Fitch, ie structured notes with embedded market risk, identified with an 'emr' suffix. KEY RATING DRIVERS  PREFERRED  SENIOR DEBT The one-notch upgrade reflects the  preferred  liabilities' lower vulnerability to default compared with vanilla senior debt. This reflects our understanding that the affected instruments contain features that allow them to rank senior to vanilla senior unsecured debt in resolution and in insolvency. In addition, in Fitch's opinion the issuing banks have sufficient outstanding qualifying junior and non-preferred senior debt that could be used to recapitalise them, restore viability and prevent default on preferred senior liabilities upon resolution. Our assessment of the amount needed to recapitalise the banks is based on the assumptions that the authorities will trigger a bail-in once the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio has depleted to 6%-7% and the banks will need to meet total pillar 1 and 2 requirements plus combined buffers after being recapitalised. The identification of preferred senior securities relies on the guidance for interpreting the classification of liabilities under the revised insolvency law in Germany, provided by the relevant authorities, the German banking supervisors, Deutsche Bundesbank and BaFin, and the acting resolution authority, the Federal Agency for Financial Market Stabilisation (FMSA) on 5 August 2016, further amended on 7 November 2016. The authorities have clarified products that are deemed complex or a potential source of contagion during resolution proceedings (notably those whose principal or interest payment depends on an event that is uncertain at the time of the issuance) rank senior to other senior unsecured debt. Examples of instruments that would be treated as preferred to other senior debt in resolution and in insolvency include, among others, bonds with embedded derivatives, index-linked bonds, obligations settled in a different currency, floating-rate notes that include interest rate floors, ceilings, or interest rate spreads, and floating-rate notes referencing non-conventional interest rate benchmarks. RATING SENSITIVITIES  PREFERRED  SENIOR DEBT Both banks'  preferred  senior debt ratings are primarily sensitive to (1) changes in the respective banks' IDRs, (2) our assessment of the volume of subordinated and non-preferred senior debt buffers relative to the recapitalisation amount likely to be needed to restore viability and prevent default on preferred obligations, (3) subsequent changes to the resolution regime or Fitch's expectation of how resolution would be implemented in practice, (4) subsequent changes to the resolution regime altering the hierarchy of the various instruments, and (5) reinterpretation by the resolution authorities of the preferential treatment of individual notes triggering a subsequent reclassification of the notes as non-preferred. The required amount of subordinated and senior vanilla debt buffers is sensitive to increases in the banks' capital requirements, in particular of the individual pillar 2 regulatory requirements, as we assume that these determine the level to which the banks would have to be recapitalised upon resolution. Furthermore, the ratings are sensitive to Fitch's assumptions regarding the individual points of non-viability at which the regulator is likely to require a recapitalisation by way of bail-in of junior and standard senior instruments. The guidance provided by the relevant authorities is not an integral part of the resolution legislation. Nevertheless, we expect that the resolution authorities would follow the guidance. Diverging evidence could lead to a re-assessment of the ratings of these securities. We expect the European Commission's (EC) proposal to amend Directive 2014/59/EU by introducing a new class of non-preferred senior debt, if and when implemented in German law, to leave the subordination of outstanding non-preferred senior debt intact. However, the EC's proposal could trigger a downgrade of the securities upgraded today if its transposition into German law reduces the buffer of junior and non-preferred senior debt or modifies the ranking of senior instruments.

Admiral has agreed to contact affected customers who renewed their policies after April 1 and who may have received inaccurate information, the FCA said.  If affected customers choose to go to another insurer, they will be able to cancel without penalty and will have their premium refunded,  the watchdog said.

The buying lifted futures for delivery in September to a premium of 6 yuan ($0.88) per tonne over October, in a structure known as a backwardation, when prompt prices are higher than those for later months, that reflects tightening supplies. At the start of the month, the spread had been in a 4-yuan contango. The new curve suggests a brighter outlook for prices of the fuel most used to generate power in China even as Beijing has tried to boost supplies to avoid another crunch in supply that triggered a historic rally in prices last year. Data earlier this week showed miners in May produced coal at their fastest pace in years ahead of peak summer demand.  Price rally has been mainly driven by higher demand,  said Wang Fei, coal analyst at Huaan Futures.  We are seeing utilities buying more coal from major ports and falling stocks at ports.  The most-active domestic thermal coal prices have risen 39 percent this year, reaching a record high on Friday of 580.8 yuan ($85.29) per tonne. Open interest also hit a record on Tuesday, reflecting bullish sentiment. Prompt coal prices for cargoes from Australia's Newcastle export terminal, Asia's benchmark, have shot up 18 percent since mid-May to $84 per tonne. Temperatures in northern China have been higher than usual since May, raising residential air conditioning use and spurring coal-fired power demand while hydropower generation in the south, the nation's second-largest power supply, has fallen due to low reservoir levels. Total daily consumption from six of the largest coal power plants rose to 622,400 tonnes per day by June 16, up from 592,000 tonnes a month ago, according to China Sublime Information Group. A coal futures trader in Beijing said he had expected hydropower to help replace coal over the summer once the rainy season in the south replenished reservoir levels.  But in recent weeks, we look at extremely low reservoir levels and think hydro output for summer won't be good and enough to replace coal power,  he said. Total inventory at utilities dropped 560,000 tonnes in June to 13.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 19 days of use, according to China Sublime. While that is considered a healthy inventory, falling supplies at ports suggests power companies have continued to boost buying to replenish stockpiles. Inventories at major coal port Qinghuadao fell to 5.33 million tonnes from 5.8 million tonnes at the beginning at June, the port's data showed.

The regional currencies were weakening against the dollar after the nudge in U.S. interest rates. I think that is one of the leading indicators on why Asian equities trimmed their gains from morning's trade,  said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Manila-based Asiasec Equities Inc.     Sentiment was also affected by Wall Street, with a recent slump in technology stocks worsening further on Thursday, dragging on major U.S. indexes.     Philippine shares posted their lowest close in over two weeks, pulled down by index heavyweights SM Investment Corp  and Aboitiz Equity Ventures.     The index recorded its biggest weekly percentage drop since March 10.     Early in the day, the Philippine central bank revised its current account balance forecast for this year, predicting a deficit for the first time since 2002, on expectations of surging imports. Data showing April remittances dropped 5.9 percent from a year ago had also dented sentiment.          Indonesia extended its declines to end 0.9 percent lower, with Elang Mahkota Teknologi Tbk Pt plunging 16.4 percent.      Earlier in the session, Malaysia hit a two-year high, adding 0.1 percent for the week in its fourth straight weekly gain.     Singapore ended the day marginally lower, dragged down by industrials and consumer discretionary stocks. The index posted its biggest weekly fall since May 19.     Singapore's exports shrank for a second straight month in May, with non-oil domestic exports (NODX) from the city-state dropping 1.2 percent.     Thailand was the biggest gainer in the region, despite the central bank saying its foreign exchange reserves fell to $184.1 billion in the week ended June 9, down from $185.0 billion a week ago.

The world's largest automaker's core division is being restructured with thousands of job cuts and retrenchments in parts and vehicle development as it struggles to fund a post-dieselgate shift to electric cars and new technologies. More than 10 new models launched this year including the top-of-the-line Arteon fastback and a redesigned Polo subcompact, one of VW's all-time bestsellers, would stoke demand and underpin the turnaround, VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess told Reuters on Friday.  We are making good progress,  Diess said during an event to present the next-generation Polo.  2018 will be a strong year for VW,  he said, adding a new product always helped margins. VW brand's operating margin jumped to 4.6 percent in the first quarter from 0.3 percent a year earlier, still lagging French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA) but nearing its long-term 2025 target of 6 percent. Diess said VW had a goal for 2017 to maintain the brand's first-quarter performance when operating profit surged to 869 million euros from 73 million a year ago.  The most important thing is the product offensive in coming months,  Diess said. Herbert Diess, chairman of the board of Volkswagen, speaks during the World premiere of Volkswagen's new Polo in Berlin, Germany June 16, 2017.Stefanie LoosWolfsburg-based VW is counting on the larger, technology-packed Polo model to revive its sluggish sales in the core European market where the brand's deliveries slid 0.2 percent in the January-to-May period to 726,000 cars. The new Polo, priced from 12,975 euros ($14,500) and due to hit showrooms in October, will be the main volume product VW launches this year, preceding the all-new T-Roc, a Golf-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) which is due out later in 2017. Slideshow (15 Images)A spokesman declined to specify the new Polo's on-road nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and whether they met EU targets, saying VW at this point only had emissions estimates for the model which cannot be disclosed. The advent of the new Polo will intensify the struggle for dominance in Europe's crowded subcompact segment where the VW model is going up against a redesigned Ford (F.N) Fiesta and an upgraded Renault (RENA.PA) Clio, all vying for the top spot. Research firm IHS Markit expects the VW model to win easily. European deliveries of the Polo may jump a quarter to 368,158 cars by 2025 from 293,700 this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain to 328,846 models for the Fiesta and a 32 percent plunge to 185,525 cars for the Clio, according to IHS. Registrations of the Peugeot (PEUP.PA) 208 model may surge a fifth to 277,067 cars, IHS said.

This follows a change enacted in laws last month that gives the Reserve Bank of India greater power to address the $150 billion stressed loan problem plaguing growth in Asia's third-largest economy. This week, the RBI said it had identified 12 of the country's biggest loan defaulters. Jaypee Infratech, Electrosteel Steels, unlisted Bhushan Power & Steel, textiles maker Alok Industries , ABG Shipyard and Jyoti Structures are also among the firms that will be taken to insolvency courts by the RBI, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the list was not public. The RBI has yet to officially name any of the 12 companies, which account for about 2 trillion rupees ($31 billion) of India's non-performing loans, or roughly 25 percent of all the country's bad loans. CNBC TV18, which reported the 12 names earlier on Friday, also said Lanco Infratech, Amtek Auto and Era Infra Engineering were on the list. Reuters could not immediately verify these three names. According to the television station, RBI has asked banks to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against six of the firms within 15 days and to file petitions for the others within 30 days. The RBI had no official comment. A spokesman for Essar Steel declined to comment, while a spokesman for Electrosteel said they had heard from their main lender that creditors wanted to initiate resolution of the unpaid loans through the National Company Law Tribunal. The NCLT has been appointed as the nodal court for insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings in India. A bankruptcy filing would result in recovering some funds owed through a debt restructuring, or ultimately through liquidation of the company. Such action means banks would no longer leave bad debt on their books and it could force them to put more money aside to cover losses - at a time when funds are already short as banks seek to comply with international capital standards. The filings could have far reaching implications, as India's new insolvency code sets out a tight deadline for restructuring resolutions to be struck, failing which the defaulters would be moved into forced liquidation, potentially leading to further value erosion and jeopardizing tens of thousands of jobs at the heavy industry companies on the list. Indian banks typically lend larger sums in groups. Lead banks plan to call meetings of the groups over the next two weeks to decide the next course of action, one source said.

The prime minister's younger brother and sister, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, said on Wednesday they had lost confidence in Lee Hsien Loong and feared that the state's organs would be used against them. Lee Hsien Yang said he and his wife, the lawyer Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and threatened. A timeline issued by the prime minister's lawyers and published on Facebook late on Thursday shows that the three children of Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled the country for three decades, have been battling over the will for several years.The biggest issue has been over the future of the house that their father lived in for most of his life. Before Lee died in March 2015, he made it public that he wanted the home near the bustling Orchard Road shopping district to be demolished rather than turned into some kind of museum. But Lee Hsien Loong said in the six-page timeline that the fifth and sixth versions of the will had removed a clause about the demolition, and it was only reinserted in the final will, the seventh version. He questioned whether Lee Kuan Yew knew the clause was re-inserted, saying there was no evidence that he did. Related CoverageFeud within Singapore's first family leads to outpouring of concern on social mediaPossible Conflict of Interest  The prime minister questioned the role his brother's wife, Lee Suet Fern, may have played in his father's last will. He said that she  was involved in the preparation and/or signing of the Last Will  and that given her husband was a beneficiary this appeared to be a conflict of interest. He also said that there had been another major change between the sixth and the last will. In the sixth will, Lee Kuan Yew had given his daughter Lee Wei Ling a greater share of the estate than his two sons.  However, in the last will they all got equal shares, and after that was drawn up the prime minister said in the timeline that Lee Wei Ling told the prime minister's wife Ho Ching in an email that she didn't trust Lee Suet Fern because of her great influence on her husband, Lee Hsien Yang. Late on Thursday, Lee Wei Ling indicated in a Facebook posting that she still supported Lee Hsien Yang and his wife Lee Suet Fern.  Hsien Loong and (his wife) Ho Ching are being mischievious and dishonest to selectively use quotes from me out of context to suggest that Hsien Yang and his wife were trying to cheat me in our father’s final will,  Lee Wei Ling wrote.  There was no duplicity by Hsien Yang and his wife, Suet Fern.  Lee Hsien Yang responded on social media, saying his brother's allegations are false.  Hsien Loong raised no legal challenge to Lee Kuan Yew's will in the many months after it was read. Probate was granted in Oct 2015, so the will is full, final, and legally binding,  Lee Hsien Yang posted on his Facebook.  Hsien Loong should not use a committee of his subordinates to allege what he did not dare to allege in court,  he said, asking how Lee Kuan Yew would not have known about any changes when he initialed right beneath the demolition clause. The prime minister said he didn't challenge the will in court because he wanted to avoid a public fight.

Bombshell accusations through press releases and Facebook postings are unusual in Singapore, a country that usually keeps such matters behind closed doors and media freedom within carefully controlled boundaries. And as this comes from within the family of modern Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who was prime minister for three decades, it has gained plenty of attention. The first salvo came from the prime minister's younger brother and sister, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, who said on Wednesday they had lost confidence in Lee Hsien Loong and feared that the state's organs would be used against them. Lee Hsien Yang said he and his wife, lawyer Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and threatened. The prime minister denied the allegations, and said he was very disappointed that they have chosen to publicize private family matters. Then late on Thursday, he hit back,  saying there are  deeply troubling circumstances  over how Lee Kuan Yew's will was drawn up and asking what role Lee Suet Fern, had played. There has been plenty of additional back and forth, accusation and denial over the past couple of days. Many on social media website Facebook flooded it with requests for the family to settle the matter out of the public eye.   It's a personal family matter which should have been settled privately. Not good for Singapore's reputation to air these personal family affairs publicly,  Facebook user Selene Zhuo commented on one post from the prime minister. Another Facebook user Douglas Ho said,  The repercussions are very detrimental to Singapore. This is far beyond a family squabble.  Critics Emboldened A few used it as an opportunity to criticize the way the government has run Singapore for many years.  The siblings, in openly attacking their brother, claim to be protecting their father's legacy against Lee Hsien Loong’s authoritarian ways, with apparently zero awareness that the system they now fear actually is their father's legacy,  journalist and activist Kirsten Han posted on Facebook. Supporters of the prime minister asked him to take care of his health and expressed their faith in him. Lee, 65, had a health scare, stumbling at a podium during a speech last August, though doctors subsequently said there were no serious concerns.  Pls do not let this affect your health, PM Lee.It's a trivial family matter which happens to lots of families. You are still our caring & loving PM,  said Vanessa YC on Facebook. Some, though, were less understanding.   When ur siblings cannot trust you, how can we?  asked Facebook user SV Khanthan. Analysts said it was too early to gauge the dispute's impact on the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). The next general election does not have to be held before April 2021.  Thus far, the matter is confined to PM Lee and, to a much smaller extent, the government. The party is not yet on the radar screen,  said Eugene Tan, associate professor of law at the Singapore Management University. The heart of the dispute is about whether to demolish the  house that Lee Kuan Yew lived in for most of his life at 38 Oxley Road, near the Orchard Road shopping district, capturing the attention of property-obsessed Singaporeans. Lee died in 2015.  Do I care if 38 Oxley Road is demolished? No, because it doesn't affect the citizens,  Facebook user Ethan Lee Yong Sheng posted.  Do I care if Sungei Market was forced to cease operations? Yes, because a lot of elderly rely on that as their only source of income,  the poster added, referring to a flea market that is due to shut next month to make way for future residential development.

In 2015, a Greek prosecutor charged three officials at the country's privatisation agency with embezzlement for withholding interest payments and breach of duty in relation to a sale and lease-back deal of 28 state-owned buildings. The case is still pending.  If there's not a definitive solution for the situation of these three experts, the Eurogroup will block the payment,  de Guindos said in Luxemburg. Greece would do  whatever necessary  to immediately settle the legal case, a Greek government official said. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he was confident the problem would be resolved and that he would continue to discuss the issue with Spain during his visit to Madrid next week.  The problem has to be solved. We should not over dramatise it. The disbursement will happen and at the same time will find a solution to this problem,  Moscovici said on his arrival at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxemburg on Friday. On Thursday, euro zone governments threw Greece the latest financial lifeline and sketched new details on possible debt relief, allowing Athens to avoid defaulting on bailout repayments next month. Italy's Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said the disbursement of the 8.5-billion-euro loan would continue as the progress on the officials' case was assessed and that he was optimistic of a quick solution.

His brother Omar broke down in tears as he told how Mohammed got trapped in the burning block as they both tried to flee their 14th floor home. Omar, who initially thought his brother had escaped, spoke to Mohammed by phone from outside the block as he watched it engulfed in flames and thick black smoke.  He said: 'Why (have) you left me...?' He said:  I'm dying. I cannot breathe,  Omar told the BBC.  We came from Syria to be safe here, and now we're dying.  Scores of people are feared dead after the massive blaze tore through Grenfell Tower in West London just after midnight on Wednesday. Mohammed, reported to be 23, came to Britain in 2014 and was studying engineering in London.    The Syria Solidarity Campaign said Mohammed had tried to call his family in Syria during the fire but could not get connected. He had not seen his family for four years.   When the fire reached his flat ... Mohammed bid his friend and brothers goodbye, saying that the fire had reached him. He asked them to pass on the message to his family in Syria,  the charity said in a statement.  Mohammed undertook a dangerous journey to flee war and death in Syria, only to meet it here in the UK, in his own home.   Where Are You?  The charity said Mohammed had dreamed that he would one day be able to go back and help rebuild Syria. It called for a  thorough investigation  into building regulations, adding:  Mohammed came to this country for safety and the UK failed to protect him.       Up to 600 people lived in the social housing block in more than 120 apartments.  The official death toll stood at 17 on Friday but is expected to soar. Firefighters say they do not expect to find more survivors. Omar sobbed as he told how firefighters led trapped residents to safety through dense smoke as the fire raged around them.  They came in the last minute when the fire was in the next room. They said: 'Come, come.' They were pushing us,  he told the BBC.   I couldn't see anything. They opened the door, the smoke come inside, I (saw) the fire around me.   I thought they were pushing all of us. I (couldn't) even see anything, even my fingers, nothing.   When he got outside Omar phoned his brother, still unaware he had not made it out.   I said: 'Where are you?'. He said: 'I'm in the flat.'. He said: 'No one brought me outside'.    I saw the fire in the flat from outside. I was watching the flat - it was burning - and my brother was inside.  The BBC reported that the family are trying to get UK visas for their parents so they can come from Damascus to see Mohammed's body.

Africa's biggest economy has at least six exchange rates which include one for Muslim pilgrims going to Saudi Arabia, a retail rate set by licensed exchange bureaus, and a rate for foreign travel and school fees, in addition to the official and black market rates. Nigeria is battling a currency crisis brought on by low oil prices which tipped its economy into recession and created chronic dollar shortages. It wants to attract foreign investors and strengthen its currency to ward off inflation. The central bank has been intervening on the official market in the last few weeks to try to narrow the spread between rates on the official market and black market - where the local currency trades around 30 percent weaker. It has sold about $5 billion since February. The bank opened a currency window in April for investors to trade the naira at rates set freely between buyers and sellers, hoping to increase the amount of dollars available in Nigeria.  The gradual convergence of the exchange rate on both black market and investor forex window is an opportunity for the central bank to unify rate in all segments of the forex market,  Aminu Gwadabe, president of the country's Association of Bureaux De Change Operators told Reuters late on Thursday. Gwadabe said a move to eliminate multiple rates would restore investors' confidence in the economy and boost offshore dollar inflows, further strengthening the naira. Central bank spokesman Isaac Okorafor said the regulator would sustain its current efforts to improve dollar liquidity in the market until it was able to achieve currency rate convergence. The naira was quoted at 365 to the dollar on the black market on Friday, while the local currency was quoted at 372.70 per dollar at the investor window. The local bourse rose to a two-year high on Wednesday as investors snapped up Nigerian stocks after MSCI increased the country's weighting in its frontier market index. Nigeria's forex reserves grew to around $30.22 billion by June, from $26.44 billion a year ago, as oil production and oil price stabilise in the wake of OPEC and non-OPEC oil output cut deal, analysts have said.

The UK prime minister is in talks to form a government with Northern Ireland’s main pro-British political party. Brexit was always likely to put immense pressure on Northern Ireland, and a pact between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party could make things even more tense. Why is Northern Ireland so important? Talks on Britain’s exit from the European Union are due to begin next week. All sides have agreed that Northern Ireland is one of the red-line issues that must be addressed before the substance of Brexit can be discussed – along with the size of the so-called Brexit bill, the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa. Northern Ireland is no simple matter, though. It has the UK’s only land border with another EU member state, the Republic of Ireland, so the impact of any post-Brexit restriction in trade or movement of people will be significant. Residents on both sides of the Irish-UK border remember decades of violence between pro-UK unionists and Irish republicans that came to an end with the Good Friday agreement of 1998. The physical divide between the north and the south of Ireland is largely invisible today, yet it remains the most politically sensitive border in Europe. The main objective is thus to avoid a “hard” Irish divide at all costs. What happens when the region leaves the EU? Northern Ireland faces big Brexit risks. Take funding from Brussels. For every 10 pounds earned by Northern Ireland’s farmers, the Common Agricultural Policy accounts for 8.70 pounds. The EU has financially underwritten the north’s peace process for decades. Northern Ireland sends a fifth of all its exports south of the border to the Republic of Ireland, so tariffs and the introduction of new red tape would hurt. All-island supply chains and production processes are enmeshed. And curbs on free movement of people would add disruption for the 30,000 people that cross the border daily for work. How might the DUP play its hand? The Democratic Unionist Party is in favour of Brexit and union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, but it doesn’t want a hard border. Now it has leverage over a Conservative party that has at times treated it cavalierly. In addition to maintaining the roughly 9 billion pound annual fiscal transfer from Westminster that props up the region’s sickly economy, the DUP is likely to ask for additional monies for infrastructure and health spending, devolved powers to lower Northern Ireland's corporate tax rate, and a generous package for farmers. That is the easy part. While the DUP wants the post-Brexit border to remain as open as possible, its priority is to veto any assignation of special status to Northern Ireland in the Brexit negotiations. Meanwhile, the DUP’s nationalist opposite, Sinn Fein, is using Brexit as a way of pushing for a united Ireland. What’s so bad about special treatment? Were Northern Ireland to be subject to different rules from Britain, the DUP thinking goes, it would undermine the idea of United Kingdom unity. That takes one potential remedy for Northern Ireland’s Brexit problems squarely off the table: membership of the European Economic Area. Being part of that grouping, which includes non-EU members like Iceland and Liechtenstein, might allow trade and people to flow freely between the north and south. Still, without access to the EU customs union or structural funds, it is no perfect solution. Another good option for Northern Ireland would be for the UK to remain in the customs union and there has been speculation that the DUP could press May for a softer Brexit. A more cynical view is that the unionists could live with a hard border provided they get what they want in other areas. The trouble is, currently Brexit negotiations can’t begin in earnest until progress is made on Northern Ireland. And any progress that requires clarification of Britain’s relationship with Europe is therefore, by definition, impossible. Can this have a happy ending? May faces at least four competing interests in trying to cobble together a solution for Northern Ireland: Europe, the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland’s unionists and nationalists. The region’s nationalist and unionist communities have diametrically opposed views on Brexit. Bringing the DUP into the heart of 10 Downing Street has already aggravated nationalist parties. But it’s not a given that Ireland and its European partners will agree either. However, it can only be a good thing for the Northern Ireland question to finally be getting airtime in London's corridors of power. Clear-eyed reflection on the practical implications of a hard Brexit is now that bit more difficult to avoid. And the folly of May’s desire for both a hard Brexit and open border won’t stand up to close scrutiny. There are no easy solutions for Northern Ireland. At worst, that might leave Brexit talks in a quagmire. Still, forcing some serious debate about the challenges ahead may turn out to be the best outcome of the whole complex affair.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Bombshell accusations through press releases and Facebook postings are unusual in Singapore, a country that usually keeps such matters behind closed doors and media freedom within carefully controlled boundaries. And as this comes from within the family of modern Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who was prime minister for three decades, it has gained plenty of attention. The first salvo came from the prime minister's younger brother and sister, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, who said on Wednesday they had lost confidence in Lee Hsien Loong and feared that the state's organs would be used against them. Lee Hsien Yang said he and his wife, lawyer Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and threatened. The prime minister denied the allegations, and said he was very disappointed that they have chosen to publicise private family matters. Then late on Thursday, he hit back, saying there are  deeply troubling circumstances  over how Lee Kuan Yew's will was drawn up and asking what role Lee Suet Fern, had played. There has been plenty of additional back and forth, accusation and denial over the past couple of days. Many on social media website Facebook flooded it with requests for the family to settle the matter out of the public eye.  It's a personal family matter which should have been settled privately. Not good for Singapore's reputation to air these personal family affairs publicly,  Facebook user Selene Zhuo commented on one post from the prime minister. Another Facebook user Douglas Ho said,  The repercussions are very detrimental to Singapore. This is far beyond a family squabble.  Critics Emboldened A few used it as an opportunity to criticize the way the government has run Singapore for many years.  The siblings, in openly attacking their brother, claim to be protecting their father's legacy against Lee Hsien Loong’s authoritarian ways, with apparently zero awareness that the system they now fear actually is their father's legacy,  journalist and activist Kirsten Han posted on Facebook. Supporters of the prime minister asked him to take care of his health and expressed their faith in him. Lee, 65, had a health scare, stumbling at a podium during a speech last August, though doctors subsequently said there were no serious concerns.  Pls do not let this affect your health, PM Lee. It's a trivial family matter which happens to lots of families. You are still our caring & loving PM,  said Vanessa YC on Facebook. Some, though, were less understanding.  When ur siblings cannot trust you, how can we?  asked Facebook user SV Khanthan. Analysts said it was too early to gauge the dispute's impact on the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). The next general election does not have to be held before April 2021.  Thus far, the matter is confined to PM Lee and, to a much smaller extent, the government. The party is not yet on the radar screen,  said Eugene Tan, associate professor of law at the Singapore Management University. The heart of the dispute is about whether to demolish the house that Lee Kuan Yew lived in for most of his life at 38 Oxley Road, near the Orchard Road shopping district, capturing the attention of property-obsessed Singaporeans. Lee died in 2015.  Do I care if 38 Oxley Road is demolished? No, because it doesn't affect the citizens,  Facebook user Ethan Lee Yong Sheng posted.  Do I care if Sungei Market was forced to cease operations? Yes, because a lot of elderly rely on that as their only source of income,  the poster added, referring to a flea market that is due to shut next month to make way for future residential development.

Speaking at an event, James Proudman, the central bank's executive director for supervision of deposit takers, reiterated that there was no room for manoeuvre on the January 2019 deadline for banks to separate the businesses. Ring-fencing deposit-taking operations from riskier, investment banking was a central reform following the financial crisis which forced taxpayers to bail out several lenders. Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union and the upheaval it could mean for the banking sector had, however, raised hopes ring-fencing would be pushed back.  The Bank of England will require full and prompt implementation of the ring-fencing legislation and requirements by 2019,  Proudman said.  As with any big infrastructure project, there is some potential for disruption to everyday activities as new group structures are moved into place and new ways of operating are brought online,  he said. The aim of the reform is to ensure that day-to-day banking will be insulated with enough capital to continue unaffected if problems emerge in investment banking. It will be a major change to the structure of British banking, with 75 percent of customer deposits being affected by the reorganisations within lenders. Banks estimate almost a million people and businesses will see changes to their bank account details as they are placed on the right side of the fence.  To minimise the disruption these changes could cause to customers, banks will ensure that any outgoing payments, for example standing orders and direct debits, are made as normal,  the BoE said. Banks and payment schemes will also redirect any incoming payments to the new accounts. Some banks will need to move the assets and liabilities of significant numbers of customers from one legal entity to another to comply with the legislation. A judge will consider the impact of this on customers and others. HSBC has already set up a separate high street lender, HSBC UK, which is due to open its new head office in January.  While the timelines vary, all banks plan to meet this tight deadline, with the bulk of restructuring activities planned from now to mid-2018,  Proudman said.

Again. Euro zone governments threw indebted Greece another credit lifeline worth 8.5 billion euros (7.44 billion pounds) on Thursday, offered further clarity on a roadmap to possible debt relief and the International Monetary Fund said it might join a bailout programme after sitting on the fence for two years.  What's the big deal? Is it going to change the real problem of more than a million unemployed Greeks?  said Maria Papadia, 42, jobless for four years.  Do they understand the pain when you can't find a decent job for so long and your measly unemployment benefit runs out after 12 months?  Greece's unemployment rate -- pumped up by years of austerity demanded by the lenders -- is still running above 23 percent, with youth unemployment around 45 percent. Taking a drubbing in opinion polls, leftist Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said the deal was a  decisive step  towards the country emerging from the debilitating crisis which has pushed more of a third of the population into poverty, and  turned thousands of Greeks into economic migrants.  His finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, declared:  There is now light at the end of the tunnel.   A pro-government newspaper, Avgi, called it  The beginning of the end to the Greek drama,  saying that the euro zone's s decision forms a strong basis for Greece to leave its bailouts behind from August next year. Greece has had their bailouts since 2010 and came close in 2015 to crashing out of the euro zone. No Debt Relief Centre-right Eleftheros Typos daily was less upbeat, saying the closure of the country's bailout review, which led to pension cuts and higher taxes, did not bring any substantive benefit other than the disbursement of the next loan tranche.  Debt relief is put off for the summer of 2018 while the country's inclusion in the ECB's quantitative easing programme was not secured,  it said, referring to the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme, The mood on the streets of Athens on Friday was also more subdued.  I think the climate could change, not immediately though,  said Dimitris Kokkotos, 57. In a nation battered by unemployment where elderly pensioners are called to support their jobless offspring, discussion on whether, or when the country might be given relief to taper a mountain of debt reaching 180 percent of output was of secondary importance. And the anger remains over what is widely seen as too stringent demands by lenders that have driven the country into poverty.   I'm fed up of being fooled. Its nerve wracking,  said Mary Koutra, 59.  Lenders have put us in a snake pit ... they just want slaves, not individuals displaying initiative, or dignity.

The Singapore-listed company, battered by concerns over its financial strength in recent weeks, has been in negotiations with banks over a $2-billion credit facility, secured on its inventories and working capital. The facility is due to be rolled over by the end of next week. The expiry of the credit line has been extended until October. In exchange, creditors have asked Noble to find a strategic investor, the person said, declining to be named because the information is not public yet. Noble declined to comment. Noble shares closed up 8.3 percent on Friday at S$0.325, helped by hopes it would secure the much-needed extension. The value of its shares has been almost wiped out, collapsing from a 2011 peak after the company was faced with accusations of murky accounting and hit with the impact of a broad commodity downturn. The firm's market capitalization has slumped from a peak of more than S$10 billion to just S$430 million. Noble Group's probability of default, implied by its 5-year credit default swap (CDS), has been hovering at around 93 percent since mid-May. The CDS curve is severely inverted, implying a very high chance of the company defaulting on its debt.

After finishing last season with the worst record in the majors, Minnesota has spent more than half of the 2017 campaign atop the Central, which sent Kansas City to the World Series in 2014 and 2015 and Cleveland last year. The Twins have owned at least a share of the division lead since May 11 and enter this series with a two-game edge on the Indians after winning Thursday to split a four-game set versus Seattle to wrap up a 14-game run against west coast teams. The Indians outscored Minnesota 20-7 en route to a three-game sweep at Target Field in mid-April, but the Twins took two of three when the teams last met at Progressive Field from May 12-14.

The 30-year-old Venezuelan has surrendered only one of his eight homers this season on the road and is yielding only a .195 batting average to right-handed hitters. Joe Mauer is 11-for-22 and Miguel Sano is 4-for-10 against Carrasco, who is 2-6 with a 4.74 ERA in 14 games (11 starts) versus the Twins. Turley made his big-league debut against San Francisco on Sunday after toiling for nearly 10 years in the minors, settling for a no-decision after giving up four runs and eight hits in four frames. The former 50th-round draft pick of the New York Yankees earned his long-awaited promotion after posting a 2.05 ERA and fanning 84 over 52 2/3 innings at two minor-league stops this season.

The Braves return home to open a 10-game homestand after winning two of three at National League East-leader Washington, improving to 14-15 since losing first baseman Freddie Freeman to a fractured wrist. Atlanta hopes left fielder Matt Kemp, who entered Thursday fifth in the NL in batting average (.327), will be available Friday after he left Wednesday’s game with left hamstring tightness. The Braves have won three of the first five matchups against the Marlins this season and are 14-9 versus Miami since the start of 2016.

It occurred in his last start Saturday at Pittsburgh when the 28-year-old gave up four runs on nine hits in four innings of a no-decision. Straily earned his first victory for Miami against the Braves on April 11, surrendering two earned runs in five innings with two walks and five strikeouts to improve to 1-1 in two career starts against Atlanta. Newcomb impressed in his major-league debut Saturday against the New York Mets, surrendering just an unearned run on four hits over 6 1/3 innings with two walks (one intentional) and seven strikeouts. The 24-year-old struggled at times in the minor leagues with control, but fired 70 of his 96 pitches for strikes in his debut to earn another turn in the rotation. Newcomb was promoted to replace Bartolo Colon, who is on the disabled list with a strained oblique. Walk-Offs 1. Atlanta CF Ender Inciarte and 2B Brandon Phillips combined for seven hits and five RBIs in Wednesday’s 13-2 victory, and both are batting above .300 (Phillips at .306; Inciarte at .304). 2.

The 25-year-old Dominican has fanned 37 batters over his last four starts, but has only a 2-2 mark to show for it. A lack of run support has been an issue for Martinez, who has seen St. Louis score just 25 runs in his first 12 starts before Saturday's uprising. While Martinez was dominant in his last outing, Gausman wasn't as fortunate as the 26-year-old yielded seven runs on eight hits in 3 1/3 innings of Sunday's 14-3 shellacking by the New York Yankees. Gausman also struggled to find the plate, allowing six walks versus the Yankees and has issued 12 free passes in his last three trips to the mound.

Chicago scored 27 runs in its four-game set against Baltimore, with designated hitter Matt Davidson leading the way by homering in each game to boost his season total to 14. White Sox right fielder Avisail Garcia was ejected from Thursday's 5-2 victory, but not before he ran his hitting streak to eight games with a pair of singles.

Arizona answered a three-game skid by erupting for 59 runs in its next seven contests before completing a two-game interleague sweep of Detroit with a 2-1 victory on Wednesday. Paul Goldschmidt has been integral in the power surge by going 17-for-40 with three homers, 14 RBIs and 12 runs scored this month and aims to build off last season's feast of Philadelphia in which he went 6-for-14 with two homers in the Diamondbacks' four-game sweep at Citizens Bank Park on June 17-19, 2016.

Apple <AAPL.O., Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, the five largest U.S. technology stocks, have seen their combined market capitalization fall by about $120 billion since last Thursday. By Thursday the S&P; 500 technology index had seen its largest five-day drop in a year. The slide was again led by sector heavyweights Apple and Alphabet, as investors moved away from what had been the year's best-performing sector and rotated portfolios into stocks that pay higher dividends amid some signs that U.S. economic weakness. “I think it’s a perfectly normal backing off. Tech has done really well. All of sudden everyone wakes up and says, ‘Holy cow, maybe we’re getting ahead of ourselves,’ and backs off a little bit,  said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. Among technology stocks hit, shares of Google's parent Alphabet fell 0.8 percent Thursday after broker Canaccord Genuity downgraded its rating of the stock to  hold  from  buy.  The broker downgrade triggered a broader technology sector selloff according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Apple shares slid 0.6 percent on Thursday, extending their five-day decline to 6.9 percent. Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote that Apple is near the peak valuation levels in its iPhone 6 cycle which  could mean a bumpy ride lower  if the prospects for sales of its next phone disappoint. Shares of social media company Snap Inc closed at their initial public offering price of $17 for the first time. Some investors were selling technology shares to rotate into other sectors, such as beaten-down energy stocks, said Russ Koesterich, co-portfolio manager of BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund. “It’s more the winners into the losers, rather than a broader move towards safety,” he said. The recent decline notwithstanding, the technology sector remains the best performing so far this year, up 17.4 percent versus the overall S&P; 500 index gain of 8.6 percent. Rotation to Value Amid Weak u.s. Economic Data Companies including Apple and Google parent Alphabet have seen their stock prices soar in 2017, and their heavy weightings in benchmark stock indexes prompted concerns that overall market gains are too concentrated in a handful of large technology firms.  We had sensed over the last 4-5 weeks that clients were becoming uncomfortable with the clustering of returns to the S&P; 500 , said Julian Emanuel, executive director of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at UBS Securities.  It felt to us that you had the elixir for a correction in the (technology) sector.  Concern over the earlier gains in technology stocks this year has been compounded by some recent weak U.S. economic data. Last month, the U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs, well below the expected gain of 185,000. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.3 percent in May, marking the largest one-month decline since January of last year. Also, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month, the second drop in inflation in three months. In the 12 months through May, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since last November. U.S. Treasury yields tumbled to their lowest since early November on Wednesday on the weak data.  Tech is one of the losing sectors when the interest rate trade is dominating because rates are falling,  said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Investments, an affiliate of Nuveen, because investors need to look for higher yield in dividend paying stocks. Resilience in S&P; 500 Benchmark Despite the 3.7 percent drop for technology stocks over the past five sessions, the S&P; 500 index has barely budged, slipping just 0.05 percent over the same period. The resilience in the S&P; 500 benchmark has resulted from investors rotating their portfolios into other sectors such as financials and the more defensive sectors like real estate .  It definitely feels like a rotation that's gone on for a few days with tech being weakened,  said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.  What's done well in the last few days is the more bond-like plays.

The company plays an important role in Canada's mortgage market, lending to borrowers who cannot get loans from the country's biggest banks, such as self-employed workers and new immigrants. Canada's biggest non-bank lender must still overcome hurdles, though, including finding a permanent chief executive, rebuilding relationships with brokers, and winning back the support of depositors and borrowers. On Wednesday the company reached a C$30.5 million ($22.3 million) settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), settled a class action lawsuit, and accepted responsibility for misleading investors about problems with its mortgage underwriting procedures. The settlement is expected to help secure long-term financing at sustainable interest rates, investors and analysts said, after Home Capital's board was bolstered by former Ontario Teachers Pension Plan head Claude Lamoureux and Alan Hibben, a former head of strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.  This is a signal that the new board has taken control,  said Hari Panday, chief executive of investment banking firm PanVest Capital Corp.  They've decided they want the focus to be running the business and not fighting the regulators. The OSC (probe) was a huge hangover.  Depositors have withdrawn 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Martin Reid. The company is still searching for Reid's successor as well as a permanent chief financial officer. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when the OSC, Canada's biggest securities regulator, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Maria-Gabriella Khoury, vice president of global financial institutions group at DBRS, said the company had taken  the first step to restore market confidence  with the OSC settlement and now needed to prioritize new funding. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Home Capital is in talks with a syndicate of banks, including some of Canada's biggest lenders, to secure a loan of about C$2 billion ($1.5 billion), expected to be on more favorable terms than an existing loan. The expensive bridge financing of C$2 billion provided by the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) came with an effective interest rate of 22.5 percent on the first C$1 billion drawn down, and affected the company's ability to originate new mortgages since it cannot afford to lend money at lower rates than its cost of borrowing.  Because of the high interest on that facility the company needs to secure something soon in order to a) still have a runway of liquidity and b) not have it eat away at its current revenue,  said Khoury. Home Capital had said it was continuing to originate mortgages but had tightened its lending criteria. Negotiating new financing would enable it to relax that criteria, offer more mortgages and generate more profit, analysts say. To meet its long-term funding needs, it must repair relationships with deposit brokers who have guided clients away from putting money in its Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), a key source of funding.  It will require meeting with brokers, launching a communication campaign and reaching out to people on both deposits and mortgages,  said Panday. Those relationships will be a key focus for new CEO and CFO, who analysts say should have established relationships with the banks and both deposits and mortgage brokers. David Cockfield, managing director at Northland Wealth Management,  said Home Capital had taken  a step in the right direction .  Settling with the OSC clears the horizon,  he said. Shares in Home Capital closed up 12.7 percent on Thursday having closed up 7.4 percent on Wednesday.

Baker June 15 (Reuters) - China-backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC disclosed on Monday it had refiled its proposed $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for the second time. This followed Canyon Bridge partner Ray Bingham's resignation from two corporate boards, Cypress Semiconductor Corp and Oracle Corp, over claims of potential conflict of interest. Here's a look at the latest twist and turns in Canyon Bridge's attempted acquisition of Lattice: - February 2016: Lattice approaches Cypress Semiconductor Corp to gauge its interest in making an acquisition offer. Cypress declined. - April 8, 2016: Financial advisers for China Reform Fund Management Co contact Lattice's advisers to express interest in discussing  a strategic transaction involving Lattice.  - May 5, 2016: Lattice CEO Darin Billerbeck and the company's financial adviser Morgan Stanley meet with Benjamin Chow, a representative of China Reform to discuss a potential deal. - August 2016: Ray Bingham meets Chow and discusses serving in an advisory role for a private equity fund. - August 2016: Lattice and China Reform discuss China Reform's most recent deal proposal. During those talks, Chow states that, after discussions with China Reform, he was considering leaving China Reform to form a new private equity fund, which one of China Reform’s affiliates, CVC, had agreed to invest in. This fund eventually became Canyon Bridge. - September 2016: Chow informs Bingham that Canyon Bridge had received an initial $1.5 billion funding commitment, and that it was in active negotiations with a potential target in the United States. - September 2016: Cypress turns down another opportunity to make an acquisition offer for Lattice. - October 2016: Cypress Semiconductor Corp executive chairman Ray Bingham reaches an understanding with Ben Chow about how they would work together. - November 2, 2016: Lattice's board holds a meeting with its advisers where they discuss the proposed merger agreement at length, including the experience and reputations of Canyon Bridge’s co-founders, Bingham and Chow.

It is that lucrative line of business that President Donald Trump will target when he rolls out his new Cuba policy Friday in Miami, the heart of the country's hard-line exile community, according to U.S. officials who have seen a draft presidential memorandum. Trump will significantly restrict U.S. companies from doing business with some military-linked enterprises, the officials said. “Any ban on using military-owned tourism facilities would make it very difficult to bring groups larger than seven people because for logistical reasons you need to work with the government,” Collin Laverty, president of Cuba Educational Travel, said. The number of Americans traveling to Cuba, mostly in large groups due to U.S. regulations, has nearly tripled in recent years and was expected to reach around 400,000 in 2017, according to U.S. travel agencies. Trump's expected limits on U.S. business deals will target the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy that is headed up by General Luis Alberto Rodriguez, reportedly President Raul Castro’s son-in-law. That is bad news for the pro-engagement U.S. politicians and hundreds of businesses that flocked to Cuba in the last few years in search of new opportunities. The only hotel deal struck to date may prove the last for now, at least in the capital. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, signed on to manage a Gaviota hotel in Havana under the Sheraton brand which opened in 2016. Gaviota is part of GAESA and tourism development projects in Havana and other choice locations are almost exclusively in its hands. U.S. Gulf Coast ports and the Port of Virginia, which have signed letters of intent to work with the new Mariel container terminal, will most likely have to look elsewhere for shipping partners as it is controlled by Almacenes Universales, another GAESA company. The terminal feeds a surrounding Chinese-style development zone which allows investors 100 percent ownership and which was visited by dozens of U.S. business delegations beginning in 2015, though no deals were signed. It also is controlled by Almacenes Universales. GAESA does not run Cuba’s airports, or its cruise ship terminals, meaning U.S. airlines and cruise operators might not be directly impacted, but it does control the marinas. All the state hotels, stores and eateries in colonial Old Havana are owned by Habaguanex, which was recently taken over from the city historian's office by GAESA. GAESA began modestly enough in the 1980s as an effort to bring modern management to the civilian sector mired in the ways of Soviet-style administration. It has grown dramatically over the last decade since Raul Castro took over for his ailing and now deceased older brother, Fidel. Today GAESA boasts dozens of companies that control anywhere from 40 percent to 60 percent of the Caribbean island’s foreign exchange earnings, according to Cuban economists. GAESA’s books, like those of other state-run companies, are not public. Some Cuba experts and diplomats believe the military is feathering its own nest and perhaps preparing to cash in if the government falls. But others believe revenues flow to the cash-strapped state. A former British ambassador to Cuba, Paul Hare, who lectures at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies, said the military was viewed as a guardian of the Revolution. “Their function is to ensure that private Cubans and foreign investors do not undermine the principles of 'socialism',” he said. The holding company controls virtually all of the thousands of stores, supermarkets and malls in the country that sell imported products ranging from food and beverages to clothing and appliances, and hundreds of gas stations and eateries. That means when you enter a shop in Cuba to purchase a bottle of water, soda or beer, you probably are patronizing a military establishment. If you want to rent a condominium or satellite TV service, you have to go through a GAESA company. The holding company also controls two banks and all credit card and money transfer transactions through Fincimex.

Baker and Michael Flaherty SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - As the ultimate corporate insiders, board members are presented with plenty of opportunities to cash in on their sector knowledge and connections. The case of Ray Bingham, until recently Oracle Corp’s second-highest paid board member and executive chairman at U.S. chip maker Cypress Semiconductor Corp, shows how taking advantage of those breaks can backfire. The 71-year old technology veteran helped set up a private equity fund backed by China’s central government last fall. In November, the fund agreed to buy Lattice Semiconductor Corp , another U.S. chip manufacturer, for $1.3 billion – a potentially lucrative coup for Bingham. But the chip deal is in doubt over U.S. national security concerns. On Monday, Lattice and the buyout fund, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, said they submitted the deal for review for the third time to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The deal has also cost Bingham personally. His connection to Canyon Bridge has forced Bingham, recipient of a 2009 Financial Times ‘Outstanding Director’ accolade, to relinquish two marquee board seats in the technology sector because of divergent perceptions of whether he faced conflicts of interest in his various roles. On Sunday, Bingham resigned from Cypress' board of directors after the company's founder and sixth-largest shareholder - T.J. Rodgers - sued the Cypress board and launched a proxy contest to remove Bingham from the board. Rodgers alleged Bingham faced irreconcilable conflicts of interest because of his involvement with Canyon Bridge. Bingham, in the Cypress announcement of his stepping down, cited this contest as a distraction. It came three months after he gave up his seat on Oracle's board of directors due to controversy over him moonlighting for Canyon Bridge. “Throughout the process (of joining Canyon Bridge), Ray conducted himself with transparency. He discussed his plans to join Canyon Bridge with Cypress' board and outside legal counsel, who concluded there was no conflict and was given the green light to join,” a Canyon Bridge spokesman told Reuters. Bingham himself did not respond to several requests for comment. Bingham’s reputation in the technology industry helped clinch the Lattice acquisition for Canyon Bridge, regulatory filings show. Bingham was offered a $1.2 million signing bonus by Canyon Bridge, a $2 million cut of its management fees and a 20 percent stake in Canyon Bridge itself. That is in addition to the $890,902 in 2016 he received from Oracle, making him the second-highest paid board director at the company behind founder Larry Ellison, and an annual salary and bonus from Cypress worth $900,000, as well as equity grants worth $4.5 million. The income from Oracle and Cypress is now gone because of his gamble to align with Canyon Bridge. Bingham continues to serve on the board of two other publicly listed technology companies, Flex Ltd and TriNet Group Inc. A Compromising Relationship U.S. board members increasingly come from business leadership backgrounds. This often presents them with new opportunities that come up through existing roles or previous corporate relationships. This was the case with Bingham, who had done business with China-born U.S. citizen, Benjamin Chow, when Bingham worked at private equity firm General Atlantic LLC a decade ago. Chow set up Canyon Bridge last summer with funding from China Reform Management, a Chinese state-owned investment firm, which became Canyon Bridge's sole investor, according to Lattice’s regulatory filings. For a timeline of events in the Lattice deal, click Chow approached Bingham last August. He believed that a U.S.-based buyout fund with a U.S. partner like Bingham would trigger much less scrutiny by CFIUS compared with a Chinese buyer, Reuters reported in March. Canyon Bridge’s Chinese state links, first revealed by Reuters in November, were a bone of contention at Oracle. Its board told Bingham in March he could not retain his seat and continue to be a partner of Canyon Bridge, according to Bingham’s deposition in Rodgers’ lawsuit. In response, Bingham decided to step down.  Oracle expressed concern that Bingham's affiliation with Canyon Bridge would compromise Oracle's relationship with the United States government,  Andre Bouchard, the judge presiding over Rodgers' lawsuit, said at Delaware's Court of Chancery earlier this month, citing Bingham's deposition. Oracle declined to comment. Chow, approached through Canyon Bridge, declined to comment. A Matter of Interest for the Board Bingham helped Chow set up Canyon Bridge in September and October 2016, taking on tasks ranging from setting up calls for hiring staff for Canyon Bridge to using Bingham’s name, a quote from him, and his phone number at Cypress on the press release announcing the Lattice deal on November 3, according to regulatory and court filings. Bingham was even given signatory authority on a $30 million Canyon Bridge bank account. Yet he had not yet formally joined Canyon Bridge, and had not let Cypress’ board know. On Oct. 20, Bingham contacted Cypress' outside counsel, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, to ask if he should tell Cypress’ board he was considering joining Canyon Bridge, according to a regulatory filing from Cypress. Bingham concluded there was no need to do so at that time, according to Cypress. Wilson Sonsini did not respond to a request for comment.  Clearly this is a matter that would have been of interest to the other board members, and the fact that Bingham did not come forth with this information prior to that time seems odd,  said Alan Seem, a corporate partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP who is not involved with the case. On Nov. 4, at a regularly scheduled Cypress board meeting and a day after the Lattice deal was announced with his name on the press release, Bingham told the board that he was contemplating joining Canyon Bridge as a minority partner, according to Cypress. At the same meeting, Morgan Stanley gave a presentation to Cypress' board in which it identified Canyon Bridge as one of the top four most likely acquirers for Cypress out of a list of 30 company names. Cypress itself had been approached by Lattice twice in 2016 about making a potential acquisition offer, most recently last September, but it turned both opportunities down, according to Cypress. Nonetheless, Cypress said its board concluded there was no conflict of interest because there were no active talks or considerations about a possible deal with either Lattice or Canyon Bridge. But some Cypress board members could see that there was scope for future problems.  On Nov. 7, Eric Benhamou, Cypress’ lead independent director at the time, told another director that Bingham’s role with Canyon Bridge was “ripe for conflicts interest,” according to a Cypress regulatory filing. In December, Cypress’ board amended the company’s code of ethics to ensure that if Cypress was having significant acquisition talks with a potential target, then any conflicted director would recuse themselves. “Duty of loyalty issues are corrosive. They leave investors with the impression that the playing field isn’t level,  said Thomas Lys, accounting information and management professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

But one group of investors is heading the other way - concerned that shale may become a victim of its own success. The speed of the recovery in the U.S. shale industry in the past year has surprised oil investors after a global supply glut led to a two-year crude price slump and bankrupted many shale firms. Eight prominent hedge funds have reduced the size of their positions in ten of the top shale firms by over $400 million, concerned producers are pumping oil so fast they will undo the nascent recovery in the industry after OPEC and some non-OPEC producers agreed to cut supply in November. The funds, with assets of $286 billion and substantial energy holdings, cut exposure to firms that are either pure-play Permian companies or that derive significant revenues from the region, according to an analysis of their investments based on Reuters data. The Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), accounting for more than a quarter of overall U.S. crude production.  We'll have to see if these U.S. producers have the discipline to not go crazy and keep prices where they keep making money,  said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Dallas-based investment firm Hodges Capital Management. Hodges Capital owns shares of Permian play firms including Diamondback Energy Inc, RSP Permian Inc and Callon Petroleum Co. Bradshaw's firm has maintained its exposure to the Permian. There is no sign that shale producers will restrain production. They redeployed rigs and personnel quickly since prices began strengthening in 2016 and made shale profitable again; rig counts have risen by 40 percent this year in the Permian, which accounts for about half of all U.S. onshore oil rigs. Hedge funds pulled back in the first quarter, according to the most recently available regulatory filings, and the stocks have continued to struggle as oil prices have come under renewed pressure. The value of these funds' positions in the 10 Permian companies declined by 14 percent, to $2.66 billion in the first quarter, the most recent data available, from $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Hedge funds have continued to reduce their exposure to energy stocks in the second quarter, said Mark Connors, global head of portfolio and risk advisory at Credit Suisse, though he could not provide figures specific to shale companies. Margins Squeezed Fund managers interviewed expressed concern that volatile oil prices along with rising service costs and acreage prices are not reflected in overly optimistic projections for the Permian. The funds analyzed include Pointstate Capital LP, a $25 billion fund with 16 percent in energy shares, and Arosa Capital Management, a $2.1 billion fund with more than 90 percent of assets in energy stocks. Pointstate and Arosa declined comment.  Margins will continue to be squeezed by a 15 to 20 percent increase in service costs in the Permian basin,  said Michael Roomberg, portfolio manager of the Miller/Howard Drill Bit to Burner Tip Fund. A Reuters analysis of 10 Permian producers, including several that almost exclusively operate in Texas, carry an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 35, compared with the overall energy sector's P/E ratio of about 17.8.  These are not great returns, but the problem is the market is rewarding them,  said an analyst at one of the hedge funds on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Concerns about lofty land prices are driving some of the pullback by hedge funds, according to two fund analysts who could not speak on the record. Values for Permian acreage have increased 30 percent from two years ago, according to Detring Energy Advisors in Houston. The 10 Permian stocks analyzed have, on average, dropped 18 percent so year, compared with the broader S&P; 500 energy sector's 13 percent fall. Permian production is expected to reach 2.47 million bpd by July, a 330,000 bpd increase from the beginning of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Last month the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other key producers, including Russia, extended a historic output cut agreement to combat a global glut. However, production from non-OPEC countries, especially the U.S., continues to rise and weigh on prices. U.S. crude prices on Wednesday hit a six-month low just above $44 per barrel. Reuters analysis shows many shale companies reduced hedges in the first quarter, leaving them vulnerable to falling oil prices.

Do they understand the pain when you can't find a decent job for so long and your measly unemployment benefit runs out after 12 months?

Under new rules adopted after the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis, banks are required to issue loss-absorbing debt that would be used in a liquidation to reduce taxpayers' costs, but that issuance has so far fallen short. One reason for the slow take-up is the fragmentation of EU countries' rules on the hierarchy of creditors that would be hit first in case of liquidation. To tackle this problem, EU ministers reached an agreement on the  ranking of unsecured debt instruments in insolvency proceedings,  an EU statement said on Friday. The deal, reached at a regular meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg, defines a common EU list of subordinated creditors that would face losses when a bank needed to be rescued. A new common category of so-called  non-preferred senior debt  is to be established. Investors who buy these bonds would be wiped out only after all shareholders and junior bondholders are hit in a bankruptcy, but before other senior creditors and depositors. This  will provide more clarity  and help investors to assess and price the risk, the EU commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters. The added clarity could also reduce claims of misselling that have partly limited regulators in the application of the new rules. The new regime, known as bail-in, has been staunchly criticised by Italian authorities on fears that it could scare investors and damage retail savers who were unaware of risks. The wiping out of bondholders in the rescue in 2015 of Banca Popolare dell'Etruria, a small Italian lender, pushed a pensioner to commit suicide after he lost more than 100,000 euros ($111,000). Since then, Rome has tried to rescue other ailing banks using an exception to the rules that still permit the injection of public funds into banks and reduce creditors' losses. EU regulators expect the new rules to speed up banks' issuance of new  bailinable  debt, boosting their financial stability. The European Banking Authority estimated that Europe's largest lenders need to raise issuance of these subordinated liabilities by 11 percent to meet legal requirements by 2019. The deal reached by finance ministers needs to be approved by the European Parliament to become law. Banks have urged a quick adoption of these measures to avoid  significant market capacity concerns  if issuance was concentrated in a compressed period of time, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a banking lobbying group, said. In a separate decision, EU finance ministers also agreed on Friday to delay the application of new, stricter international standards on the calculation of bank losses caused by bad loans, known as IFRS9. The new requirements were expected to enter into force in 2018, but ministers backed a five-year transitional period in which their application will be softened. The delay is meant to avoid steep capital falls for banks with a high percentage of bad loans, a widespread problem in southern European countries.

Euro zone governments threw Greece another credit lifeline on Thursday and sketched some new detail on possible debt relief as the IMF finally offered to join the bailout after two years of hesitation. The 8.5 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of new loans from the euro zone's 18 other states lets Athens avoid defaulting on bailout repayments next month and recognises the unpopular cuts and reforms the left-wing government has made. Berlin backed the loans even though it is wary of easing terms for Greece ahead of a German election in September. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hailed the deal on Friday as Greece's 10-year government bond yield fell to its lowest for almost a month on the news.  It was a decisive step, for the country exiting from this crisis. It was a clear step of confidence for the markets,  Tsipras said. But the deal was not enough for the European Central Bank to include Greece in its government bond-buying program for now, as the ECB needed more clarity on what kind of debt relief Greece will get from its international creditors.  It’s a very positive step in the right direction but you need to see more clarity on debt to include Greece,  an official close to the issue said.  Euro zone ministers, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, said on Thursday they could in 2018 extend the average maturities of Greek loans and grace periods by up to 15 years. The average maturity now is 30 years. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (L) welcomes French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire at his office in Maximos Mansion in Athens, Greece, June 12, 2017.Costas BaltasBut this was not enough for either the IMF or the ECB, with the Fund deciding to wait with disbursements to Greece until the euro zone provides more clarity on debt relief. New Obstacles Spanish Finance Minister Luis De Guindos unexpectedly cast a pall over the agreement on Friday by saying Madrid would block the disbursement to Greece unless Athens grants immunity to privatization agency officials from Spain, Italy and Slovakia, charged over a sale and lease-back deal of 28 state-owned buildings in Greece in 2015.  If there's not a definitive solution for the situation of these three experts, the Eurogroup will block the payment,  de Guindos said in Luxemburg where European Union finance ministers hold monthly talks. EU officials said they were convinced the issue would be resolved quickly and not impact the disbursement after all, but they also noted that euro zone ministers stood behind Spain, Italy and Slovakia on the issue. A senior lawmaker from Germany's center-left Social Democrats also added to the uncertainty by calling for a full parliamentary debate on the deal, in a challenge to Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble who deems such a debate unnecessary. Social Democrat lawmaker Johannes Kahrs believes the IMF's decision to delay its own disbursements despite joining the bailout is a major change to the deal and needs the approval of the whole German parliament. Schaeuble said on Thursday that it would be up to the budget committee of the Bundestag to decide whether full parliamentary approval was needed, but that he did not believe the deal was a substantive change.  A vote in the Bundestag could embarrass conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel as some of her lawmakers oppose aid to Greece ahead of German elections in September. Altogether 63 German conservative lawmakers voted against the third bailout for Greece in August 2015 and a further three abstained.

Smoke was still wafting out of the blackened shell of the Grenfell Tower on Thursday where specialist firefighters and dog search teams faced hazardous conditions as they scoured the wreck, with external cladding still falling from the building. Fire engulfed the social housing block, where as many as 600 people lived in more than 120 apartments, in the early hours of Wednesday, turning it into a flaming torch in minutes.   Sadly I can confirm that the number of people that have died is now 17,  London police commander Stuart Cundy told reporters. He said that number was expected to rise and firefighters, who rescued 65, have said they did not expect to find any more survivors. Asked if the final figure would be in double or triple digits, Cundy said:  I'd like to hope that it isn't going to be triple figures.  He said the search of the gutted block might take months and some victims might never be identified. Thirty-seven people remained in hospital, with 17 of them in critical care.  Our absolute priority ... is identifying and locating those people who are still missing,  Cundy said. An investigation into the cause of the blaze, the worst in the British capital in a generation, was underway. But the shock at its scale turned to anger and recriminations on Thursday. Accounts of people trapped inside as the blaze destroyed everything around them, shouting for help, throwing children to safety and trying to escape through windows using makeshift ropes from bed sheets tied together left the nation in shock.  It was so preventable, and that's why we're so angry,  said Alia Al-Ghabban, a veterinary receptionist who lives on the estate.

We need to know what happened, we need to have an explanation of this. People deserve answers; the inquiry will give them.  Local residents say there had been repeated warnings about the safety of the building, which recently underwent an 8.7 million pound ($11.1 million) exterior refurbishment, which included new external cladding and windows. The firm behind the work said the project met all required building regulations. Planning documents detailing the refurbishment did not refer to a type of fire barrier that building safety experts said should be used when high-rise blocks are being re-clad, according to Reuters research.

They also promised that those who had lost their homes would be rehoused in the local area. Survivors, many of whom lost all their belongings in the blaze, spent the night at emergency shelters, as charities and local support groups were flooded with piles of boxes full of clothes and bedding from shocked Londoners. No Reply Others gathered seeking news of the missing. Semira Mohammed, 37, a science technician who lives nearby, said she knew a family of five who lived on the 21st floor of the block.  Slideshow (25 Images) I kept calling and calling,  she told Reuters.  The phone was ringing but they didn't reply to us. We were from the same community, and many in the tower were. Maybe 70 percent are from Somalia, Sudan, Morocco.  The Syrian Solidarity Campaign said on its Facebook webpage that Mohammed Al Haj Ali, a refugee from Syria, was one of those who had been killed. Queen Elizabeth said her thoughts and prayers were with those families who had lost loved ones and those still critically ill in hospital.   It is also heartening to see the incredible generosity of community volunteers rallying to help those affected by this terrible event,  the queen said. Her grandsons, Prince William and Prince Harry, along with William's wife Kate, donated to a relief fund organized by London's local Evening Standard newspaper. The singer Adele was among many Londoners who gathered close to the burnt tower late on Wednesday to show sympathy for the victims and survivors. The tower, built in 1974 on the low-rent housing estate in North Kensington, sits in a part of west London surrounded by some of the most affluent areas of the capital. By Thursday morning, there was no sign of life in or around the blackened hulk. Security cordons were in place around the base of the tower and the ground was littered with charred debris. Outside the cordons, impromptu tributes appeared with photos of missing people, messages of condolences, flowers and candles.  I'm really angry about what's happened,  said receptionist  Samira Jama, 50, who was helping her sister collect belongings from an apartment behind the cordon.  Hundreds of people still aren't accounted for - what happened to them? Every person in a position of power has to answer questions about this.

Where they could, workers used the original bricks that had broken off the wall over the centuries. When they found none, they used new bricks made to exacting specifications.  We have to stick to the original format, the original material and the original craftsmanship, so that we can better preserve the historical and cultural values,  said Cheng Yongmao, the engineer leading Jiankou's restoration. Cheng, 61, who has repaired 17 km (11 miles) of the Great Wall since 2003, belongs to the 16th generation in a long line of traditional brick makers. A government clampdown on pollution has forced the closure of almost all brick-making factories in Beijing and nearby provinces, Cheng said. If he ran out of bricks, Cheng added, he would have to look for bricks left elsewhere or request the central government to consider reopening some brick factories. Cheng Yongmao, the engineer in charge of the reconstruction project on the Jiankou section of the Great Wall, looks as the sun rises over the wall, located in Huairou District, north of Beijing, China, June 7, 2017.Damir Sagolj      Concrete Pavement Famed for its rugged beauty, Jiankou, which is Chinese for an arrow's nock, or notch for a bowstring, was built in the twilight years of the Ming dynasty in the 1600s, but is young compared with other sections dating back two millennia. Slideshow (25 Images)Intensive repairs on the Jiankou section in the past year have been led by the district government keen to preserve the wall's natural beauty and shore up its disintegrating steps. The restoration began in 2005 and is now in its third phase, making slow progress because the uneven terrain allows use only of basic tools such as chisels, hammers, pickaxes and shovels.  Authorities' meticulous approach followed widespread outrage last year sparked by botched restoration efforts on some stretches. Authorities in the northeastern province of Liaoning, home to a 700-year-old section of the wall, paved its ramparts with sand and cement, resulting in what critics said looked more like a pedestrian pavement.  Soon after, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage said it would investigate any improperly executed wall preservation projects.  Just a tenth of the wall built during the Ming dynasty has been repaired, said Dong Yaohui, vice president of the China Great Wall Association.     In the past, we would restore the walls so that they would be visited as tourist hot spots,  he said, by contrast with today's objective of repairing and preserving them for future generations.  This is progress.

A dozen or so women, in their 60s to 80s, stand watch each day around the clock to make sure no military vehicles enter the deployment site through the only road to it -- a former golf course owned by a leading conglomerate, the Lotte Group. The vigil has forced the U.S. military to use helicopters instead to shuttle fuel and supplies to the site hosting the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. South Korea's former conservative government agreed with the United States to deploy the battery to counter growing threats from North Korean missiles. New liberal President Moon Jae-in had promised to review the controversial decision during his successful campaign for the May 9 election. Last week, Moon ordered full deployment be suspended while the government reviews how the system will affect the area's environment. But there is no intention to change the deployment decision and elements of the battery, including two launchers already installed at the site, will stay, his government said. The women, who brandish canes and umbrellas at the military helicopters and shout for them to go away every time one flies through the village, say they have no interest in the politics of the deployment. But they protest, longing for the peace they had before.  I can't sleep. I'm taking sedatives at night but I still get only two hours of sleep,  said 87-year-old Na Wi-bun, who lives within a kilometer (0.62 mile) of the site and says she can hear the generator that powers THAAD humming around the clock. Na goes to the town hall every day, a refuge to a group of women as well as a number of civic groups protesting the deployment.  During the daytime, we used to farm and later go to the town hall and us grandmothers would spend time together. Now there's no day and night for us. I live at the town hall now,  said 81-year-old Do Geum-ryeon. Most of the villagers are farmers of chamoe, or Korean melon. Do, who moved to the village 61 years ago, said she sustained bruises fighting against police in late April, trying to keep U.S. military trailers full of THAAD components from passing through the village at early dawn.  On my dying breath, I'm going to tell them to take THAAD away,  she said. Villagers are blocked by South Korean policemen as they march during an anti-THAAD proest near an entrance of a golf course where a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is deployed, in Seongju, South Korea, June 14, 2017.  Picture taken on June 14, 2017.Kim Hong-JiLong Fight Ahead On the site now are two launchers and a powerful X-band radar that constitute THAAD. The launchers are visible to the naked eye from a mountain peak roughly two to three kilometers away and the generator can be heard from the mountain. Visitors who scale the 600-meter (0.37 mile) peak to look at THAAD are shooed away by South Korean police holed up in a guard post near the summit. Soseong-ri town head, Lee Seok-ju, said he has warned villagers of a long fight ahead. Slideshow (17 Images) I see this going on for at least two years, and at longest, even five. If this was going to end in one or two days, we would have fought tooth and nail, but we're saving our energy for the long run,  Lee said. Soseong-ri is part of North Gyeongsang Province, long known for being a conservative stronghold. With THAAD, that has changed. When conservative candidate Park Geun-hye was elected as president in 2012, voter support stood near 90 percent for her in Seongju County, where Soseong-ri is located. In the most recent presidential election in May, support for the conservative candidate from Park's party fell to 56 percent. Most Soseong-ri villagers voted for Moon or the other liberal candidate, Ahn Cheol-soo, Lee said. That includes 67-year-old Kim Jeom-sook, who farms chamoe with her husband.  THAAD must go. Sometimes I look up and I am so frightened some of things dangling from the helicopters will fall on us,  Kim said. Her 73-year-old husband, Lee Mu-hwan, said their business has not been affected by THAAD yet but prices have declined in past years due to oversupply and so they cannot risk another hit. They earn roughly 10 million won ($8,901.55) a year from melon farming, after expenses. Kim, whose grandfather died in the 1950-1953 Korean War, said THAAD would be of no use if North Korea is determined to strike the South.   If North Korea wants to boom boom boom, they can hit everywhere and create a sea of fire. I'm sure this area will turn like that too if they want,  said Kim.

The vaccination program will kick off in Guangdong and Guangxi in southern China in early July, said a notice from the agriculture ministry posted on the official WeChat account of the Chinese Veterinary Medical Association this week.  It targets all species including broiler chickens, ducks, geese and egg-laying hens. Farms in other provinces will be allowed to opt for vaccination if approved by local veterinary authorities, it added, and emergency vaccination may be used to tackle outbreaks.  In the near-term, it's a good thing, it's definitely a control measure,  said Li Jinghui, managing director, China Poultry Association. H7N9 first emerged in China in 2013 but human cases spiked up last winter, claiming at least 268 lives since October, and mostly during the first few months of this year. While the virus initially had little impact on birds, the high number of human cases led authorities to shut down live poultry markets around the country, hitting demand for eggs and the native yellow-feather chickens, commonly sold in such marketplaces. The H7N9 strain has also evolved in some places into a more severe form, killing egg-laying hens and leading authorities to cull flocks in surrounding areas. FILE PHOTO: Chickens are seen at a livestock market before the market asked to stop trading on March 1 in prevention of bird flu transmission, in Kunming, Yunnan province, China February 22, 2017.Stringer/File PhotoAs farmers are still reeling from the plunge in their business, many had lobbied the government for a vaccine to protect their flocks. Others operating integrated farms that sell directly to slaughterhouses were not in favour of the plan however, said Li.  In the long run, vaccination does not help the eradication of the disease,  he said. Vaccines reduce clinical disease but do not prevent a virus from circulating and can mask its prevalence, say experts. China is the world's third-largest producer of broiler chickens and the second-biggest consumer of poultry. In densely populated Guangdong, there were more than 300 human cases of H7N9 virus this winter, far more than any other province.  While acknowledging the debate around the use of vaccines, Vincent Martin, chief representative for the Food and Agriculture Organization in China, said China had taken the right step.  It's a tough decision. If you start, you may have to do it for some time, it could be several years, with a robust post-vaccination monitoring system in place, especially in a country like China with a huge poultry population,  he said. He added that the decision to start the vaccination programs in July, six months ahead of the usual rise in cases, showed good timing and smart preparation by the country.

The country's multitrillion-dollar financial industry has lobbied for certain data exchanges to be suspended if there is evidence that countries could misuse bank data which could then expose clients to crimes such as blackmail. Switzerland is already due in 2018 to start swapping information with 38 foreign tax authorities, including all European Union nations, under the Automatic Exchange of Information programme fostered by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The government has now approved the mechanism for exchanging data with an extra 41 states and territories in the second half of 2019, among which are several emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico and Russia. But before the exchange takes place, the government will now prepare a  situation report , it said in a statement on Friday.  In the process, it will be checked whether the states and territories concerned effectively meet the requirements under the standard, especially those concerning confidentiality and data security,  the government said. If Switzerland finds requirements are not met with specific countries, it could suspend the exchange of data with these jurisdictions. No reports are planned for the 2018 batch of countries. Parliament will vote on the government's recommendation.  We take positively note of the Federal Council's dispatch on the automatic exchange of information published today,  the Swiss Bankers Association, the main banking lobby, said in a statement, referring to the government. Wealthy clients have pulled tens of billions of dollars out of Swiss bank accounts because of a worldwide crackdown on tax evasion following the global financial crisis last decade. That culminated in the Automatic Exchange of Information programme, which aims to ensure that offshore accounts are known to authorities. The participation of Switzerland, the world's largest centre for overseas wealth, in the data exchange agreement was heralded at the time as a major breakthrough in tackling tax avoidance.

The imports have supported the Asian diesel market which would otherwise have collapsed under a flood of Chinese exports. The Singapore diesel crack margin rose to a more than two-month high of over $11 a barrel to Dubai crude on Friday, Reuters data showed. India's state-owned refiners are already seeking or have bought up to 967,000 tonnes of diesel through July, according to tender data published by Reuters. That exceeds then-record imports of 962,000 tonnes in 2016, according to full-year government data going back to 2011. The upgrades to meet new Euro IV fuel standards implemented on April 1 and warmer temperatures are boosting diesel imports into the world's third-largest oil consumer, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil for oil consultants FGE.  Extreme temperatures in various states lifted (diesel) demand both in the agricultural and power sector in May,  she told Reuters.  While there were downpours early this month, indicating early arrival of the monsoon, some states continue to face warm weather.  Heavy maintenance at Indian Oil Corp and Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd as they upgrade units are also boosting diesel shipments, she said. India's HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd (HMEL), part owned by Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd, delayed the start-up of its Bathinda refinery in northern Punjab state by a fortnight to the end of this month. The plant had been shut for works that would increase its ability to produce cleaner diesel. While monsoon rains typically reduce the need for diesel used in irrigation pumps, the curtailed supply because of the maintenance shutdowns will likely continue to boost imports into the country, FGE's Paravaikkarasu said. India is a net exporter of diesel with its refinery production usually enough to meet domestic demand, limiting imports. But the change in fuel standards has boosted imports of cleaner diesel while it has exported more lower sulphur diesel, traders said. India's diesel demand is expected to rise to record levels again this year as a slew of infrastructure projects boosts the use of the fuel, although a government-induced cash shortage will hold growth to its slowest in three years. Diesel demand is expected to grow by 3 percent this year, lower than the 5.1 percent growth in 2016, FGE's Paravaikkarasu said.

With barely three months to go before an independence referendum called for Oct. 1, naturalized immigrants are taking on an important and prominent role in the campaign both as activists and supporters. Catalonia has one of the highest percentages of immigrants in Spain, just under 14 percent of residents are foreign-born, and their votes may gain crucial votes for the independence movement in what is likely to be a close-run race. Including them in the movement for nationhood is key says Catalonia's deputy governor, Oriol Junqueras.  We want to be a very open and integrated society,  he told Reuters in Barcelona.  Campaigners are even encouraging migrants without the right to vote to ask work mates and friends to vote for independence and are advocating Catalan nationality for all migrants living in the region if it leaves Spain.  All those who are officially registered as living in Catalonia will have the right to Catalan nationality from day one of independence,  said Uruguayan Ana Surra, Spanish member of parliament for Catalan pro-independence party ERC. After a live performance by a reggae singer in the community hall, organizers handed out leaflets saying: 'Wherever you're from, it's in your hands to secure a better future for you and your children. Sign up to the Catalan Republic!   I want to call on everyone here to stand with us and to vote 'yes',  said Zuhair Altayeb, who fled Syria in 2011 and has Spanish nationality by marriage.  With separatist sentiment on the wane from Scotland to Quebec, the pressure is on for Catalonia's secessionists as they attempt to push through a second ballot after a symbolic vote three years ago which was not recognized by Madrid. Madrid says the new vote is illegal and must not take place.     Unlike the 2014 ballot, non-Spaniards will not be able to vote in October because Catalonia wants to comply with national rules on voting to give the ballot more legitimacy. A majority of Catalans want to hold a referendum, polls show, with those in favor of a united Spain slightly in the lead. Nationality Not for Certain An  Estelada  (Catalan separatist flag) and an Argentina's flags hang from balconies in Barcelona, Spain June 15, 2017.Albert GeaCarles Puigdemont, the pro-independence regional governor, said in a televised debate in January that he supported giving Catalan nationality to migrants living in the region, although he said that would ultimately be decided when a constitution for the proposed new country was drawn up.  Catalonia, Spain's second most populous region and home to major city Barcelona, has for centuries attracted migrants to work in its textile, steel and chemical industries. In the 1960s, tens of thousands of Spaniards from the poorer southern regions of Murcia and Andalucia also moved to the region in search of work. Their descendents speak Catalan and are some of the most vocal supporters of an independent state. During Spain's boom years at the turn of the 21st century, a new wave of economic migrants came from Latin America and northern Africa. Catalonia was one of the biggest recipients of these migrants. Slideshow (11 Images)Migrants as a percentage of Catalonia's population leapt to a peak of just under 16 percent in 2011, up from 4.1 percent a decade earlier, a bigger jump than in Spain overall.  Whereas the economic crisis of the last decade saw the number of migrants fall, that trend reversed in Catalonia last year and it was one of the few Spanish regions to register a net increase in foreign residents. The Catalan regional government has worked to integrate migrants by providing free healthcare and education even to illegal immigrants registered as living in Catalonia. Saoka Kingolo, who came to Spain from Congo in 1988 in search of work and to escape dictatorship, said his experience of Catalonia as an immigrant has been positive despite the big jump in the number of foreigners in recent years.  At the most there have been one or two (xenophobic) incidents, but nothing serious,  said the 56-year-old independence campaigner who works to promote the Catalan language and advocate immigrant rights in the region. However, back in the hall in Polinya, all is not plain sailing. Members of the audience express concerns about their eligibility to vote and what will happen to their Spanish residency papers if Catalonia gets independence.  I don't like the idea of independence. We are all one family aren't we?  said one Senegalese audience member who did not want to give his name.  If Catalonia splits off, what if another region wants to go? Spain won't be Spain anymore.  (Fixes paragraph 16 to say Catalonia was one of the biggest recipients of migrants not the biggest.)

CEFC was granted a license by the Zhoushan Free Trade Zone to supply bunker fuel from bonded storage to vessels that call at the Zhoushan area, according to two CEFC officials. The Zhoushan Free Trade Zone is in the coastal province of Zhejiang and is a new free trade zone the Chinese government approved earlier this year to boost commodities trade. Chinese media yicai.com reported last week that three other companies including Zhejiang Energy Group, Jiangsu CNPC & Tafo Petroleum Corp and a unit of privately run Herun Group were also given licenses. Those permits bring the total number of tax-bonded bunker licenses in the country to nine. Transactions from bonded tanks are exempted from taxes.  CEFC has rented tanks in Zhoushan and also barges to start the new business,  said one senior CEFC source. A CEFC spokesperson confirmed the new license. The new permit allows CEFC to expand its China oil business which has until now largely focused on operating its 17.6 million-barrel storage facility in the southern island province of Hainan. Before the new permits from Zhoushan, only five companies have the licenses for bonded bunker, four of which are state oil firms and one independent, Brightoil Petroleum.

China matters for Mickey Mouse's owner: its box office takings there have tripled over the last two years and Shanghai Disneyland has seen more than 10 million guests in its first year, setting it on track for faster profits than Disney reaped from parks in Paris and Hong Kong, both loss-making for most of the years they have been open.

I think those are the sort of right precursors, if you will, for future development,  he said when asked about expansion plans.  We're very encouraged by what we've seen.  Disney released 10 films in China last year, including  Zootopia  and  Star Wars: The Force Awakens  with ticket sales of about $1 billion, according to box office tracker EntGroup. That was up from four films and $313 million in 2014. Last month, it rolled out the red carpet in Shanghai for a rare world premiere of the latest film in its  Pirates of the Caribbean  franchise. Stars Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Javier Bardem made an appearance.     It has also been tying up with partners like state-backed producer Shanghai Film Group, its digital subsidiary BesTV for online content, and Shanghai Shendi, its partner for Shanghai. Now, for the first anniversary of the Shanghai park, it will celebrate Disney-style, with lights, fireworks and visits by  executives including Chapek and Chief Executive Bob Iger. Chapek said their hotels at Shanghai Disneyland had hosted almost 750,000 people and had maintained occupancy levels significantly higher than the overall market.  Guests were also spending more time at the park than  anticipated, averaging about nine hours, he said.

CHINA OUT.But along with the hotel rooms and rides, Disney is pursuing a steadier path to build brand and profit in downtown classrooms in six Chinese cities, where children study English with the help of Winnie the Pooh and Captain America.  With the theme park, films, co-productions, Disney English and retail, they're creating an ecosystem to bring consumers in and foster a broader buzz and awareness,  said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.  The aim is to recreate that feeling in the U.S. where you have multiple generations who know the characters and cartoons.  Disney said China was a strategically important market. Slideshow (2 Images) Not only is it home to Shanghai Disney Resort, our largest ever foreign investment, but it has a thriving studio, consumer products and media distribution business,  it said in a statement. Disney is hiring for schools in cities including Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai - all decorated with Disney characters and motifs. It has not all been plain sailing. Disney was forced to launch an investigation this year after an employee was found to have set up firms which made deals with local authorities using the Disney name. Local children are also more used to Asian cartoon heroes, while Disney faces caps on imported films, partial bans on foreign cartoons on TV and long-established domestic theme park rivals. However, for 7-year-old Sunny Sun who has been attending classes once a week at Disney English for the past two years, Disney characters are now familiar.  Her mother, freelance writer Happy Chen, plans to take her to the Shanghai park this summer, and says her daughter goes to almost every new Disney animation at the cinema.  Now she really yearns to go to the Disney park,  said Chen, pointing to the crossover between the classes, films, characters and the theme park.   It's all connected.

The company that places people with financial, energy, banking and pharmaceutical firms posted a 2 percent rise in first-half gross profit to 134.3 million pounds ($171.5 million), helped by strong demand for temporary workers in Europe and the United States, its main markets. Gross profit is a key indicator for staffing firms as it represents total fees earned from all recruitment work. Performance in Britain and Ireland was held back by a slower market after Britain's vote to leave the European Union and new IR35 tax rules affecting contractors working for public sector bodies.  A number of contractors, when their contract is coming up for renewal, are deciding to see if they can find jobs in the private sector,  CEO Gary Elden told analysts, adding this hit more than 3 million pounds of gross profit in the past two years. Overall, SThree, which now generates 80 percent of its gross profit outside Britain, said gross profit from contract hiring rose 8 percent, with growth in engineering, life sciences and energy businesses. Elden said SThree's work in the energy business was changing.  Our renewable business, power business is seeing some progression there. So, we're less reliant now on oil and gas and less reliant on upstream,  he said. He said work in the oil and gas industry in Britain and Africa had disappeared, but he said there was some pick up in places like the U.S. state of Texas due to shale projects. Elden said the focus was also changing in the financial sector, where he said nearly 80 percent of investment banks froze hiring last year.  We've shifted out business to try and be less reliant on investment banks,  he said, adding SThree was seeing improvements in areas such as fintech and financial services, while investment banking was improving  slightly.

Boeing is studying a gap in the market between narrow-body jets and long-haul aircraft for a potential new airplane that could seat 220 to 260 passengers.  There is clearly a market, the question is how do you serve it?  Eric Schulz, president of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce, told journalists at a briefing ahead of the Paris Air Show, which starts on Monday. He said that should Boeing decide on a mid-market jet, then Rolls-Royce as an engine maker would weigh up the opportunity.   If there is the possibility to enter a program, we will examine it and if the conditions are right, we will,  he said.

Schulz said the company was increasing production of Trent engines, including the Trent XWB 84K for the A350.  Six to seven years ago we were making 250 Trent engines a year, this year we want to manufacture more than 400 and our target is 430-450,  he said.  Eighteen months from now, we want to produce 600 Trent engines a year.

We are in a phase where we can catch up some of the delay, to reach a reasonable delay of two-three months compared with what we initially expected,  he said.

British and European stocks had sold off on Thursday as fears grew around the squeezed British consumer and the durability of stronger macroeconomic data which had spurred cyclical sectors higher. The main FTSE 100 benchmark gained 0.4 percent by 1000 GMT, underperforming the European benchmark, Italian and French stocks. UK mid-caps pulled out of Thursday's nosedive to gain 0.7 percent, outperforming the larger stock index, though they were still headed for a loss on the week, taking them to a three-week losing streak. Concerns around the more domestically exposed mid-cap companies came to a head on Thursday when furniture store DFS warned on profit, triggering a sharp sell-off among consumer-exposed stocks. Investors said valuations among mid-caps, which hit a fresh record high as recently as two weeks ago, were also putting off prospective buyers.  It's not panic stations, but you can see why there might be a consolidation,  said Ian Williams, head of economics and strategy at Peel Hunt.  Mid-caps have held up a lot better than people thought they would. So although underlying earnings are good and the bottom up news is good, valuations mean there's not that many more compelling cheap opportunities,  he added.  The incremental buyer is not there anymore, and the markdown could continue before they appear again.  Concerns around the reflation trade were also leading investors to shift away from the sectors most geared to economic growth, and towards defensive stocks, naturally favouring the less cyclicals-heavy FTSE 100.  Whilst corporate earnings have continued to improve and look healthy however the increase in equity market valuations mean that a lot of this improved outlook is reflected in prices,  said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.  Fuller valuations mean that equities are responding more nervously to the recent softer global data,  he added. Uncertainty around UK politics, a week after a shock general election result, had also generated jitters around domestic stocks.  Political uncertainty puts pressure on the domestically focused mid-cap companies who struggle to make well informed investment decisions with such an unclear outlook,  said Park. British American Tobacco and Unilever were among the large-cap drivers of the timid rebound, as investors turned to safer, high dividend-yielding stocks. Tesco shares reversed course, erasing early gains to trade down 0.5 percent, after  weak international same store sales overshadowed the retailer's strongest UK sales growth in seven years.  Tesco's results show that the small ticket, less discretionary spending is proving quite resilient,  said Williams, adding that the inflation-driven squeeze on consumers would likely weigh more on bigger-ticket spending such as furniture, as evidenced by DFS's warning. Energy stocks lent some support after oil edged up off its seven-week lows. But Anglo American fell 1 percent to an 8-month low after some analysts said new mining regulation in South Africa could hit miners' margins. Driving the mid-cap recovery were industrials firms with less exposure to the domestic economy, with engineers Cobham , IMI Melrose Industries and Meggitt among top gainers. Meanwhile companies exposed to housebuilding and real estate kept falling, with Bovis Homes, Crest  Nicholson , Savills and Countryside all down.

Germany intends to take over the liabilities relating to management of radioactive waste and spent fuel from nuclear power plant operators. They would have to pay in about 24.1 billion euros ($26.9 billion).  This is made up of a basic amount equivalent to the provisions already set aside by the operators for this purpose and a risk premium aimed at covering the risk of cost increases in the future. The Commission concluded that the move did involve state aid because of uncertainties over the cost of a repository for waste and the possibility of cost overruns. Germany regards the measure as necessary as it seeks to phase out nuclear energy production by 2022. Without the measure, Germany could have faced a situation in which financial difficulties of operators forced it to take on the full cost of waste management.  The Commission has concluded that the support granted does not exceed what is necessary to achieve this objective and that the competition distortions created by it are limited,  the Commission said in a statement.

Lotte Group, which provided land in South Korea for the U.S. THAAD missile system, says it has fixed safety issues at dozens of its Lotte Mart retail stores in China which local fire authorities had shut down earlier this year. The family-run Korean conglomerate said it has repeatedly asked fire authorities to come and inspect the stores. Some stores have had no response, while others have simply been told to wait, said a Lotte official in Shanghai.  Not a single visit has been made in the past couple of months,  said a Lotte Mart official in Seoul. Seventy-four of Lotte's 99 Mart stores in China were closed by fire authorities over safety violations such as boxes blocking exit doors. South Korea and ally the United States say the THAAD system is designed to thwart nuclear-armed North Korea's missile threat, but Beijing says the system's powerful radar can also reach far into its territory. China has pressured South Korean businesses via boycotts and bans, such as ending Chinese group tours to South Korea, but Lotte has been among the hardest hit by moves seen as punishment for it agreeing to hand over a golf course it owned in southern South Korea so the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery system could be installed there.  We are seriously worried. We did not expect the shutdown to last this long. We thought China would just scare us and that's it,  said the Lotte official in Seoul. That official said Lotte Mart, a supermarket chain run by Lotte Shopping, has been losing around 100 billion won ($88.5 million) a month in wages and lost sales since March, and can't lay off its 12,000 staff under Chinese rules, though it can reduce pay. Lotte had hoped the election of Moon Jae-in as South Korea's president on May 9 would signal an easing of its problems in China as Moon had vowed to review the previous government's deployment of the THAAD system. Last week, Moon ordered THAAD's full deployment be suspended until a review of its environmental impact. But Seoul has also sought to assure the United States, saying the deployment decision won't be reversed and the elements of the battery already installed - two of six launchers and a powerful radar - would stay. China's President Xi Jinping said on May 19 he wanted to put ties with South Korea back on a  normal track , but Beijing urged Seoul to respect its concerns and resolve tensions over the THAAD deployment.  We remain pessimistic,  said the Lotte official in Seoul.  Unless Korea offers concrete benefits to China, it will be difficult for China to allow the re-opening of our stores.

Mingzheng International Trading Limited has facilitated prohibited dollar transactions through the United States on behalf of the Foreign Trade Bank, a North Korean bank, and laundered the proceeds, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of Columbia said in a statement. The $1.9 million forfeiture action  represents one of the largest seizures of North Korean funds by the Department of Justice,  it said. The sum was transacted in 2015 by Mingzheng, based in the Chinese city of Shenyang, via wire transfers, using their Chinese bank accounts, the statement said. Mingzheng could not be immediately reached for comment In March 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department placed the Foreign Trade Bank under sanctions linked to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It described the bank as a state-owned entity that  acts as North Korea's primary foreign exchange bank,  the U.S. prosecutors' statement said. China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the country opposed, in principle, the use of unilateral sanctions outside the scope of United Nations Security Council resolutions.         The foreign trade bank mentioned by the United States is not on the list of U.N. sanctions for North Korea, so we oppose any country using their own so-called domestic laws to implement long arm jurisdiction,  he told a regular news briefing.

Protests over jobs in southern Tataouine and Kebili provinces hit oil and gas production in a region where French company Perenco and Austrian producer OMV operate. The deal calls for jobs in oil companies and development projects. Labor Minister Imed Hammami told a press conference the agreement would allow production to restart immediately.  It is an agreement that addresses all our demands for the region and we will end the sit-in,  Tarek Haddad, one of the protest leaders at the Kamour site told Reuters. The deal calls for 1,500 jobs in oil companies, a budget of 80 million dinars ($32.66 million) for a development fund and another 3,000 jobs in environmental projects. Protesters were pressing demands for jobs and a share of the country's energy wealth and forced the closure of two oil and gas pumping stations in Kamour in Tatatouine and in Kebili. At Kamour, they had shut down the Vana pumping station, affecting around 40 percent of Tunisia's energy production. Tunisia only produces around 44,000 barrels per day, but the protests hit foreign companies. The closures were another challenge to Prime Minister Youssef Chahed's government as it tries to push economic reforms and consolidate Tunisia's democracy six years after a revolt ended the autocratic rule of Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. Southern and central regions have erupted into protest several times since the 2011 uprising with many unemployed youths saying the fall of Ben Ali and their new democracy bought little economic opportunities for them.

He also said he was  definitely interested  in a new mid-market jet that Boeing is studying.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow interfered in last year's presidential campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trump's favor. Trump, who hired his own lawyer last month for probes by a special counsel and congressional committees, lashed out on Thursday after a report that he was under investigation for possible obstruction of justice. He dismissed as  phony  the idea that his campaign colluded with any Russian effort to sway the 2016 election. Moscow denies meddling in the campaign. Pence hired Richard Cullen, chairman of law firm McGuireWoods, to help him respond to inquiries from special counsel Robert Mueller, a spokesman said. Cullen is a former federal prosecutor who has long ties to former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9. He represents former FIFA President Sepp Blatter in the corruption probe into world soccer's governing body. U.S. prosecutors have not accused Blatter of wrongdoing. Cullen, who supported Trump's rival Jeb Bush during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, also represented Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican and former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, during the investigation into corrupt Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff. DeLay was not charged. Related CoverageEx-Homeland Secretary Johnson to testify in Russia probe: House intel panelPence had been looking at hiring his own counsel for several weeks, and made his decision earlier this week after interviewing several candidates, his office said.  The vice president is focused entirely on his duties and promoting the president's agenda and looks forward to a swift conclusion of this matter,  Pence spokesman, Jarrod Agen, said in a statement. Pence has seldom addressed the Russia issue, which has overshadowed Trump's efforts to overhaul the healthcare system, cut taxes and boost jobs - priorities that Pence has worked on intensively with Republican lawmakers. The Washington Post first reported the Cullen hire. Just before the story broke, Trump wrote a pair of angry tweets, suggesting that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the election, should be under investigation instead of him. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence watches as U.S. President Donald Trump departs the White House to embark on his trip to the Middle East and Europe, in Washington, U.S., May 19, 2017.Kevin LamarqueEarlier on Thursday, Trump called the probe a  witch hunt  on Twitter.  They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,  Trump wrote. Lines of Inquiry Mueller is investigating whether anyone on Trump's campaign, or associated with it, with him or any of his businesses, may have had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin, said one U.S. official familiar with the rough outlines of the probe and who spoke on condition of anonymity. That includes the finances and business dealings of Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, and is a senior adviser at the White House, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing unnamed officials familiar with the matter. Slideshow (3 Images)Mueller is also looking at a second line of inquiry: whether, if any potential offenses were committed, Trump or others attempted to cover them up or obstruct the investigation into them, the source said. An examination of possible obstruction of justice charges was  unavoidable  given testimony by Comey, although the issue may not become the main focus of the probe, the source said. Comey told a Senate panel last week he believed Trump fired him to undermine the FBI's Russia probe. He also told the Senate Intelligence Committee in his June 8 testimony that he believed Trump had directed him to drop a related agency investigation into the president's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. White House officials, including Pence, initially gave differing reasons for Comey's dismissal, including that he had lost the confidence of the FBI. Pence said on Twitter on May 10 that Trump had  made the right decision at the right time to remove Comey as the head of the FBI  and praised him for showing  strong & decisive leadership to restore trust & confidence of the American people in the FBI.  Trump later contradicted his own staff, saying on May 11 he had the Russia issue in mind when he fired Comey. Examining the possibility of obstruction charges will allow investigators to interview key administration figures including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and possibly Trump himself, said the source familiar with the Mueller investigation. While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Any such step would face a steep hurdle as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.

The People's Bank of China left interest rates for its open market operations unchanged on Thursday, shrugging off an overnight increase by the Federal Reserve. In March, the PBOC raised rates within hours of a Fed hike.     Analysts said the central bank was keen to keep cash conditions stable at the end of the quarter and stood pat on short-term interest rates. But some pressure to raise rates will persist, given expectations of another U.S. hike this year.     Traders said some banks were not so willing to lend funds this week due to the coming central bank  Macro Prudential Assessments  (MPA) of lenders. They noted cash conditions are traditionally tight in June, and memories remain fresh of a June 2013 crunch that sent money rates soaring and spooked global markets.      In open market operations, the PBOC injected a net 410 billion yuan ($60.2 billion) through its reverse bond repurchase agreements this week, the most since mid-January moves to meet Lunar New Year holidays cash demands.     The central bank said Friday's daily net injection of 250 billion yuan was to counter liquidity stress from factors including corporate tax payments, maturing reverse repos and maturing medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans.     On Friday, a batch of 207 billion yuan in six-month MLF loans were due to mature. The central bank had injected 498 billion yuan through MLFs last week, more than offseting all the maturing MLFs in June.     The fund support failed to drag money rates lower. The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo  traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, closed at 2.9513 percent on Friday afternoon, nearly four basis points higher than the previous week's closing average rate of 2.9136 percent.      Market expectations for tightening cash conditions towards the end of June have driven interest rates for longer-term loans higher.     The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) for one-month tenor stood at 4.6990 percent on Friday, close to its highest level since April 2015. The three-month rate  eased slightly this week but remained close to 26-month highs.     While China did not follow the Fed and raise rates this week, market watchers point out that the gap between China's higher rates and U.S. ones has widened dramatically in recent months.     Ming Ming, chief analyst at CITIC Securities, said that with the gap remaining at a  historic high , this week's Fed cut did not put pressure on China to also raise rates.     The interest rate gap between the two countries is around 140 basis points this month, compared with about 80 basis points in March.     Yields on Chinese benchmark 10-year government bonds  stood at 3.556 percent on Friday, 138 basis points higher than 2.1740 percent of yields on similar U.S. bonds .

It was set to be the second week of falls for MSCI's widely tracked world index, although Europe, which has been the star performer in the first half of the year, was trying to end it on an upnote. London, Frankfurt and Paris climbed between 0.3 and 0.5 percent and the euro, the pound and the Swiss franc rose against the dollar in the currency markets. Greece's 10-year government borrowing costs fell to their lowest in almost a month in bond markets as well, as euro zone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund approved a long-delayed 8.5 billion euro lifeline for Athens, albeit keeping them hanging on for debt relief.  The things that we were worried about at the start of the year which were French elections and potentially a Greek deal not getting done, we have had all the good news on that now,  said State Street Global Markets' strategist Michael Metcalfe. He said the dollar's rise for the week suggested markets had now priced in that positive news - France's new President Emmanuel Macron is expected to get a parliamentary majority at the weekend too - and were thinking where to go next. The Japanese yen hit a two-week low against the dollar after the Bank of Japan left its mass money printing programme unchanged, maintaining the contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which signalled further tightening this week. It was trading 0.3 percent lower at 111.23 yen per dollar, while the euro was buying $1.1173 compared with almost $1.13 earlier in the week. The yen's drop helped Japan's Nikkei advance 0.7 percent, narrowing its loss for the week to 0.3 percent.  The market was relieved that there was no mention of an exit strategy, at least for now,  said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Submerging Markets MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down roughly 0.85 percent for the week though for emerging markets more broadly it was looking like being the worst week of the year so far. Russian stocks steadied on Friday but have been hammered more than 4 percent this week and the rouble is down for a third straight week, on talk of increased Western sanctions and as oil prices have stumbled back again. Overnight, the Nasdaq led losses on Wall Street, dragged lower again by shares including Apple and Alphabet that tumbled on bearish analysts' reports. The broader S&P; 500 index fell 0.2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 percent though future's prices pointed to a modest recovery later.  It was a brutal day for the tech sector once again as investors are increasingly more worried about the (Federal Reserve) tightening cycle and how that would put a number of firms in trouble,  Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets in London, wrote in a note. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, and better-than-expected business conditions numbers also bolstered the case for the Fed to continue raising rates after its second hike of the year on Wednesday. Sterling added almost 0.2 percent to $1.2775. On Thursday, it jumped to as high as $1.2795 on signs of a shift in the Bank of England's stance on keeping interest rates at record lows. In commodities, oil remained subdued however on continued worries over rising U.S. gasoline inventories adding to already elevated global supply. Global benchmarks Brent and U.S. crude hovered at $47.34 and $44.74 a barrel, on track for 2.4 and 2.8 percent drops for the week respectively. It will also be their fourth consecutive week of falls. The dollar's strength kept gold flat at $1,255 an ounce, failing to make up Thursday's 0.6 percent drop. It is poised to close the week with a 1 percent loss, its second weekly decline.

The assets include a Picasso painting given to actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the rights to two Hollywood films, the department said. The filing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles was the Justice Department's latest step in a long-running case over an alleged conspiracy to launder money misappropriated from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund, known as 1MDB, which was set up by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009 to promote economic development. In the complaints, which are all civil actions, the Justice Department alleged that more than $4.5 billion was taken from 1MDB by high-level fund officials and their associates.  We simply will not allow the United States to be a place where corrupt individuals can expect to hide assets and lavishly spend money that should be used for the benefit of citizens of other nations,  Kenneth Blanco, acting assistant attorney general, said in a statement on Thursday.  1MDB said on Friday that it is not a party to the civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and had never been contacted in relation to the case. Najib has denied taking money from 1MDB or any other entity for personal gain, after it was reported that investigators traced nearly $700 million to bank accounts that were allegedly in his name. In response to the latest lawsuit, a spokesman for Najib said the lawsuits raised concerns about  the unnecessary and gratuitous naming of certain matters and individuals that are only relevant to domestic political manipulation and interference .  This suggests a motivation that goes beyond the objective of seizing assets,  Najib's press secretary, Tengku Sariffuddin, said in a statement, adding that unproven allegations should not be taken as fact. Malaysia attorney general's office said in an emailed statement that Malaysian authorities had discovered no crime committed by anyone at the fund.  The latest lawsuit comes as Najib prepares for a elections, which sources say he hopes to call in the second half of the year to cement his position following a purge of dissenters within his party. He has dismissed calls from opponents and activists to step down and make way for a full inquiry into the scandal. An investigation by Malaysia's top attorney found no wrongdoing by Najib. Diamonds, Paintings and Movies U.S. authorities, in civil complaints, have accused Malaysian financier Jho Low of laundering more than $400 million stolen from 1MDB through an account in the United States, where he lavished his associates, including DiCaprio, with money to gamble and luxury goods.  U.S. authorities have not charged Low with any crime. Authorities said that in 2014, Low used $3.2 million diverted from a 1MDB bond sale to buy a Picasso painting for DiCaprio.  Dear Leonardo DiCaprio, Happy belated Birthday! This gift is for you,  a friend of Low's wrote in a note.  DiCaprio has not been accused of any crime. FILE PHOTO: A construction worker talks on the phone in front of a 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) billboard at the Tun Razak Exchange development in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, February 3, 2016.Olivia Harris/File PhotoA spokesman for DiCaprio on Thursday said that the actor had recently begun proceedings to transfer ownership of the Picasso to the U.S. government. The spokesman said that DiCaprio in July 2016 had  initiated the return  of gifts he had received from financiers connected to the 1MDB case after authorities made allegations against people involved in financing the 2013 film  The Wolf of Wall Street,  which starred DiCaprio.  It is one of three Hollywood films that the Justice Department says were funded with tens of millions of dollars stolen from 1MDB by Jho Low.  The spokesman said that DiCaprio had accepted the gifts to raise funds in an auction for his environmental foundation. The three films were produced by Red Granite, which was founded by Najib's stepson, Riza Aziz. The other two films are  Dumb and Dumber To,  a 2014 comedy starring Jim Carrey, and the 2015 film  Daddy's Home  starring Will Ferrell.  Slideshow (2 Images)The Justice Department's filing on Thursday seeks the rights to those films, after moving last year to seize rights to  The Wolf of Wall Street.  Red Granite said in a statement it was in discussions with the Justice Department  aimed at resolving these civil cases and is fully cooperating.     DiCaprio's spokesman also said that the actor had returned an Oscar won by actor Marlon Brando that was given to him by Red Granite  to thank him for his work on The Wolf of Wall Street.  DiCaprio's charitable foundation last October said that any gifts or donations made to the actor or his ventures would be returned if they were found to have come from 1MDB.  The Justice Department filing on Thursday also alleged that Low also used $9.2 million diverted from 1MDB bond sales to buy a collage made by New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat that was also given to DiCaprio.  DiCaprio and Low signed a note in March 2014 absolving the star of  any liability whatsoever resulting directly or indirectly from these art-work,  according to the filings. Low, in an emailed statement sent via a representative, said the Justice Department (DOJ) continued its  inappropriate efforts  to seize assets.  This week's activity from the DOJ is a further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case,  Low said. Rasky Partners, a public relations firm that emailed his statement, could not be immediately reached by phone. Other purchases with the misappropriated funds included a yacht and jewelry worth $200 million purchased from various companies around the world. Nearly $30 million of those funds was used to buy jewelry for Najib's wife, according to the U.S. Justice Department filing. An aide to the prime minister's wife, Rosmah Mansor, did not respond to requests for comment. Fraud allegations against 1MDB go back to 2009, the Justice Department said, and the fund is subject to money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland and Singapore.

Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern said on Wednesday his Social Democratic Party (SPO) was renouncing its 30-year ban on national coalitions with the Freedom Party (FPO) and instead adopting a set of terms that any coalition partner must meet. An Oct. 15 parliamentary election is shaping up to be a three-horse race between those parties and the SPO's junior coalition partner, the conservative People's Party (OVP), which is leading in opinion polls. The OVP and SPO are at loggerheads, increasing the FPO's chances of allying with either of them. The SPO's new terms include both a  values compass  of principles - including support for the European Union, human rights and gender equality - that any partner must meet and a list of policies it wants to include in any coalition deal.  It is formulated in such a way that it could not be a reason to exclude any party in parliament,  FPO deputy leader Norbert Hofer said in an interview with newspaper Der Standard, referring to the SPO's broad set of principles. He also did not dismiss the more specific list of policies, which includes raising the minimum wage to 1,500 euros ($1,676) a month and, more problematically for the FPO, taxing inheritances of more than 1 million euros.   It is in reality nothing insurmountable,  said Hofer, who came close to winning last year's presidential election.  Kern has said his party and the FPO are far apart on issues including gender equality, taxation and integration. Hofer did not address all those points but said common ground might be found.  On the whole we do not like new taxes,  Hofer said, adding that since the inheritance tax plan was aimed at funding public healthcare, that could be achieved through savings instead.  There is great potential in terms of possibilities to make means available by better organizing the state,  he added. The FPO is short on specific economic policy proposals but generally rails against the taxation level while supporting the generous welfare state. Hofer said it was too soon to go into detail on what talks might take place after October's snap election.  We do not want to say beforehand but see how the election goes,  he said.

The assets include a Picasso painting given to actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the rights to two Hollywood films, the department said. The filing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles was the Justice Department's latest step in a long-running case over an alleged conspiracy to launder money misappropriated from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund, known as 1MDB, which was set up by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009 to promote economic development. In the complaints, which are all civil actions, the Justice Department alleged that more than $4.5 billion was taken from 1MDB by high-level fund officials and their associates.  We simply will not allow the United States to be a place where corrupt individuals can expect to hide assets and lavishly spend money that should be used for the benefit of citizens of other nations,  Kenneth Blanco, acting assistant attorney general, said in a statement on Thursday.  1MDB said on Friday that it is not a party to the civil lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and had never been contacted in relation to the case. Najib has denied taking money from 1MDB or any other entity for personal gain, after it was reported that investigators traced nearly $700 million to bank accounts that were allegedly in his name. In response to the latest lawsuit, a spokesman for Najib said the lawsuits raised concerns about  the unnecessary and gratuitous naming of certain matters and individuals that are only relevant to domestic political manipulation and interference .  This suggests a motivation that goes beyond the objective of seizing assets,  Najib's press secretary, Tengku Sariffuddin, said in a statement, adding that unproven allegations should not be taken as fact. Malaysia attorney general's office said in an emailed statement that Malaysian authorities had discovered no crime committed by anyone at the fund.  The latest lawsuit comes as Najib prepares for a elections, which sources say he hopes to call in the second half of the year to cement his position following a purge of dissenters within his party. He has dismissed calls from opponents and activists to step down and make way for a full inquiry into the scandal. An investigation by Malaysia's top attorney found no wrongdoing by Najib. Diamonds, Paintings and Movies U.S. authorities, in civil complaints, have accused Malaysian financier Jho Low of laundering more than $400 million stolen from 1MDB through an account in the United States, where he lavished his associates, including DiCaprio, with money to gamble and luxury goods.  U.S. authorities have not charged Low with any crime. Authorities said that in 2014, Low used $3.2 million diverted from a 1MDB bond sale to buy a Picasso painting for DiCaprio.  Dear Leonardo DiCaprio, Happy belated Birthday! This gift is for you,  a friend of Low's wrote in a note.  DiCaprio has not been accused of any crime. FILE PHOTO: A construction worker talks on the phone in front of a 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) billboard at the Tun Razak Exchange development in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, February 3, 2016.Olivia Harris/File PhotoA spokesman for DiCaprio on Thursday said that the actor had recently begun proceedings to transfer ownership of the Picasso to the U.S. government. The spokesman said that DiCaprio in July 2016 had  initiated the return  of gifts he had received from financiers connected to the 1MDB case after authorities made allegations against people involved in financing the 2013 film  The Wolf of Wall Street,  which starred DiCaprio.  It is one of three Hollywood films that the Justice Department says were funded with tens of millions of dollars stolen from 1MDB by Jho Low.  The spokesman said that DiCaprio had accepted the gifts to raise funds in an auction for his environmental foundation. The three films were produced by Red Granite, which was founded by Najib's stepson, Riza Aziz. The other two films are  Dumb and Dumber To,  a 2014 comedy starring Jim Carrey, and the 2015 film  Daddy's Home  starring Will Ferrell.  Slideshow (2 Images)The Justice Department's filing on Thursday seeks the rights to those films, after moving last year to seize rights to  The Wolf of Wall Street.  Red Granite said in a statement it was in discussions with the Justice Department  aimed at resolving these civil cases and is fully cooperating.     DiCaprio's spokesman also said that the actor had returned an Oscar won by actor Marlon Brando that was given to him by Red Granite  to thank him for his work on The Wolf of Wall Street.  DiCaprio's charitable foundation last October said that any gifts or donations made to the actor or his ventures would be returned if they were found to have come from 1MDB.  The Justice Department filing on Thursday also alleged that Low also used $9.2 million diverted from 1MDB bond sales to buy a collage made by New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat that was also given to DiCaprio.  DiCaprio and Low signed a note in March 2014 absolving the star of  any liability whatsoever resulting directly or indirectly from these art-work,  according to the filings. Low, in an emailed statement sent via a representative, said the Justice Department (DOJ) continued its  inappropriate efforts  to seize assets.  This week's activity from the DOJ is a further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case,  Low said. Rasky Partners, a public relations firm that emailed his statement, could not be immediately reached by phone. Other purchases with the misappropriated funds included a yacht and jewelry worth $200 million purchased from various companies around the world. Nearly $30 million of those funds was used to buy jewelry for Najib's wife, according to the U.S. Justice Department filing. An aide to the prime minister's wife, Rosmah Mansor, did not respond to requests for comment. Fraud allegations against 1MDB go back to 2009, the Justice Department said, and the fund is subject to money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland and Singapore.

But the ruling Conservative party's setback in an election last week has deepened uncertainty over Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans that included quitting the European customs union and single market, and a focus on controlling immigration.

KEY RATING DRIVERS Credit-Linked to Chengdu Municipality: CCIC's ratings are credit linked to, but not equalised with, those of Chengdu municipality. This reflects strong government oversight and supervision, the strategic importance of CCIC's public sector business and moderate integration with the municipal budget. These factors indicate the high likelihood that CCIC would receive extraordinary government support, if needed. CCIC is classified as a credit-linked public-sector entity under Fitch's criteria. Chengdu's Creditworthiness: Chengdu is the capital city of Sichuan province, located in the heart of mid-west China. The central Chinese government has projected Chengdu, together with Chongqing, as the two municipalities in the western China that bear great potential for economic development. Chengdu achieved gross regional product (GRP) growth of 7.7% in 2016, outperforming the national average by 1.0%. The city ranked eighth among all 333 Chinese municipalities by GRP in 2016. Legal Status Mid-Range: CCIC is registered as a wholly state-owned limited liability company under Chinese company law and is directly owned and supervised by the Chengdu State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The legal status is assessed at mid-range because legally speaking, CCIC can file for bankruptcy and employees are not civil servants. Strategic Importance Stronger: CCIC is the sole public-sector entity (PSE) responsible for developing the municipality's toll-road network and investing equity on behalf of Chengdu in railways and the new Tianfu international airport, making it the municipality's only comprehensive transportation PSE. Chengdu is mid-western China's transportation hub and is expanding its transportation network under China's 13th Five-Year plan. Tight Control, Supervision: CCIC is wholly owned and directly controlled by the Chengdu State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which closely monitors its financing plan and debt level, according to CCIC. CCIC says that under the company's current investment management guidelines, it requires government approval for the development of transportation networks and its board members, except for employee representatives, are appointed or nominated by the government. Integration Mid-Range: CCIC has received capital injections, operating and construction project subsidies from the Chengdu government. Part of its debt is also included in the local-government debt-swap programme. Fitch believes capital injections are likely to continue due to the capital-intensive investment plans of Chengdu's multiple transportation projects. RATING SENSITIVITIES Linkage with Municipality: Stronger or more explicit commitment of support from the Chengdu government may trigger positive rating action on CCIC. Significant changes to CCIC's strategic importance, diluted municipal shareholding and/or lower explicit and implicit governmental support could cause the rating gap between CCIC and Chengdu to widen. Municipality's Creditworthiness: An upgrade of Fitch's internal credit view on Chengdu may trigger positive rating action on CCIC. A weaker fiscal performance or higher municipal indebtedness could cause us to lower our internal assessment of Chengdu's creditworthiness and thus trigger negative rating action on CCIC.

Russian stocks rose 0.6 percent off Thursday's 16-month lows, but are down 3 percent so far this week, their worst weekly performance since mid-April. The rouble also firmed 0.2 percent against the dollar after dipping to one-month lows on Thursday, but was down over 1 percent this week. The sell-off was triggered by U.S. lawmakers moving to impose new sanctions on Russia and force President Donald Trump to get the approval of Congress before easing any existing sanctions. Oil's price fall to six-month lows compounded Russia's woes. But as oil edged higher on Friday, the rouble found a floor, ahead of a Russian central bank meeting which is expected to cut interest rates by 50 basis points.  The reason we expect a 50 bps cut is inflation fell to their target in May, and so far signs from the first quarter are that domestic demand is still soft and they have room to cut,  said Kiran Kowshik, a strategist at UniCredit.  But it's possible they could do 25 bps given how oil is trading,  he said, adding that either outcome was fine for the rouble due to the pace of disinflation. MSCI's emerging markets stocks index was steady near three-week lows hit on Thursday with gains in some European markets such as Hungary and Poland offsetting earlier losses in Asia. Chinese mainland shares fell 0.3 percent, ending the week down 1.6 percent, the first weekly fall since early May as weak producer inflation and investment data have reinforced concerns of a renewed slowdown in the world's No.2 economy. The yuan was set for its worst week since early-March, after the central bank fixed its official guidance sharply lower. Hong Kong stocks closed slightly up but have lost 1.6 percent for the week, their biggest fall in three months. Kowshik said that as fiscal stimulus promised by U.S. President Donald Trump had been delayed, there had been some selling in emerging assets that would have benefited from such extra spending. He cited South Korea, where the won fell as much as 1.2 percent before the central bank was suspected of intervening. The won ended at five-week lows. U.S. Federal Reserve signals that it may begin reducing its holdings of bonds and other securities this year is also a negative for emerging markets  The bad news for emerging markets is the Fed tapering announcement, which many people were not expecting this week,  Kowshik said.  It suggests there is a limit to how much U.S. yields can fall.  The Turkish lira weakened 0.2 percent against the dollar. The central bank left its key interest rate on hold on Thursday, despite high inflation. South Africa was closed for a public holiday but stocks ended the week down almost 3 percent, their worst performance since December. Mining stocks sold off hard on Thursday when the government revamped the sector's ownership rules. In central Europe, the Romanian leu reached a near five-year low against the euro after the ruling coalition said it would seek to topple Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu next week. But the Serbian dinar hovered near a 17-month high hit on Thursday after the president nominated Ana Brnabic as the country's first woman prime minister. She is not affiliated with any party.

Bopanna, who joined Bhupathi, Leander Paes and Sania Mirza as the latest Indian grand slam champion when he teamed up with Canadian Gabriela Dabrowski at Roland Garros, said the country should not be satisfied with winning doubles crowns. And the 37-year-old disagreed with the theory that doubles glory was a stepping stone to singles success.  If playing doubles was a shortcut to success we would have had a number of players ranked in the top 50,  Bopanna said in an interview.   There was no system in place for players to come through. Whoever did well in singles in the past did it on their own.  While Paes alone has amassed eight doubles grand slam titles to go with 10 in mixed doubles, India has had only rare glimpses of joy in singles. In the early 1960s, Ramanathan Krishnan twice reached the  singles semi-finals at Wimbledon. His son Ramesh and Vijay Amritraj both made the last eight there, as well as at the U.S. Open, and were ranked in the top 25 in the world at one point. Since then, however, the now-retired Somdev Devvarman's 62nd spot in 2011 is the highest an Indian player has been ranked in the singles.  The players, the federation, the corporates, everyone has to come together to help out for the future of Indian tennis,  Bopanna said.   That's how a sport will grow in India, when there is a system in place.   There are kids who have the potential, they only have to be guided well and supported well and we will have singles players playing at the highest level.  Foreign Coaches Bopanna said Indian players had the skills to compete at the highest level but often lacked the fitness to be successful.  We need to have a system in place at the grassroots level for the future of Indian tennis. That's one reason I have started my academy in Bengaluru,  he said, adding that he had also met India's sports minister, Vijay Goel, this week to discuss how to promote tennis in the country.   I am also bringing a couple of coaches to my academy in Bangalore from outside. One from the United Kingdom and one from Serbia. They will be there for an year at least.   I want the kids to have that opportunity to learn from experienced foreign coaches in their own country. They often spend a lot of money to get trained by foreign coaches for just one or two months, which is not of much help.  Bopanna enjoyed some memorable singles wins, including the deciding victory in the Davis Cup tie against Brazil in 2010 that brought India back into the World Group after 19 years, before completely focusing on doubles. Prior to his French Open mixed doubles success, he partnered Pakistan's Aisam-ul-haq Qureshi to a runner-up finish at the  U.S. Open men's doubles. It took Bopanna 14 years to achieve his grand slam dream after turning pro in 2003 but he said he never gave up hope.  As a sportsman if you don't have the belief then you have no motivation to really go out there and play,  said Bopanna, an ambassador of sportswear brand Zeven.   It was truly a personal goal, so there was no number to it. It didn't matter how many years it took.  It has been many years of sacrifices, discipline and commitment. Not only from my side, but from my coaches, family, friends and the team, who are working throughout. Everyone has played a huge part.

The government of Southeast Asia's biggest economy, which is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund infrastructure expansion, launched a tax amnesty scheme last year to bring back billions of dollars stashed abroad. Hong Kong's government has come under pressure after the so-called Panama Papers scandal last year, which showed that the Chinese territory was the most active center in the world for the creation of shell companies.  These shell companies have many legitimate purposes but can also be used to hide assets and evade taxes. Indonesia's Director-General of Taxes and Hong Kong's Commissioner of Inland Revenue Department had signed a  Bilateral Competent Authority Agreement , a statement issued by the Indonesian government said. Indonesia will use the financial information obtained from Hong Kong to complement its tax database,  so hopefully this will encourage Indonesian taxpayers to voluntarily fulfill their tax obligations,  the statement said. The move is in line with a global effort to boost tax transparency. An increasing number of countries have committed to the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Based on the result of Indonesia's tax amnesty program, Hong Kong was the third-biggest source of repatriated funds at 16.31 trillion rupiah ($1.23 billion). Indonesians also declared 58.15 trillion rupiah worth of assets in the Asian financial center. In 2014, Hong Kong stated its commitment to implement the AEOI on a reciprocal basis with  appropriate partners  and said it aims to start exchanging information by 2018.

With the rate of inflation at its highest in four years and showing no sign of reversing, the Bank's eight-strong Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-3 to keep rates on hold at a record low 0.25 percent. Economists had expected a 7-1 split. But the pound's boost faded, exposing the Bank's delicate balancing act: trying to shore up the currency without delivering the policy tightening that could damage an economy already slowing amid the deep uncertainty of Brexit. It's a dangerous balancing act, too, one that could put the Bank's credibility in the eyes of financial markets on the line. As the Bank itself knows only too well, once it's lost, it's extremely hard to recover. And the currency suffers. Turkey's central bank jacked up rates by more than 400 basis points, or four percentage points, in January 2014 to prevent the sliding lira from sparking massive inflation. Later that year, Russia's central bank more than doubled interest rates to 17 percent. It's not only an emerging market phenomenon, either. The Bank of England famously raised interest rates to 12 percent on 16 September, 1992 -  Black Wednesday  - and spent billions of dollars of its foreign exchange reserves in a doomed attempt to defend the pound from attack. The Bank is in a bind. Economic growth is slowing, and all the incoming data show no sign of it picking up speed any time soon. Figures released just before the Bank announced its decision on Thursday showed that retail sales in May fell sharply. On Wednesday, data showed that wage growth in February-April was much weaker than expected at 2.1 percent, while inflation in May jumped to a four-year high of 2.9 percent. This means real earnings are falling at the fastest pace in three years, throwing grit in one of the economy's most powerful growth engines: consumer spending. British growth in the first quarter was the slowest of all 28 European Union nations, according to Eurostat. And if the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is right, the 1 percent growth penciled in for next year will be the lowest of all 32 nations covered in its latest outlook. Against the hugely uncertain backdrop for investment and spending stemming from Brexit, Britain's soft economic indicators point to the Bank sticking with its ultra-loose policy and sterling remaining under pressure. All bar one: inflation. The pound's 13 percent devaluation since last year's Brexit referendum has fueled the surge in inflation, and there's little sign of it reversing much any time soon. It's decimating real wage growth, eating into consumer spending and weighing on the economy at large. The growth outlook is darkening, and as Thursday's vote showed, the Bank finds itself in an increasingly tight spot. If it threatens to raise rates, sterling could steady or even rise in value, thereby easing the upward pressure on inflation. The erosion of real earnings would stop, potentially providing a springboard for a rebound in consumer spending. This would be the ideal scenario for the Bank. But it only works as long as the $5 trillion-a-day currency market believes that, if the push comes to the shove, the Bank will raise rates. If not, sterling will likely come under immediate and sustained attack. A fall towards $1.20 would be more on the cards than a test of $1.30 again. In that scenario, with inflation already nudging 3 percent, the Bank's current dilemma will seem like a picnic in comparison.

Chinese leaders have pledged to open the world's second-largest economy wider to foreign investors but a negative list specifying the areas off limits to foreign capital is in place for its eleven free trade zones, which enjoy looser trade and financial regulations on a trial basis.  Among the beneficiaries of the new negative list across more than 20 industries are foreign makers of rail transport equipment and civilian satellites, who will no longer be obliged to enter a joint venture with Chinese partners or let the Chinese side take the majority share.  Previously restricted sectors such as precious metals and lithium mining, as well as internet access services, credit rating services, and large-scale theme park construction are now open to foreign capital. Rules on banking services, which in the past forbade foreign banks from underwriting Chinese government bonds, have also been eased.  China opened its first free-trade zone in Shanghai in 2013. Since then, ten major provinces and cities such as Zhejiang and Chongqing have been approved to establish such zones. The State Council, or cabinet, this year announced an easing of curbs on foreign investment, in sectors such as banking, credit ratings and accounting. But it gave no details or timeframe for the relaxation.

World coal consumption dropped by 1.7 percent in 2016,  according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, which was published on June 13. Consumption fell by 53 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe), which equates to about 79.5 million tonnes of hard coal on an energy basis, the review said. Global production of coal plunged 6.2 percent to 3,656 mtoe, or about 5.5 billion tonnes of hard coal, the review said, the largest annual drop on record. That's the good news for efforts to curb the use of the most-polluting major global energy source. The bad news is that 2017 may well see coal output and consumption increase from last year, and as usual with most things coal, it's all about China, which accounts for about half of global consumption. China is also the world's largest producer and importer of the fuel and while the authorities in Beijing have had success in reducing coal's share of the country's energy mix, so far this year is on track to see an increase in demand. This is largely because 2016 was somewhat exceptional in China from a coal perspective, with two factors combining to lower output and demand. The first was a policy driven move to restrict production by limiting the working days of domestic mines, which was aimed at boosting prices to ensure the viability of the industry as well as curbing air pollution. If anything the policy was too successful, resulting in a 9 percent drop in output in 2016 to 3.64 billion tonnes, the third consecutive annual decline. But rapid price gains and worries over a shortage of domestic coal prompted Beijing to reverse course, allowing mines to boost output in order to ensure adequate stocks and reduce reliance on imports, which surged 25.2 percent last year. China's coal production rose 12 percent in May to 297.8 million tonnes from the same month last year, according to official data released on Wednesday. For the first five months of the year, coal output is up 4.3 percent to 1.4 billion tonnes, and a hot start to summer and low levels of inventories suggest that both domestic production and imports may rise in coming months. Weather to Boost Coal Use The weather was the other factor behind the decline in China's coal demand in 2016, with both a mild summer and winter curbing the need for electricity. If this summer does prove to be warmer than usual, it's likely that this alone will be enough to boost coal demand for the year. Imports are also still rising in China, with 111.7 million tonnes imported in the first five months of the year, up 29.6 percent from the same period in 2016. Rising imports will support coal production in China's main suppliers, Australia, Indonesia, Mongolia and Russia. If China's domestic coal output maintains the growth rate for the first five months of 2017 for the entire year, it implies production will rise by about 160 million tonnes from 2016. This is slightly less than half of what global coal output fell by in 2016, according to the BP review. It's also likely that coal output will gain in other countries, with India's state-owned producer targeting production of 660 million tonnes in the fiscal year from April 2017 to March 2018. If achieved, this would be an increase of 106 million tonnes from the 2016-17 fiscal year, but it's extremely unlikely Coal India will get anywhere near its target, if history is a guide. In 2016-17 the company fell 44 million tonnes short of its target, but still managed to produce some 25 million tonnes more than it did the prior year. Nonetheless, it's likely that India will increase output in the current year, and even an increase of the magnitude achieved in 2016-17 will add significantly to global production. Indonesia, the world's top exporter of coal, is expected to boost output by nearly 5 percent in 2017, or about 20 million tonnes, to 460 million tonnes, according to the country's coal mining association. And if U.S. President Donald Trump has his way, coal output in the world's second-largest producer will rebound, although most analysts dismiss this as unrealistic. What is more likely is that coal output in the United States may stabilize, with higher production of coking coal used to make steel offsetting any declines in coal for power generation. Colombia, the world's fifth-largest coal exporter, plans to boost output by 4 million tonnes this year to around 95 million tonnes, a government official said on March 22. Another factor to consider with coal is price, and it's likely that part of the decline in consumption in 2016 was related to the strong rally over the year. The Asian benchmark weekly thermal coal price at Australia's Newcastle port more than doubled from the start of 2016 to the peak of $109.69 a tonne in November. It has since slipped back to $80.79 a tonne for the week ended June 9, with this decline improving the competitiveness of coal against other generating fuels, such as natural gas. Overall, with major coal producers planning to boost output this year, it's possible that 2017 will see an increase in production and consumption, or at least a sharp slowdown in the rate of decline.

Shale firms have hired an extra 425 rigs to drill for oil since the end of May 2016, more than doubling the active rig count, oilfield services company Baker Hughes says. Producers have continued adding rigs even though benchmark oil prices have fallen almost $10 per barrel since the middle of February and are now almost $4 below year ago levels. Rigs have been added at rates comparable to the height of the shale boom between 2012 and 2014 ensuring output will continue growing significantly through the rest of 2017 and into 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts onshore production from the Lower 48 states will grow by 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and another 500,000 bpd in 2018. As a result, U.S. shale producers together with other non-OPEC suppliers are expected to capture all of the increase in global oil demand in 2018 and raise their share of the market significantly at the expense of OPEC. Shale producers and OPEC are now on a collision course, with OPEC curbing production to try to raise prices and shale drillers adding rigs to boost output. The contradiction will likely be resolved through a drop in oil prices to rein in shale growth.     Oil prices have already declined significantly to curb the drilling boom and put output on a more sustainable trajectory. Past experience shows changes in the U.S. oil rig count typically lag 15-20 weeks behind changes in WTI oil prices (tmsnrt.rs/2svJfUd). The decline in WTI prices since February should cause the rig count to level out or even start to fall sometime between the middle of June and the end of July (tmsnrt.rs/2s4kBZ8). If the rig count starts to level off or fall in the next few weeks, it could offer some support to beleaguered oil prices. However, if the rig count continues rising relentlessly, fears about overproduction will grow, and prices are likely to come under even more pressure. Many shale producers hedged a large proportion of their planned production in 2017 at prices above $50 per barrel which has given them some protection from the recent downturn. Shale firms have benefited from the plentiful availability of fresh capital from private equity investors taking an optimistic long-term view of the prospects for both prices and output. But only a small proportion of output has been hedged for 2018, which will leave shale producers progressively more exposed to low prices as existing hedges mature. The calendar strip of monthly WTI futures prices for 2018 is trading just below $47 per barrel ensuring any new hedges for 2018 executed now will be well below $50. The calendar strip for 2018 has fallen by more than $9 from its recent high over $57 per barrel at the start of the year and has fallen to its lowest level for more than a year (tmsnrt.rs/2s4ut5m). The low level of forward prices is likely to discourage hedging -- unless shale producers really are profitable at much lower prices, or fear prices will slide even further. Eventually the reduction of both spot and forward prices should curb the drilling boom, which will in turn provide a floor for oil prices. But until the boom shows real signs of moderating, oil prices are likely to remain under pressure.  Edited by David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shale-kemp-idUSKBN197052"},

But even with the seemingly back-and-forth weather models, large global supplies may keep the lid on any potential seasonal rally in Chicago corn futures this summer. Corn futures hit the highest price on a continuous chart in nearly a year last Thursday on a warmer and drier outlook. Forecasts started trending wetter over the weekend and futures declined again this week, hitting two-week lows during Thursday’s session. But the market’s hypersensitivity to weather was brought into focus again late in Thursday’s trade, as the midday model update showed much warmer and drier weather in the next two weeks for parts of the Midwest than was previously expected, and corn futures closed well off the day’s lows, aided by strength in wheat. Hedge funds entered this growing season holding unusually bearish positions in corn futures and options, which prompted many analysts to warn of the potential for an explosive short-covering rally should yield concerns surface. But plentiful domestic and global supply has led to muted market action. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that by the end of 2016/17, the world will be sitting on its largest-ever corn stockpile, capped off by a 43 percent year-on-year increase in output from major exporters Brazil and Argentina. The stateside supply will be the largest in 30 years. There is still a lot of the growing season to get through, as the U.S. corn harvest does not begin until September. But unless iron-clad proof comes along that corn yields will fall more than a couple percentage points below the long-term trend, another meaningful rally in futures this summer may remain out of reach. Stubborn Reactions When the USDA has published major reports this year, those release dates have failed to produce any significant moves in corn, soybean, or wheat futures relative to past years. The huge global supplies are widely to blame. Through May, the price swings that followed USDA’s monthly supply and demand reports, acreage estimates and quarterly stocks views were down 26.88 percent from 2016, and the daily price moves on report days so far in 2017 are 45.83 percent below the 10-year average, according to Reuters data. Granted the 2017 reports have not exactly dropped stunners on the market, but traders may have been able to justify a slightly more bullish take on corn if the world were not awash with it – especially with lower-than-expected U.S. acres and sharply decreasing global supply into 2018.  Dampened volatility amid the global supply glut has led to declining profits for the world’s largest grain merchants. And price gains could be even further limited in the coming weeks as some domestic corn end users are stocked through July in the wake of last week’s farmer selling spree.  Speculative investors have been left largely indecisive over what to do with the yellow grain as supplies are ample, but a shaky start to the U.S. growing season and constantly changing weather models have raised legitimate concerns. Money managers began drastically shedding their net bearish corn view in the first week of June. But just over half of this move was attributable to new longs in the market, meaning that the short covering – despite it being the largest round since February – was not the leading driver. In the week ended June 6, funds extended their outright corn longs by 16 percent over the prior week while cutting back on outright shorts by only 7 percent. With speculators still holding a record number of short positions for the time of year as of last Tuesday, it is clear that many are not as eager to budge on their views.  Clarity Nears The next three to four weeks historically can be some of the most volatile of the year for corn futures, as four of the last five years have featured gains in the July contract of more than 5 percent beginning June 1 through expiration. The recent rally topped out at 4.66 percent above the June 1 price on Friday. Unless there are obvious issues with the crop and firm reason to believe the harvest will come up short, corn futures often have a harder time rallying in late July and August since traders have a better handle on yield potential at that time. The July 4 holiday in the United States often marks a turning point in the season, as focus shifts entirely to weather and yields. And with an extra day off from trading, there is plenty of time for the weather models to trend off into a different direction, which is why the evening model runs on July 4 are so closely followed as they set the tone for the next day – or longer. If corn conditions have improved and are stable by the time USDA issues the first crop progress report of next month on July 5, speculators are going to feel more comfortable with the bearish stance – especially if the forward weather forecasts are benign – and the chances for higher futures prices this summer become slimmer. But first the market will have to process another round of major USDA reports on June 30 with the acreage and quarterly stock estimates. There are some ideas that total corn acres could go lower after some regions experienced planting troubles in the spring, but so far there is no evidence that these reports might drastically change the market’s current thinking.

The government of Southeast Asia's biggest economy, which is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund infrastructure expansion, launched a tax amnesty scheme last year to bring back billions of dollars stashed abroad. Hong Kong's government has come under pressure after the so-called Panama Papers scandal last year, which showed that the Chinese territory was the most active center in the world for the creation of shell companies.

The move is in line with a global effort to boost tax transparency. An increasing number of countries have committed to the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

On Friday, executives from the top three exchanges - Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange, Shanghai Futures Exchange and Dalian Commodity Exchange - reeled off 14 products from fruit to chemicals to power that they are studying as possible candidates for new derivatives.  The race to introduce contracts, designed to help farmers, utilities and steel mills protect against big price swings, comes as Beijing aims to be a major hub for exchange-based trading and prepares to prise open long-closed markets in the world's second-largest economy to foreign investors.  The plans for futures such as dates, apple, anthracite (coal) fit into China's plan to develop its real economy,  said Liu Jin, director of research at COFCO Futures.    We are seeing market regulators decreasing the varieties of financial futures and increasing the number of commodities futures.  A record 4.14 billion futures contracts traded last year, up 16 percent from 2015, according to China Futures Association.     The moves will stir the debate over the role of speculators, who have caused wild gyrations in everything from steel to eggs to corn in recent years, as well as the heavy-handed intervention by regulators which may scare off some players. A variety of obscure futures contracts already traded in China, like glass, silicomanganese, and bitumen, offer price discovery and a gauge on industrial activity in the country. Many of the contracts discussed on Friday have been in the works for a while and complement existing domestic and international markets - SHFE's long-awaited crude oil contract could be a serious contender on the global market and Dalian has been looking at stainless steel and scrap contracts for a year to expand its metals offering. Anthracite would fit alongside Zhenzhou's thermal coal futures, which have attracted more liquidity since its launch two years ago. China is the world's top buyer of the fuel. Others like red dates are niche, low in volume and unique to China - dates are one of the nation's favorite fruits, a staple in tea and porridge and considered crucial for health while cashmere, apples and silk point to China's role as the world's top producer.

The prime minister's younger brother and sister, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, said on Wednesday they had lost confidence in Lee Hsien Loong and feared that the state's organs would be used against them. Lee Hsien Yang said he and his wife, the lawyer Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and threatened. A timeline issued by the prime minister's lawyers and published on Facebook late on Thursday shows that the three children of Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled the country for three decades, have been battling over the will for several years.The biggest issue has been over the future of the house that their father lived in for most of his life. Before Lee died in March 2015, he made it public that he wanted the home near the bustling Orchard Road shopping district to be demolished rather than turned into some kind of museum. But Lee Hsien Loong said in the six-page timeline that the fifth and sixth versions of the will had removed a clause about the demolition, and it was only reinserted in the final will, the seventh version. He questioned whether Lee Kuan Yew knew the clause was re-inserted, saying there was no evidence that he did. Related CoverageFeud within Singapore's first family leads to outpouring of concern on social mediaPossible Conflict of Interest  The prime minister questioned the role his brother's wife, Lee Suet Fern, may have played in his father's last will. He said that she  was involved in the preparation and/or signing of the Last Will  and that given her husband was a beneficiary this appeared to be a conflict of interest. He also said that there had been another major change between the sixth and the last will. In the sixth will, Lee Kuan Yew had given his daughter Lee Wei Ling a greater share of the estate than his two sons.  However, in the last will they all got equal shares, and after that was drawn up the prime minister said in the timeline that Lee Wei Ling told the prime minister's wife Ho Ching in an email that she didn't trust Lee Suet Fern because of her great influence on her husband, Lee Hsien Yang. Late on Thursday, Lee Wei Ling indicated in a Facebook posting that she still supported Lee Hsien Yang and his wife Lee Suet Fern.  Hsien Loong and (his wife) Ho Ching are being mischievious and dishonest to selectively use quotes from me out of context to suggest that Hsien Yang and his wife were trying to cheat me in our father’s final will,  Lee Wei Ling wrote.  There was no duplicity by Hsien Yang and his wife, Suet Fern.  Lee Hsien Yang responded on social media, saying his brother's allegations are false.  Hsien Loong raised no legal challenge to Lee Kuan Yew's will in the many months after it was read. Probate was granted in Oct 2015, so the will is full, final, and legally binding,  Lee Hsien Yang posted on his Facebook.  Hsien Loong should not use a committee of his subordinates to allege what he did not dare to allege in court,  he said, asking how Lee Kuan Yew would not have known about any changes when he initialed right beneath the demolition clause. The prime minister said he didn't challenge the will in court because he wanted to avoid a public fight.

The filings lodged at the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday did not identify Prime Minister Najib Razak or his wife Rosmah Mansor by name, but said the jewelry purchases were for the wife of 'Malaysian Official 1'. Malaysian and U.S. government sources have previously confirmed that 'Malaysian Official 1' refers to Najib. The diamond necklace set alone cost $27.3 million, according to latest filings in a lawsuit that was launched in July last year. The accusations will provide further ammunition for Najib's political rivals, who often criticise his wife for lavish spending, and come at an awkward time for the Malaysian leader, as he had been expected to call a snap election later this year. Rosmah's aide did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The prime minister's office, in a statement early on Friday, said it was  concerned by the unnecessary and gratuitous naming of certain matters and individuals that are only relevant to domestic political manipulation and interference.  Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing. A total of $4.5 billion have been misappropriated from 1MDB, the Justice Department said on Thursday. The fund was set up by Najib in 2009 to promote economic development. The department is seeking to seize a total of about $1.7 billion in assets that were bought with misappropriated funds, including a Picasso painting that was given to actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the rights to two Hollywood films.  This money financed the lavish lifestyles of the alleged co-conspirators at the expense and detriment of the Malaysian people,  acting U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco said in a statement. The jewelry purchases were arranged by Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, who was also accused of gifting DiCaprio a $3.2 million Picasso. A spokesman for DiCaprio on Thursday said that the actor had begun proceedings to transfer ownership of the Picasso to the U.S. government, having in July 2016  initiated the return  of gifts he had received from financiers connected to the 1MDB case. Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, could not be reached for comment. In an emailed statement through a representative, Low said the Justice Department's actions were  a further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case.   The U.S. Department of Justice's latest move continues its inappropriate efforts to seize assets despite not having proven that any improprieties have occurred,  the statement read. Rasky Partners, a public relations firm that emailed his statement, could not be immediately reached by phone. Najib's Bank Account The lawsuits show the jewelry for Rosmah was bought with funds that passed through Najib's account. The jewelry, like the Picasso painting, was purchased with funds traceable to diverted proceeds from a 2013 bond offering by 1MDB, according to the filings. The diamond necklace was bought in 2013, just months after $680 million was transferred to the private bank account of Najib in Kuala Lumpur, the filings show. The Malaysian government says that money came from a member of the Saudi royal family. The necklace was purchased from New York jeweler Lorraine Schwartz, who has designed for Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Lopez and other stars of the entertainment world.  Need a 18 carrot (carat) pink heart diamond vivid or slightly short of vivid. On diamond necklace urgent,  Low said in a text message to Schwartz in June 2013, the filings said. A month later Schwartz showed the necklace in Monaco to a group of people, including Rosmah, onboard Topaz, one of the largest private yachts in the world. Low had chartered the 147-meter yacht for seven days in early July 2013, according to the filings. Rosmah and Low met with Schwartz again at a hotel in New York in September that year, when Najib was in New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly. The necklace was eventually delivered to an unnamed friend of Rosmah's in 2014 in Hong Kong, who then handed it over to Rosmah in Kuala Lumpur, the filings said. Low also arranged for the purchase of 27 pieces of jewelry – worth a total of $1.3 million – for Rosmah in 2014. The lawsuits also describe how Low spent about $9 million in 2014 buying jewelry for Australian model Miranda Kerr. Low bought a necklace with a 11.72 carat heart-shaped diamond for $1.29 million, with Kerr's initials  MK  inscribed on the back. The necklace was given to Kerr as a Valentine's Day gift, according to the lawsuit. Later that same year, Low bought a 8.88-carat pink heart diamond pendant worth $4.8 million, also as a gift for Kerr. Reuters was unable to immediately contact Kerr, who married Snapchat cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel late last month.

Partly a response to Moscow's actions in Poland's eastern neighbor Ukraine, the  Concept of Defense of the Republic of Poland  aims to enable Warsaw to resist any possible Russian aggression without having to rely so much on help from the thousands of U.S. and other NATO troops already based in Poland.     But the plan risks alienating Poland's allies, could allow Russia to exploit new weaknesses and may prove financially ruinous for Warsaw, NATO diplomats, security analysts and some in the Polish military and government say.     In no more than 12 years Poland will be able to defend itself with its own armed forces,  Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said when presenting the strategy in late May. The right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) government's strategy essentially focuses on what it sees as Russia's goal to  create a new international order . It assumes a prolonged  aggressive stance  from Moscow towards Poland and its allies. Macierewicz has accused Poland's previous centrist government of underestimating threats from Russia, which in 2014 annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. He has also stressed the need to boost the domestic defense industry, scrapping some earlier plans to buy equipment including drones from abroad.  Absolutely Unrealistic  About a quarter of the Polish top brass has quit since PiS swept to power in late 2015, citing disagreements with Macierewicz over personnel and other decisions. Even within the government not all are convinced by the new military strategy and its emphasis on Poland's ability to defend itself, alone if necessary, from foreign aggression.   Self-sufficiency? How? This is absolutely unrealistic,  one government official told Reuters.  Do we really want to send a message to our NATO allies that we don't care about them?  In Brussels, the NATO alliance has not publicly commented  on Poland's change of tack but privately officials are wary, with one saying:  No one can stop any member country from shooting itself in the foot. The consequences of that will be apparent when something really collapses.  Poland's armed forces have suffered from decades of under-investment and some two-thirds of their equipment still dates from the Soviet era, but Macierewicz scrapped much of the previous government's modernization program. That program had envisaged, among other things, buying 70 multi-task helicopters, with deliveries starting next year.      FILE PHOTO: U.S. soldiers attend welcoming ceremony for U.S.-led NATO troops at polygon near Orzysz, Poland, April 13, 2017.Kacper Pempel/File PhotoBut the PiS government broke off a 13.5 billion zlotys deal signed with European planemaker Airbus to supply some of those helicopters. It now says they are no longer a priority. The government still expects by the end of 2017 to sign a $7.6 billion deal with U.S. firm Raytheon to buy eight Patriot missile defense systems, but a person close to the talks said the deadline was no longer realistic.      The lack of army modernization is the biggest problem right now,  Waldemar Skrzypczak, a general who resigned as an adviser to the defense ministry earlier this year, told Reuters.  The government has also dismayed some military experts by taking the unusual step of moving its modern, German-made battle tanks away from its western border and sending them to Warsaw, closer to Russia. In their place are now ageing Soviet-era tanks that regularly break down and are difficult to maneuver.  U.S. soldiers attend the final day of NATO Saber Strike exercises in Orzysz, Poland, June 16, 2017.Ints KalninsMoving the German-made tanks to Warsaw requires equipping the base there with the infrastructure and trained personnel to operate them. That would take about two years and means that in case of a sudden attack, Poland would not be able to use them, the experts said.     Moscow strongly denies any plans to invade Poland or the Baltic republics and instead accuses NATO of threatening stability in Europe with its troop maneuvers in the region. More Cash Poland, already one of only five NATO members to meet the alliance's defense spending target of 2 percent of national output, now aims to raise spending to 2.5 percent by 2030, assuming positive economic growth. That would mean a near doubling in real terms to about 80 billion zlotys ($21.50 billion).     Such an ambition is likely to impress Trump when he visits Warsaw next month. At a NATO summit last month the U.S. president was publicly critical of allies who fail to meet the 2 percent target. Among several planned new acquisitions, Warsaw aims to buy two squadrons of Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters that each costs at least $100 million.    Critics of the Polish government's ambitious plans say they lack a clear time frame and proper costing. Poland is required along with other European Union member states to keep its budget deficit under 3 percent of national output, but Macierewicz's ministry has proposed a draft bill that would not limit how much is spent on specific programs.  Is this all realistic? Absolutely not,  said Marek Swierczynski, a security analyst at Polityka Insight, a pro-European think-tank based in Warsaw.      If we added up all the items on the wish list we would be talking about a colossal amount.

The talks in Washington will involve U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis as well as  China's top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, and General Fang Fenghui, chief of state of the People’s Liberation Army, the U.S. State Department said. It will be the inaugural session of the U.S.-China  Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, a framework launched by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during a summit in Florida in April. The State Department said the aim was  to expand areas of cooperation while narrowing differences on key diplomatic and security issues.  U.S.-China ties have warmed since the April summit, in spite of continued U.S. concerns about China's pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and a large trade imbalance.      Tillerson has said North Korea will top the agenda next week and made clear that Washington wanted more help from China in pressing Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs, calling Chinese efforts so far  notable  but  uneven.  The focus on North Korea has been sharpened by dozens of North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests since the beginning of last year.  North Korea says it is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, and this week Mattis called it the  most urgent  threat to U.S. national security. China is party to U.N. economic sanctions on North Korea.  But it remains the country's main ally and trading partner and has been reluctant to impose the sort of punishing measures experts say are needed to get Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs. In Beijing, asked about the talks, China's foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said,  The two sides are in close communication about the schedule, but the issues discussed will be those that both countries are concerned about and that involve China-U.S. relations.  He did not elaborate. On Tuesday, Tillerson said Washington was considering imposing  secondary sanctions  on foreign firms doing business with North Korea and had been in discussions with Beijing about the activities of entities inside China. A Washington think tank said this week that North Korea's effort to circumvent sanctions was complex but could be defeated by targeting relatively few Chinese firms. The U.N. Security Council expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea this month in the first such resolution agreed by the United States and China since Trump took office. Washington has been pushing for even tougher steps, including an oil embargo, bans of North Korea's airline and overseas workers and interception of its cargo ships.

(BWH) at 'A+'. The Outlooks are Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The rating actions follow Fitch's periodic review of the Macao banks. Fitch views Macao's short-term banking sector outlook as less negative than our assessment in the last year, on the back of an improving economy, which had contracted in 2015 and 2016. Fitch is forecasting Macao's growth to pick up to 5.0% in 2017 (1Q17: 10.3%), supported by a recovery in gaming revenue, which is expected to grow by 12% in 2017. The medium-term trend on Macao banks' operating environment remains challenging and potentially volatile, but is also less negative than what we have previously assessed. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND SUPPORT RATING ICBC Macau's IDRs are aligned with those of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC; A/Stable/bb), reflecting a very high probability that support would be provided to the bank by its 89.3% shareholder. ICBC's ability to provide support is indicated by the bank's IDR, which in turn is driven by Fitch's opinion that the Chinese authorities would very likely support it in the event of stress, and that state support would also include ICBC Macau. ICBC Macau plays an important role in the Greater China strategy of ICBC, providing offshore cross-border financing services to Chinese corporates. We view that a default of ICBC Macau would pose a high reputational risk to ICBC, given the subsidiary's strong strategic and business integration with the parent and their shared brand identity. Strong ordinary support from ICBC is also evidenced from its periodic capital injections and subscription of subordinated debt issued by ICBC Macau. BWH's ratings are driven by Fitch's expectation of support from its ultimate parent, Singapore-based Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC; AA-/Stable/aa-). That reflects our assessment of OCBC's strong ability and high propensity to support BWH as it complements OCBC's Greater China strategy. The banks share a similar brand identity and the level of operational integration between BWH, its immediate Hong Kong-based parent OCBC Wing Hang Bank Ltd (WHB; A+/Positive/a-) and OCBC continues to improve, with BWH contributing 17.3% to WHB's net profit in 2016. However, Fitch sees only moderate business synergies between the Macao bank and OCBC, which has resulted in Fitch maintaining a one-notch difference between the IDRs of BWH and OCBC for now. The Stable Outlooks of the two banks mirror those of their respective ultimate parents. Fitch does not assign Viability Ratings to ICBC Macau and BWH as both banks' operations and risks are tightly controlled by their parents and both significantly benefit from their parents' franchise. SUBORDINATED DEBT (ICBC MACAU) ICBC Macau's legacy subordinated debt is rated one notch below its IDR to reflect higher loss severity relative to senior unsecured debt. The IDR is used as the anchor rating because Fitch believes ICBC would likely extend support to repay the subordinated debt, if required. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SUPPORT RATINGS The banks' IDRs and SRs are sensitive to changes in assumptions around the ability and propensity of their respective parents to provide support in a timely manner. Our view on ICBC's and OCBC's ability is fully described in  Fitch Affirms China's 5 State Banks at 'A' , dated 23 May 2017 and  Fitch Affirms Major Singapore Banks at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable , dated 25 May 2017, available at www.fitchratings.com. Our view on ICBC's propensity to support ICBC Macau could change negatively if its role and integration with the parent were to significantly weaken.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The PayNet Small Business Lending index rose to 120.1 from 118.7 in March. The index was up 1 percent compared to a year ago, the first annual gain in 16 months.  When these small businesses are investing and expanding, that means that there's lift in the overall economy,  said PayNet President Bill Phelan. The index of medium-sized firms pulled back to 233.0 in April from 242.3 after rising for the previous five months in a row. Among the small businesses, industries tied to consumer spending fared best, including the retail sector, which rose to 182.2 from 180.8, and the professional services sector, which increased to 399.6 from 396.1. Still, the sustainability of growth in the economy remains fragile with sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale remaining lackluster, said Phelan. The overall financial health of small companies remained strong, with the 30-day delinquency rate edging down to 1.09 percent from 1.10 percent. The number of firms that were 90 days or more behind held steady at 0.35 percent.

On Friday, executives from the top three exchanges - Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange, Shanghai Futures Exchange and Dalian Commodity Exchange - reeled off 14 products from fruit to chemicals to power that they are studying as possible candidates for new derivatives.  The race to introduce contracts, designed to help farmers, utilities and steel mills protect against big price swings, comes as Beijing aims to be a major hub for exchange-based trading and prepares to prise open long-closed markets in the world's second-largest economy to foreign investors.  The plans for futures such as dates, apple, anthracite (coal) fit into China's plan to develop its real economy,  said Liu Jin, director of research at COFCO Futures.    We are seeing market regulators decreasing the varieties of financial futures and increasing the number of commodities futures.  A record 4.14 billion futures contracts traded last year, up 16 percent from 2015, according to China Futures Association.     The moves will stir the debate over the role of speculators, who have caused wild gyrations in everything from steel to eggs to corn in recent years, as well as the heavy-handed intervention by regulators which may scare off some players. A variety of obscure futures contracts already traded in China, like glass, silicomanganese, and bitumen, offer price discovery and a gauge on industrial activity in the country. Many of the contracts discussed on Friday have been in the works for a while and complement existing domestic and international markets - SHFE's long-awaited crude oil contract could be a serious contender on the global market and Dalian has been looking at stainless steel and scrap contracts for a year to expand its metals offering. Anthracite would fit alongside Zhenzhou's thermal coal futures, which have attracted more liquidity since its launch two years ago. China is the world's top buyer of the fuel. Others like red dates are niche, low in volume and unique to China - dates are one of the nation's favorite fruits, a staple in tea and porridge and considered crucial for health while cashmere, apples and silk point to China's role as the world's top producer.  Varieties of dates are very different from region to region in China, so it is not easy to have a standard product for delivery,  said Meng Jinhui, analyst with Shengda Futures.

The 22-year-old man, surnamed Xu, was among those killed in the blast near the entrance to the kindergarten in Xuzhou, a city in the coastal province of Jiangsu, police said in a briefing shown on state television. The official Xinhua news agency said police were considering the act a  criminal offense . Xu had dropped out of an unnamed school due to his neurological condition and rented an apartment near the kindergarten, China Central Television said.  Self-made explosive device materials were found in his apartment, and on the walls in many places were handwritten words such as kill, death, destroy and terminate,  it said.  Two people died at the scene of the blast and six more died from their injuries in hospital. Xinhua reported on Thursday night that eight people were in a critical condition. Pictures circulating on Chinese social media showed about a dozen women and children lying on the ground in what appeared to be the immediate aftermath of the blast. Security personnel gather at the scene of an explosion at a kindergarten in Fengxian County in Jiangsu Province, China June 16, 2017.Aly SongOne video showed an injured woman with scorched clothing staggering unsteadily, while others sat on a floor holding crying children in their arms. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos. None of those injured were children or teachers, Xinhua said.     Slideshow (4 Images) When I arrived, the scene was messy, both adults and children were lying on the ground. I felt very scared,  a local shopkeeper Wei Xunying, who rushed to the site, told Reuters on Friday. China's Ministry of Education issued a statement demanding that education officials strengthen security around schools to ensure the safety of students and teachers.  Local authorities said that contrary to early reports the blast did not occur while parents were picking up children after school, according to the People's Daily. Explosives are relatively easy to obtain in China, home to the world's largest mining and fireworks industries. Violent crime is rare in China compared with many other countries, but there have been a series of knife and axe attacks in recent years, many targeting children.

Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said there was  some distance  to achieving the BOJ's inflation target of 2 percent, adding that it was  inappropriate  to say how the Bank would exit its massive stimulus programme. That ran contrary to market speculation in the past month that the BoJ could be considering its own plan for eventually withdrawing emergency stimulus for the economy, and the yen fell as much as 0.4 percent to 111.380 yen per dollar.  The BoJ seems definitely stuck in its very loose monetary policy as deflationary pressures are still important,  Swissquote analyst Yann Quelenn said in a note to clients.  Japan, in the medium-term, will try to expand the monetary policy divergence with the US in order to help reduce pressures on its currency. Yet we consider that the US economy is overestimated and may trigger again inflow towards the Japanese yen.  Those moves came as the dollar was edging down from two-week highs hit since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and stuck to its guns on the likelihood of further moves this year. The index that measures the greenback's broader strength was less than 0.1 percent lower on the day at 97.401, but still set for its second weekly gain on the trot. A round of poor economic data has undermined market expectations for the scale of future U.S. rate rises and is likely to continue to weigh on the greenback.  I hear nothing from the Fed that seeks to dissuade the market from thinking that we're heading towards an extremely low peak in rates. And I think that's what's going to cap the dollar now,  said Kit Juckes, currency strategist with Societe Generale in London.  The more interesting question is, will the communication be that there's another one (hike) coming in the fall.  The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.1169, but still more than a cent below a seven-month peak of $1.1296 hit before the Fed's decision on Wednesday. Thursday's run of U.S. economic data gave dollar bulls some reason for cheer. The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, lower than the 242,000 that economists had predicted.  The USD appears to be driven by some re-assessment of this week’s FOMC decision as well some upbeat US manufacturing survey data on Thursday,  Credit Agricole strategists wrote in a note.

Mingzheng International Trading Limited has facilitated prohibited dollar transactions through the United States on behalf of the Foreign Trade Bank, a North Korean bank, and laundered the proceeds, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of Columbia said in a statement. The $1.9 million forfeiture action  represents one of the largest seizures of North Korean funds by the Department of Justice,  it said. The sum was transacted in 2015 by Mingzheng, based in the Chinese city of Shenyang, via wire transfers, using their Chinese bank accounts, the statement said. Mingzheng could not be immediately reached for comment In March 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department placed the Foreign Trade Bank under sanctions linked to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It described the bank as a state-owned entity that  acts as North Korea's primary foreign exchange bank,  the U.S. prosecutors' statement said.

The foreign trade bank mentioned by the United States is not on the list of U.N. sanctions for North Korea, so we oppose any country using their own so-called domestic laws to implement long arm jurisdiction,  he told a regular news briefing.

Temples get billions of dollars in annual donations and have been hit by scandals ranging from murder to sex to drugs to improper financial dealings. They have also largely eluded the junta's control as it has stamped its authority on other aspects of Thai life since a 2014 coup. Pongporn Pramsaneh, a former policeman appointed to head the government's National Office of Buddhism this year, said reform was essential to stamp out corruption.  It's a crisis of faith,  Pongporn told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.  If we don't do it today, more damage will be done in future.      Efforts to bring greater control over Buddhism have intensified since March, when the influential Dhammakaya Temple defied a three-week siege by police searching for its former abbot on money-laundering charges. He is still on the run. The temples get an estimated $3.5 billion a year in donations, according to a 2014 study. The government provides a further 4.67 billion baht ($137 million) to support temples and more than 300,000 monks. Pongporn said he would propose measures to the military-appointed parliament next week to make it a law for temples to report their assets and financial records, as well as make them publicly available for scrutiny.   It will be greatly beneficial in preventing corruption,  said Pongporn, whose agency liaises with the Sangha Supreme Council, Buddhism's governing body in Thailand. But one of the senior monks on the council, Phra Phrom Moli, said corruption should be addressed case by case and temple finances kept private.  If someone asks to know your salary, will you tell them?  he asked.  Murder and Corruption FILE PHOTO: Soldiers and Buddhist monks are seen during an inspection of the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple, in Pathum Thani province, Thailand March 10, 2017.Chaiwat Subprasom/File PhotoThe need for action had been highlighted by the recent exhumation of a 17-year-old novice murdered in a quarrel over money as well as the discovery of past corruption involving the Buddhist office itself, Pongporn said. Buddhism is one of the three traditional pillars of Thai society alongside the nation and monarchy. Theravada Buddhism is followed - to varying degrees - by more than 90 percent of people in the country of more than 67 million. Pongporn said about 80 percent of the 40,758 temples in Thailand submit their annual financial reports for archive purposes, but authorities are not allowed to scrutinize them. Slideshow (3 Images)The Dhammakaya Temple, which is Thailand's biggest, is among those that do not, he said. Another junta-appointed body, the National Reform Steering Assembly, is also pushing for financial reform of temples.  It's not enough for temples to submit their accounts, but they must be scrutinized and audited,  Borvornvate Rungrujee, one of the assembly members, told Reuters. A separate bill that appears to significantly reduce the say of the Sangha Supreme Council is also making its way through government. It would give monks chosen by the Sangha Council only three of 29 seats on the committee. Among the committee's duties would be to appoint  monk police  with legal authority to report misbehaving monks.  The bill has been approved by the council of monks and is being considered by the cabinet, Pongporn said. After that, it would need to go to parliament.  If Buddhism becomes too decadent, it will affect national security,  Pongporn said.

Hasmukh Adhia, revenue secretary at the Finance Ministry, also said rules would be issued  soon  to deter unscrupulous businesses from exploiting the tax reform to gouge customers. The biggest tax reform in India's 70-year history as an independent nation would, overnight, unify its $2-trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a single market, tearing down trade barriers between more than 30 states and territories. It would also require firms to file at least three online tax returns monthly into the GST Network, a massive IT back-end that will process up to 5 billion invoices a month. The compliance burden and the tax's complex structure - it has four main rates ranging from 5 to 28 percent - have sparked fears of initial chaos.  In particular, businesses worry that they will struggle to reconcile invoices, blocking the flow of tax credits down supply chains, forcing them to commit time and effort to resolving disputes and reworking budgets. Adhia, viewed as close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, dismissed those fears outright and ruled out a delay to a reform that has been more than a decade in the making.  Everything is ready. We will roll out on July 1,  he said in an interview at his office in North Block, a sandstone edifice in the heart of New Delhi dating from the British colonial era. Moving the Goalposts The reform represents an unprecedented exercise in fiscal federalism. A GST Council that brings together the federal and state governments has met 16 times to thrash out how the tax will work. It meets again on Sunday. The tax rates for goods and services were only worked out in recent weeks and, at the council's meeting last weekend, several were amended following complaints by businesses. Still, Adhia said, the multi-rate structure is far simpler than India's existing federal and state taxes - even if he would have preferred a flatter structure.  This is a great step for simplification - although not the ideal GST that we should have,  he said.  It is a technological marvel, as well as a fiscal marvel.  Progressive Tax The multi-rate structure of the GST exempts or imposes a low rate of tax on essential items, while the top rate of 28 percent applies to items such as consumer durables.  Adhia said the GST would be reviewed on an ongoing basis, adding that he would like to see the top rate reduced in future.  I'm not at all happy with my 28 percent slab. It's a very odd number. One should try to bring it down,  he said. Where the headline rate of tax goes up under GST, the government will be vigilant in seeking to prevent profiteering.  We will come out with our anti-profiteering rules soon,   Adhia said, without elaborating. He dismissed speculation that the GST Network might crash, or data security be compromised, after launch.  We have a contingency plan for everything - don't worry,  he said.  Every angle is secure. It is the best system.  Adhia said he expected the GST to overcome initial hiccoughs and help businesses become more efficient over time, by cutting logistics and inventory costs, freeing them to invest and grow.  The economy will become more efficient and we should see greater benefits coming to everybody,  he said.

The market is closely watching the central bank which is expected on Friday to trim its key rate and give hints on the pace of further monetary policy easing. Fifteen out of 23 analysts polled by Reuters said they expected the central bank to cut the key rate to 8.75 percent from 9.25 percent. The rate decision, due at 1030 GMT, will be accompanied by a press conference from central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina at 1200 GMT. The central bank will also present a new set of economic forecasts and is expected to raise its oil price assumption from the current level of $40 per barrel for this year. The rate cut, however, is unlikely to move the market as lower rates are fully priced in.  We think that monetary policy easing by the Bank of Russia won't have a visible impact on the rouble, which we expect to stabilise at 58 (versus the dollar) by the end of June,  Rosbank analysts said in a note. The rouble was 0.3 percent stronger against the dollar at 57.74 and was little changed at 64.5 versus the euro as of 0810 GMT. Higher oil prices, with Brent crude futures gaining 0.8 percent to $47.3 per barrel, supported Russian stocks, helping them to regain some ground after falling to levels last seen in 2016. The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 0.6 percent to 997.9 points, while the rouble-based MICEX was 0.6 percent higher at 1,829.1 points after hitting its lowest since February, 2016 of 1,774.56 the day before. The Russian market has become a victim of dashed hopes about the relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that once promised a thaw in diplomatic ties. But far from lifting sanctions, U.S. lawmakers this week voted for fresh, stickier, curbs while preventing Trump from easing existing ones. Contemplating unfavourable conditions on the stock market, Russian authorities had to put on hold a stock market sale of a 25 percent stake in Russian state shipping company Sovcomflot, which was initially planned for this week, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The firm, wholly owned by South Korea's Lotte Chemical Corp , at its IPO prospectus launch said the other backers were Great Eastern Life Assurance Malaysia Bhd, Maybank Asset Management Sdn Bhd and Maybank Islamic Asset Management Sdn Bhd. Those investors will buy 18.4 percent of shares offered in an initial public offering (IPO), or about 5.5 percent of the firm's enlarged issued share capital, Lotte Chemical Titan said. The integrated petrochemical producer plans to sell 740.4 million shares, or 30 percent of enlarged capital, in Bursa Malaysia's biggest IPO in over two years as improving commodity prices and upbeat economic growth stimulate appetite for deals. Power producer Malakoff Corp Bhd raised 2.74 billion ringgit ($642 million) in May 2015. With the ceiling IPO price set at 8 ringgit a share, Lotte Chemical Titan could raise as much as $1.4 billion. IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, on Friday reported the firm is likely to set a price of 7.80 ringgit to 8 ringgit. Lotte Chemical Titan Chairman Abdul Rahman Mamat, announcing the IPO prospectus, said the firm has been spending to increase production capacity for long-term growth.  Improvements in our operations and profitability are demonstrated in the 131 percent compound annual growth rate in our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from 2014 to 2016,  he said. The firm, which earns 70 percent of revenue at home and in Indonesia, will use the IPO proceeds to build a naphtha cracker plant in its southern neighbour. Its IPO prospectus showed net profit more than doubled to 1.32 billion ringgit in 2016, on revenue that fell 1 percent from a year prior to 8.14 billion ringgit. Also, Lotte Chemical Titan's 2009 annual report showed state-linked asset manager PNB, one of its cornerstone investors, owned 5.58 percent of its shares before Lotte Chemical's 2010 acquisition. Lotte Chemical Titan originally planned the IPO for last year but postponed after South Korea began investigating Lotte Group for alleged wrongdoing. Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and Maybank are joint global coordinators for the IPO. Bookrunners are CIMB, HSBC and Nomura.

Exports were seen rising 16.1 percent in May from a year ago, up for a sixth straight month and the strongest gain since a 16.9 percent jump in January 2015, the poll of 19 economists found. Japan's exports and factory output have benefited from a pick-up in overseas demand, and the Bank of Japan has upgraded its assessment of private consumption and overseas growth, signaling its confidence that an export-driven economic recovery was broadening and gaining momentum.  The global economy is recovering, led by a pickup in emerging economies. The rising trend in exports will likely continue this year,  said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.   Imports are expected to be up 14.8 percent from a year earlier, up for a fifth straight month, and boosted by rising liquefied natural gas, coal and oil prices.

Thermomix in Australia, a Vorwerk distributor, was slow to disclose problems in 2014 with lid seals for the kitchen appliance, despite at least 14 customers suffering serious burns when lids failed and scalding hot liquid spilled on users, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement on Friday. The Thermomix, a kitchen gadget which chops and cooks food, is made by unlisted German home appliances maker Vorwerk Elektrowerke. It has been the flagship product of the family-owned Vorwerk since the 1970s when it was launched to turn out French-style thickened soups. Sold by sales agents at tupperware-style parties, the product costing A$2,000 has earned a cult following and the company says sales have  steadily grown  through the 2000s to comprise nearly half the company's earnings.  The law requires that suppliers must act to notify the ACCC as soon as they become aware of any person who has suffered a serious injury associated with the goods they have supplied,  the watchdog's acting chairwoman, Delia Rickard, said in the statement. The TM31 Thermomix model was recalled in 2014 because of the lid problems. Thermomix in Australia Pty Ltd said it was aware of the watchdog's investigation and had  been cooperating fully with the ACCC and will continue to do so.  The company said it was not appropriate to comment further on a matter before the court. It faces fines of up to A$1.1 million ($835,000) for each breach of consumer law. Consumer advocate group Choice in 2016 sent the ACCC a report documenting 87 injuries, mostly burns, suffered by Thermomix users. The ACCC also alleges that in the course of the recall, Thermomix in Australia made  false and misleading statements  about safety of its products, and wrongly told customers they needed to sign non-disclosure forms to obtain refunds or replacements. Thermomix sales rose 11 percent to  almost  1.3 billion euros in 2016, with the product comprising nearly half of Vorwerk's total sales of 3.1 billion euros, company reports show.

On Thursday night, with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the 10th inning, Davis found another way to deliver a big hit. Davis, who has a team-high 17 home runs, blooped a two-run, walk-off single, leading the Athletics to an 8-7 victory against the New York Yankees in the opener of a four-game series at Oakland Coliseum. Yankees right-hander Giovanny Gallegos (0-1) came on in the 10th, trying to protect a 7-6 lead. After Gallegos retired the first two batters, Rajai Davis singled and moved to third on Chad Pinder's double. Gallegos intentionally walked Jed Lowrie, loading the bases. Davis hit a soft fly to shallow center that went off the glove of second baseman Starlin Castro, who tried to make a diving catch. Rajai Davis and Pinder scored on Khris Davis' third career walk-off hit.  I thought it had a chance, but Castro was getting after it out there, so you never know,  Khris Davis said.  I saw it tip off his glove and then I saw my boys running after me, so that was fun.  Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at AthleticsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchDavis' walk-off ended a battle that lasted four hours and 29 minutes.  We kept fighting back,  said Yankees manager Joe Girardi, whose team lost its third straight game.  We got behind, then we tied it up, got behind, tied it up. We did it a bunch of times. It hurts because it's a matter of a couple inches that you lose that game by, and it's frustrating.  Lowrie went 3-for-5 with a solo home run and a triple for the A's. Yonder Alonso had two hits, including a solo home run. Pinder went 3-for-6 with a double, an RBI and a run.  You're basically spent at this point,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of the final inning.  It was 10 innings, and it felt like 15. There were so many emotional swings in the game, and it just kind of wears you out a little bit. At the end of the day, it's a lot better to win those games than to lose them.  Castro hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly with the bases loaded in the top of the 10th inning. Castro had three hits, including a double, and scored three runs. Chris Carter, a former Athletic, went 2-for-5 with his 13th career homer against Oakland, and drove in two runs. Gary Sanchez went 3-for-3 with a double, walked twice and drove in two runs. Brett Gardner grounded a one-out single to right off Liam Hendriks (3-1) in the 10th. Gardner went to third on Aaron Hicks' infield single, and Hendriks walked Aaron Judge, loading the bases. Castro brought Gardner home with a sacrifice fly to right field. The A's broke a 5-5 tie with a run in the eighth inning when Matt Joyce grounded into a fielder's choice off Dellin Betances with the bases loaded. The Yankees answered with a run in the ninth off closer Santiago Casilla. Castro doubled with one out and scored on Sanchez's single. Yankees rookie left-hander Jordan Montgomery gave up four runs and seven hits, including two home runs, over 5 2/3 innings. He struck out five and walked one. A's right-hander Sonny Gray allowed three runs on eight hits over 5 1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked three.  I think a lot of guys were going on fumes toward the end, but to be able to stay in it and be able to pull it off was a pretty special feeling,  Gray said. Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius extended his career-high hitting streak to 17 games with a single in the sixth inning. Gregorius has the longest active hitting streak in the major leagues. NOTES: Yankees C Gary Sanchez left the game for a pinch runner in the ninth after stealing a base.  When I got up, I tried to move too quickly, and that's when I felt a little tightness in the groin area,  said Sanchez, who is day-to-day. ... Yankees OF Aaron Hicks left the game in the bottom of the ninth with tightness in his Achilles tendon. He's day-to-day. ... Yankees LHP CC Sabathia (Grade 2 left hamstring strain) was placed on the 10-day disabled list. ... The Yankees recalled RHPs Luis Cessa and Domingo German from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Cessa will likely start in Sabathia's place on either Saturday or Sunday. ... RHP Ronald Herrera was optioned to Double-A Trenton by the Yankees. ... Yankees 1B Greg Bird (right knee contusion) was shut down from his rehab assignment at Triple-A and he'll be examined Friday by team Dr. Christopher Ahmad. Bird went on the disabled list May 2 with a bone bruise in his right ankle. He fouled a ball off his knee Sunday. ... The A's fired longtime pitching coach Curt Young and promoted bullpen coach Scott Emerson. Young, a former A's pitcher, was in his sixth season of his second stint as Oakland's pitching coach. ... Oakland called up 3B Matt Chapman from Triple-A Nashville. He went 0-for-3 with two walks and scored a run in his major league debut. To make room for Chapman on their 25-man roster, the A's designated 3B Trevor Plouffe for assignment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED6GMQ17YC"},

China launched the world's first quantum satellite last August, to help establish  hack proof  communications between space and the ground, state media said at the time. The feat opens up  bright prospects  for quantum communications, said Pan Jianwei, the lead scientist of the Chinese team, Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS), according to the official Xinhua news agency. The scientists exploited the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, in which a particle can affect a far-off twin instantly, somehow overcoming the long distance separating them, a situation termed  spooky action at a distance  by the Nobel-prize winning physicist Albert Einstein, Xinhua added. The team had successfully distributed entangled photon pairs over 1,200 km, it said, outstripping the distance of up to 100 km (62 miles) at which entanglement had previously been achieved. The technology so far is  the only way to establish secure keys between two distant locations on earth without relying on trustful relay,  Pan told Xinhua, referring to encrypted messages. The new development  illustrates the possibility of a future global quantum communication network  the journal Science, which published the results of the Chinese team, said on its website.  China still lags behind the United States and Russia in space technology, although President Xi Jinping has prioritized advancing its space program, citing national security and defense.  China insists its space program is for peaceful purposes, but the U.S. Defense Department has highlighted its increasing space capabilities, saying it was pursuing activities aimed at preventing adversaries from using space-based assets in a crisis.

Secretary-General Kofi Annan and nine former African presidents have warned that the future of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is in  grave danger  due to the failure to organise an election to replace President Joseph Kabila. Kabila refused to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December, adding to uncertainty in the vast, mineral-rich central African nation, where regional wars from 1996-2003 killed millions of people. An agreement between Kabila's ruling coalition and opposition leaders calls for the presidential election to take place by the end of this year, but delays in registering voters and mobilising financing make that increasingly unlikely.  The failure to organise elections in late 2016, in conformity with the constitution of the DRC, has created an acute political crisis,  Annan and former presidents including South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo said in a statement issued late on Thursday.  We feel obliged to sound the alarm before it is too late,  it added. Dozens died last year in violent anti-government protests in major cities, and an insurrection in the centre of the country has killed hundreds and displaced 1.3 million more since last August.

The dollar index        firmed after data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week.                         Robust economic data could encourage the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again this year following a hike this week.      The strengthening of the dollar (is weighing on gold)... and after the latest Fed interest rate hike people are waiting to see when the Fed will raise rates next,  said Brian Lan, managing director at gold dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.     Higher interest rates tend to boost the dollar, putting pressure on gold prices by increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.     Spot gold        remained unchanged at $1,253.50 per ounce, as of 0758 GMT. Earlier in the session, it hit $1,251.05, its weakest since May 24. The metal has fallen about 1 percent so far this week.      U.S. gold futures         for August delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1,256.4.      The fact that the dollar is nudging higher, should continue to pressure the market, while the churn in U.S. equities is still not serious enough to warrant a flight to safety into the precious metal,  said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.         We think gold will likely have another $20-$25 on the downside before encountering more serious support.      Meanwhile, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund fell 0.14 percent to 853.68 tonnes on Thursday.                Among other precious metals, spot silver        was headed for its biggest weekly decline in six weeks. The metal gained 0.5 percent at $16.84 per ounce, after hitting $16.64 in the previous session, its weakest since May 19.      Price action in both gold and silver of late seems to imply that traders still have plenty of short-term long positioning on their books,  said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.      It may leave both metals vulnerable to a further washout into the weekend if the U.S. dollar strength persists.        Platinum        slipped 0.2 percent to $917.60 per ounce. The metal had hit its lowest in more than one month on Thursday.     Meanwhile, palladium        dropped 0.6 percent to $864.05 per ounce, as it moved towards its first weekly decline in four weeks.

Sterling surged to its highest in a week against the euro on Thursday after it emerged that three members of the Bank of England's policy committee had voted for a rise in interest rates. At a time when the BoE has blamed a rise in inflation past its 2 percent target on a weak pound, traders read the split vote as a warning that officials could seek to defend the currency with rhetoric or action, even as the economy overall slows. In trade-weighted terms, the pound was another 0.1 percent higher in morning trade in London.  Sterling will have another stab at rising (today),  said Naeem Aslam, Chief Market Analyst with retail broker Think Markets in London.  But investors would remain quick in taking the profit off the table if we continue to fail (to break) the resistance of $1.2820. (That) would confirm the downward bias.  By 0747 GMT, the pound had gained 0.2 percent at $1.2778 and was roughly flat at 87.34 pence per euro.  Dollar demand post Fed, political uncertainty in the UK post election, the Brexit negotiation overhang and depressed wages should make it difficult for the UK currency to run much higher right now,  said Joel Kruger, an analyst with LMAX Exchange in London. But he also said that technical analysis of sterling painted a more optimistic picture.  The latest round of setbacks are viewed as corrective with the market expected to be very well supported on dips ahead of 1.2500,  he said, pointing to the possibility of a rebound to $1.35 in the weeks ahead.

Brent crude futures were at $47.12 per barrel at 0656 GMT, 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, above their last settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $44.56 per barrel, up 10 cents, or 0.2 percent. Traders said the slight increases were a result of the threat of a partial export halt in Libya. However, prices for both benchmarks are still down by around 13 percent since late May, when producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) extended a pledge to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by an extra nine months until the end of the first quarter of 2018. Rising U.S. oil output, particularly from shale drillers, is contributing to the ineffectiveness of the OPEC-led cuts.  Oil is unlikely to find solace into the weekend either, with tonight's Baker Hughes Rig Count expected to deliver its now weekly increase of operational rigs,  said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. U.S. investment bank Jefferies said the low prices were due to  a relentless build in the U.S. rig count, weekly builds in U.S. inventories, rising production in Nigeria and Libya, and weak compliance by key OPEC members Iraq and the UAE.  High exports and production from Russia is also contributing to the ongoing glut. Top producer Russia, not an OPEC member but participating in the deal, is expected to export 61.2 million tonnes of oil via pipelines in the third quarter (around 5 million bpd), against 60.5 million tonnes in the second quarter, according to industry sources and Reuters calculations. Add in Russia's tanker shipments and its total exports are likely more than 9 million bpd. In the United States, which is not participating in any deal to hold back production, oil output C-OUT-T-EIA has risen more than 10 percent over the past year to 9.3 million bpd, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects that figure to rise above 10 million bpd in 2018. In a sign of the continuing supply overhang, traders are again hiring oil tankers to store unsold crude while they wait for higher prices.

Euro zone governments threw Greece another 11th-hour credit lifeline on Thursday but merely sketched possible ways to make the country's debt burden more sustainable.  It’s a very positive step in the right direction but you need to see more clarity on debt to include Greece in the PSPP,  the source said.  We need more specificity on the debt measure.  The ECB has repeatedly said it would need to deem Greek debt sustainable over the long term to include it in its 2.3 trillion euro bond buying programme but this would require relatively specific commitments on easing this debt pile.

Schaeuble said after a Eurogroup meeting on Thursday that it would be up to the budget committee of the Bundestag to decide whether full parliamentary approval was needed. But he said that he did not believe the agreement represented a substantive change to Greece's bailout program, meaning a broader debate in the Bundestag was not necessary.     I don't believe that the budget committee should do this alone,  said SPD lawmaker Johannes Kahrs, who is a member of the committee.  The Bundestag should do this.  A vote in the Bundestag on the 8.5 billion euros of loans from the euro zone's 18 other states could embarrass conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel as some of her lawmakers oppose aid to Greece. Altogether 63 German conservative lawmakers voted against the third bailout for Greece in August 2015 and a further three abstained.

China's market in asset-backed securities (ABS), a financing instrument via which a wide range of assets such as loans, real estate, toll ways and scenic parks have been converted into tradable bond-like securities, surged 50 percent in 2016 alone and now exceeds a trillion yuan ($147.1 billion). But there are signs of risks building in this market, which barely took off three years ago. Its first default struck late last year when a securitized bridge in Inner Mongolia could not collect enough tolls to pay investors.  Analysts say some securitized projects have had over-optimistic cash flow projections, and in other cases there has been an excessive concentration of risk.  Chinese media reports have added to that worry by suggesting the government may soon lower the regulatory bar for government-backed infrastructure projects to be securitized.  Asset securitization can help companies reduce leverage in a controllable manner and support the economy,  said Song Qinghui, a Beijing-based independent economist.  It's only a financial tool, but in recent years, ABS has been trumpeted to the sky in China, and the rapid growth of the business even shares some resemblance to the budding stage of the U.S. subprime crisis.  The securitization drive by the government ironically comes alongside China's stepped-up efforts to reduce its massive debt load and excessive investment. It is in part responsible for pushing banks and real estate firms to try and convert the illiquid future receivables on their balance sheets into immediate cash. The first batch of public-private partnership (PPP) projects  was securitized early this year and included two water treatment projects, a tunnel operator and a heating facility. A second batch of projects is expected to begin trading on China's two main stock exchanges soon, raising billions of yuan for the local governments that securitize the assets.  There could be more securitization of such PPP projects if the government changes rules that currently bar projects that have been in operation for less than two years from being securitized.   Questionable Quality China launched ABS in a pilot scheme in 2005, but suspended the market during the 2007-08 global financial crisis, which was  triggered by the collapse of shaky mortgage-backed securities in the United States. China resumed ABS issuance in 2012, and has issued a range  of policies since to promote the business, with the State Council, or China's cabinet, identifying asset securitization last year as a way to help Chinese companies reduce leverage. Financial regulators believe ABS could help China's local governments manage their massive 15 trillion yuan debt.  Lin Hua, chairman of consultancy China Securitization Analytics, warns however that it is the local governments with lower ratings or those in China's less-affluent regions, such as Guizhou, or Shandong, that would be tapping the ABS market. Although in a typical asset securitization structure, a special purpose vehicle is set up to insulate the issuer's credit-worthiness from the underlying assets backing the ABS, there is also growing concern underwriters and credit rating agencies could paint an unrealistically rosy picture of the securitized assets' future cash flows.  That was the case with the bridge in Inner Mongolia that  missed payments after its toll income collapsed due to a slump in coal transportation, a far cry from the stable cash flows projected by rating agency China Lianhe Credit Rating Co.  In February, Shenwan Hongyuan Securities Co was reprimanded by securities regulators for having made  inconsistent  due- diligence reports in several ABS deals that  lack adequate supportive evidence  and that failed to fully reflect the borrowers' creditworthiness.  Zhou Hao, president of China Chengxin Securities Rating Co, said brokerages paid more attention to winning the ABS underwriting business than to collecting future cash flows.  Brokerages have poor management in collecting future cash flows, and there are also disclosure problems.  Bank of Tianjin issued an ABS in July 2015 that was created from loans to just 22 borrowers, with lending to Shandong Shanshui Cement Group, a struggling cement maker, accounting for 12 percent of the underlying assets. In another case, the China Development Bank raised 5 billion yuan by issuing an ABS product backed by loans to just one borrower, state-owned steelmaker Shougang Group. The big worry is that some underwriters and rating agencies could collude with issuers to package shoddy assets into risky,  opaque and hard-to-understand bundles of products sold to an unsuspecting public.  If assets of zombie companies are sold to investors in the form of ABS, with acquiescence from banks and regulators, that would be organized fraud,  Wang Jun, finance professor at China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) told a forum in December.

China's market in asset-backed securities (ABS), a financing instrument via which a wide range of assets such as loans, real estate, toll ways and scenic parks have been converted into tradable bond-like securities, surged 50 percent in 2016 alone and now exceeds a trillion yuan ($147.1 billion). But there are signs of risks building in this market, which barely took off three years ago. Its first default struck late last year when a securitized bridge in Inner Mongolia could not collect enough tolls to pay investors.  Analysts say some securitized projects have had over-optimistic cash flow projections, and in other cases there has been an excessive concentration of risk.  Chinese media reports have added to that worry by suggesting the government may soon lower the regulatory bar for government-backed infrastructure projects to be securitized.

Following are comments from BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at his post-meeting news conference: Deflationary Mindset  It is taking long to turn around Japan's deflationary mindset because the country has been mired in deflation for a long time. People tend to act on the assumption that wages and prices won't rise ... But the job market is tightening further, so we will likely see that pushing up sales prices. We expect inflation to gradually accelerate ahead.   We're recently seeing some data showing inflation expectations not just bottoming out but heading higher. But we can't say yet that inflation expectations have completely turned positive ... At some point, we expect underlying inflation and inflation expectations to heighten. But that will take some time.  Inflation Target  There's some distance to achieving 2 percent inflation, so it's inappropriate to say now specifically how we will exit our ultra-loose monetary policy and how that could affect the BOJ's financial health. Laying out specific simulations now would only create confusion. We will debate an exit strategy only after 2 percent inflation is achieved and price growth stays there stably.  Pace of Bond Buying  The pace of our government bond buying will fluctuate from time to time depending on market conditions. The amount we buy would be determined based on how much is necessary to guide interest rates appropriately. We won't set in advance the pace of our bond buying.  On Boj's Purchases of Exchange-Traded Funds  Our purchases (of ETFs) are one factor of our QQE programme. We don't buy these assets to manipulate stock prices to a certain level. We buy them to achieve our 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible.  On Whether Boj Could Slow Etf Purchases  Theoretically that's possible ... Our bond purchases to achieve curve control and our ETF purchases that aim to cut risk premium don't necessarily have to completely synchronize.   Having said that, our ETF purchases are conducted as part of the entire QQE programme. So the decision on the pace of ETF purchases won't be made independently from achievement of our 2 percent inflation target.  RAISING 10-YR BOND YIELD TARGET AS STIMULUS WITHDRAWAL TOOL  It's possible to say so. But usually, when you talk about normalising unorthodox monetary policy you focus either on guiding short-term interest rates and adjusting the bank's balance sheet by changing the pace of asset buying.  Exit Strategy  It's true we shouldn't debate an exit strategy now. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be aiming to achieve 2 percent inflation ... There's no clear link, theoretically and practically, between demographics and deflation.  When advanced economies all set their inflation targets at 2 percent, that would contribute to stabilising exchange rates to some extent.  Demerits of Prolonged Monetary Easing  I know there are various discussions on the pros and cons of prolonged easing. But what's most important is to achieve price stability and maintain it.   Achieving and maintaining price stability is far more important than how long you continue easy monetary policy.

The Outlook on the IDR is Stable. The agency has also affirmed the 'A' rating on the USD300 million 3% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and USD700 million 4.125% senior unsecured notes due 2025 issued by Beijing State-owned Assets Management (Hong Kong) Company Limited (BSAMHK), BSAM's wholly owned subsidiary. In place of a guarantee, BSAM has granted a keepwell and liquidity support deed and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking on the US dollar notes to ensure BSAMHK has sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its obligations under the guarantee. The notes were BSAM's first issuance of offshore debt and are affirmed at the same level as BSAM's IDR due to the strong linkage between BSAMHK and BSAM and because the keepwell and liquidity support deed and deed of equity interest purchase undertaking transfer the ultimate responsibility of payment to BSAM. Fitch believes both the keepwell and liquidity support deed and the deed of equity interest purchase undertaking signal a strong intention from BSAM to ensure BSAMHK has sufficient funds to honour the debt obligations. The agency also believes BSAM intends to maintain its reputation and credit profile in the international offshore market and is unlikely to default on offshore obligations. Additionally, a default by BSAMHK could have significant negative repercussions on BSAM for any further offshore funding. KEY RATING DRIVERS Links to Beijing Municipality: BSAM's ratings are credit-linked to, but not equalised with, Beijing municipality. This is reflected in BSAM's 100% government ownership, strong municipal oversight of its financials and strategic importance of the entity's operation to the municipality. These factors result in a strong likelihood of extraordinary support, if needed. BSAM is classified as a credit-linked public-sector entity under Fitch's criteria. Beijing's Strong Creditworthiness: The capital city has a robust budgetary performance, a strong and well-diversified socio-economic profile and a close relationship with the China sovereign (A+/Stable), owing to its status as the capital. These strengths are mitigated by its moderately high municipal debt, contingent liabilities arising from its public-sector entities and weak transparency. Legal Status Attribute Mid-Range: BSAM is wholly owned, managed and supervised by the Beijing municipal government through the Beijing State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The group is registered as a wholly state-owned limited liability company and the government does not plan to dilute its shareholding in BSAM. Strategic Importance - Stronger: BSAM is a key investment holding platform of the Beijing municipal government to manage a diversified portfolio, which includes health care, technology, property development, finance, manufacturing, environmental protection, sports, culture and tourism, with both social and economic purposes. BSAM holds stakes in key Beijing financial institutions on the government's behalf. The lack of full flexibility in managing these investments also demonstrates the close linkage between BSAM and the Beijing municipal government. Balancing Policy and Commercial Objectives: One of BSAM's core operations is to incubate investments in new industries that the Beijing government seeks to develop. BSAM will exit the investments when they mature and recycle the capital into new projects that support Beijing's economic development. BSAM makes these investments in close consultation with the municipal government to determine their commercial viability. Moderate Business Concentration Risk: BSAM may face geographic concentration risk as a majority of its investments are based in Beijing. However, Fitch sees the risk to be moderate due to BSAM's increasing national presence via multiple investments in the previous few years, such as Dynagreen's renewable energy plant in Shenzhen. Business concentration risk is limited due to the diversified portfolio across multiple industries. Integration - Mid-Range: BSAM has received large government asset injections, including a national stadium and other state-owned assets. Total government support from the Beijing municipality amounted to around CNY12.9 billion between 2002 and 2015. BSAM also receives around CNY200-300 million per year in subsidies. Control and Oversight - Stronger: The group's board members are ultimately appointed by, or report to, the government. The group's financing plan and indebtedness are also closely monitored by the municipality via periodical financial reports. Satisfactory Financial Status: BSAM's assets largely consist of long-term equity investments, inventory and cash.  Fitch expects to see further growth in BSAM's consolidated total assets following capex expansion. BSAM's parent-level total assets amount to around CNY48 billion and its parent-level total debt is CNY10.4 billion. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade of Fitch's credit assessment on the Beijing municipality as well as a stronger or more explicit support commitment by the municipality may trigger positive rating action on BSAM. Significant weakening of BSAM's strategic importance to the municipality, dilution of the municipality's shareholding or reduced explicit and implicit municipality support may result in a downgrade. A downgrade could also stem from weaker fiscal performance or increased indebtedness of the municipality, leading to deterioration in the sponsor's creditworthiness.

But emerging markets fund managers who bought Russian equities in January will have seen the MSCI Russia equity index tumble more than 15 percent in dollar terms since then. It fell as much as 2 percent at one point on Thursday, hitting 15-month lows and has fared worse this year than even Qatar, which is locked in a high-profile spat with its Gulf neighbours: tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5 Russia's setback is part of a global cooling of 'Trump trades'. These were mainly based on hopes that President Donald Trump would boost the U.S. - and global - economy through spending increases. But he was also expected to repeal sanctions imposed in 2014 to punish Russia for its role in the Ukraine crisis . As a result, most foreign investors were overweight Russia until this month, holding more Russian stocks than the country's share in the benchmark indexes, according to data from Renaissance Capital. This seemed obvious as an apparent  bromance  between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin promised a thaw in diplomatic ties. But far from lifting sanctions, U.S. lawmakers this week voted for fresh, stickier, curbs while preventing Trump from easing existing ones.  The two theses behind the overweight have both collapsed - oil prices and Trump,  said David Hauner, head of emerging markets cross-asset strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  People were bullish on oil, which turned out to be wrong, and there were hopes on sanctions relief, which also turned out to be wrong.  Hauner, among those bullish on Russia in January, advised clients in March to reduce exposure to the stock market and has since cut Russian bonds too, citing worries over how heavily foreigners were positioned in both markets. Crude futures meanwhile were near six-month lows, despite repeated supply cuts and price forecasts have fallen each month in 2017. Oil revenues make up almost half the government budget revenues while six of the 10 biggest Russian stocks by market capitalisation are energy firms. The latest steep losses mean state shipping firm Sovcomflot - specialising in transporting oil and gas - will delay a planned share sale which had been planned for this week, a source told Reuters on Thursday. Rouble Stronger On the domestic front, things are looking up. The economy should grow 1.5 percent in 2017 after two years of contraction while company earnings have improved. Russian earnings-per-share (EPS) have on average bounced 27 percent from troughs hit in 2016 and should expand 7-9 percent in the coming six months, noted Michael Bolliger, head of emerging market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management.  That part of the Russia story is intact,  Bolliger said but admitted the decision to overweight Russian stocks had proved  painful .  We are having discussions on how to reposition.  Russian bond investments have fared better, earning dollar-based returns of over 10 percent this year, thanks to a conservative central bank that has cut interest rates very slowly. It is expected to ease policy on Friday by 50 basis points but has pledged to keep rates well above inflation. But high interest rates have lured record fund inflows into Russia's domestic bonds, in turn boosting the rouble 8 percent against the dollar until this week. That has effectively severed a long-standing correlation between the currency and oil. So while crude slid 11 percent off May peaks, the rouble lost 1.2 percent, Christopher Granville, managing director at consultancy TS Lombard said in a note this week.  The rouble's de-coupling from oil compounds the blow for Russian oil stocks,  Granville said, advising clients to re-focus on domestically oriented sectors such as retail and avoid energy stocks that face oil price weakness and rouble strength.

The 53-year old Canadian lopped heads and boosted returns at his last job, and was unsentimental about weak business lines. Activist investor Elliott is pleased. Other shareholders should be too.     Elliott is rightly critical of BHP's lacklustre market performance, in particular compared to archrival Rio Tinto. Rio's Australian-listed shares are up around 10 percent in the last five years where BHP has fallen about 20 percent.  Graphic: BHP versus Rio: reut.rs/2rCI2oW     The hedge fund attacked poor decisions including  disastrous acquisitions” and badly timed buybacks, as well as an inefficient dual-listing structure. It estimated an overhaul could increase shareholder value by nearly 50 percent. BHP argued the costs of Elliott's plan outweighed the benefits, and Elliott has since backed away from the move to consolidate the listing structure.      The appointment does not necessarily mean surrender to the rest of the activist's agenda. Most notably, BHP may still keep its U.S. oil business, rather than spinning it off. But hiring MacKenzie makes sense whether one agrees with Elliott's specific proposals or not.    MacKenzie's record turning around Amcor, an $14 billion Australian food and industrial packager, offers a clue to how he could behave at BHP. An engineer by training, he came out of the corner swinging an axe, replacing 75 percent of the firm's top 80 managers in his first two years. In 2013 he demerged Amcor's Australasian paper and packaging and U.S. distribution businesses, while snapping up a packaging company from Rio for a low price. Returns on capital doubled to 20 percent; Amcor's share price is up 140 percent since 2012.     MacKenzie has been on BHP's board since September, so he has met with Elliott already and has an idea of what the challenges are. The track record is not necessarily a perfect guide to future performance: manufacturing is a very different business from commodities, subject to a different set of macroeconomic headwinds. And BHP is a very politicized Australian beast, which might limit his room for manoeuvre. But at least he appears to have broad support to make dramatic change.  BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The aviation-to-financial services group said Guo had injured HNA's  business reputation arising from repeated false and defamatory statements , according to a summons filed in the New York State Supreme Court on Thursday. Guo, whose companies and employees are also the subject of criminal cases in China, did not respond immediately to requests for comment, nor did he immediately comment on the cases on Twitter, where he often issues statements. The summons, seen by Reuters, cites allegations that  officials in China's Communist Party and their relatives are undisclosed shareholders  in the group, and that subsidiary Hainan Airlines had allowed government officials and their relatives to use its aircraft  for purely personal reasons . HNA said in a statement posted on its website late on Thursday that Guo's allegations had harmed its reputation and that it intended to vigorously pursue its claim. China's judiciary said separately on Friday that it would prosecute additional cases against Guo's companies, the official Xinhua news agency reported, after a court in the northern city of Dalian sentenced three of his employees for fraudulently obtaining hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. Guo has disputed the facts of the Dalian case and said its main purpose was to establish a criminal case against him, in order to bolster an Interpol global  red notice  for his arrest that was issued at Beijing's request in April. The three employees, who testified that they were acting under Guo's instructions, received either suspended sentences or jail terms close to time already served. Xinhua said officials in Dalian and central China's Henan province would prosecute new cases involving Guo's companies and employees on charges including abuse of power, loan fraud and destruction of accounting records, while pursuing additional suspected misdeeds. Chinese-born Guo, who lives in New York, has emerged in recent months as a political threat to the Chinese government in an acutely sensitive year, making clear that he wants to disrupt a five-yearly congress to be held this autumn.  Through Twitter posts and video blogs, Guo has unleashed a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials. Guo began making specific allegations against HNA in April but the group did not respond publicly until last week, when it issued a denial and threatened legal action. Guo has said he will make additional revelations in a live online interview scheduled later on Friday with U.S.-based Chinese-language political gossip site Mingjing.

The state-owned national carrier, which is looking for an international partner to help revive its business, incurred an annual loss of 27.79 billion rupees ($182.50 million), versus a loss of 12.08 billion rupees a year ago.  The airline continues to pay a heavy price for the extremely high lease rental agreements entered into by the previous government,  SriLankan Airline said in a statement.  The cost of terminating the leases on four A350-900 aircraft that were grossly overpriced and completely unsuitable for the national carrier, imposed a further burden on the airline,  it added. More than half of the company's loss last year was due to a compensation of 14.36 billion rupees for the cancellation of aircraft lease agreements. Results for the 2016/17 year came under added pressure due to a runway re-surfacing project at Sri Lanka's main airport that forced the airline to cancel more than 600 flights over January to March, equivalent to two weeks of scheduled services. SriLankan Airlines was a profitable 10-year joint venture with Dubai-based partner Emirates Airline until the pair split in 2008. Mismanagement in the years since has left it with a debt of about $3.25 billion. It last made a profit in 2009, a year after Emirates sold its stake. The current government has been able to attract several bidders, including U.S. private equity firm TPG and investment manager BlackRock Inc, for a 49 percent stake in the carrier, but the airline has so far failed to find a partner. TPG, one of three bidders short-listed, pulled out of talks about the potential acquisition last month.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index ended up 0.2 percent, or 10.81 points, at 5,774. The benchmark, which fell 1.2 percent on Thursday, added 1.7 percent on the week, its best weekly performance week since March-end. Analysts attributed some of this week's gain to buying by self-managed super funds (SMSF) and net purchases by foreigners. Tony Farnham, an economist with Patersons Securities, said individuals have been buying shares ahead of July 1, when superannuation regulations change. Among the 'Big Four' banks, National Australia Bank and ANZ were the biggest gainers on the benchmark by weight, up 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent respectively.  We've got the bank levy and other uncertainties, but at the moment I think there's a degree of confidence that profit numbers pre-bank levy were quite solid and dividend yields were still solid to retail investors,  Farnham said. The financial index gained 2.5 percent this week. Basic materials shares, however, remained pressured by continuing weakness in commodity prices, compounded by a poor outlook. Rio Tinto was 0.3 percent lower and rival BHP declined marginally. Industrials were hurt by Sydney Airport Holdings shares, which shed 2.3 percent and were the biggest drag on the main board. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index was 0.5 percent, or 36.40 points, higher at 7,552.75. It added 1.6 percent on the week. Consumer stocks were the biggest gainers driven up by a2 Milk shares, which added 8.2 percent after the dairy products maker raised its full-year group revenue forecast earlier in the day.

With only a gentle breeze and rains having taken the bite out of the monstrous 7,845-yard course, players tore apart the links-style layout, attacking the pins with bravado on a day when 17 competitors broke 70. Fowler returned a seven-under 65 for a one-shot lead over compatriot Xander Schauffele and Englishman Paul Casey. Starting from the 10th tee, Fowler showed why he was among the pre-tournament favorites, returning a polished bogey-free effort that matched the lowest first round score in relation to par at a U.S. Open. Not even the sight of a burning blimp crashing to the ground in an open field just a half-mile (800 meters) from the course could shake the world number nine, who failed to make the cut at his previous two U.S. Opens but finished runner-up in 2014.  You don't get many rounds at the U.S. Open that are stress-free,  said Fowler, who got his round off to a flying start with birdies on three of his opening five holes.  It is always cool to be part of some sort of history in golf but I'd rather be remembered for something that's done on Sunday.  Related CoverageFowler prefers his followers on leaderboard not social media'Call me Phil!' Mickelson stand-in Diaz cards 72Newly branded as the  ultimate test in golf , the U.S. Open has long been famed for its toughness and Erin Hills, the longest ever layout for a U.S. Open, was expected to add to that hard-man reputation. But under sunny skies Erin Hills looked more friend than foe with 44 golfers breaking par setting a record for the opening round of a U.S. Open. But not everyone left with a smile as the world's top six ranked players all failed to get into red numbers. World number one Dustin Johnson opened defense of his U.S. Open crown with a shaky three-over 75 while number two Rory McIlroy, sidelined for much of the year with rib and back injuries, opened with an eagle but could not shake the rust, fading to six-over 78 after being punished by the brutal fescue rough on several occasions.

Mandatory Credit: Michael Madrid-USA TODAY SportsAs bad as the Northern Irishman's day was it was still better than playing competitor world number three Jason Day, the Australian slumping to a seven-over 79 that included two triple bogeys.  I just played bad golf,  said Day.  I can't put it any other way other than just there was some good stuff mixed in with a lot of poor stuff.   Two triples, I don't know. It's weird.  Slideshow (5 Images) It's not like I gave up. I actually gave it 100 percent all the way through the end and I shot 79.  World number four Hideki Matsuyama (74), number five Jordan Spieth (73) and number Henrik Stenson (74) will all have work to do if they hope to see the weekend at season's second major. Few in the 156 player field, however, had a more wretched day than Englishman Danny Willett, the 2016 Masters champion who handed in a nine-over 81. The year's second major started without Phil Mickelson, the five-times major winner withdrawing to attend his daughter's high school graduation. Six times a runner-up at the U.S. Open, Mickelson skipped another chance at completing a career grand slam when it became obvious Mother Nature was not going to cooperate and delay the start of the opening round. Mickelson had kept fans and officials guessing almost down to the wire, hanging on to the long shot hope that storms might delay the start of the year's second major and allow him to attend the graduation and then fly from San Diego to Wisconsin to make his tee time. His withdrawal marked the end of a golfing era with the 117th U.S. Open becoming the first major to not include Mickelson and/or Tiger Woods since the 1994 Masters. Woods, who recently underwent his fourth back surgery, has not played a PGA Tour event since January at Torrey Pines, the site of the last of his 14 major wins in 2008. The last major he played in was the 2015 PGA Championship. Editing by Mark Heinrich and Andrew Both","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-usopen-fowler-idUSKBN1962TX"},

Harmon says he told Fowler to decide whether he wanted to be a golf pro or a celebrity.  We had a big conversation at the end of the year and he didn't like it,  Harmon said recently on Sky Sports, where he works as an analyst during golf tournaments.  I said 'you gotta decide are you going to be Kardashian or are you going to be golf pro? You're the kind of social media, you're all over these snapchats and all these things'.      Fowler, without a major victory yet, evidently took Harmon's tough love the right way, not that he has exactly disappeared from social media either this year. But he has also let his clubs do the talking with a win, a second and a third already on the PGA Tour, and will try to do so again on Friday when he takes a one-stroke lead into the second round at Erin Hills. A long way back, defending champion Dustin Johnson, world number two Rory McIlroy and number three Jason Day will need to conjure up some magic simply to make the halfway cut, which looks like falling at around one-over.  This means Johnson, after an opening three-over 75, requires a good second round to stay alive, while McIlroy and Day are in need of a minor miracle. McIlroy and Day spent so much time in the fescue on Thursday they probably had to check for ticks afterwards, the Northern Irishman running up a 78, Day a 79. McIlroy is in danger of missing the U.S. Open cut for the second time in a row, while for Australian Day it would be his first missed cut after top-10 finishes the past four years. But if there is a silver lining, both players have early tee times, usually more favorable for low scoring. Erin Hills is likely to yield plenty of birdies again for the second round as nothing more than a light breeze is expected. But with only an outside chance of rain forecast, the course is likely to dry out and perhaps start to show some fire. The first round proved that the long fescue rough can severely punish an errant drive but keep it on the fairway, and the green light is often turned on for an aggressive approach and a good birdie chance.

The state should act as an enabler - not a constraint - for innovators and entrepreneurs, he said.  The French president said he would limit the wealth tax to cover just property in order to help businesses, and would create a single levy of 30 percent on capital income so as not to scare businesses away.

Thermomix in Australia, a Vorwerk distributor, was slow to disclose problems in 2014 with lid seals for the kitchen appliance, despite at least 14 customers suffering serious burns when lids failed and scalding hot liquid spilled on users, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement on Friday. The Thermomix, a kitchen gadget which chops and cooks food, is made by unlisted German home appliances maker Vorwerk Elektrowerke. It has been the flagship product of the family-owned Vorwerk since the 1970s when it was launched to turn out French-style thickened soups. Sold by sales agents at tupperware-style parties, the product costing A$2,000 has earned a cult following and the company says sales have  steadily grown  through the 2000s to comprise nearly half the company's earnings.  The law requires that suppliers must act to notify the ACCC as soon as they become aware of any person who has suffered a serious injury associated with the goods they have supplied,  the watchdog's acting chairwoman, Delia Rickard, said in the statement. The TM31 Thermomix model was recalled in 2014 because of the lid problems. Thermomix in Australia Pty Ltd said it was aware of the watchdog's investigation and had  been cooperating fully with the ACCC and will continue to do so.  The company said it was not appropriate to comment further on a matter before the court. It faces fines of up to A$1.1 million ($835,000) for each breach of consumer law. Consumer advocate group Choice in 2016 sent the ACCC a report documenting 87 injuries, mostly burns, suffered by Thermomix users. The ACCC also alleges that in the course of the recall, Thermomix in Australia made  false and misleading statements  about safety of its products, and wrongly told customers they needed to sign non-disclosure forms to obtain refunds or replacements. Thermomix sales rose 11 percent to  almost  1.3 billion euros in 2016, with the product comprising nearly half of Vorwerk's total sales of 3.1 billion euros, company reports show.

The film doesn’t mention Muruganantham by name, but it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the story is based on the life of a man who made it his mission to manufacture low-cost sanitary napkins. Muruganantham’s story has been well-documented through media coverage and documentaries, but given that Saxena doesn’t have the official biopic rights, he disguises his film as the story of Phullu (Sharib Hashmi), the village wastrel who spends his days running errands for people and loitering instead of heeding his mother’s advice to get a proper job. Given that his mother is prone to hitting him with shoes and cursing his existence, you wouldn’t blame Phullu for ignoring her. A chance visit to the city, and a revelation about what sanitary pads are used for, sets Phullu off on a mission which will change his otherwise aimless life.  Struck by how unhygienic menstrual habits in his village are and how his beloved wife Begni (Jyoti Sethi) suffers because of them, Phullu decides that he wants to manufacture low-cost sanitary napkins. Much like Phullu, Saxena too has his heart in the right place, but he and his protagonist stumble when it comes to implementation. The narrative is clunky, and we never get a sense of the life-changing realisation that makes Phullu want to risk everything to follow his dream.  Hashmi is a too over-the-top playing Phullu, while Sethi as Begni is the bright spark. Saxena seems to have a good idea for an entertaining film but is unable to see it to its rightful conclusion. The film ends even as the protagonist has barely begun his journey, without any sense of closure.  Whether intentional or not, “Phullu” seems liked a half-made film, one that started off right but was abandoned midway and left to fend for itself.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/movie-review-phullu-idUSKBN1970LI"},

She is the First Lady of South Korea, the wife of popular new liberal President Moon Jae-in. Kim Jung-sook's upbeat personality and unprecedented openness have earned her the nickname  Happy Mrs. Jung-sook . In barely a month since Moon's election win, she has already set herself apart from former first ladies who lived quietly in their husbands' shadows. Kim says she wants to fill any gaps Moon might miss as he tries to communicate with a South Korean public wary of established politicians after a corruption scandal ousted his predecessor, Park Geun-hye.  I would like to be a neighborly first lady who's down to earth and friendly,  Kim said in written responses to questions from Reuters, her first as first lady.  First of all, I have asked people not to call me first lady,  she said. So it was no surprise that Kim, 62, was seen queuing to buy fish during campaigning for the snap May election. She also makes honey-preserved ginseng for politicians as gifts. Political observers see her as a breath of fresh air after Park's ouster in a corruption scandal that rocked South Korea's business and political elite.  In the past, first ladies were seen sticking to formalities, they were serious and never spoke up,  said Ha Jae-keun, a culture critic for South Korean media.  Kim, in contrast, seems approachable and feels fresh.  Her image as an ordinary  ajumeoni , or middle-aged woman, adds to the luster of Moon, whose popularity has surged because his  common man  touch is in such contrast to Park's aloof and disconnected style. Moon's approval rating hit a record 83 percent in the latest poll by Gallup Korea released on Friday. By contrast, the unmarried Park's approval rating had fallen to 44 percent just four weeks after she took office. Park was famous for never going out in public without her trademark highly coiffed hairdo and makeup, her unapproachable demeanor later earning her the nickname of  ice princess .  It seems that the public that was wounded by Park's coldness is being comforted by Kim,  Ha said. 'Female Warrior' Kim and Moon have been married since 1981, and a video showing her brushing his hand away after a minor row during a visit to a traditional market has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. While the first couple might argue just like any other, Kim sees her role as helping to keep her husband well-grounded during his single five-year term.  Our new house is so large and nice but I'm trying to live as we lived before because I know we'll go back to staying in a small house five years later,  said Kim.  I'm trying to make him laugh, make side dishes he is accustomed to and have kept our bedroom small and cozy so he can feel at home in a completely new place,  she said. Days before moving into the presidential Blue House, Kim was seen with a protester who had camped outside her home, holding her hands and asking  why don't you come in for some ramen?  Father Paolo Ryu Jong-man of the Hongje-dong Catholic Church, where the presidential couple worshipped, recalls Kim calling her husband  my person . Invited to the Blue House a few weeks ago to give them a blessing, Ryu said they walked with him and some nuns through the presidential compound.  I told the first lady about how confidently she walks - like a 'female warrior',  he said.  And she replied: 'Oh is that so? Should I walk more like a lady'?  Ko Sang-man, a human rights activist and executive producer of a play called  Private's Mother , recalled seeing a woman sitting quietly and crying during a performance of the play, which is about mothers whose sons have died, possibly as a result of bullying, during military service. The woman arrived at the theater on a recent Friday night after the lights had gone down and Ko thought at first she might have been part of the president's security team. The public only learned it was in fact Kim after Ko posted about it on Facebook.  I saw a middle-aged woman who was crying, and wondered whether the presidential security team hires women. I also thought she looked a bit old to be in security service,  Ko told Reuters.

Maersk Oil will, according to the plan, be listed separately, and it will happen within the next six to 12 months,  a source told the newspaper. Plans to list Maersk's Supply Service and Drilling units have been dropped, while the future for Maersk Tankers is still undetermined, the newspaper said. The newspaper's sources underlined that the final decision to go ahead with the IPO of the oil unit has still not been taken, and that divestment or a merger with another player was still a possibility, although not likely. Maersk, whose container ship and oil businesses have been struggling, announced last year that it would split up into separate companies and said it would unveil details of its structural changes by September 2018. A spokeswoman for Maersk said on Friday that the company would not comment on speculation.   As previously mentioned we aim to be able to publish the structural solutions by the end of September 2018, depending on market development and opportunities,  she said in an email response to Reuters.

China matters for Mickey Mouse's owner: its box office takings there have tripled over the last two years and Shanghai Disneyland has seen over 10 million guests in its first year, setting it on track for faster profits than Disney reaped from parks like Paris or Hong Kong, both loss-making for most of the years they have been open. Disney released 10 films in China last year, including  Zootopia  and  Star Wars: The Force Awakens  with ticket sales around $1 billion, according to box office tracker EntGroup. That was up from four films and $313 million in 2014. This May, it rolled out the red carpet in Shanghai for a rare world premiere of the latest film in its popular  Pirates of the Caribbean  franchise. Stars Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Javier Bardem made an appearance. It has also been tying up with partners like state-backed producer Shanghai Film Group, its digital subsidiary BesTV for online content, and Shanghai Shendi, its partner for Shanghai. Now, for the first anniversary of the Shanghai park it will celebrate Disney-style, with lights, fireworks and top executives including Chief Executive Bob Iger and chairman of Disney's parks and resorts, Bob Chapek. They are likely to face questions on whether the group is planning a second park in China. But along with the rides, Disney is pursuing a steadier path to build brand and profit in downtown classrooms in six major Chinese cities, where children study English with the help of Winnie the Pooh and Captain America.  With the theme park, films, co-productions, Disney English and retail, they're creating an ecosystem to bring consumers in and foster a broader buzz and awareness,  said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.  The aim is to recreate that feeling in the U.S. where you have multiple generations who know the characters and cartoons.  Disney said China was a strategically important market.  Not only is it home to Shanghai Disney Resort, our largest ever foreign investment, but it has a thriving studio, consumer products and media distribution business,  it said in a statement. Disney is hiring for schools in cities including Beijing, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai - all decorated with Disney characters and motifs. It hasn't all been plain sailing. Disney was forced to launch an investigation earlier this year after a rogue employee was found to have set up firms which made deals with local authorities using the Disney name. Local kids are also more used to Asian cartoon heroes, while Disney faces caps on imported films, partial bans on foreign cartoons on TV and long-established local theme park rivals. However, for 7-year-old Sunny Sun who has been attending classes once a week at Disney English for the past two years, Disney characters are now very familiar. Her mother, freelance writer Happy Chen, plans to take her to the Shanghai park this summer, and says her daughter goes to almost every new Disney animation at the cinema.  Now she really yearns to go to the Disney park,  said Chen, pointing to the crossover between the classes, films, characters and the theme park.  It's all connected.

The U.S dollar index is a lot firmer and if the majors are depreciating against the dollar then that typically means the Asian currencies are going to follow suit,  said Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING Financial Markets.     The dollar index, recovering from a fall on Thursday after dismal inflation and retail data, was up 0.1 percent at 0534 GMT after weekly data showed that the number of unemployment benefit claims in the United States fell more than expected.     Fed Chair Janet Yellen indicated on Wednesday that it  remained confident inflation would rise to its target over the medium term, bolstered by what she described as a robust labour market that is continuing to strengthen.     On Friday, the biggest loser among regional currencies was the South Korean won falling 1.2 percent, followed by the Philippine peso and the Taiwan dollar each down 0.5 percent.     The peso was on track to post its worst week since November 2016.     The Malaysian ringgit was 0.3 percent lower.     The Chinese yuan edged 0.1 percent lower after the central bank set the midpoint rate sharply lower on Friday than the previous day at 6.7995 per dollar, the weakest level since June 2, reacting to greenback strength overnight.       The Singapore dollar slipped 0.2 percent after rising marginally on data showing a contraction in non-oil exports was smaller than expected.     For the coming week, the beginning of Brexit talks on Monday will be a theme influencing investors.          SOUTH KOREAN WON      The won's 1.2 percent drop was its steepest intraday decline in more-than three months and putting it on track for its worst week since early April.     A dealer in Seoul said the USD/KRW pair extended its rise during hour as offshore players and local banks  opted to build up positions in anticipation of the USD's strength continuing for some time, thanks to bullish Fed views and prolonged uncertainty over U.S. politics .       Dollar purchases by the National Pension Service added momentum, the dealer said.              TAIWAN DOLLAR     The Taiwan dollar was on track for a ninth straight day of losses and its steepest weekly decline since early March.      It may be a combination of the weakness in yen and a late reaction from Panama breaking off relations and dropping its recognition of Taiwan, and recognising China,  Condon said.     On Monday, Panama said it had broken with Taiwan to forge ties with Beijing.

Due to the mid-year reserve targets, we don't think the central bank would intervene in the market unless they see a huge volatility,  said the dealer, adding that the year-end seasonal demand for dollars would start from August. The rupee has been under pressure after central bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said the bank would allow gradual depreciation of the currency.

The prime minister's younger brother and sister, Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling, said on Wednesday they had lost confidence in Lee Hsien Loong and feared that the state's organs would be used against them. Lee Hsien Yang said he and his wife, the lawyer Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore because they felt closely monitored and threatened. A timeline issued by the prime minister's lawyers and published on Facebook late on Thursday shows that the three children of Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled the country for three decades, have been battling over the will for several years. The biggest issue has been over the future of the house that their father lived in for most of his life. Before Lee died in March 2015, he made it public that he wanted the home near the bustling Orchard Road shopping district to be demolished rather than turned into some kind of museum. But Lee Hsien Loong said in the six-page timeline that the fifth and sixth versions of the will had removed a clause about the demolition, and it was only reinserted in the final will, the seventh version. He questioned whether Lee Kuan Yew knew the clause was re-inserted, saying there was no evidence that he did. The prime minister questioned the role his brother's wife, Lee Suet Fern, may have played in his father's last will. He said that she  was involved in the preparation and/or signing of the Last Will  and that given her husband was a beneficiary this appeared to be a conflict of interest. He also said that there had been another major change between the sixth and the last will. In the sixth will, Lee Kuan Yew had given his daughter Lee Wei Ling a greater share of the estate than his two sons. However, in the last will they all got equal shares. The Prime Minister said he didn't challenge the will in court because he wanted to avoid a public fight. Lee Hsien Yang responded on social media, saying his brother's allegations are false.  Hsien Loong raised no legal challenge to Lee Kuan Yew's will in the many months after it was read. Probate was granted in Oct 2015, so the will is full, final, and legally binding,  Lee Hsien Yang posted on his Facebook.  Hsien Loong should not use a committee of his subordinates to allege what he did not dare to allege in court,  he said, asking how Lee Kuan Yew would not have known about any changes when he initialed right beneath the demolition clause.

The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects Etiqa group's established market franchise as one of Malaysia's major insurance groups, with dominant market positioning in the conventional insurance and takaful sectors. The affirmation also considers the group's very strong capitalisation, supported by the core operating entities' strong investment and liquidity profile and very strong profitability. Fitch views the group's business profile as strong. EIB, ETB and EIPL are considered core subsidiaries of Maybank Ageas Holdings Berhad (MAHB) and hence all have been assigned the group rating. All three entities are wholly owned by MAHB and contributed more than 90% of group total gross premiums in 2016. The entities share the 'Etiqa' branding and show significant coordination in their processes, management and resources. Fitch expects MAHB to have adequate financial and capital strength to support its core operating entities if needed. In addition to its significant insurance market share in Malaysia, the group maintains a modest presence in Singapore as a composite insurer. Overall, at the group level, MAHB's absolute-size by total equity and net premiums remains smaller relative to other Fitch-rated regional insurance groups. All three entities reported regulatory risk-based capital (RBC) ratios well above the individual target capital level (ITCL) set according to its risk profile and therefore well above the minimum regulatory benchmarks. This was underpinned by ongoing surplus growth and sound capital management at the entity and group level. MAHB's score on Fitch's Prism Factor-Based Capital Model and consolidated financial leverage stood at 'Very Strong' and 14% respectively, which Fitch sees as acceptable and well within the median guidelines for MAHB's rating category. Fitch expects the new operating entities, following Bank Negara Malaysia's requirement for composite insurers to split their operations into separate licenses by 2018, to continue to be managed at a group level, with capital support coming from MAHB. The three entities' investment mix and liquidity profiles remained sound in 2016. Investments in fixed-income securities, cash and deposits accounted for more than 80% of total invested assets and exposure to risky assets, such as equities, was manageable. Fitch expects the investment strategy to remain prudent and not to deviate significantly in the near-term. Fitch views Etiqa group's profitability to be very strong. EIB and ETB achieved combined ratios below 100% for their general insurance businesses, and the group's bottom-line profitability, measured by pre-tax return-on-assets, improved to 3.0% (2015: 2.3%) and its return-on-equity improved to 12.4% (2015: 8.7%), helped by higher investment returns and favourable underwriting results. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key triggers for a rating downgrade include: - Changes in the status of EIB, ETB or EIPL as a core operating entity of the Etiqa group - Deterioration in the entities' capitalisation, with EIB's or EIPL's statutory RBC ratio falling below 200% persistently, ETB's statutory RBC ratio falling below 150% on a sustained basis or deterioration in MAHB's Prism score to below 'Strong'. - Significant decline in the entities' financial performance, with EIB's or ETB's general insurance and takaful combined-ratio above 105% consistently, or a sharp decline in EIB's and ETB's lapse rates/mortality profits in the life and family takaful business - Sustained increase in MAHB's consolidated financial leverage to above 30% An upgrade is unlikely in the near term, as the Insurer Financial Strength rating is constrained by Malaysia's Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating of 'A-'.

Thermomix in Australia, a Vorwerk distribtor, was slow to disclose problems in 2014 with lid seals for the kitchen appliance, despite at least 14 customers suffering serious burns when lids failed and scalding hot liquid spilled on users, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in a statement on Friday. The Thermomix, a kitchen gadget which chops and cooks food, is made by unlisted German home appliances maker Vorwerk Elektrowerke. It has been the flagship product of the family-owned Vorwerk since the 1970s when it was launched to turn out French-style thickened soups. Sold by sales agents at tupperware-style parties, the product costing A$2,000 has earned a cult following and company says sales have  steadily grown  through the 2000s to comprise nearly half the company's earnings.  The law requires that suppliers must act to notify the ACCC as soon as they become aware of any person who has suffered a serious injury associated with the goods they have supplied,  the watchdog's acting chairwoman, Delia Rickard, said in the statement. After the injuries, the company issued a recall of the TM31 model in 2014 because of the lid problems. Thermomix in Australia Pty Ltd did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It faces fines of up to A$1.1 million ($835,000) for each breach of consumer law. Consumer advocate group Choice in 2016 sent the ACCC a report documenting 87 injuries, mostly burns, suffered by Thermomix users. The ACCC also alleges that in the course of the recall, Thermomix in Australia made  false and misleading statements  about safety of its products, and wrongly told customers they needed to sign non-disclosure forms to obtain refunds or replacements. Thermomix sales rose 11 percent to  almost  1.3 billion euros in 2016, with the product comprising nearly half of Vorwerk's total sales of 3.1 billion euros, company reports show. $1 = 1.3177 Australian dollars Reporting by Tom Westbrook and Byron Kaye; Editing by Jacqueline Wong","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/australia-thermomix-idUSL3N1JD173"},

New passenger car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association increased to 1.43 million vehicles last month, according to the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA).   In volume terms, this result comes close to May 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis hit the auto industry,  the industry group said in a statement. European car sales returned to annual growth in 2014 after a six-year slump during which registrations fell to their lowest in decades. Demand has been growing most months since, as an improvement in consumer confidence, retail incentives and new product launches lured customers back to the showrooms. The May increase comes after registrations dropped the previous month, given fewer trading days around Easter and thanks to a double-digit sales decline in Britain. May's growth was led by Japanese carmakers Suzuki (7269.T) and Toyota (7203.T), up 21.4 percent and 19.6 percent respectively, and Germany's Daimler (DAIGn.DE), up 14 percent.  Sales from the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) stable rose 11.9 percent, as a 47.8 percent jump for sporty Alfa Romeo models helped offset a 7.3 percent drop for its Jeep SUV brand.  France's Renault (RENA.PA) recorded a 10.4 percent rise in registrations, outpacing domestic rival PSA Group (PEUP.PA), whose sales increased 4.8 percent. Sales at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Europe's biggest carmaker, rose 8.4 percent, both for the group and its core namesake brand, as the German company continues to recover from its diesel emissions test-rigging scandal. Its market share remained roughly stable year-on-year at 24.3 percent. The only carmakers to report falling sales last month were Jaguar Land Rover, down 9.3 percent, Japanese carmakers Honda and Mazda, falling 14.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively, and Opel Group, down 1.7 percent. All five major national markets, except for the United Kingdom, recorded sales increases last month, led by Germany, where registrations increased 12.9 percent, and followed by Spain, where sales were up 11.2 percent. UK sales dropped 8.5 percent.  In the first five months of the year, European registrations increased 5.1 percent to 6.92 million vehicles, ACEA added.

The Japanese yen remained near a two-week low against the dollar after the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged as expected even as its U.S. counterpart signalled further tightening. It was trading 0.3 percent lower at 111.23 yen per dollar after the BOJ left in place its program to buy Japanese government bonds, and kept its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and its 10-year government bond yield target at around zero percent. As expected, the central bank offered a more upbeat view on private consumption and overseas economies, signalling its confidence that the recovery was gaining momentum. Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.7 percent, narrowing its loss for the week to 0.3 percent.  The market was relieved that there was no mention of an exit strategy, at least for now,  said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped about 0.1 percent, on track to end the week down 0.85 percent. Financial spreadbetters expect Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 to all open up about 0.2 percent. Overnight, the Nasdaq led losses on Wall Street with a 0.5 percent drop, dragged lower by shares including Apple and Alphabet that tumbled on bearish analysts' reports. The S&P; 500 technology index also declined 0.5 percent. The broader S&P; 500 index fell 0.2 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 percent.  It was a brutal day for the tech sector once again as investors are increasingly more worried about the (Federal Reserve) tightening cycle and how that would put a number of firms in trouble,  Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets in London, wrote in a note.  The tech boom has been on the back of easy money and lower interest rates. Both of them are leaving town.  South Korea's KOSPI slipped about 0.1 percent, surrendering early gains. The biggest company, Samsung Electronics added 0.1 percent. The second biggest firm, semiconductor concern SK Hynix , hit a 15-year high before pulling back to trade 0.2 percent lower. The technology-heavy Taiwan index widened gains to 0.6 percent, with the biggest company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. jumping 1.7 percent and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry surging 2.5 percent.  This is long overdue... There's a clear discrepancy, where Asia and emerging market tech names are still being discounted compared to their western counterparts,  said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.  Historically that made sense, but politically, things are potentially a lot more stable in Asia than in developed markets as a whole.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, climbed to a two-week high. Data overnight showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment fell more than expected last week, and better-than-expected business conditions in June bolstered the case for Federal Reserve tightening this year. The index rose 0.1 percent to 97.539, extending Thursday's 0.5 percent gain. It's on track for a 0.3 percent rise this week. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates as widely expected, and also released some preliminary details of its plan to begin paring its $4 trillion-plus debt holdings. Sterling added almost 0.1 percent to $1.2769. On Thursday, it jumped to as high as $1.2795 on signs of a shift in the Bank of England's stance on keeping interest rates at record lows. But it fell back to close flat, as monetary policy uncertainty added to existing concerns about Britain's political outlook after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election. In commodities, oil was subdued on continued worries over rising U.S. gasoline inventories adding to already elevated global supply. U.S. crude fell 0.1 percent to $44.49 a barrel, remaining near Thursday's six-week low, on track for a 2.9 percent drop for the week. Global benchmark Brent crept up 0.1 percent to $46.97, set to end the week 2.45 percent lower. The dollar's strength kept gold flat at $1,252.92 an ounce, failing to make up Thursday's 0.6 percent drop. It is poised to close the week with a 1 percent loss, its second weekly decline.

Industrial and financial sectors accounted for nearly half of the gains, with Airports of Thailand climbing as much as 2.3 to a record high.     Indonesian shares were down for a second consecutive day with consumer goods and financial stocks being the top losers. Unilever Indonesia Tbk Pt declined as much as 2.9 percent.     On Thursday, Indonesia's central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, saying the current level still fits efforts to maintain stability and support growth.     Philippine shares fell for a second consecutive session, with the industrial sector making up for most of the losses.

The Alpine country is preparing to dismantle bank secrecy next year when it begins sending information about its customers' accounts to foreign tax agencies. But Switzerland's multi-trillion-dollar financial industry is seeking new safeguards to protect bank data against misuse that could expose clients to crimes such as kidnapping or blackmail.  Data could be sold or used to put pressure on clients or their families,  said Yves Mirabaud, chairman of the Association of Swiss Private Banks and senior managing partner at Mirabaud, a Geneva-based private bank.  I'm referring to countries where we're not very sure that the democratic process is the same as ours, or where corruption is very high.  Wealthy clients have pulled tens of billions of dollars out of Swiss bank accounts because of a worldwide crackdown on tax evasion following the global financial crisis last decade. That culminated in the Automatic Exchange of Information programme fostered by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which aims to ensure that offshore accounts are known to authorities. The participation of Switzerland, the world's largest centre for overseas wealth, in the data exchange agreement was heralded at the time as a major breakthrough in ending tax avoidance. Banks in Switzerland are  fully committed  to implementing the Automatic Exchange of Information, said a spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association, the main banking lobby. But they are lobbying to add an  activation  clause that means information would only be handed over to a country if two criteria are met -- a level playing field with other financial centres, and an assurance the data will be used properly. They say giving information to countries in regions such as South America or Africa, where data protection standards can be weak and corruption rife, risks it falling into the wrong hands. In 2018 Switzerland is due to start swapping information with 38 foreign tax authorities, including all European Union countries, and with a further 41 from 2019. The proposed clause would apply to the 2019 batch of countries, among which are several emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico and Russia.  We want to be sure that when we provide information that it does not get misused or compromise a client's security,  said Boris Collardi, chief executive at Julius Baer, Switzerland's third-biggest private bank behind UBS and Credit Suisse. The Swiss government will send to parliament a dispatch, which contains its proposals on the exchange of information with these 41 countries, by July 5. Parliament will then be asked to decide on the implementation of these plans. Diamonds in a Toothpaste Tube Mirabaud expressed confidence the government supports the clause, despite lobbyists for transparency saying it is a back-door attempt to continue bank secrecy rather than a genuine move to prevent criminality or persecution. A spokeswoman for the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters, an arm of the finance ministry, signalled the government would consider halting transfers of information.  If there are concerns about how the data will be used in a specific jurisdiction, Switzerland could look at taking any of the measures provided for in the multilateral framework governing the automatic exchange of information,  she said, referring to steps that include suspending the data exchange with a country. Campaigners against secrecy are crying foul, however, and accuse the Swiss of trying to allow the wealthy to keep cash hidden.  That information might fall into the hands of kidnappers... is the perfect excuse,  said Nicholas Shaxson of Tax Justice Network, an organisation that lobbies on tax havens.   It's a justification for an ocean of fraud.  Pressure on Switzerland built after a U.S.-led crackdown starting in 2008 publicised practices used by its bankers to keep money hidden from tax authorities, from smuggling diamonds in toothpaste tubes to hiding documents in the pages of Sports Illustrated. This U.S. clampdown and the push by the OECD to bring in global rules on exchanging tax data between countries means that Switzerland handing over information to Europe and the United States is unavoidable.  Perfect Excuse  Data from the Swiss National Bank shows a sharp decline in U.S. money in Swiss accounts. U.S. customers accounted for 161 billion Swiss francs  ($165.3 billion) of bank deposits in 2006, but that had more than halved in 2015. In the meantime, the size of deposits from many emerging market countries has gradually increased. Mark Herkenrath of Alliance Sud, a group that campaigns for transparency, is sceptical about the true motivation.  For a lot of Swiss banks, a big part of their business is breaking away because money from the U.S. has dried up. The temptation now is to continue taking money from developing countries,  he said.  The suggestion that they are shielding their customers from abuse of their human rights is the perfect excuse to avoid transparency.  The Paris-based OECD, which will police whether the exchange of information is working, is optimistic that Switzerland will honour the deal. But it stands ready to act in case the Swiss banks drag their feet.  It's not going to be used as an excuse,  said Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD's tax policy director, acknowledging the banks' argument for preventing the misuse of information.  But if it is, the country will be sanctioned.  $1 = 0.9741 Swiss francs Editing by Catherine Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/swiss-banks-secrecy-idUSL8N1JC4IX"},

New passenger car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association increased to 1.43 million vehicles last month, according to the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers (ACEA).   In volume terms, this result comes close to May 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis hit the auto industry,  the industry group said in a statement. European car sales returned to annual growth in 2014 after a six-year slump during which registrations fell to their lowest in decades. Demand has been growing most months since, as an improvement in consumer confidence, retail incentives and new product launches lured customers back to the showrooms. The May increase comes after registrations dropped the previous month, given fewer trading days around Easter and thanks to a double-digit sales decline in Britain. May's growth was led by Japanese carmakers Suzuki (7269.T) and Toyota (7203.T), up 21.4 percent and 19.6 percent respectively, and Germany's Daimler (DAIGn.DE), up 14 percent.  Sales from the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) stable rose 11.9 percent, as a 47.8 percent jump for sporty Alfa Romeo models helped offset a 7.3 percent drop for its Jeep SUV brand.  France's Renault (RENA.PA) recorded a 10.4 percent rise in registrations, outpacing domestic rival PSA Group (PEUP.PA), whose sales increased 4.8 percent. Sales at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Europe's biggest carmaker, rose 8.4 percent, both for the group and its core namesake brand, as the German company continues to recover from its diesel emissions test-rigging scandal. Its market share remained roughly stable year-on-year at 24.3 percent. The only carmakers to report falling sales last month were Jaguar Land Rover, down 9.3 percent, Japanese carmakers Honda and Mazda, falling 14.5 percent and 2.3 percent respectively, and Opel Group, down 1.7 percent. All five major national markets, except for the United Kingdom, recorded sales increases last month, led by Germany, where registrations increased 12.9 percent, and followed by Spain, where sales were up 11.2 percent. UK sales dropped 8.5 percent.  In the first five months of the year, European registrations increased 5.1 percent to 6.92 million vehicles, ACEA added.

The deadline marks the first concrete timetable for a U.S.-Australia refugee swap arrangement that sparked tensions between the strong allies after President Donald Trump described it as  a dumb deal  for America.   U.S. officials representing Homeland Security this week returned to Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, home to one of two Australian-administered detention centers in the Pacific, to conduct medical examinations on 70 men. The men last month completed  extreme vetting  interviews that lasted up to six hours, with in-depth questions on associates, family, friends and any interactions with the Islamic State militant group. After completing the medical tests, refugees were told to expect a decision on their resettlement applications within six weeks, two of the Manus Island detainees told Reuters.  They took some blood and did a chest X-ray. Afterwards they told me I would get a decision within 45 days,  said one refugee who declined to be named for fear for jeopardizing his application. It is not clear how many of the 70 men vetted will be accepted for resettlement in the United States. The refugees include men from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Myanmar. A spokeswoman for Australia's Minister for Immigration Peter Dutton declined to comment. Former U.S. President Obama agreed a deal with Australia late last year to offer refuge to up to 1,250 asylum seekers, a deal the Trump administration said it would only honor to maintain a strong relationship with Australia and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks. In exchange, Australia has pledged to take Central American refugees from a center in Costa Rica, where the United States has taken in a larger number of people in recent years. FILE PHOTO - A sign adorns the security fence near shelters inside the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea, February 11, 2017.   Behrouz Boochani/Handout viaFile photoThe swap is designed, in part, to help Australia close one of its offshore centers that is expensive to run and has been widely criticized by the United Nations and others over treatment of detainees. Trump's resistance to the refugee deal had strained relations with a key Asia Pacific ally, triggering a fractious phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier this year. Trump's concession and a series of high-level visits by U.S. dignities has since help mend connections between the two countries.  Underscoring the improved relations, the U.S. embassy said on Thursday it considered a leaked video of Turnbull apparently making fun of Trump and alluding to ties with Russia  with the good humor that was intended . Australia's hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing to camps at Manus and on the South Pacific island of Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Human rights groups have condemned the intercept policy and the harsh conditions of the camps. Australia says offshore processing is needed as a deterrent after thousands of people drowned at sea before the policy was introduced in 2013. Under pressure, Australia and Papua New Guinea will close the Manus detention center on Oct. 31, by which time Australia's hopes to have relocated the hundreds of men classified as refugees. But the fate of approximately 200 men deemed non-refugees is uncertain. Those not offered resettlement in the United States will be offered the chance to settle in Papua New Guinea or return home. Australia has already offered detainees up to $25,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, an offer few have taken up.

China is in the middle of a reform program aimed at shaking up its bloated, debt-ridden state sector with the aim of creating  innovative and globally competitive multinationals . But China's leaders have repeatedly stressed that while firms need be more competitive and respond better to the market, they must also continue to fulfill their  strategic  functions under the strengthened leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.  Xiao Yaqing, chairman of the State-Owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), said China should not waver in its efforts to make state-owned firms  strong and big . But China must  resolutely resist erroneous thinking such as 'privatization', 'denationalization' and 'removing the leading role' (of SOEs),  Xiao wrote in Study Times, the Communist Party's theoretical journal.  To develop and strengthen the state-owned economy, (China)must strengthen the substantive and political foundations of Party rule,  he said. The government is currently driving through a series of ownership reforms designed to inject private capital into government enterprises. It is also urging firms in a variety of industrial sectors to merge, to end  duplication  and irrational competition. Xiao said the government currently manages company assets worth 144.1 trillion yuan ($21.14 trillion), and SOEs contribute a fifth of total tax receipts and account for more than 40 million jobs, as well as more than 10 million Communist Party members.

China is in the middle of a reform program aimed at shaking up its bloated, debt-ridden state sector with the aim of creating  innovative and globally competitive multinationals . But China's leaders have repeatedly stressed that while firms need be more competitive and respond better to the market, they must also continue to fulfill their  strategic  functions under the strengthened leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.  Xiao Yaqing, chairman of the State-Owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), said China should not waver in its efforts to make state-owned firms  strong and big . But China must  resolutely resist erroneous thinking such as 'privatization', 'denationalization' and 'removing the leading role' (of SOEs),  Xiao wrote in Study Times, the Communist Party's theoretical journal.  To develop and strengthen the state-owned economy, (China)must strengthen the substantive and political foundations of Party rule,  he said. The government is currently driving through a series of ownership reforms designed to inject private capital into government enterprises. It is also urging firms in a variety of industrial sectors to merge, to end  duplication  and irrational competition. Xiao said the government currently manages company assets worth 144.1 trillion yuan ($21.14 trillion), and SOEs contribute a fifth of total tax receipts and account for more than 40 million jobs, as well as more than 10 million Communist Party members.

The aviation-to-financial services group said Guo had injured HNA's  business reputation arising from repeated false and defamatory statements , according to a summons filed in the New York State Supreme Court on Thursday. Guo did not respond immediately to requests for comment by Reuters, nor did he immediately mention HNA's lawsuit on Twitter, where he often issues statements. The summons, seen by Reuters, cites allegations that  officials in China's Communist Party and their relatives are undisclosed shareholders  in the group, and that subsidiary Hainan Airlines had allowed government officials and their relatives to use its aircraft  for purely personal reasons . HNA said in a statement posted on its website late on Thursday that Guo's allegations had harmed its reputation and that it intended to vigorously pursue its claim. Chinese-born Guo, who lives in New York, has emerged in recent months as a political threat to the Chinese government in an acutely sensitive year, making clear that he wants to disrupt a five-yearly congress to be held this autumn. Through Twitter posts and video blogs, Guo has unleashed a deluge of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials. Guo began making specific allegations against HNA in April but the group did not respond publicly until last week, when it issued a denial and threatened legal action. Guo has said he will soon make additional revelations in a scheduled live online interview with U.S.-based Chinese-language political gossip site Mingjing. Last week, he urged HNA to make good on its threat to sue.  If it's just me speaking, that's no good,  he said in a livestreamed video.  Only their replies can prove the value and the truth of the matter. This is critical.  Several other legal cases are pending against Guo. Nine Chinese creditors launched a $50 million lawsuit in New York on Tuesday to recover outstanding debts. Last week, three of Guo's senior employees told a Chinese court he had instructed them to fraudulently obtain loans running into hundreds of millions of dollars. Guo is also being sued in New York for defamation by the chairman of property developer SOHO China, Pan Shiyi, and prominent journalist Hu Shuli. He has provided scant evidence to back up his accusations, but his standing as a former billionaire insider, and his close ties with a disgraced former senior intelligence official, have made him a centre of attention in Beijing political circles. The Chinese government requested that Interpol issue a global  red notice  for Guo's arrest in April.

South Korea is the world's fifth-biggest consumer of nuclear energy, and one of few countries to export its technology, having won an order to build reactors in the United Arab Emirates. But a scandal over forged certificates for spare parts in 2012 and the 2011 Fukushima meltdown in neighboring Japan have undermined public support for nuclear power, while the new left-leaning government aims to speed up plans to move away from both coal and nuclear. Another 11 of South Korea's 25 reactors are set to shut down by 2030 as they reach the end of their operating lives, although some may push to have their operating licenses renewed.  With the country still setting its long-term energy plans, it is unclear how many will be replaced by new reactors.  Since Kori No.1 began operations on June 19, 1977, the 587-megawatt reactor has generated enough electricity to meet the entire country's current demand for around 100 days, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission.  I feel sad because it's like telling me to bury your own child as he turned 40,  88-year-old Lee Chang-kun, who worked as an engineer at the Kori No.1 plant, told Reuters.  The reactor was built by Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO), based on technology by now bankrupt U.S. firm Westinghouse. Suh Kyun-ryul, professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University, said the closure would set the stage for South Korea's aim of scaling back nuclear power. An energy ministry official estimated it will take at least 15 years to fully dismantle Kori No. 1, at a cost of about 644 billion won ($571 million). Some experts hope that shutting the reactor may help South Korea catch up to the United States, Japan and Germany in decommissioning plants. The global decommissioning market is expected to grow to about $980 billion by 2050, according to a report by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.  The Kori No. 1 closure  ... could work as a testbed for dismantling nuclear power plants,  said Kim Chang-lak, a nuclear engineering professor at KEPCO International Nuclear Graduate School.  It should help efforts to standardize technology for other Korean nuclear reactors and tap into the global market.

The price of the benchmark 10-year JGB futures, which had shed as much as 0.12 point earlier in the session, were last down 0.03 point at 150.43. The yield on the 10-year cash benchmark bonds stood flat at 0.050 percent. The BOJ kept its two main interest rates targets -- minus 0.10 percent for a portion of banks' excess reserves and zero percent for the 10-year JGB yield. The central bank's policy statement stated that the pace of increase in its JGB holding will be about 80 trillion yen a year, even though the bank's actual pace has been falling behind that level for the past several months. At the end of last month, its increase was just over 70 trillion yen. The longer end of the market was softer, taking cues from the decline in global bond markets, after hawkish signals from the Bank of England and stronger-than-expected U.S. jobless claims figures.

The Nikkei soared 0.9 percent to as much as 20,015.16 in early afternoon trade, its highest since June 9 after the BOJ kept monetary policy steady as expected, before quickly paring gains. The benchmark is on track to fall 0.2 percent for the week. The BOJ also left unchanged a loose pledge to keep increasing bond holdings at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($729 billion). It upgraded its assessment of private consumption and overseas growth, signalling confidence that an export-driven economic recovery was broadening and gaining momentum. Investors concerned whether the BOJ would communicate its exit strategy without causing market turmoil took solace from the fact that its announcement made no mention of exiting from the ultra-loose policy, traders said.  The market was relieved that there was no mention of an exit strategy, at least for now,  said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.  Kuroda may or may not mention that in his press conference later, but for now, the market took heart from a policy decision without a surprise,  he added, in a reference to central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda.

Mark Reynolds led off the ninth with a single against Hunter Strickland (1-2). Ian Desmond fouled out. Pinch hitter Carlos Gonzalez walked on four pitches, setting the stage for Tapia, who went 2-for-5 with two RBIs after going 4-for-4 on Wednesday. The Rockies, who are 10-2 in one-run games, led 8-1 after three innings -- a lead that vanished when the Giants packed eight runs into the seventh, eighth and ninth. The loss was the 12th in 16 games for the Giants, who are a season-high 16 games below .500. The Rockies inflicted most of their damage on starter Matt Moore, whose limited history at Coors Field has been dreadful. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at RockiesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchDJ LeMahieu had his sixth career four-hit game, scored three runs and drove in two. Nolan Arenado hit three doubles and drove in four runs. After the Giants erupted for five runs in the eighth to make it a one-run game, closer Greg Holland (1-0) came on in the ninth and blew a save for the first time this season. He gave up a leadoff single to Austin Slater, who went 4-for-5, but struck out Nick Hundley. Denard Span lined a single to center, sending Slater to third. Span took second on a wild pitch, causing the Rockies to draw in their infield. Slater scored on Gorkys Hernandez's sacrifice fly, just beating center fielder Charlie Blackmon's throw and giving Holland his first blown save in 24 opportunities. Span stole third but was thrown out at home when he tried to advance on a ball that got away from catcher Tom Murphy. The play was reviewed, and the call was upheld. Moore gave up a season-high 11 hits and eight runs in three innings, his shortest start of the season, but he did pile up seven strikeouts, all swinging. In four starts at Coors Field, Moore is 0-3 with a 14.73 ERA and has yielded 32 hits in 14 2/3 innings. The Rockies pounced on Moore for three runs in the first, beginning with five straight hits. A run scored on Arenado's double, and Reynolds singled him home. Arenado doubled home two more runs in the second. He scored on a double by Ian Desmond, who crossed the plate on Tapia's two-out single. Charlie Blackmon tripled home a run in the third to make it 8-1. He leads the majors with nine triples, tying his career-high set two years ago. The big lead was a boon to Rockies starter Jeff Hoffman, who needed a career-high 103 pitches to weave his way through five innings. He gave up one run and seven hits. Arenado doubled home a run in the sixth, but Buster Posey cut the lead to 9-3 with a two-run homer in the seventh off Scott Oberg. The homer was Posey's ninth and just his second since May 15. Hundley homered in San Francisco's five-run eighth when pitcher Ty Blach delivered a run-scoring, pinch-hit single to trim the deficit to 9-5. Jake McGee came on with two outs and runners at first and second and gave up a three-run homer to Brandon Crawford that made it a one-run game and ended McGee's scoreless streak at 14 innings. It was the first time the Giants, who are last in the majors with 52 home runs, hit three in a game since May 22 at the Chicago Cubs.

Thirteen soldiers died and about 40 were wounded during a 14-hour battle that showed recapturing Marawi City from an estimated 150-200 Islamic State militants was becoming harder by the day. The troops were hit by rocket propelled grenades and came under sniper fire as they crossed bridges over the Agus river toward the city's commercial center, an area held by the militants since May 23.  The snipers are good, they make sure that with every shot, someone is killed or wounded,  said Pendaton Guro, a retired colonel who recognized the popping sound of the high caliber rifles while watching the battle daily from his rooftop overlooking the city. The offensive to retake the town, in the middle of the southern Philippines region of Mindanao, is now in its fourth week. And, the longer the militants hold out, the more President Rodrigo Duterte's image as a strong man could suffer. Two weeks ago the general leading the offensive was relieved of command, and Duterte assured Filippinos that Marawi would be cleared of militants in a matter of days. The protracted battle is reinforcing fears in nearby Indonesia and Malaysia, both of which have Muslim majorities, that Islamic State could seek to set up a regional caliphate as it holds onto territory in Southeast Asia for the first time. Withering Fire During last Friday's assault, Technical Sergeant Mahamud Darang said his armored carrier came under fire from a black-clad militant firing rocket-propelled grenades as a column of troops crossed the Agus River toward the commercial center of Marawi City, an area held by the militants since May 23. The first grenade hit the ground in front of them, Darang told Reuters. He then spotted the shooter, just before he fired again.  He was on the third floor of a building. Then the second one came right into the vehicle and blew up,  said Darang, speaking from a hospital bed, his head and shoulders bandaged from shrapnel wounds.  One soldier died and Darang and some of the others were wounded. Bleeding, the 21-year army veteran ordered his comrades to dismount from the burning vehicle and take cover in a nearby building. The four soldiers were rescued later and taken to hospital. The rest of the contingent also came under withering fire from militants in buildings, six to seven storys high, as they crossed the low-lying Mapandi bridge over the river. Some were hit by Molotov cocktails. Despite his hostile attitude to Washington since taking power a year ago, Duterte could be forced to seek greater support from the United States.  Some U.S. special forces soldiers are providing technical support in Marawi under a long-standing arrangement, and a P3 Orion spy plane and drone aircraft have provided reconnaissance, but U.S. troops are not directly involved in the fighting.  At least eight soldiers on the frontlines in Marawi told Reuters the militants were using accurate sniper fire, grenades and firebombs to hold off advancing troops, despite daily bombing raids and artillery fire on their positions. Many spoke anonymously as they were not authorized to speak to media. The military says 310 people have been killed, including 59 soldiers, 225 militants and 26 civilians. Residents who have fled the shattered city said they have seen least 100 bodies in the rubble and in battle zones.  Reinforced Buildings, High Ground Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera, a military spokesman, said on Thursday that the army had retaken higher ground to the east of the city, reducing the enemy's field of fire. Three bridges over the Agus were also now under the army's control, Herrera said.  Many of the militants are locals, from the Marawi region. Military officials say they have been joined by battle-hardened Islamic State fighters from as far away as Yemen and Morocco. The ill-equipped Philippines military has mostly operated against rebels in mountainous territory or on remote islands and is unused to urban warfare.  Aiding the militants is Mindanao's history of clan warfare - known in the local dialect as rido – and most buildings in Marawi have basements and are built with walls of thick concrete.  The culture of this region is they have built their houses like fortresses,  said one of the frontline army commanders.  They want to protect their families. They know how to make guns. That's also part of the rido culture.  The military says its attacks have to be tempered with caution because of civilians trapped in the cross-fire and because it does not want to assault one of the city's numerous mosques.  The most fearsome weapon the militants have is a sniper rifle modeled on the U.S.-made .50 caliber Barrett. If the army uses armored carriers, the militants respond with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) that can penetrate the armor, or shower metal splinters within the vehicle.   Their RPGs make it hard for our armor to advance. If we get too close, they will fire RPGs,  said a soldier, who said he had lost four close comrades in the siege. Troops have responded by rigging wooden panels – adorned with painted images of skulls or slogans - on their  Simba  armored personnel carriers to repel rockets. A grenade  will explode as soon as it hits the wood block, and it will not explode on the metal,  a combat policeman told Reuters. Well-Stocked Although the military has said it has thrown a cordon around the city, the militants appeared to have good stocks of food and ammunition. The assault on Marawi began just before the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when many Muslim families store food because they do not eat in daylight hours.  They put ammunition and different arms in different places,  said Marawi City police commander Superintendent Marlon Tabaya.  I believe they have planned it for a long time.  The military is using OV-10 planes for regular bombing raids and has pressed tanks into battle, and some units are armed with M-16 assault rifles.  A combat policeman who spent nine days on the frontlines, however, lamented the state of his equipment.  We have no kevlar vests, helmets or new weapons,  he said. Despite the difficulties, troops are confident they will make a breakthrough.  Two front line officers told Reuters radio intercepts indicated that the militants' ammunition, arms and food supplies were running low.  There were also signs of discord between the different groups fighting in the city, who come from at least three different Muslim-majority ethnic groups.  They are calling each other, looking for help, thinking they have left each other,  an army radio officer said.  They are demoralized.  Lieutenant Colonel Herrera said the military was advancing toward the inner city, but added:  There are still sniper positions. We continue to assess the battlefield. The battlefield is very fluid.  Darang, the wounded armored carrier commander, said he was eager to return to battle.  When I recover I will go back there to fight,  he said. A Muslim himself, from Cotobato City in Mindanao, the 47-year-old soldier was filled with disdain for the militants.  They are not good Muslims. How could they attack us during Ramadan, these people have no religion.

China's weak producer inflation and investment data also dented sentiment this week as it reinforced concerns of a renewed slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy. China's blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.2 percent, to 3,522.03 points by the lunch break, declining 1.5 percent for the week - the first weekly decline since early May. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3 percent, to 3,124.42 points. The Hang Seng index added 0.4 percent to 25,677.88 points, but is on track for a 1.4 percent weekly loss, the biggest since early March. The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index , which fell sharply on Thursday, rebounded 0.5 percent, to 10,400.93. The rally in China's blue-chips, which have far outperformed small-caps this year, appear to be losing steam amid signs of monetary tightening and renewed economic weakness. Yu Gang, analyst at Zhongtai Securities, said that upside potential for mainland shares is limited, as liquidity remains tight while borrowing costs rise. In a sign that China's central bank intends to stabilize market sentiment, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected a net 410 billion yuan  ($60.17 billion) into money markets this week, the biggest weekly injection since mid-January. Most sectors in China fell, with property and consumer shares leading the decline. In Hong Kong, many of the sectors rebounded on Friday after the sharp falls the previous session.

The area, home to six of China's 10 smoggiest cities in the first quarter of this year, has promised to upgrade or shut vast swathes of polluting industry as it tries to meet 2017 air quality targets. But financing the transition to cleaner energy has proved one of its biggest challenges, especially in poorer rural regions of Hebei, where the switch from coal to natural gas is expected to cost at least 300 billion yuan ($44.04 billion) over the 2016-2020 period. The financing platform was launched by the ADB and the China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation (I&G;), the State Development and Investment Corporation (SDIC), as well as China's finance ministry and National Development and Reform Commission.  The bank late last year approved a loan of 458 million euros ($510.58 million) for the platform, which it says will leverage 3.6 billion euros in domestic commercial financing. According to Hebei delegates attending an annual session of parliament in March, the government is only expected to provide around 10-15 percent of the 3-4 trillion yuan of green investment China needs every year over the next five years.   China began to develop green financing in 2007, and more than 8 trillion yuan in  green credit , used to finance clean projects, has been issued. However, environmental financing mechanisms remain inadequate, especially when it comes to tackling widespread soil and water pollution, and SMEs have also struggled to get funding.   The reality is, even though SMEs realize the need to invest in cleaner production facilities, they often do not have access to finance,  said Ayumi Konishi, Director General of ADB's East Asia Department, at a ceremony in Beijing on Friday. China selected five regions this week to take part in pilot government green financing schemes, the cabinet said on Wednesday. It promised to back financial institutions in their efforts to set up green financing businesses, encourage small loans and provide support to venture capital and private equity funds participating in green investment programs. It also said it would explore new green credit mechanisms, including the granting of loans that accept emission trading earnings as collateral.

Laying out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami, Trump will issue a presidential directive to reverse some of the loosened regulations that Obama introduced after a 2014 breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes, senior White House officials said. Trump, taking a tougher approach against Havana after promising to do so during the presidential campaign, will outline stricter enforcement of a long-time ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists and will seek to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the new U.S. administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. But, facing pressure from U.S. business and some of his fellow Republicans to avoid turning back the clock completely in relations with communist-ruled Cuba, he also will leave intact many of Obama’s steps toward normalization. The new policy will ban most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group (GAESA), a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy, but make some exceptions, including for air and sea travel, the officials said. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise-ship companies now serving the island. However, Trump will stop short of closing embassies or breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility and will not cut off recently resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights - though his more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties. The administration, according to one White House official, does not intend to “disrupt” existing business ventures such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a Havana hotel. Nor are there plans to reinstate limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the island’s coveted rum and cigars that Americans can bring home for personal use. As a result, the changes – though far-reaching – appear to be less sweeping than many U.S. pro-engagement advocates had feared. Human Rights Trump will justify his partial reversal of Obama’s measures to a large extent on human rights grounds. His aides contend that Obama’s easing of U.S. restrictions amounted to  appeasement  and has done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. Saying that the aim was to repair what Trump has called a “bad deal” struck by Obama, U.S. officials said the new administration would leave the door open to improved relations if Cuba undertakes democratic reforms such as allowing free elections and releasing political prisoners. International human rights groups say, however, that reinstating a U.S. policy of isolating the island could make the situation worse by empowering Cuban hardliners. The Cuban government has made clear it will not be pressured into reforms in exchange for further engagement with Washington. “If you want Cuba to change and reform, we are doing the opposite of what would be most likely to bring about reforms,” said Ben Rhodes, a former Obama aide who helped negotiate rapprochement. Trump’s critics have also questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for its human rights record while downplaying the issue in other parts of the world. Trump will announce his new approach early Friday afternoon at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami’s Little Havana, the heart of America’s largest Cuban-American community, whose support aides believe helped him win Florida in the election. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a key player in forging the new policy, was expected to attend along with other Cuban-American lawmakers. Under Trump’s order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations and they will not take effect until they are complete. No deadline has been set, the officials said. Under the revised travel policy, U.S. officials say there will be tighter enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the 12 authorized categories they claim to be traveling under, which could spook many visitors, wary of receiving a hefty fine. While tourism to Cuba is banned by U.S. law, the Obama administration had been allowing people to travel to Cuba as part of “people to people” educational trips for visitors, a popular classification that a White House official said was “ripe for abuse” by those looking for beach vacations. Trump’s new policy will eliminate such self-certified visits by individuals while still allowing them to be done as group tours, and also retaining some individual travel under other authorized categories such as religious, artistic and journalistic activities, officials said. In a contentious internal debate, some aides argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a campaign promise to Cuban-Americans.

But one group of investors is heading the other way - concerned that shale may become a victim of its own success. The speed of the recovery in the U.S. shale industry in the past year has surprised oil investors after a global supply glut led to a two-year crude price slump and bankrupted many shale firms. Eight prominent hedge funds have reduced the size of their positions in ten of the top shale firms by over $400 million, concerned producers are pumping oil so fast they will undo the nascent recovery in the industry after OPEC and some non-OPEC producers agreed to cut supply in November.  The funds, with assets of $286 billion and substantial energy holdings, cut exposure to firms that are either pure-play Permian companies or that derive significant revenues from the region, according to an analysis of their investments based on Reuters data. The Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), accounting for more than a quarter of overall U.S. crude production.  We'll have to see if these U.S. producers have the discipline to not go crazy and keep prices where they keep making money,  said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Dallas-based investment firm Hodges Capital Management. Hodges Capital owns shares of Permian play firms including Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O), RSP Permian Inc (RSPP.N) and Callon Petroleum Co (CPE.N). Bradshaw's firm has maintained its exposure to the Permian. There is no sign that shale producers will restrain production. They redeployed rigs and personnel quickly since prices began strengthening in 2016 and made shale profitable again; rig counts have risen by 40 percent this year in the Permian, which accounts for about half of all U.S. onshore oil rigs.  Hedge funds pulled back in the first quarter, according to the most recently available regulatory filings, and the stocks have continued to struggle as oil prices have come under renewed pressure. The value of these funds' positions in the 10 Permian companies declined by 14 percent, to $2.66 billion in the first quarter, the most recent data available, from $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Hedge funds have continued to reduce their exposure to energy stocks in the second quarter, said Mark Connors, global head of portfolio and risk advisory at Credit Suisse, though he could not provide figures specific to shale companies. Margins Squeezed Fund managers interviewed expressed concern that volatile oil prices along with rising service costs and acreage prices are not reflected in overly optimistic projections for the Permian.  The funds analyzed include Pointstate Capital LP, a $25 billion fund with 16 percent in energy shares, and Arosa Capital Management, a $2.1 billion fund with more than 90 percent of assets in energy stocks. Pointstate and Arosa declined comment.  Margins will continue to be squeezed by a 15 to 20 percent increase in service costs in the Permian basin,  said Michael Roomberg, portfolio manager of the Miller/Howard Drill Bit to Burner Tip Fund. A Reuters analysis of 10 Permian producers, including several that almost exclusively operate in Texas, carry an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 35, compared with the overall energy sector's P/E ratio of about 17.8.      These are not great returns, but the problem is the market is rewarding them,  said an analyst at one of the hedge funds on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Concerns about lofty land prices are driving some of the pullback by hedge funds, according to two fund analysts who could not speak on the record. Values for Permian acreage have increased 30 percent from two years ago, according to Detring Energy Advisors in Houston.  The 10 Permian stocks analyzed have, on average, dropped 18 percent so year, compared with the broader S&P; 500 energy sector's 13 percent fall.  Permian production is expected to reach 2.47 million bpd by July, a 330,000 bpd increase from the beginning of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Department.  Last month the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other key producers, including Russia, extended a historic output cut agreement to combat a global glut.  However, production from non-OPEC countries, especially the U.S., continues to rise and weigh on prices. U.S. crude prices CLc1 on Wednesday hit a six-month low just above $44 per barrel.  Reuters analysis shows many shale companies reduced hedges in the first quarter, leaving them vulnerable to falling oil prices. Still, fund managers say compared to other U.S. plays, the Permian still has the lowest break-even costs.  In terms of the time horizon, the economics of the Permian are so good they’re going to keep on drilling,  said Colin Davies, senior analyst at oil services company AB Bernstein.

Banks have criticized the tax as unfair since its unveiling last month, but executives on Friday told lawmakers they agreed with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's assessment that it would not threaten the financial system. The lenders also pressed for legislation to be amended to include foreign banks, such as HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA.L) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), to help them stay competitive in low-profit margin markets such as trade finance and bond trading.   All we ask is that we be put into the same position as the foreign banks and that the levy be applied to them given the advantage their scale gives on a global basis and here in Australia,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) General Counsel Anna Lenahan told a senate committee. The tax on bank liabilities including corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit is forecast to raise $4.6 billion in its first four years to help Australia return to a budget surplus by 2021. But the tax, which is not yet in effect, lacks an expiration date sought by the banks. The tax, which has bipartisan backing, applies to banks with more than A$100 billion ($76 billion) of relevant liabilities in Australia, capturing the country's five largest domestic banks by assets. Many international banks operating in Australia fall short of that threshold locally, though they exceed it globally. But Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ.AX) told the committee the big five Australian banks' overseas branches would also be taxed under the legislation. National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX) Chief Financial Officer Gary Lennon said he doubted lawmakers' intent was to put Australian banks at a disadvantage to foreign rivals at home or anywhere else.  It is possible that it will change the profitability of some of our businesses,  he said of the levy.  Once you change the profitability we might be deploying less capital to those businesses or exiting that business.  Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) Chief Executive Nicholas Moore said the tax would inevitably make the bank less competitive but that there were no plans to move the firm's head office offshore as a result.   Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX) said there should be provisions to suspend the tax if bank profits were significantly affected. HSBC and Citigroup declined to comment. The senate committee will issue a report on the hearings on Monday. Both houses of parliament will vote on the tax next week.

The area, home to six of China's 10 smoggiest cities in the first quarter of this year, has promised to upgrade or shut vast swathes of polluting industry as it tries to meet 2017 air quality targets. But financing the transition to cleaner energy has proved one of its biggest challenges, especially in poorer rural regions of Hebei, where the switch from coal to natural gas is expected to cost at least 300 billion yuan ($44.04 billion) over the 2016-2020 period. The financing platform was launched by the ADB and the China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation (I&G;), the State Development and Investment Corporation (SDIC), as well as China's finance ministry and National Development and Reform Commission.  The bank late last year approved a loan of 458 million euros ($510.58 million) for the platform, which it says will leverage 3.6 billion euros in domestic commercial financing. According to Hebei delegates attending an annual session of parliament in March, the government is only expected to provide around 10-15 percent of the 3-4 trillion yuan of green investment China needs every year over the next five years.   China began to develop green financing in 2007, and more than 8 trillion yuan in  green credit , used to finance clean projects, has been issued. However, environmental financing mechanisms remain inadequate, especially when it comes to tackling widespread soil and water pollution, and SMEs have also struggled to get funding.   The reality is, even though SMEs realize the need to invest in cleaner production facilities, they often do not have access to finance,  said Ayumi Konishi, Director General of ADB's East Asia Department, at a ceremony in Beijing on Friday. China selected five regions this week to take part in pilot government green financing schemes, the cabinet said on Wednesday. It promised to back financial institutions in their efforts to set up green financing businesses, encourage small loans and provide support to venture capital and private equity funds participating in green investment programs. It also said it would explore new green credit mechanisms, including the granting of loans that accept emission trading earnings as collateral.

The China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) withdrew one agency's permit and shut down 35 websites or public accounts on WeChat - a leading instant messaging platform - during a targeted investigation launched last year that was aimed at those products, the regulator said in a statement on Friday. CIRC said that those activities have not only  distorted the order of the domestic insurance market  but also  disturbed the government's foreign currency management and led to asset outflows and even money laundering.  The regulator said in a statement posted on its website it would have  zero tolerance  for the illegal sales of Hong Kong products, but did not provide details about the activities. Chinese regulators, which have taken severe measures to halt the illegal outflows of funds since last year, are concerned that the purchase of overseas insurance products has become a channel for mainland Chinese to move money abroad, avoiding capital restrictions. The Hong Kong life insurance market has seen very strong demand from mainland Chinese in the past year, despite some curbs imposed on purchases of insurance by Chinese visitors to the city. Most recently, China's biggest bank card provider UnionPay said it would tighten regulations over how mainland customers can use its debit and credit cards to purchase Hong Kong insurance products, potentially restricting another gateway for capital flight. Hong Kong's life insurance market saw strong new business growth of 41.5 percent in 2016, with a significant portion of business coming from mainland Chinese customers, Standard & Poor's said. Hong Kong life premiums are expected to grow at a slower rate of 10 percent over the next two years, S&P; said, mainly due to curbs on using UnionPay cards for cross-border insurance-related purchases. Hong Kong's new insurance regulator told Reuters late last year it saw Chinese demand for Hong Kong insurance products staying strong because of their high quality despite recent curbs on such purchases.

The issuance consists of notes backed by Australian residential mortgages originated by Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA, AA-/Stable). The ratings are as follows: AUD2,208.00 million Class A1 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD93.60 million Class A2 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD49.92 million Class B notes: 'NRsf' AUD23.28 million Class C notes: 'NRsf' AUD9.60 million Class D notes: 'NRsf' AUD8.16 million Class E notes: 'NRsf' AUD7.44 million Class F notes: 'NRsf' The notes were issued by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited in its capacity as trustee of Medallion Trust Series 2017-1. The total collateral pool consisted of 8,588 obligors, totalling AUD2.4 billion, at the 31 May 2017 cut-off date. The pool stratifications of the closing pool are comparable with the AUD750 million launch pool. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sufficient Credit Support: The class A1 and A2 notes have sufficient credit enhancement of 8.0% and 4.1%, respectively, provided by the subordinated notes and are independent of any credit provided by lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI). Pool Characteristics: The portfolio's weighted-average (WA) seasoning is 30 months, with a WA unindexed loan/value ratio (LVR) of 59.6% and WA indexed LVR of 57.8%. The average obligor current loan size is AUD279,460; investment loans represent 25.1% of the pool by balance and interest-only loans represent 18.0%. LMI is present on 17.4% of the pool. Sequential/Pro Rata Paydown: Interest is paid sequentially after expenses towards all note classes senior to loss reimbursement. Interest on class B, C, D, E and F notes is subordinated if the stated amount of the note is, or ever has been, reduced to zero.  Principal is allocated pro rata towards class A1, A2, B, C, D, E and F notes if step-down requirements are met. Sufficient Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided via excess spread, principal draws and a liquidity facility initially sized at 0.75% of the aggregate note balance at closing, with a facility floor of AUD1.8 million. The liquidity facility will amortise annually in line with the reduction of the outstanding pool balance, subject to the floor and performance triggers. Strong Record: CBA has experience in mortgage lending and servicing. It originates loans through its nationwide branch network, mobile sales force, online and telephone sales operations and third-party mortgage brokers. Arrears of securitised Medallion transactions have generally tracked in-line or below Fitch's Dinkum Index for prime RMBS. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and are likely to result in a decline in credit enhancement and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased credit enhancement may make certain note ratings susceptible to negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis of the ratings by stressing the transaction's initial base-case assumptions. Analysis of the foreclosure scenarios found that the ratings on the class A1 and A2 notes were not affected under Fitch's moderate or severe foreclosure stress (15% and 30% increase) scenarios. The analysis of the recovery scenarios found that the ratings on the class A1 and A2 notes were not affected under Fitch's moderate recovery (15% decrease) scenario and the class A1 notes were not affected under Fitch's severe recovery (30% decrease) scenario. However, the ratings on the A2 notes decreased to 'AA+sf'. The analysis of Fitch's moderate combination stress of 15% increase in foreclosures and 15% decrease in recoveries found that the ratings on the class A1 and A2 notes were not affected. The class A1 notes were also unaffected under Fitch's severe combination stress of 30% increase in foreclosures and 30% decrease in recoveries, while the ratings on the class A2 notes decreased to 'AAsf''. LMI is not required to support the ratings on the class A1 and A2 notes due to the level of credit support provided by the lower-ranking notes. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es;) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under  Related Research  below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es; to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class, as detailed in the report titled  Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions , dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, which indicated no adverse findings material to the rating analysis. As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of CBA's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: Loan-by-loan data provided by CBA as at 31 May 2017 Transaction documentation provided by King & Wood Mallesons, the issuer's counsel. The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, added 0.1 percent to 97.491, and was up 0.6 percent for the week. The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 111.18 yen, on track to gain 1.1 percent for the week. It ticked up to a session high of 111.27 yen, its highest since June 2, after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as expected, before quickly paring its gain. The BOJ also upgraded its assessment of private consumption and overseas growth, signalling its confidence that an export-driven economic recovery was broadening and gaining momentum. Investors awaited a news conference at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT)with BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who is expected to reassure markets that the central bank was in no hurry to follow the Federal Reserve's tapering example, according to sources familiar with BOJ thinking.  With the BOJ, there were no big surprises there,  said Mitul Kotecha, head of Asia macro strategy for Barclays in Singapore.  Obviously, the dollar is reacting more positively today  than it did on Wednesday, after the downbeat U.S. economic data that preceded the Fed announcement. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates as widely expected, and also released some preliminary details of its plan to begin paring its $4 trillion-plus debt holdings. Ahead of the central bank's announcements, however, downbeat inflation and retail sales data earlier sent the dollar into a tailspin.  The dollar now seems to be getting over its shock from the core CPI release,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist for Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. He noted that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was relatively hawkish, releasing its plan for balance sheet reduction earlier than expected and keeping the interest rate outlook unchanged - despite market expectations for a slowing in the tempo of rate hikes.  It will be increasingly difficult to short the dollar, he added. Thursday's run of U.S. economic data gave dollar bulls some reason for cheer. The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 237,000 for the week ended June 10, lower than the 242,000 that economists had predicted. June readings of the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index and the Philadelphia Fed business conditions index also both surpassed economists' expectations. Higher yields underpinned the dollar. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was last at 2.174 percent in Asian trade, above its U.S. close of 2.162 percent. It had fallen as low as 2.103 percent on Wednesday after the downbeat data was published. The euro was steady on the day at $1.1147, well below a seven-month high of $1.1296 touched on Wednesday, and down 0.6 percent for the week. Sterling edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2773, getting a lift overnight after the Bank of England (BoE) came closer to hiking interest rates than many had believed it would. As many as three members of the BoE's policy committee surprised financial markets by voting for a rise in interest rates. It was still down 1.4 percent for the week so far. The unexpectedly tight 5-3 vote came despite signs of a slowdown in Britain's economy, and uncertainty over Britain's political outlook since Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election.

No decisions have been made,  said Defense Department spokesman Jeff Davis, when asked about an Associated Press report that Mattis had decided on sending nearly 4,000 additional troops. Still, that figure would be in line with previous comments by U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. Reuters has reported that U.S. deliberations were focused on sending between 3,000 and 5,000 troops to Afghanistan, where American forces have been fighting for nearly 16 years.  One official told Reuters last month that 3,800 troops could be sent but cautioned that could change, given discussions with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies about their potential contributions. About 8,400 U.S. troops are now deployed in Afghanistan. Mattis said in testimony before the U.S. Senate on June 14 that he is just weeks away from presenting to U.S. President Donald Trump a new strategy that will inform his decision on troop numbers. Trump authorized Mattis to set future Afghan troop levels on Tuesday.

LOUIS -- When Eric Thames hit the ball, he was imploring Jesus Aguilar to get on his horse. Thames shouldn't have worried. His two-out, two-strike liner in the top of the ninth inning Thursday night bounded off the top of the right field wall and over it for a tiebreaking two-run homer that gave the Milwaukee Brewers a 6-4 win over the St. Louis Cardinals at sold-out Busch Stadium. It was the 18th homer for Thames and perhaps his most important of the year. Milwaukee (36-32) won three of four games in the series, posted a winning road trip at 4-3 and upped its National League Central lead on the Chicago Cubs to 2 1/2 games.  A lot of people thought we'd be here for a week and then fall off,  said Thames, referring to first place.  But this is a whole new team. Guys feel the confidence, they feel the mojo. Everybody's excited, so let's keep this rolling.  Aguilar started the rally with a one-out pinch-single off Seung Hwan Oh (1-3). After inducing a foulout from Eric Sogard, Oh quickly put Thames in an 0-2 hole. But after fouling off one pitch, Thames managed to get on top of a high, outside fastball. Aguilar's lack of speed meant he might not have scored had the ball been an inch lower. However, Thames' rocket possessed just enough elevation. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at CardinalsMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch With the topspin on the ball, I thought there was no way it was getting out,  Thames said.  I tomahawked it.  Brewers manager Craig Counsell discussed with bench coach Pat Murphy the possibility of running for Aguilar. Counsell was worried the decision to leave him at first might come back to haunt him when topspin started jerking Thames' liner down.  I said, 'Oh, no,' when he hit it,  Counsell said.  I was glad when it went over.  Carlos Torres (3-4) worked a scoreless eighth inning for the win and Oliver Drake pitched a clean ninth for his first career save. Milwaukee rested closer Corey Knebel and setup man Jacob Barnes after they pitched the last two nights. Jared Hughes was also unavailable after working in the series' first three games. Without that trio, the Brewers still got four hitless innings from rookie Josh Hader, Torres and Drake.  They handled big innings in tight situations the whole way and did a nice job,  Counsell said. Meanwhile, St. Louis (30-35) fell 4 1/2 games behind Milwaukee and settled for a 4-3 record during a seven-game homestand on which it started 4-0.  They kept fighting to stay in this game,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.  Oh's been throwing well ... that's a tough way to lose it.  St. Louis grabbed a 2-0 lead in the first inning with five hits. Stephen Piscotty singled home Matt Carpenter and Aledmys Diaz's two-out infield single plated Piscotty. Keon Broxton wiped out that lead with one powerful swing in the second. He destroyed a first-pitch offering from Michael Wacha, sending it an estimated 489 feet to left-center field for a two-run shot that was the longest homer in stadium history. Broxton's homer was the second longest in the majors this year. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees rocketed a 495-foot blast Sunday against Baltimore.  I didn't think I got it that good,  Broxton said.  It was just a nice, smooth swing and the ball hit the sweet spot.  The teams traded runs in the third and fifth. Dexter Fowler answered RBI singles by Domingo Santana and Travis Shaw each time. Fowler homered on the first pitch of the bottom of the third, then singled home Carpenter in the fifth. Neither starter was involved in the decision after getting cuffed around. Wacha lasted just four-plus innings, the fourth time in five starts he failed to make it through five innings. He allowed seven hits and four runs with three walks and five strikeouts. Brewers right-hander Zach Davies gave up nine hits and four runs in five innings. He walked none and fanned one. NOTES: St. Louis placed 2B Kolten Wong (right triceps strain) on the 10-day DL and recalled INF Paul DeJong from Triple-A Memphis. DeJong hit .244 in his first taste of the big leagues from May 28 to June 11 with a homer and four RBIs. ... Milwaukee assigned RHP Rob Scahill to Triple-A Colorado Springs. The team designated Scahill for assignment before Tuesday's doubleheader. ... Brewers OF Ryan Braun (left calf strain) fielded fly balls during batting practice before the game, but there's still no timetable for his return from the 10-day DL. Braun, who hit the DL on May 26, is batting .262 with seven homers and 19 RBIs in 30 games.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-brewers-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED6GMD7KSH"},
