He said authorities were providing assistance to the victim\u2019s mother, who was also in Bogot\u00e1.The mayor urged residents of Bogot\u00e1\u2019s wealthier districts to be on high alert but cautioned that there was no hint of other attacks being planned. Colombian President       Juan Manuel Santos       has ordered the head of the country\u2019s police to lead the investigation.In February, a bombing near a bullring in Bogot\u00e1 killed one police officer and injured 20 other people. The country\u2019s largest active rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, claimed responsibility for that attack.\u2014Copyright 2017 The Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-06-17 21:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bombing-in-colombia-mall-kills-three-leaves-about-nine-more-injured-1497750929", "news_title": "Bombing in Colombia Mall Kills Three, Leaves About Nine More Injured", "keywords": "centro andino bombing,colombia bombing,colombia explosion,colombia mall bombing,colombia mall explosion,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014U.S. Rep.

Left standing are provisions that allow Americans to travel to Cuba in groups and for purposes such as education or professional purposes.\u201cOur new policy begins with strictly enforcing U.S. law,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood. The U.S., he added, would \u201cvery strongly restrict American dollars\u201d flowing to Cuba\u2019s military and enforce a tourism ban.Mr. Trump castigated the Cuban government for human-rights abuses and said the longstanding U.S. embargo would remain in place until the Cuban government holds free elections, releases political prisoners, legalizes all political parties and takes other steps to open up its society.However, the U.S. Embassy in Havana will remain open, Mr. Trump said, with the hope that the U.S. and Cuba can come to a better arrangement. He faulted the Obama administration\u2019s policy for benefiting the Castro regime.Mr. Trump\u2019s speech drew a quick condemnation from Havana, with Granma, the official newspaper of Cuba\u2019s ruling Communist Party, calling it \u201ca return to the rhetoric of the Cold War which seemed to have been overcome.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s a return to the rhetoric of the Cold War which seemed to have been overcome.\u2019During his speech, Mr. Trump appeared to claim credit for the coming retirement of Cuban President       Ra\u00fal Castro,        86 years old, although the Cuban leader announced in 2013 he would step down at the end of his second five year term in February of 2018. Most analysts expect Mr. Castro to continue as head of the all-powerful Communist party. On Wednesday, Granma announced that elections for municipal assembly in the one party state would be held in October, beginning the routine cycle of elections on the island.Scheduled air service between the U.S. and Cuba resumed last summer for the first time in 50 years. Cuba attracted a record 4 million foreign- visitor arrivals last year, up 13% from 2015, according to the Cuban government. While Canadians remained the largest group, Cuban Americans and other U.S. visitors numbered 614,000, up 34% from the prior year. But supply outstripped demand, and three U.S. airlines quit the market this year.Mr. Trump delivered his speech in Miami as Latin American leaders and officials, who widely supported       Mr. Obama\u2019s       opening to Cuba, were meeting in the same city to discuss prosperity and security.A senior administration official said the timing of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t intended as \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to those officials. \u201cWe hope we can get support from other Latin American leaders for this policy,\u201d the official said.Mr. Trump\u2019s move on Friday represented a step to satisfy the demands of Florida political allies with hard-line views on Cuba\u2019s human-rights record and to fulfill a campaign vow to reverse Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. But Mr. Trump\u2019s initiative also took into account pressure from business groups and others to avoid completely undoing the opening to Cuba and to refrain from interfering with deals already under way.\u201cIt has been a measured response, in the right terms,\u201d said Pepe Hern\u00e1ndez, president of the Cuban American National Foundation.Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), slammed the move, calling it \u201cfar from credible\u201d that it was motivated by human-rights concerns and saying it could hurt the Cubans Mr. Trump says he wants to support.Republican lawmakers who favored former President Barack Obama\u2019s normalization push also criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on Friday.\u201cBy returning to the failed policy of the past 55 years, the administration moves no closer to helping improve the human-rights situation in Cuba and stands to violate the president\u2019s No. 1 campaign promise and constitutional responsibility: to keep the American people and our homeland safe,\u201d said Rep. Tom Emmer (R., Minn.).Some leading business groups took issue with Mr. Trump\u2019s directive as well.\u2018You kept your promise; you stand in solidarity with the Cuban people and freedom-loving people everywhere.\u2019\u201cUnfortunately, today\u2019s moves actually limit the possibility for positive change on the island and risk ceding growth opportunities to other countries that, frankly, may not share America\u2019s interest in a free and democratic Cuba that respects human rights,\u201d said       Myron Brilliant,        executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R., Fla.), who introduced Mr. Trump, praised Mr. Trump for keeping his campaign promise to Cuban Americans.\u201cYou have not betrayed us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou kept your promise; you stand in solidarity with the Cuban people and freedom-loving people everywhere; and you are putting American values and U.S. national security interests first.\u201dPedro Vidal, executive director of the Cuban Soul Foundation, which sponsors exchanges with artists on the island, said he, too, supported Mr. Trump\u2019s policy announcement. But Mr. Vidal said he wanted to see the Trump administration back up its pronouncements with funding for U.S. programs that support civil society on the island, and was disappointed that such funding was cut in Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed budget.\u201cIf you don\u2019t support the Cuban people, you\u2019re not going to have that momentous effect,\u201d he said.\u2018The changes appear to be much less severe than they could have been.\u2019James Friedlander, whose company, Academic Arrangements Abroad, has run cultural and people-to-people tours to Cuba for decades, said he is receiving requests for more tours later this year. The restrictions on individual tourism, he said, will negatively affect the private bed-and-breakfasts, restaurants and other businesses such tourists frequent.\u201cThis is too bad as they inject cash into the population more quickly and encourage the upkeep and preservation of the housing stock in Cuba,\u201d Mr. Friedlander said. \u201cThat said, the changes appear to be much less severe than they could have been.\u201dAirbnb, which began operating in Cuba in 2015, has benefited from the Obama policy shift. The company said it has seen 560,000 guests stay in Cuba through Airbnb since April 2015, including 70,000 a month so far this year. A spokesman said 65% of the company\u2019s guests in Cuba in 2016 weren\u2019t Americans.\u201cWhile we are reviewing what this policy could mean for this type of travel, we appreciate that the policy appears to allow us to continue to support Airbnb hosts in Cuba who have welcomed travelers from around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement.The Cuba Study Group, a Miami-based organization of powerful Cuban-American businessmen, said while Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement left many of the gains of Mr. Obama\u2019s normalization policy intact, what it called his hostile tone could jeopardize cooperation with Havana on matters of mutual concern such as terrorism, narcotics, and migration. \u201cWe urge President Trump to pursue a policy of full normalization that benefits the U.S. economy, serves U.S. interests, and can help place Cubans on a path to a better future,\u201d the organization said.Pedro Freyre, a lawyer with Akerman LLP who advises clients interested in doing business in Cuba, said Mr. Trump\u2019s changes were moderate and within the framework of continuing engagement with Cuba but that much would depend on how the new regulations are drawn up. \u201cThe devil is in the details,\u201d he said.Polling by Bendixen & Amandi International in Miami has shown that a majority of Cuban-Americans largely support engagement with the island.\u2014Arian Campo-Flores, Dudley Althaus, Susan Carey, Carol E.

Mr. Batista stepped down last month after entering a plea deal with Brazilian prosecutors in which he admitted to bribing politicians in exchange for taxpayer-subsidized loans and other government favors that helped turn JBS into the world\u2019s largest meatpacker.The comments by Mr. Batista prompted a sharp rebuke from Mr. Temer, who said he planned to file civil and criminal suits against the businessman on Monday.\u201cJoesley Batista is the most successful, notorious bandit in Brazilian history,\u201d Mr. Temer\u2019s press office said, repeating previous accusations of insider trading by the executive. \u201cHis lies will be uncovered and due financial reparation will be sought for the damages that he caused not just to the institution of the presidency, but to Brazil.\u201dThe mudslinging comes as Mr. Temer fights for political survival amid an investigation by Brazil\u2019s attorney general for corruption, obstruction of justice and criminal conspiracy after Mr. Batista\u2019s testimony. Charges are expected to be filed against the president next week, though two-thirds of Brazil\u2019s Congress would have to sign off in order for the Supreme Court to open a trial.The interview was Mr. Batista\u2019s first since the release last month of a taped conversation in which the businessman told Mr. Temer in March of his efforts to stymie investigations into his company. The efforts included the payment of hush money to former lower house speaker       Eduardo Cunha,        who was convicted of graft in March. In a recording of the conversation, Mr. Temer appeared to mutter words of encouragement, sparking public outrage and calls for his resignation.The president didn\u2019t report the conversation to proper authorities, he said, because he wasn\u2019t taking Mr. Batista seriously.In the interview, Mr. Batista said Mr. Cunha was directly beneath Mr. Temer in the alleged criminal organization. He described his relationship with Mr. Temer as symbiotic but not friendly, saying his aim was to keep the group satisfied but at an arm\u2019s length because \u201cthey didn\u2019t have limits.\u201dLate last year, Mr. Batista said he grew nervous as investigators appeared to be closing in on JBS. He said he recorded his March meeting with Mr. Temer in case he decided to switch sides, which he increasingly viewed as the only way to avoid being arrested. But he also feared retaliation.\u201cUpsetting that criminal organization was the most dangerous and risky thing I\u2019ve done in my life,\u201d Mr. Batista said, adding\u00a0that he has received anonymous threats since entering the plea bargain. \u201cI\u2019ve never had bodyguards in my life.

The attacker was killed at the scene.In April, Taliban fighters attacked the same base in a shooting spree that killed at least 170 people and triggered a wave of high-level resignations in the Afghan army, including the defense minister and army chief of staff. Official figures provided by U.S. and Afghan military officials varied, but some local media reports put the number of casualties at over 250 killed.Earlier this week, U.S. President       Donald Trump      gave the Pentagon unilateral authority to send thousands of U.S. troops to Afghanistan at its discretion, moving to ramp up the 16-year war and bolster support for ailing government forces.The decision comes as the Taliban-led insurgency has swept across rural areas and is threatening at least a half-dozen provincial capitals, taking advantage of the vacuum left after most foreign troops withdrew from the country in 2014.Afghan security forces are struggling with high attrition rates and low morale, which has contributed to the challenge of holding ground against the insurgency and prompted calls for increased coalition support.A coalition official said Saturday\u2019s insider attack would likely prompt a review of the process for training and recruiting Afghan soldiers to limit further losses.\u201cToday\u2019s incident will change everything since they are so close.

Some victims of the fire have been identified publicly by family members.The developments come amid heightened tensions over Wednesday\u2019s fire at Grenfell Tower\u2014a low-income high-rise in North Kensington, near Notting Hill and a few miles from the center of the U.K. capital, that was home to hundreds of people.Critics have questioned whether officials were too slow to address concerns about fire-safety measures in low-income, public housing. One area of focus has been whether the aluminum cladding on the 24-floor building\u2019s exterior contributed to the fire\u2019s quick spread. The cladding wouldn\u2019t have met widely adopted U.S. standards, according to building groups.On Friday, protesters barged into a meeting of local authorities responsible for the building, chanting: \u201cWe want justice!\u201d and \u201cShame on you!\u201d The building is owned by the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, a subdivision of London.On Saturday, Mrs. May met with a small group of survivors of the fire and volunteers at her official residence on Downing Street, a spokeswoman for the prime minister\u2019s office said.       Jeremy Corbyn,        the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, met with local residents near the building two days earlier.Mrs. May has ordered a public inquiry into the blaze and said she had established a \u00a35 million ($6.4 million) fund to pay for emergency supplies, food, clothes and other costs, such as for funerals.The mounting pressure on the prime minister follows a major setback in elections just over a week ago, when her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority days before the start of Brexit talks with the European Union.

The U.S. Navy doesn\u2019t provide details of the routes of its ships, and it wasn\u2019t clear where the Fitzgerald was traveling from.The region where the two ships collided is often busy with marine traffic. Tracking data sent from the ACX Crystal showed that the ship reversed course about 25 minutes before the time of the accident, according to the website MarineTraffic.com.The Fitzgerald had recently taken part in exercises in the Sea of Japan with two U.S. carrier strike groups and Japanese navy ships.Collisions at sea for the U.S. Navy are extremely uncommon, said Bryan McGrath, a former destroyer captain, who said they occur only once or twice a decade if that. He said he couldn\u2019t remember a recent collision that was \u201cthis consequential.\u201d\u201cThere are 275 ships in the Navy and 100 are under way all over the world,\u201d navigating \u201cmillions and millions of miles\u201d every year, said Mr. McGrath, who retired in 2008 and is now a consultant. \u201cThis is very, very rare.\u201dU.S. naval history includes a number of notable mishaps. In 2005, the USS San Francisco, a Los Angeles-class submarine, hit a seamount or underwater land mass, injuring dozens of crew. In 2001, the USS Greeneville, another Los Angeles-class sub, performed an emergency ballast blow for special visitors aboard the vessel, surfacing quickly and hitting a Japanese fishing ship on the surface near Hawaii, killing nine crew members of the Japanese vessel.In one of the U.S. Navy\u2019s most notorious incidents, in April 1952 the aircraft carrier Wasp collided with the destroyer Hobson in the North Atlantic, killing 176 men.Mr. McGrath declined to speculate as to what occurred or who or what might be to blame in the Fitzgerald incident. The collision occurred in darkness in a high-traffic area of the Pacific, he said. The most concerning aspect of the collision, from the destroyer\u2019s point of view, is the damage to the Fitzgerald\u2019s starboard side below the waterline, resulting from the container ship\u2019s construction and the way its bow hit, he said.\u201cThe destroyer is phenomenally maneuverable,\u201d he said. But there comes a point where there is nothing either ship can do to avoid a collision, he said.President Donald Trump tweeted early Saturday: \u201cThoughts and prayers with the sailors of USS Fitzgerald and their families.

In it, Ms. Cosby criticized the judge as \u201carrogant,\u201d prosecutors as \u201ctotally unethical\u201d and the media as \u201cblatantly vicious.\u201d\u201cI am grateful to any of the jurors who tenaciously fought to review the evidence, which is the rightful way to make a sound decision,\u201d Ms. Cosby said in the statement.Andrew Wyatt, a longtime spokesman for Mr. Cosby, also made a brief defiant statement. \u201cMr. Cosby\u2019s power is back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jurors used their power to speak. The legacy didn\u2019t go anywhere. It has been restored.\u201dMr. Cosby, 79 years old, had faced three counts of indecent aggravated assault and up to 10 years in prison. Prosecutors have alleged that he drugged and molested       Andrea Constand,        a former Temple University employee, at his home in 2004.Mr. Cosby has maintained his innocence and said he had a romantic relationship with Ms. Constand.Following Saturday\u2019s mistrial, several decisions that shaped the trial loomed large. One was the judge\u2019s pretrial ruling allowing the prosecution to call only one other woman besides Ms. Constand to testify that she had also been drugged and assaulted by Mr. Cosby.Prosecutors had sought to have a total of 13 women besides Ms. Constand testify to try to establish a pattern of prior bad acts.Several legal experts also said it was wise for Mr. Cosby not to take the stand in his own defense because that could have allowed prosecutors to discuss the accusations made against Mr. Cosby by roughly 50 women over the past several years.\u201cThe major victory the Cosby team won was limiting the prosecution to only one other woman,\u201d said Wes Oliver, a law professor at Duquesne University. \u201cIf he had testified, one way or another, the cross-examination would have alerted the jury to the elephant that the defense did such a good job of keeping out of the courtroom\u2013the 50 other women,\u201d he said.Mr. Cosby has denied the assault allegations made in all cases by other women. In most cases, the statute of limitations related to those claims has expired.Mr. Cosby still faces about 10 civil lawsuits filed by other accusers, most of whom allege he defamed them after they came forward to claim that he had sexually assaulted them years earlier. He has denied any wrongdoing.The 12-member jury was selected in Pittsburgh and bused to the trial at the Montgomery County Court in Norristown, Pa., after Mr. Cosby\u2019s lawyers argued that he couldn\u2019t get a fair hearing in the Philadelphia area.The trial drew reporters from more than 100 media outlets and from several countries. But it became less of a spectacle than many expected, as the national attention was riveted to other events, including the testimony of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director       James Comey       earlier this month and the shooting at a Republican congressmen\u2019s baseball practice in Alexandria, Va., on Wednesday.On Friday, a day before the judge declared a mistrial, Mr. Cosby took to             Twitter                   to thank his supporters. \u201cThank you to all of my fans and supporters\u2013here in Norristown and worldwide,\u201d the message read.Write to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-17 12:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-declares-mistrial-in-bill-cosby-sexual-assault-case-1497710009", "news_title": "Judge Declares Mistrial in Bill Cosby Sexual-Assault Case", "keywords": "bill cosby, cosby case, cosby trial, cosby verdict, deadlock, jury, mistrial,sexual assault allegations,Steven O'Neill,Andrea Constand,Bill Cosby,political,general news,crime,legal action,sex crimes"}, {"content": "As the U.S. considers expanding a ban of carry-on laptops on international flights, airlines are scrambling to prepare for what would be additional security checks and probably angry customers.The most likely measure would be secondary airport checkpoints to temporarily confiscate most electronic devices from passengers. Those could lead to longer lines, delayed flights and higher costs, and could be the industry\u2019s biggest logistical challenge since 2006, when a suspected bomb plot against trans-Atlantic flights led to limits on liquids and gels on board, say aviation experts.An initial ban three months ago\u2014by both the U.S. and the U.K.\u2014affected some flights from the Middle East and North Africa. The latest plan under consideration by the Trump administration could involve flights originating from as many as 71 airports around the world, and comes amid what U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly described as a \u201cvery serious\u201d and \u201cconstant\u201d threat. He told lawmakers this month that terrorists \u201care trying every day to knock down one of our airplanes.\u201dThe timing and scope of any ban remains uncertain and talks between Homeland Security and airports, airlines and European Union officials continue.Mr. Kelly recently suggested a ban could affect all international flights to the U.S., though earlier discussions involved just flights from Europe. There is even a possibility some airports won\u2019t be affected if they meet increased security standards being developed by DHS, Mr. Kelly said.At a meeting in Malta on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy DHS Secretary Elaine Duke presented their European counterparts with a list of extra security measures including improved information exchange, random testing for explosives and acquiring more advanced airport screening devices to forestall a ban, said an EU official who participated. The Americans gave no deadlines when presenting the measures, this person said, and many already are in place.In any case, airlines are trying to prepare contingency plans for what could be up to 150,000 flights affected if the ban were to go global, based on travel scheduled for June, according to OAG Aviation Worldwide Ltd.Secondary checks to seize devices and check them in aircraft cargo holds would add to increasingly cumbersome airport security procedures.For instance, many fliers bound for the U.S. make connections through European airports from countries that don\u2019t ban carry-on laptops in cabins, so those devices would have to be removed at secondary checkpoints before passengers board U.S.-bound flights.How and where secondary screening would occur depends in part on terminal layouts at each specific airport, according to one U.S. airline official.Airports in Europe, including the busy London Heathrow hub as well as facilities in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid and Edinburgh, are pursuing plans known as \u201cLittle America\u201d to segregate U.S.-bound flights at gates behind secondary screening points, according to one U.S. airline official. But the layout of airports including Athens, Rome and Venice would require secondary screening at each gate, the official said, while an airport like Paris\u2019s Charles de Gaulle Airport, with its tight space constraints, may require the device checks to be done on the bridges to the individual planes.Some airport authorities allow airline personnel or vendors to search passengers and bags, but others require the use of their own staffers.             United Continental Holdings Inc.,Delta Air Lines,       Inc. and             American Airlines Group Inc.,       are among those carriers hiring additional screening personnel, said people familiar with their planning.Also being discussed by the aviation industry are possibly installing magnetometers, traditional metal scanners, or more advanced screening technology at secondary screening sites, in lieu of hand searches. Some airlines also have raised the possibility of requiring travelers to pack their devices in checked luggage from the beginning, an idea that will likely prove unpopular. Airlines also are worried that devices may be stolen or damaged, further infuriating fliers.Airline trade groups say there are less disruptive ways to deal with the terrorist threat, including increased use of bomb-detection dogs. They say elite frequent fliers or members of so-called \u201ctrusted-traveler\u201d programs, including TSA PreCheck or Global Entry, should be allowed to bring their devices onboard.If banned devices need to be removed from carry-on bags, they would have to be tagged and wrapped in special packaging for the cargo holds, and some regulators and pilot groups worry about storing large numbers of lithium batteries, which have been known to catch fire.Peter Bellew,        chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, recently said there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d from multiple lithium batteries in the cargo hold.Patrick Ky, head of the European Aviation Safety Agency, on Wednesday said months of laboratory tests likely are required to properly assess the potential fire hazards of flying large numbers of lithium batteries in cargo holds, adding that \u201cwe should be very careful\u201d because \u201cby dealing with the security risk we can increase the safety risk\u201d stemming from the possibility of the batteries catching fire or even exploding.A U.S. official said that concern is being taken into account but that the fire risk of lithium batteries installed in devices is considered smaller than batteries transported separately. Two people familiar with the matter said the Federal Aviation Administration is conducting tests on the risks of having more batteries in the cargo hold in checked luggage.Corporate travelers are bracing for whatever comes.Ryan Rahman, a strategy consultant based in Washington, said he won\u2019t cut back on his travel, but expects that an electronics ban on more flights means he would have to get to his destinations earlier to give him the extra time to work. \u201cI\u2019m just going to have to travel an extra day and send documents ahead of time,\u201d he said.\u2014Valentina Pop contributed to this article.Write to Susan Carey at susan.carey@wsj.com and Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-17 11:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-grapple-with-potential-challenges-of-broader-laptop-ban-1497700801", "news_title": "Airlines Grapple With Potential Challenges of Broader Laptop Ban", "keywords": "airlines,airport security,air safety,aviation,laptop ban,national security,terrorism,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,state security measures,policies,transport,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "A jury on Friday found that the Minnesota police officer who shot a black motorist during a traffic stop last July in a Twin Cities suburb was not guilty of second-degree manslaughter, prompting immediate outcry on social media and calls for protests at the state capitol building in St. Paul.St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez was charged last year with second-degree manslaughter for shooting       Philando Castile,        a 32-year old supervisor at a school cafeteria. Mr. Yanez pulled Mr. Castile over for a broken taillight in Falcon Heights, a Twin Cities suburb, and fatally shot him when Mr. Castile informed the officer that he had a gun.Mr. Castile was legally permitted to carry that gun.The city of St. Anthony said Friday afternoon that \u201cthe public will be best served if Officer Yanez is no longer a police officer in our city.\u201d According to the statement, posted online, the city intends to offer him a voluntary separation agreement, the terms of which will be worked out later.The 12-person jury, which included two African-Americans, found him not guilty of the manslaughter charge and not guilty on two felony counts of dangerous discharge of a weapon, on their fifth day of deliberation.\u201cThis time, there should have been, in our opinion, a very, very different outcome,\u201d said Judge Glenda Hatchett, the lawyer representing Mr. Castile\u2019s family since the shooting. In a short press conference outside the courthouse, Ms. Hatchett said Mr. Castile\u2019s was a \u201ctragic, tragic, needless death.\u201dHis mother, Valerie Castile, expressed anger at the Minnesota justice system. \u201cWhere in this planet do you tell the truth and you be honest and you still be murdered by the police of Minnesota?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe system continues to fail black people and they will continue to fail you all.\u201dMs. Castile said that while Mr. Yanez hadn\u2019t been found guilty in the courtroom, \u201cHe will have to face his creator. And I hope he die tonight.\u201dA few hours later, protestors gathered and marched through St. Paul. About 1,500 or so people went onto the freeway, blocking it off to traffic. State Patrol troopers arrested 18 people for charges including being a pedestrian on a freeway, according to police.Prosecutors argued that Mr. Yanez\u2019s use of force was unjustified, and that Mr. Castile posed no threat to him or anyone else. They argued that the officer never saw Mr. Castile\u2019s gun and that he had other options besides shooting the man.Lawyers for Mr. Yanez, however, sought to prove that the officer feared for his life and believed that Mr. Castile was a threat because of the gun he carried. The defense pointed to the officer\u2019s testimony and initial statements where he said that Mr. Castile looked like a man who had robbed a convenience store four days earlier.The defense also argued that Mr. Castile was intoxicated when he was pulled over. He had THC, the component in marijuana that causes a high, in his blood when he died, according to medical records. The two sides over the course of the trial called competing experts who disagreed over whether Mr. Castile was intoxicated, according to the Associated Press.\u201cThe verdict was the correct verdict,\u201d said Earl Gray, Mr. Yanez\u2019s attorney. \u201cIn my opinion the case should have never been charged.\u201dThe shooting was among several in recent years where black men were killed by police in unclear circumstances, prompting a national conversation on the role of race in policing and what constitutes justified use of force. Mr. Castile\u2019s death drew extra attention because his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, filmed the aftermath of his shooting on her smartphone and posted it live to             Facebook.       The video was watched by hundreds of thousands of people, and Mr. Castile\u2019s death prompted protests in Minneapolis.Ramsey County Attorney John Choi, expressing disappointment with the verdict, encouraged the public Friday evening to accept the outcome and said that while he respects the value of protests and demonstrations, asked that people take such action peacefully. \u201cI understand that this verdict brings a lot of hurt and pain and deep-seeded frustration,\u201d he said.St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman also urged calm after the verdict and announced plans for \u201cfacilitated community discussions\u201d throughout the weekend.Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, issued a statement Friday afternoon saying that the verdict \u201conce again highlights how difficult it is to prosecute an officer for killing a person they were sworn to protect and serve.\u201dThe jury on Tuesday again watched video recordings from Mr. Yanez\u2019s squad car, as well as a copy of the video that Ms. Reynolds posted to Facebook. They were denied requests to review transcripts of the dashcam video and an interview Mr. Yanez gave to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigators after the shooting, and on Friday were told they couldn\u2019t rehear Mr. Yanez\u2019s full court testimony.A spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will release to the public video from Officer Yanez\u2019s dashcam in the next week.Mr. Castile\u2019s family, along with the Minnesota state governor and activists, has said that race was a factor in the shooting. Lawyers for Mr. Yanez, however, argued that it was the presence of a gun, rather than the issue of race, that prompted the officer\u2019s actions.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com and Shibani Mahtani at shibani.mahtani@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Philando Castile informed officer Jeronimo Yanez that he had a gun on him when he was pulled over.

One of the assailants had a gun that jammed, avoiding more serious casualties, the police added.Sergeant Major Hadas Malka, 23 years old, was stabbed while engaging the attackers and later died of her wounds, Israeli officials said.The bloodshed on Friday ended a lull in Palestinian violence against Israelis after a wave of attacks that began in September 2015 had largely abated in recent months in part due to greater security coordination between Israeli and Palestinian security forces.Islamic State quickly took responsibility for the attacks, but Israeli authorities said they had no evidence to support the extremist group\u2019s claims, which were also dismissed by other Palestinian militant groups.Islamic State made the claim in a statement on its official channel, its first about an attack in Israel.In response, Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip and regularly claims responsibility for Palestinian violence against Israelis, said one of its members and two operatives from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine conducted the attacks.Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said Islamic State\u2019s claim aimed to \u201cmuddy the waters.\u201dThe PFLP, a secular nationalist group that has only a small level of support among Palestinians, said in a statement it also was responsible for the attacks.The three attackers came from a village in the Palestinian West Bank, Israeli security officials said. The authorities launched an investigation into the assaults and attackers\u2019 affiliations to militant groups.As Islamic State loses territory in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks globally in a bid to project power and maintain its relevance among Sunni supporters. But it isn\u2019t often clear if the attackers are directly supported by the group.The extremist group has said it was behind more than a dozen attacks around the world this month, including on major landmarks in Tehran and in a bustling London food market.Israeli security officials have said some Palestinians are sympathetic to the extremist group\u2019s ideology but estimate it doesn\u2019t have widespread support among Palestinians who instead back nationalist groups such as Hamas that are driven to establish a Palestinian state.Write to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-17 10:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/palestinians-kill-israeli-police-officer-isis-claim-is-refuted-1497710561", "news_title": "Palestinians Kill Israeli Police Officer; ISIS Claim Is Rebutted", "keywords": " hamas, isis, islamic state,israel,Hamas,assault,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "Nevada\u2019s Republican governor\u00a0vetoed a bill late Friday that would have created the nation\u2019s first \u201cMedicaid for all\u201d insurance offering, a plan that drew widespread attention as states brace for changes in the federal Affordable Care Act.The bill would have allowed any state resident to buy into Medicaid, the federal-state program for people with low incomes or disabilities. The idea, which its Democratic sponsor said would have created a guaranteed health coverage option that was affordable, has drawn the interest of other liberal-leaning states as congress works to repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act, including the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.The measure passed Nevada\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature mostly along party lines. Gov.       Brian Sandoval       issued the veto on the final day before the bill would have become law without a signature \u2013 several hours after signing a letter to lawmakers in Washington rebuking their plan to roll back the Medicaid expansion.In his veto message, Mr. Sandoval lauded the bill\u2019s \u201ccreativity\u201d but wrote that the plan needs further study before it can become law.\u201cMoving too soon, without factual foundation or adequate understanding of the possible consequences, could introduce more uncertainty to an already fragile healthcare market, and ultimately affect patient health care,\u201d he wrote.The bill would have made Medicaid available for a monthly premium, offering it alongside private plans on the state\u2019s ACA marketplace, pending federal approval. That would allow consumers to use ACA subsidies\u2014or the tax credits in congressional Republicans\u2019 replacement bill, if it passes\u2014to purchase the insurance.But the bill faced several hurdles to enactment. First, federal officials would need to grant a waiver allowing the public insurance to be sold on the ACA exchange, making it eligible for the law\u2019s subsidies. The plan also didn\u2019t set premium levels, instead authorizing state officials to conduct a yearlong cost analysis to determine what the price should be.Analysts say the premiums likely would be slightly below rates on other insurance, since Medicaid traditionally pays doctors at lower rates and negotiates less-expensive prices on prescription drugs.\u201cWhen we look at the cost of coverage between Medicaid and private insurance, Medicaid is typically cheaper because it tends to get a better price for the services that it buys,\u201d said       Diane Rowland,        executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health-care research organization.Nevada\u2019s consideration of the measure reflects a broader trend among states to experiment with health-care options given the uncertainty of the national landscape and the Trump administration\u2019s stated willingness to give states more flexibility. Some conservatives states are looking to impose more conditions on Medicaid recipients, while liberal states are contemplating ways to expand coverage.Mike Sprinkle,        a Democratic state assemblyman who introduced the measure, explicitly framed \u201cMedicaid for all\u201d as an option for people who could lose insurance under congressional Republicans\u2019 repeal plan.\u201cI strongly believe government has a responsibility to provide for the health and safety of its citizens, and this bill [would] place in statute the mandate that at least one form of health insurance be available to all Nevadans,\u201d Mr. Sprinkle said.Republicans legislators warned the plan would undercut private insurers and move the market closer to a single-payer health care model, in which the government provides a single health-care system for all people.\u201cYou\u2019re using a government-subsidized health program to compete with other insurers in the market, and to what end?\u201d said Paul Anderson, the state assembly\u2019s minority leader. \u201cThis certainly is a step toward a single-payer system.\u201dWrite to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-17 09:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nevadas-governor-vetoes-medicaid-for-all-insurance-plan-1497701687", "news_title": "Nevada\u2019s Governor Vetoes \u2018Medicaid for All\u2019 Insurance Plan ", "keywords": "aca, affordable care act, brian sandoval, gop, health care, medicaid, medicaid for all, nevada,Brian Sandoval,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s        AMZN 0.24%       purchase of             Whole Foods                         Market Inc. could fill an important logistics gap for the online retailer, providing hundreds of stores perfectly positioned to serve as pickup and delivery hubs for urban customers.For more than two years, Amazon has been building out a network of urban warehouses, located in highly populated neighborhoods, and offering \u201cPrime Now\u201d delivery of food and sundries within a one- or two-hour delivery window. They are essentially large convenience stores, without the customers.Adding the more-than-430 stores in Whole Foods\u2019s network would expand Amazon\u2019s current neighborhood network by a factor of at least five, logistics experts said Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to give them little warehouses all around the country in some of the big markets,\u201d said Michael Knemeyer, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University\u2019s Fisher College of Business.Prime Now warehouses are around the same size as grocery stores, or slightly larger, and in urban areas where Amazon shoppers live and work, and delivering mostly same-day orders\u2014some within one hour. Inside, there are pallets of bulk items like paper towels and cases of soda, shelves of produce and a few freezer and refrigerator aisles.That is a contrast with the behemoth fulfillment centers that are the backbone of Amazon\u2019s extensive and expanding logistics operations. Those are located in far-flung suburbs and stock a much wider array of goods, fulfilling and shipping orders for delivery within two days or more.One potential immediate benefit from buying the grocer is the chain\u2019s refrigerated storage areas, which would have been expensive to install across a network of basic warehouses, experts say, as Amazon seeks to build out its own grocery business.\u201cSetting aside food, the larger opportunity to build out what many refer to as the final mile to the consumer is now in sight,\u201d said Dave Beaird, a supply chain consultant.\u201cWill these locations become mini-fulfillment centers to help execute local deliveries of not only food but also other items? Will these locations become hubs for customer pickup, decreasing some traditional transportation last mile costs? Or will they simply remain as they are today? Which is very hard to believe,\u201d he said.VIEW GraphicMeanwhile, the partnership with Amazon may mean Whole Foods doesn\u2019t need to rely as heavily on its storefronts.Recently, vendors on Amazon.com have increasingly been filling orders from their own facilities or those of third-party logistics providers, with Amazon never holding that inventory in its own fulfillment centers. Under that strategy, Whole Foods may see many of the products it stocks one day shipped to customers in much the same way, skipping the store stock room entirely and heading directly to customers.\u201cThe opportunity to do direct to home [delivery] with Whole Foods, as well as the suppliers to Whole Foods, could become dramatic,\u201d said Benjamin Gordon, managing partner at BG Strategic Advisors LLC. \u201cYou could keep the stores, but all the growth might come from distribution center to home.\u201dWrite to Erica E.

The business owner has\u00a0appealed to the Supreme Court, which has so far delayed deciding whether it will hear the case.Washington state\u2019s highest court this year ruled against a florist who wouldn\u2019t prepare floral arrangements for a gay couple\u2019s wedding.\u201cSome people argue there\u2019s a free speech claim even with a florist, but I think that\u2019s a weaker claim,\u201d said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cSpeech-based claims are generally stronger.\u201dIn the case of the Minnesota film production company, oral arguments were held last month.\u00a0The company\u2019s Christian owners, Carl and Angel\u00a0Larsen, have tried to highlight the artistic nature of their work, likening themselves more to documentary filmmakers\u00a0than videographers.\u201cWe\u2019re telling marriage stories, not merely documenting the ceremonies,\u201d\u00a0Mr. Larsen, co-owner of\u00a0Telescope Media Group,\u00a0said. \u201cWe want to tell stories about marriage that are consistent with the Bible, which shaped our beliefs. Currently, we can\u2019t do that in the state of Minnesota.\u201dLike traditional wedding videographers, however, Mr. Larsen said the couple getting married would pay for their services, which are advertised on their website.Ms. Tabacco Mar, the ACLU lawyer, called pre-emptive challenges, like the one being made in Minnesota, part of a \u201csecond generation\u201d of cases about Christian business owners serving gay couples.In the early cases, gay couples sued after they were denied services. Now, the business owners are starting to bring legal challenges even before they have been asked to serve gay weddings.\u201cThey\u2019re seeking a license to discriminate at the outset,\u201d Ms. Tabacco Mar said.The business owners themselves, however, said that pre-emptive challenges were the only way they could enter the wedding business without risking crippling punishment. In Minnesota, businesses that violate the state\u2019s nondiscrimination law face up to 90 days in jail.In the past, legal groups have often sought out the best cases, known as test cases, to challenge laws they want to overturn.Mr. Tedesco said Alliance Defending Freedom wasn\u2019t\u00a0\u201crunning around finding test cases,\u201d but was \u201cactively looking to challenge laws that threaten our clients\u2019 rights.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t say exactly how the group first encountered the Larsens.\u201cIt\u2019s well-established in case law that film is fully protected by the first amendment,\u201d he said. Though he said he believed that his clients\u2014including florists and cake shop owners\u2014should all have the right to decline to serve gay weddings, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s important to bring cases where free speech protection is involved.\u201dWrite to Ian Lovett at Ian.Lovett@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-17 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/conservatives-aim-to-shift-debate-over-gay-weddings-to-speech-rights-1497700802", "news_title": "Conservatives Aim to Shift Debate Over Gay Weddings to Speech Rights", "keywords": "baker,conservative,gay rights,gay wedding,religion,same sex marriage,videographer,wedding,wedding cake,corporate,industrial news,small,medium businesses,political,general news,society,community,discrimination,health,human rights,civil liberties,lgbt rights,sex discrimination,sexuality,social issues,marriage,divorce"}, {"content": "Stuart Montaldo might look like a landlocked gondolier gliding along bike paths on an extra-long skateboard, leaving bewildered cyclists and joggers in his dust. But he swears by his sport, SpikeBoarding, which combines elements of Nordic skiing, stand-up paddling and switch-kick longboarding for a high-intensity, low-impact workout.\u201cI never imagined I\u2019d be back on a board as an adult,\u201d says Mr. Montaldo, 53, who was into downhill and slalom skateboarding in junior high school. Two-and-a-half years ago, he started to feel aches and pains during mixed martial arts workouts. A friend suggested he try SpikeBoarding.Mr. Montaldo oversees global compliance training for conduct and culture matters for             Citigroup                   and works out of a home office in Chesterfield, Mo., a St. Louis suburb. He says kickboxing often aggravated his lower back and he suffered two shoulder injuries during jujitsu workouts. \u201cNot only is SpikeBoarding low-impact, but the motion of picking up the spike and stroking is like physical therapy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy shoulders feel great now.\u201dSpikeBoarding was created in 2010 in New York City\u2019s Central Park. A SpikeBoard is 29 inches long, resembling a longboard skateboard. The spike looks like a Nordic ski pole with the same carbide spike tip, but the handle looks like the handle of a kayak paddle. The rider can use two different strokes to propel the board forward.\u201cIt\u2019s like doing two sports in one,\u201d Mr. Montaldo says. \u201cThe sport plays to all of the weak parts of my body. It has strengthened my core, my lower back and my knees.\u201dMr. Montaldo says his wife and three children, ages 26, 24, and 16, are used to his trying unusual workouts. \u201cBikers and runners give me funny stares,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd kids are always yelling after me, \u2018That is so cool.\u2019 \u201dMr. Montaldo gets on his SpikeBoard for an hour four times a week. He will either do a 7-mile loop at Forest Park or 4 to 5 miles on the trails of Creve Coeur Park. He alternates using the Cubi-X-Cross (CXC) stroke and Stand Up Spike (SUS) stroke during workouts (see sidebar). To perform the Cubi-X-Cross stroke, one foot pushes off the ground, while the opposite hand spikes. \u201cThe Cubi-X-Cross is more aerobic,\u201d Mr. Montaldo says. He estimates he can reach up to 13 miles an hour using the Cubi-X-Cross stroke.During the Stand Up Spike (SUS) stroke, both feet remain on the board as the rider swings his arms in a square formation to spike against the pavement, alternating sides. \u201cI couldn\u2019t Stand Up Spike for more than 5 minutes when I started,\u201d Mr. Montaldo says. \u201cIt\u2019s the best core and upper-body workout I\u2019ve ever had, particularly if you\u2019re going uphill.\u201d He estimates he can reach up to 20 miles an hour on a flat stretch using the SUS stroke. To slow down and stop, he repeatedly strikes one foot, heel first, against the ground to reduce speed.Mr. Montaldo eats nutrient-dense foods. His diet is high in fruits, vegetables and nuts, while limiting carbs, meat and dairy. \u201cI love cheese, so I do cheat,\u201d he says. Breakfast might be Shredded Wheat cereal with blueberries, and lunch a barbecued bratwurst, some walnuts and grapes, and peach juice. He might snack on chips with avocado before a dinner of quinoa pasta with mushrooms, onions and almonds. He occasionally has a Manhattan for dessert.Mr. Montaldo paid $475 for his Susoix SpikeBoard and $250 for his Susoix spike. He purchased a Susoix Diamond File for $35 and uses it to sharpen his spike tip. His Pro-Designed wrist guards cost $70 and gloves $11. He wears The North Face Hedgehog Fastpack Gore-Tex sneakers, which retail for $120.\u201cI wore tennis shoes the first few years, but the North Face have more lateral stability and grip really well,\u201d he says. He bought a used Schwinn helmet for $40. He wears Smith sunglasses ($90) for eye protection.Mr. Montaldo only listens to music when he SpikeBoards on uncrowded trails or roads. \u201cI\u2019m an audiophile, so I don\u2019t need to listen to hard rock to work out. I can listen to anything from Chopin or jazz to blues and \u201960s rock.SpikeBoarding uses two strokes, the Stand Up Spike (SUS) stroke and the Cubi-X-Cross (CXC) stroke. The SUS is a modification of the double-poling Nordic skiing stroke, but uses a single pole with one hand on the top handle and another just below on the silicone grip of the shaft.When SpikeBoarders use the SUS stroke, their feet are offset across the width of the board. They switch their stance from side to side, always engaging the stroke on their front side. \u201cThe biceps are highly engaged in the SUS stroke,\u201d says SpikeBoard creator Enrique Cubillo.For the CXC stroke, one leg is used to kick off the ground, similar to a scooter kick, while the upper body spikes on the opposite side of the board using one hand on the silicone grip of the shaft. The upper arms and lats do the bulk of the work.No matter the stroke, SpikeBoarding requires a powerful core. \u201cThe abdominal muscles as well as the glutes are completely engaged during both strokes, and the abs in particular during the SUS stroke,\u201d Mr. Cubillo says.Write to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-17 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spikeboarding-a-new-low-impact-fitness-secret-1497697207", "news_title": "SpikeBoarding: A New Low-Impact Fitness Secret", "keywords": "cross-country skiing,cubi-x-cross ,cxc,high intensity,low impact,more on fitness,nordic skiing,skateboarding,spikeboarding,stand up paddling,stand up spike,sus,Stuart Montaldo,political,general news,physical fitness,health,living,lifestyle,sports,recreation,routine general news,sports equipment,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods,sports goods"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014This week, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy inherited one of the most difficult jobs in Washington: leading Congress\u2019s most powerful investigative committee charged with monitoring the workings of the federal government while a president of his own party is running it.A former prosecutor from South Carolina, Mr. Gowdy, 52 years old, was elected by his Republican colleagues this week as the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the only congressional panel dedicated full-time to investigating waste, fraud and mismanagement within the federal agencies and offices.He takes over leadership of the panel from Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a rising Republican star on Capitol Hill who surprised colleagues by resigning from his Utah seat in the middle of his term for a job in the private sector. Mr. Chaffetz will leave the House at the end of June.\u201cThis is an interesting time for me, because our party\u2014my party\u2014is in power,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said in an interview from his Capitol Hill office this week.Veterans of the oversight committee say that holding the job when a president of your own party is in power is always tough\u2014putting the chairman in a vise between his institutional responsibilities and the desire to see his party succeed legislatively and politically.\u201cIt\u2019s very different. You\u2019re protecting the quarterback instead of sacking him,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Davis, a Republican who chaired the committee for several years while       George W. Bush       was president.Mr. Davis said he was willing to issue subpoenas and write tough reports when needed, but that most White Houses bristle at oversight and expect some deference and loyalty from the rank-and-file in Congress. \u201cPresidents wish Congress didn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Mr. Davis, now a consultant. \u201cAnd the president treats his party as an appendage.\u201dAs Mr. Gowdy takes the committee\u2019s reins, President       Donald Trump       finds himself under mounting scrutiny from other congressional committees and the FBI.Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed after the firing of FBI Director       James Comey,        is now investigating whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in addition to the investigation\u2019s original mandate of probing whether anyone in the president\u2019s orbit colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the investigations a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dIn his new role, Mr. Gowdy vowed to maintain his distance from the White House. In addition to chairing the oversight committee, he\u2019s also on the House Intelligence Committee, which is already charged with investigating questions of collusion between Mr. Trump and Russia. On the oversight panel, many questions about the performance of the federal government under the Trump administration will ultimately become Mr. Gowdy\u2019s responsibility.His predecessor, Mr. Chaffetz, raised eyebrows when he took a one-on-one Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump earlier in the year. Mr. Gowdy said he has no relationship with Mr. Trump and hasn\u2019t been to the White House or talked to the president.\u201cIf you\u2019re a member of Congress, you\u2019re going to be invited to the White House. Or you can manufacture reasons to go to the White House,\u201d he said. But given his role on several investigative committees now probing questions related to the president, he said it struck him as\u00a0\u201cbeing better for everyone involved\u201d if he avoided striking up a close relationship with Mr. Trump.Mr. Gowdy bristles at the notion that Congress is the best place to investigate criminal acts. To him, law enforcement should take the lead on such investigations, including any questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior.Allies of Mr. Trump\u2019s have suggested that the president could fire the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, whom Mr. Gowdy called \u201cyour quintessential straight arrow.\u201d\u201cI do have confidence in [Mr. Mueller]. I have confidence in the women and men he has assembled on this team,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said.The committee in the past has claimed a wide-ranging mandate to investigate nearly anything that happens in the federal government. Sometimes, the panel has expanded its mandate beyond government, such as when former Rep.       Henry Waxman       (D., Calif.) used the perch to investigate steroid use in baseball.Mr. Gowdy said he\u2019d like to return the committee to its core responsibilities as assigned under the rules of the House, including monitoring federal workforce issues and the coming 2020 census.First elected to Congress in the tea party-fueled wave of 2010, Mr. Gowdy said he is eager to focus not just on the oversight and investigative aspects of the new job, but also the reform part.\u201cThat\u2019s the frustration that the public has. You have these hearings, you expose an issue, and then you do nothing about it,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said, adding that his goal is to make the government run better after an issue is uncovered by the committee.Mr. Gowdy sees the fact that Republicans control the government as a way to remove some of the politics from his new job.\u201cThis is actually a pretty rare opportunity to depoliticize oversight. Because if you are conducting oversight against your own party, you\u2019ve removed the No. 1 argument against it, which is this is a political exercise,\u201d he said.Mr. Gowdy is familiar with battling charges that he has engaged in a political exercise. He first rose to national prominence as the chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, a special panel created to investigate the death of four Americans in a 2012 terrorist attack in Libya.The panel and its chairman were routinely accused by Democrats of using taxpayer money to finance a political crusade to damage       Hillary Clinton.       Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state when the attacks occurred and was widely expected to run for the president when the panel was created in 2014.Mr. Gowdy, who has long defended the panel\u2019s work and importance, said the experience heading the Benghazi committee taught him that it is \u201calmost impossible to conduct serious investigations in a political environment.\u201d He tangled frequently with Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, over the way the probe was conducted.The pair are poised to revive their rivalry on the oversight committee, where Mr. Cummings is the top Democrat. Mr. Gowdy describes his relationship with Mr. Cummings as strong and expressed hope that they could work together on some issues.For his part, Mr. Cummings said he hoped to meet with Mr. Gowdy soon to discuss ways they could work together, pointing to the more than 700 letters he signed jointly with Mr. Chaffetz during their time together as the top Democrat and Republican on the panel.\u201cI hope to talk to Chairman Gowdy about continuing to protect and fully exercise our committee\u2019s unique jurisdiction over White House officials,\u201d Mr. Cummings said, \u201cwhich includes the vetting system, the security-clearance process and the compliance with ethics rules.\u201dWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Gowdy to Play Crucial Oversight Role.'", "news_time": "2017-06-17 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trey-gowdy-takes-reins-of-congresss-most-powerful-investigative-committee-1497697210", "news_title": "Trey Gowdy Takes Reins of Congress\u2019s Most Powerful Investigative Committee", "keywords": " donald trump, gop,house of representatives,house oversight and government reform committee, house oversight committee,house panel, president trump, republicans, russia meddling in election,trey gowdy, white house,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The U.S. meat industry is striving to crack a conundrum: Why fewer eggs are hatching chicks.Over the first five months of the year, the percentage of eggs hatching broiler chickens, raised for their meat, fell to its lowest level in over a decade. That is a big problem for companies in an industry that requires about 750 million new chickens each month to raise, slaughter and process into wings, breasts and drumsticks.\u201cThis is pretty out of the ordinary,\u201d said Will Sawyer, animal-protein analyst at Rabobank. As to the cause, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has the for-sure answer.\u201dThe chicken sector\u2019s decadeslong effort to make chickens grow at rapid speeds has never helped fertility. But industry officials point to a confluence of factors behind this year\u2019s decline. Some think new varieties of fast-growing breeder chickens are overeating and growing too top-heavy to effectively procreate in the first place. The breeding flock may also be growing older overall, reducing fertility. Elderly chickens\u2019 libidos also tend to wane, breeders and academics say.The situation affects both poultry companies and consumers. At current prices, a 1% decline in the percentage of eggs that hatch of those set in incubators translates to about $121 million in lost sales for the poultry industry over the first five months of 2017, according to analysts\u2019 estimates.For retailers, restaurants and consumers, fewer hatching eggs\u2014together with rising meat exports and strong consumer demand\u2014have contributed to higher prices. Wholesale prices for boneless breast meat have surged by 68%, while consumer prices have climbed 3%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grocery stores tend to operate on six- to 12-month supply contracts for poultry, suggesting that consumer prices could rise further.The companies that dominate the $60 billion U.S. chicken industry, including             Tyson Foods Inc.,Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp.       Perdue Farms Inc. and             Sanderson Farms Inc.       rely on a tightly managed network of breeding farms and industrial-scale incubators. They place about 180 million baby chicks each week onto farms to raise roughly 9 billion birds annually.The parents of those chickens are supplied by breeding companies, which have mapped the chicken\u2019s DNA to help choose birds that gain weight rapidly, particularly profitable breast meat, while consuming the least possible amount of feed. Modern broiler chickens can swell to 6.2 pounds in about seven weeks, growing to be twice as large as the birds\u2019 ancestors.\u201cThese birds can grow to become big ol\u2019 couch potatoes,\u201d said Phil Stayer, corporate veterinarian for Mississippi-based Sanderson Farms, which raised and processed about 500 million chickens in 2016.Fertility challenges accompanying rapid growth may have contributed to an average 81.52% of eggs placed into incubators successfully hatching during the first five months of this year, the lowest such stretch since early 2007, according to Rabobank estimates. It ranged nearly 1 percentage point below the average of the previous five years.Aside from possible problems stemming from overeating and age, some industry officials pin part of the egg-hatching dip on new breeding chickens. For instance, Alabama-based Aviagen Inc. over the last two years has been introducing new birds that now make up nearly half the U.S. market in broiler-chicken breeding birds, according to industry estimates. Tyson, which maintains a breeding subsidiary, also has been introducing a new breeding rooster.Figuring out how to manage any new breeder bird can be tricky. Underfeeding hens and roosters can leave them sluggish and reduce fertility. But gaining too much weight can make them lazy, with sore feet and legs, according to Dr. Keith Bramwell, a poultry specialist at the University of Arkansas.\u201cUnfortunately, if you let breeders grow to their potential, they will be horrible breeders,\u201d said Mr. Bramwell, who works with poultry companies on their breeding flocks. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine line.\u201d Feed components, including calorie and protein levels, are being fine-tuned to keep the birds from growing too thin or fat to procreate at the levels poultry executives expect.An Aviagen spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A Tyson spokesman said the company\u2019s egg-hatching is in line with expectations for its breeds.Breeding specialists also have been experimenting with male-to-female ratios. Typically there is one rooster for every 10 hens, but if a new male variety proves unusually assertive, fewer are needed.Producers\u2019 zest to capture robust poultry profits has also meant keeping some breeder hens in production longer than usual, to help produce as many baby chicks as possible, industry officials said. As chickens age, a lower percentage of their eggs tend to successfully hatch.Mr. Bramwell said that mixing up the age range within a group of breeder roosters has an impact. An infusion of younger, 25-week-old males can boost older rivals\u2019 reproductive zeal. He said: \u201cThat seems to motivate those older males.\u201dWrite to Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-17 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/poultry-farmers-brood-over-slowdown-in-breeding-1497697205", "news_title": "Poultry Farmers Brood Over Slowdown in Breeding ", "keywords": " chickens, eggs,poultry,Aviagen,Pilgrim's Pride,PPC,Perdue Farms,Sanderson Farms,SAFM,Tyson Foods,TSN,Dr. Keith Bramwell,Phil Stayer,Will Sawyer,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,agriculture,farming,poultry farming,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,poultry processing,consumer goods,food products,livestock farming"}, {"content": "Most established robo-advisory services have little to no socially responsible investment options.

The French author\u2019s tale\u2014the first published in English\u2014is set in southern France and told from the perspective of a preteen boy named Isidore. A tragedy brings his emotional intelligence to the fore and changes his role in a family once dominated by his five dazzling older siblings. He is approaching adulthood when the oldest person in the world tells Isidore her life would be worthwhile if someone would just remember her. She asks if he will. His younger self, full of innocence, would have sworn to do so. But the one who has come of age knows such promises are hard to keep.by Stephanie Powell Watts (April 4)Andrew Medlar, librarian and assistant chief of technology, content and innovation, Chicago Public Library\u201cThis one really sticks to my ribs,\u201d said Mr. Medlar, describing a tale full of \u201csnarky gossip, sultry weather and sweet tea.\u201d Critics have called the book a reinvention of \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d that explores the American Dream in the modern South with African-American characters.

She is married to a furniture-factory worker with sawdust in his hair and a line of dirt under his fingernails \u201clike the vein in shrimp.\u201d Mr. Medlar called it \u201cthe kind of book where almost every page you want to stop and tweet a quote.\u201dby Gabriel Tallent (Aug. 29)Cathy Langer, director of buying, Tattered Cover Book Store in DenverA father lives with his daughter Turtle on the northern California coast, in a house overgrown with vines and overrun with animals. He is a survivalist, putting the pots out for the raccoons to lick clean so he can reuse them. Turtle, deeply in his thrall, is a remarkable and damaged 14-year-old who shoots targets with real bullets in the kitchen. When she develops a crush on a local boy, she learns the dangers of crossing her charismatic father. \u201cThere are some really horrifying scenes and you might wonder why you\u2019re subjecting yourself to it, but if you keep going, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d said Ms. Langer, calling Turtle a character unlike any she\u2019d ever encountered. \u201cHer vibrating energy, her skill with a gun, her understanding of nature and just her wildness\u2014you\u2019re rooting for her to find a way out.\u201dby Michael Connelly (July 18)Chris Schluep,        senior books editor, AmazonWhen Detective Ren\u00e9e Ballard\u2019s rising career is derailed, she gets stuck working the night shift, also known as \u201cthe late show.\u201d She is used to giving up her cases by morning, but not when a prostitute is brutally beaten and a waitress is killed in a nightclub shooting. Mr. Schluep immediately took to the new series, with its engaging heroine and the author\u2019s reliably authentic-sounding cop talk and crime-scene details. \u201cIt\u2019s the relationships between the characters that I really appreciate\u2014this is not paint-by-numbers detective writing,\u201d said Mr. Schluep.

Still, less obviously, Mr. Trump\u2019s policy also took into account pressure from business groups, Republicans in agricultural states and others to avoid completely undoing the opening to Cuba and to refrain from interfering with projects already under way.So while he emphasized human rights and civil liberties in his speech, the policy outlined by Mr. Trump also recognized matters of importance to many Americans and U.S. businesses, in keeping with the \u201ctransactional\u201d foreign policy approach he has used elsewhere.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking to acknowledge the political and the personal views of a shrinking part of the Cuban-American community in Miami, clearly this policy and the announcement does that,\u201d said Matthew Aho, a special adviser at the Akerman law firm who works with companies looking to do business in Cuba. \u201cBut it also preserves the foundation of normalization and of the post-2014 period.\u201dPolitically, Mr. Trump had to thread a needle to alter Mr. Obama\u2019s policy while not upsetting business leaders and voters in rural states that supported him in wide margins, and where farmers see big opportunities to ship their goods should the U.S. embargo ever be fully lifted.\u201cBy rolling back reforms that have benefited U.S. citizens, everyday Cubans and our economy, we are taking a step backward, not forward.\u201d said Sen. John Boozman (R., Ark.) \u201cIt would be more effective to continue an open line of communication and working relationship with a government in need of democratic assistance, instead of shutting them out. Through this approach, we not only trade goods, but ideas. The two go hand-in-hand.\u201dThe U.S. sent $83.4 million in goods to Cuba in the first four months of this year. Farmers see big potential in selling rice, poultry and other products to Cuba, but those sales still aren\u2019t practical because U.S. law blocks the kind of credit needed to ease those shipments.In a sign of the political importance Mr. Trump placed on Friday\u2019s announcement, he devoted a significant portion of his remarks to reflections on his presidential campaign and the support he received in Florida. \u201cI have wonderful memories from our visit during the campaign,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He told those supporters Friday that he was \u201ccanceling\u201d the Obama administration\u2019s policy shift.In reality, he retained many elements of it.Trump administration officials have stressed they don\u2019t want to interrupt American business already under way on the island. Depending on how regulations are crafted in the coming months by officials at the Treasury and Commerce departments, there could be carve-outs that would satisfy some businesses. The policy allows airlines and cruise lines to keep operating.The White House moved to address concerns raised Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin,        who worried about leaving current projects in limbo. The final policy guidance stresses that the Trump administration doesn\u2019t intend to interrupt ongoing projects.Backers of the policy shift pointed to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s intervention, citing his department\u2019s responsibility for crafting many of the final regulations as evidence that the Trump administration might not go too far in scaling back some of the space for business created by Mr. Obama.The policy stands to adversely affect travelers by ending a practice begun under the Obama administration that allowed travelers to plan their own trips, rather than travel with tour groups, which resulted in a boost in tourism.A document released by Treasury officials explaining the changes says the administration will work with travelers affected by the changes who have begun to plan trips. But a longer term decline in the number of American travelers likely to be a result from Mr. Trump\u2019s shift stands to harm airlines, which had expected demand to grow over time.\u2014Carol E.

Amazon.com        AMZN 0.24%       has successfully twisted that to its own ends for much of its life, but the logic still holds.The e-commerce giant built much of its early fortune by stockpiling Harry Potter books in huge warehouses in the Nevada desert and shipping them relatively cheaply throughout the West. That did to the bookselling industry what Amazon has now done to a range of retailers. But books don\u2019t grow mold after a couple of days. So while Amazon has pushed to get ever closer to customers in recent years, its ambitious goals for the grocery business still required a different tack.Enter             Whole Foods Market,             which Amazon acquired Friday for $13.7 billion. Like Amazon, Whole Foods knows that the closer it gets its products to consumers, the better. With 456 stores concentrated in pricey ZIP Codes, Whole Foods already is close to a lot of customers with means. And it keeps getting closer; the grocer has grown its gross square footage by an average of 11% annually over the past decade.That should check an important item off Amazon\u2019s shopping list. And it is one Amazon would have had a harder time building on its own. Fulfillment costs, which include distribution centers, already represent about 13% of Amazon\u2019s net revenue, compared with 10% five years ago. And while the company\u2019s existing distribution footprint is immense, only about 3% of its 94.5 million square feet of distribution space is devoted to fresh-food delivery, according to       Marc Wulfraat,        president of supply-chain consultancy MWPVL.Whole Foods reported 17.8 million gross square feet of space at the end of 2016, with another 4.1 million in development. It also has 11 distribution centers of its own, according to Mr. Wulfraat. So Amazon\u2019s acquisition of the food seller significantly boosts its grocery capacity. And the average size of Whole Foods\u2019 stores has crept up by 14% over the past five years, which theoretically gives Amazon more room to add other types of products or services, such as same-day pickup for goods sold online.There is a cost, of course. The price of the deal amounts to nearly two-thirds of Amazon\u2019s last reported cash position. The company\u2019s debt load already has risen by nearly a factor of 10 in the past five years as it has financed an aggressive expansion, though its ability to service that debt has risen even faster and the company\u2019s balance sheet remains healthy. Nevertheless, S&P Global Ratings placed Amazon on watch for a possible downgrade Friday.Amazon\u2019s investors are clearly willing to bear the cost, given that the company added more than $11 billion in market cap on the deal\u2019s announcement Friday. That is because Amazon these days is valued primarily on its ability to maintain double-digit growth in its core retail business while breaking into new markets. Whole Foods should help on both counts.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Amazon Just Got Closer to You.'", "news_time": "2017-06-17 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-amazon-juggernaut-is-coming-to-a-neighborhood-near-you-1497697221", "news_title": "The Amazon Juggernaut Is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You", "keywords": "amazon whole foods,delivery,distribution,food,fulfillment centers,grocer,heard,heard on the street,locations,pickup,stores,Amazon.com,AMZN,Whole Foods Market,WFM,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "Rochester, N.Y.Looking at the photographs of       Eugene Richards       can induce a kind of disbelief. That the world should inflict so much pain on so many people, and that he would regard it as his life\u2019s work to witness and capture it, can be hard to comprehend. And yet, for nearly 50 years, in numerous magazine essays and some 15 books, he has recorded the human capacity to withstand suffering and despair, using his cameras to extract moments of lyrical intensity from the direst circumstances.Eugene Richards: The Run-On of TimeGeorge Eastman Museum  Through Oct. 22\u201cEugene Richards: The Run-On of Time,\u201d his untrendy and emotionally draining retrospective, which has just opened at the George Eastman Museum, contains nearly 150 prints and four short films of still images, on subjects as diverse as river blindness in Africa and the depopulation of rural America. In both their installation and the handsome catalog, co-curators       Lisa Hostetler       of the GEM and       April M. Watson       of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (to where the show will travel) have skillfully organized the 73-year-old\u2019s oeuvre in an informal chronology that exposes its common themes. Mr. Richards\u2019s identification with the damaged and luckless is one visible thread. Another is the magnetic grip of family and community.The first of the three rooms begins in Boston, where he was born in 1944 and where, after college at Northeastern, he took graduate photography courses at MIT with the orphic Minor White. In 1967, to avoid being drafted during the Vietnam War, Mr. Richards joined Vista and was assigned to the Deep South. Angered by the grinding racism and poverty he saw there, he photographed the daily lives of African-Americans and co-founded an activist newspaper in Memphis, experiences assembled in his first book, \u201cFew Comforts or Surprises: The Arkansas Delta\u201d (1973).On his return to Boston, he continued to report from the margins of American society. In 1973 he moved with his first wife, the writer       Dorothea Lynch,        to the largely white working-class neighborhood of Dorchester. His boisterous portraits of its residents led to the self-published \u201cDorchester Days\u201d in 1978. That same year, after Lynch was diagnosed with breast cancer, he began to document (at her request) the progress of her treatment, until her death in 1983.On the walls of the second and largest room here is a selection of the many projects he undertook between the 1980s and 2010s. These include the frantic and exhausting routine of emergency-room doctors in Denver; psychiatric patients confined to shabby hospitals in Ohio, Mexico and South America; addicts smoking crack or shooting up heroin in Brooklyn and Philadelphia; American families trying to mend after the death or maiming of a son or daughter in the wars since 2001; and impoverished communities that pockmark the U.S., from Appalachia to Arkansas.Probably no living photographer combines so deeply the independent spirit and formal bravado of storied Life photographer W. Eugene Smith as Mr. Richards. Often shot with a wide-angle lens, his pictures tend to be eccentric, with canted horizons and multiple points of focus. The compositions are rarely so ornate, though, that the emotional meaning is garbled.A black-and-white photograph taken soon after Sept. 11, 2001, is typical. It shows the hand of a New York shopkeeper reaching into a display case of tourist knickknacks\u2014among them a snow globe of the Twin Towers\u2014covered with ash. Among his photographs documenting soldiers killed in Iraq or Afghanistan is one of a boy precariously standing in a fir tree to watch a graveyard funeral.This second room also introduces his transition to color. A small group of his large landscapes from 2004-06, elegiac portraits of abandoned farms, are mounted on partitions as a more meditative space. Although photographers may have overdone the Romantic theme of the deserted home, Mr. Richards has met the challenge. His soft, multihued pictures of a snow-covered bed in an empty North Dakota room and the bleak view looking out from a glassed-in kitchen in Nebraska are among his finest.His adherence to the constraints of the still photograph is unusual today. Three of his short films, playing on a loop here, are essentially slideshows, albeit with music and his voiceover.The most wrenching of these describes his revisit with an African-American woman named Dorothy and her family in the Arkansas Delta. He had photographed her in the \u201970s and her desperate situation then may be worse now. His self-critical remarks about her ambiguous reactions to his presence touch on issues that any intruding reporter must face, especially as \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d has become a flashpoint.\u201cThere\u2019s always, always people who don\u2019t want you around,\u201d he said in a recent newspaper interview. \u201cYou have to find some sympathetic way in, and then decide what your job is. It\u2019s very seldom a pleasant process, you just grit your teeth and go.\u201dThis is not an exhibition for the politically correct or aesthetically numb. Don\u2019t expect to leave here dry-eyed.\u2014Mr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.", "news_time": "2017-06-17 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eugene-richards-the-run-on-of-time-review-keeping-his-eyes-wide-open-1497697202", "news_title": "\u2018Eugene Richards: The Run-On of Time\u2019 Review: Keeping His Eyes Wide Open", "keywords": "arts in review, documentary,eugene richards, george eastman museum, photography, the run-on of time,Eugene Richards,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,photography,reviews"}]
