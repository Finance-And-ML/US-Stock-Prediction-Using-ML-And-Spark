The veteran right-hander produced his most effective start of the season, holding Baltimore scoreless for 6 1/3 innings as Milwaukee completed a sweep with a 4-0 victory at Miller Park.  We keep feeding off each other,  said Garza (4-4), who scattered five hits and two walks while striking out four.  It has been a fun ride. We need to keep going and see how this thing plays out.  Garza worked out of a bases-loaded jam with nobody out in the third. He responded with two strikeouts and then escaped when Seth Smith flied out to left.  It was a big momentum shift for us,  Garza said.  It was awesome. I was able to sneak out of it. I got a couple of punchouts and a flyout. I really took off from there. I got my mechanics back in order in the third and I felt like I was in control from there on out.  Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at BrewersBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchHe had put two more on in the third but cruised from there and retired 10 of his final 11 batters for his first victory in four starts and just his second victory in his last six decisions.  He pitched with some traffic on in the first three innings, but I thought the last three and a third he pitched very, very well,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. Milwaukee's bats couldn't accomplish much against Baltimore left-hander Jayson Aquino but made the most of their limited opportunities. Aquino (1-2) was making a spot start in place of Chris Tillman, who was placed on the paternity list after his wife gave birth the night before, and held Milwaukee to four runs (three earned) and five hits while striking out seven without a walk.  (Aquino) pitched real well, he deserved a better fate,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  We didn't play well behind him defensively.  Travis Shaw put him in an early hole with a double to lead off the second inning and scored when Keon Broxton reached on an error by Manny Machado to give the Brewers a 1-0 lead. Ryan Braun followed suit in the fourth, opening the inning with a double off the top of the wall in right and coming home on a one-out single by Domingo Santana to make it 2-0. Broxton homered later in the inning, sending Aquino's first pitch over the wall in center for his 14th home run of the season.  I miss(ed) a pitch and the result was a home run,  Aquino said through a team interpreter.  I just missed a pitch right there.  Oliver Drake, Jared Hughes and Corey Knebel combined to allow three hits and strike out seven in the final 2 2/3 innings to complete Milwaukee's fourth shutout of the season and second in the last 10 games. The victory helped National League Central-leading Milwaukee maintain a 3 1/2-game lead over the second-place Chicago Cubs, who they'll face Thursday in a makeup game at Wrigley Field before wrapping up the first half with a three-game series in New York against the Yankees.  We are just going to keep riding it, man,  Garza said.  There's not really much to say about it. We're going to just keep going and see if we can finish these last four games off strong to build a nice cushion before the break.  NOTES: The Orioles activated LHP Zach Britton (left forearm strain) from the 60-day disabled list. He worked a scoreless seventh inning, allowing a hit and a walk in his first action since May 4. ... Brewers 3B Eric Sogard will get one more day to rest his sore ankles before the team decides whether to place him on the disabled list, manager Craig Counsell said. ... Milwaukee RHP Wily Peralta began a minor league rehab assignment with Triple-A Colorado Springs. Peralta has been shelved since June 20 with a strained right calf and will pitch in two-inning stints as he continues his conversion into a reliever, Counsell said. ... The Brewers agreed to terms with prep OF Tristen Lutz, the No. 34 overall selection in last month's draft. Lutz will join the team's Arizona Rookie League squad in Phoenix later in the week.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-orioles-brewers-writethru-idUSMTZED76NE6548"},

The USD300 million-500 million of notes will mature after 10 years and will be callable by CHB after five years. They will qualify as Tier-2 capital as their terms include a point of non-viability that the authorities may trigger at their discretion. The terms also make explicit reference to the Hong Kong resolution authorities' statutory bail-in powers under The Financial Institutions (Resolution) Ordinance, which will come into effect on 7 July 2017. The new issuance will be used by the bank to strengthen its capital base and to fund business growth. The notes represent direct, unsecured, and subordinated obligations of CHB. The final rating is contingent on the receipt of the final documents conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch rates the notes one notch below CHB's Viability Rating of 'bbb', which is the anchor rating for the notes. The one-notch difference reflects the notes' below-average recovery prospects relative to senior unsecured instruments, as well as their partial contractual loss-absorption feature that allows for a permanent write-down in full or in part. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) can override the notes' contractual terms through its resolution powers if it considers it necessary to restore the bank's viability. We consider it possible that noteholders would only lose part of their investment in such a statutory bail-in scenario as the authorities would be guided by the principle that no creditor should be worse off in resolution compared to bankruptcy. We apply no additional notching for non-performance as the point of non-viability broadly coincides with what we express in the anchor rating. CHB's ratings were affirmed on 11 May 2017, reflecting its small domestic franchise and rapid China-related growth through customer referrals from its 75% parent, Yue Xiu Group, resulting in high mainland China exposure of 40% of assets at end-2016 (2015: 41%). A steady increase in operating profit from China-related lending is offset by below-peers contribution from non-loan businesses and lower cost efficiency. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating on the notes is sensitive to any changes in CHB's Viability Rating, which in turn is sensitive to the performance of its China-related activities, maintenance of sufficient loss-absorption buffers and stringent risk controls.

The Pittsburgh starter gave up two runs in the first inning and then settled in, going six strong innings while also providing the eventual game-winning hit in the Pirates' 5-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday night at Citizens Bank Park.  He basically Little Leagued the guys tonight,  Pirates skipper Clint Hurdle said. The Pirates (39-46) hit Phillies starter Ben Lively hard in the first three innings, but several long fly balls fell just short of the wall. They finally got to him in the fourth, when a John Jaso single, a Josh Bell triple and a David Freese sacrifice fly tied the score at 2. Lively then played a large role in his own demise, issuing a two-out walk to Francisco Cervelli and allowing Jordy Mercer to reach on a dribbler by throwing high to first base, loading the bases.  I just caught it, I looked up, thought (Mercer) was further down the line than he was, and I just rushed it,  Lively said.  (I) felt really good tonight ... just let that one inning get away from me.  Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at PhilliesPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchCole made his counterpart pay, lacing a two-run single up the middle to break open the game. Those were his first two RBIs of the season and his 13th and 14th in his five years in the majors.  I wasn't trying to do much,  he said.  Obviously, a single works there. I was trying to work the count and not be too aggressive because his pitch count was high. I just hit it up the middle.  The Pirates tacked on a run in the sixth inning on an RBI triple by Mercer. Cole (7-7) picked up the win, giving up two runs and seven hits, throwing 75 of his 113 pitches for strikes. He walked one and struck out eight, including all three outs in the sixth inning. The home run Cole gave up in the second inning to Maikel Franco was his 19th allowed on the season -- already eight more than last year -- but he didn't let that bother him.  He gave us the outing we needed tonight,  Hurdle said.  Fastball velocity was real tonight. He stayed strong and finished strong.  Felipe Rivero, who turned 26 on Wednesday, pitched around a one-out single for his fifth save of the season. The Phillies (28-55) out-hit the Pirates 10-8 but couldn't plate the runs necessary to mount a comeback. Leadoff hitter Daniel Nava went 3-for-4 to raise his average to .313, but his team went 1-for-8 with runners in scoring position and left eight men on base.  We just couldn't push runs across once again,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  Twice tonight we had a man on third base with less than two outs and couldn't get him in. We just can't string together enough hits to score some crooked numbers.  Philadelphia's best chance came in the seventh inning, with runners at second and third and one out, but Pittsburgh right fielder Gregory Polanco completed a double play on a fly ball with a rocket strike to the plate to end the inning.  That was a great throw, man,  Cole said.  Big out. Definitely locked down the momentum on our side.  Lively (1-4) departed after giving up five hits and four runs (two earned) in four innings. He threw 52 of his 84 pitches for strikes. Lively is still looking for his first win since his major league debut on June 3. The Phillies plated two in the first inning on a two-run homer by Franco, who placed a 2-2 breaking ball five rows deep in the left field bleachers for his 12th home run of the season. NOTES: The four-game series culminates Thursday with Phillies RHP Jeremy Hellickson (5-5, 4.48 ERA) going against Pittsburgh RHP Chad Kuhl (2-6, 5.26). ... The Phillies took the series opener 4-0 before the Pirates responded with a 3-0 win on Tuesday. ... The Pirates are 27-14 against the Phillies since 2012 in the intrastate rivalry. ...

Australia's management of the Great Barrier Reef has come under sustained criticism amid the biggest ever coral die-off as a result of the strongest El Nino in 20 years, a weather event that scientists believe is exacerbated by climate change. Eager to head-off charges that it was failing the World Heritage Site, which was recently pegged at being worth $56 billon to Australia, the Coalition government of Malcolm Turnbull lobbied all 21 UNESCO members.

This, environmentalists claim, would release plumes of soil and debris over the reef, causing damage to its ecosystem.

The decision, which was taken at a UNESCO committee meeting in the Polish city of Krakow, allows Australia's conservative government to dodge political embarrassment and potential damage to the country's lucrative tourism industry,   We're taking every action possible to ensure this great wonder of the world stays viable and healthy for future generations to come,  Australia's Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio. Australia's management of the Great Barrier Reef has come under sustained criticism amid the biggest ever coral die-off as a result of the strongest El Nino in 20 years, a weather event that scientists believe is exacerbated by climate change. Eager to head-off charges that it was failing the World Heritage Site, which was recently pegged at being worth $56 billon to Australia, the Coalition government of Malcolm Turnbull lobbied all 21 UNESCO members.

Slideshow (2 Images)Adani's Abbot Point terminal, located adjacent to the reef, would also need to be expanded to accommodate all the extra traffic. This, environmentalists claim, would release plumes of soil and debris over the reef, causing damage to its ecosystem.

It urged Australia to accelerate its efforts to improve water quality, describing it as  essential to the overall resilience of the property .

There is an outstanding ICC warrant for Pressident Omar Hassan al-Bashir's arrest on genocide charges, which he denies. Thursday's ruling will be closely watched for its possible implications for Bashir and other sitting heads of state as well as for the court itself. If the ICC rules that South Africa's decision to let Bashir go was an act of non-compliance, the court could then either report Pretoria to the U.N. Security Council or to the ICC's own member states. In either case, South Africa would only likely suffer the diplomatic setback of a court reprimand, rather than any further fine or sanction. It is also possible that the court may accept South Africa's argument that it was not obliged to implement the warrant. Pretoria has argued that the ICC's warrant for Bashir's arrest was void in the face of a South African law that grants sitting heads of state immunity from prosecution, in line with customary international law. However, the ICC's statutes explicitly state that sitting heads of states do not have immunity in war crimes cases. Bashir, who came to power in Sudan in a 1989 Islamist and military-backed coup, was charged with genocide and crimes against humanity in 2008 over the deaths and persecution of ethnic groups in the Darfur province. He denies the charges and continues to travel abroad, trailed by human rights activists and shunned by Western diplomats. Though Sudan is not a member of the ICC, the court has jurisdiction there due to a 2005 U.N. Security Council resolution that referred the conflict to the Hague court. The ICC faces the risk that any action it takes will only  underline waning international support for its own existence. The United States, Russia and China never became ICC members. In Africa, resentment over the court's indictments of Africans has led Kenya to threaten withdrawal, and the African Union also called in February for mass withdrawals. South Africa has gone further, formally notifying the United Nations last year that it intended to withdraw from the court.  Earlier this year a domestic South African court blocked the move over procedural issues, but authorities said as recently as last week that they would press ahead with the withdrawal.

Middle East crude sellers consider Japan, the world's fourth-largest oil importer, a premium market since its refiners will pay more to secure supply than other Asian buyers. Saudi Arabia raises revenue by boosting sales of more expensive light crude since it cut its supply of so-called heavy crude to comply with the agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers to reduce output. Japan's imports of Saudi crude between January and June reached 1.3 million bpd, 7.7 percent higher than a year ago, making it Japan's biggest supplier, according to trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. The increase was mainly in Arab Extra Light as state oil giant Saudi Aramco offered extra cargoes on top of contracted volumes to Japanese buyers, two Japanese refining sources said. They declined to be named due to company policies. Imports of Arab Extra Light and Arab Light were 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) higher through May at 1.03 million bpd, said Virendra Chauhan, Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects. Saudi Arabia  clearly sees Asia as its backyard and as a center of growth and long-term source of demand. As such, it does not want to give up too much market share here,  he said. FILE PHOTO - Steam spews from the chimneys of an oil refinery in Kawasaki, south of Tokyo January 30, 2013.Toru HanaiSaudi Aramco did not respond to an e-mail from Reuters seeking comment. Japan's spending on oil through May this year surged 73 percent from the same time a year ago to 3.82 trillion yen  ($33.64 billion) as global oil prices rose and imports climbed, data from the Ministry of Finance shows.  Saudi imports came at the expense of Iran, whose imports dropped 20 percent in the first half of 2017, and Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which fell by 8 percent and 5 percent respectively. Saudi crude exports to its second- and third-largest Asian buyers - China and South Korea - were little changed in the first half of 2017 from a year ago, the trade flow data showed.  Exports to India and Taiwan dropped 3 percent and 13 percent respectively, the data on Eikon showed. Trade sources said this was because Saudi Aramco was unable to supply more heavy crude. The tighter supplies have pushed the official selling price that Saudi Arabia sets for its Arab Heavy crude for August loading to the highest since the end of 2013.  People are asking for more (heavy crude) but the Saudis can't give because of the OPEC cuts,  said a Gulf oil source who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.

Qatar Airways joins Emirates, Turkish Airlines and Etihad Airways who have also announced this week a lifting of the U.S. ban on their flights. In March, the United States imposed the ban on direct flights originating at 10 airports in eight countries -- Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey -- to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Qatar Airways said in a statement early on Thursday the ban had been lifted after the airline and its hub airport Hamad International met with all new U.S. security requirements. U.S. transport officials were due to visit Qatar Airways, Emirates and Turkish Airlines on Wednesday to check that the latest measures are in place, a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) told Reuters on Wednesday. The United States announced on June 29 enhanced security measures for flights to the country which require additional time to screen passengers and personal electronic devices for possible explosives. The new measures, which take effect within three weeks of the announcement, will affect around 325,000 daily passengers travelling on 180 airlines from 280 airports around the world, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Airlines that fail to meet the new security requirements could still face in-cabin electronics restrictions. Saudi Arabia Airlines (Saudia) expects the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19, state news agency SPA reported on Tuesday. Other airlines affected by the ban include Royal Jordanian , Kuwait Airways, EgyptAir and Royal Air Maroc.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index dipped 0.1 percent or 2.7 points to 5,760.6 points by 0243 GMT. Financial stocks were the biggest drag with the Big Four banks - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia , National Australia Bank and Australia New Zealand Banking - all drifting lower. Minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting released on Wednesday showed policymakers increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises. The details of the meeting, at which the U.S. central bank voted to raise interest rates, also showed that several officials wanted to announce a start to the process of reducing the Fed's large portfolio of Treasury bonds by the end of August but others wanted to wait until later in the year.  All in all, the minutes essentially show that these officials do not seem to have a clear picture of where things are really heading, and what the appropriate policy calibration will be,  OCBC Bank said in a note. Market sentiment was also dented by oil prices which plummeted about 4 percent on Wednesday, ending their longest string of daily gains in more than five years, as rising OPEC exports and a stronger dollar spurred selling. Among energy stocks, Beach Energy Ltd fell 1.3 percent while WorleyParsons Ltd was down 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, the world No. 1 stand-alone wine company Treasury Wine Estates Ltd fell as much as 2.1 percent to touch a near two-month low. Despite the losses on the benchmark during the day, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 1.2-to-1 ratio. Sentiment in some of the sectors was boosted by data showing Australia's trade surplus rebounded sharply in May as coal shipments recovered faster than expected from cyclone disruptions, putting exports back on track to add to economic growth in the quarter. Among the gainers, biopharma giant CSL Ltd climbed 1.8 percent while retailer Wesfarmers was up 1.1 percent. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index edged 0.2 percent or 13.27 points higher to 7,608.94. The utilities sector drove the index higher and accounted for more than one-fourth of the gains.

The notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by International Financial Center Property Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing Capital Land Ltd. (BCL; BB+/Stable), which is in turn a 54.5% directly owned listed subsidiary of Beijing Capital Group Company Limited (BCG; BBB/Negative). The notes are rated at the same level as BCG's senior unsecured rating, as BCG has granted a keepwell and liquidity support deed and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking to ensure that the issuer and guarantor have sufficient assets and liquidity to meet their respective obligations for the senior notes. The proceeds of the notes will be used mainly to meet BCL's refinancing needs and to pay the interests of current indebtedness. Fitch's Negative Outlook on BCG reflects our belief that leverage will continue to rise, as well as the weak interest coverage on the holding company (holdco) level as of end-2016. The infrastructure segment leverage has deteriorated over the last 12 months due to the inclusion of the new subway, Beijing's subway Line 14. The property segment has remained highly leveraged regardless of the development of the holdco's land in Daxing, a 3 million square metre (sqm) piece of land directly held by the holdco in Beijing's suburban district. Development of Daxing is likely to provide a weaker buffer than Fitch had previously expected due to the timing lag of cash upstream to the holdco. Fitch will take negative rating action if BCG fails to generate sufficient cash inflow from the holdco's land so that BCG's ratio of dividend and interest income to interest expense remains below 1.2x. KEY RATING DRIVERS Environment Protection Leverage Deterioration: BCG's subsidiary, Beijing Capital Co. Ltd. (BCC), continues to operate the core environmental protection business for BCG. BCC has had a high capex and acquisition programme since 2014 due to its expansion in the waste-management business. BCC's free cash flow (FCF) remained negative in 2016 despite a lower capex of around CNY4.5 billion in 2016, which was lower than the CNY6 billion in both 2014 and 2015. We believe BCC's FCF will remain negative in the next three years as operating cash flow generation lags capex by two to three years - due to the construction period for projects. Fitch expects BCC's FFO-adjusted net leverage to be sustained above 12x in the expansion phase, putting pressure on BCG's standalone rating. The segment credit profile is commensurate with a high 'B' rating. Weak, Unstable Interest Coverage: The holdco's ratio of dividends to interest expense remained below 1x in 2015 because the holdco's total debt increased by more than CNY6 billion. The ongoing disposal of non-core assets helps to reduce total debt and hence interest expense, but Fitch does not expect cash flow from the disposal to uphold the ratio. However, BCG could generate enough cash flow to deleverage if it successfully develops its 3 million sqm Daxing land and 38 million sq m of land in the Beijing-Tianijn-Hebei region. Daxing Asset Realisation Credit Positive: BCG launched the Meilanwan social housing project in Daxing in 2016. The project accounts for less than 10% of the Daxing land area, and is likely to generate more than CNY5 billion in revenue. The deduced land valuation from the Meilanwan project is considerably higher than our previous estimate. Fitch continues to assess BCG's property segment on a consolidated basis. Our expectation of the decline in this sector's leverage (as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory) to less than 50% for the next three years supports BCG's ratings. A higher valuation of the Daxing land is a main driver as BCL, whose standalone credit profile is assessed at 'B+', saw little change in its 2016 leverage at 67.8% compared with 65.2% (restated) in 2015, and its deleveraging may not be likely in 2017. Lack of improvement in the credit profile of BCG's property segment may pressure its ratings. Stable Infrastructure: BCG's Beijing MTR Co., Ltd (Beijing MTR) has started consolidating revenue from its Line 14 subway investment in 2016 under its franchising contract with the Beijing government. The CNY13 billion capex for Line 14, initially funded by Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co Ltd (A+/Stable), will be repaid mostly with debt funding in 2016-2017. At the same time, Beijing MTR has started its Line 16 subway investment. Fitch expects Beijing MTR's leverage to rise due to its large capex, but to remain manageable, with EBITDA interest coverage of above 3x. Leverage at BCG's Tianjin Beijing Expressway Co., Ltd remains high, with an FFO-adjusted net leverage above 12x at end-2015. This has dragged down the infrastructure segment's overall credit profile. BCG is considering restructuring the segment's assets as part of its ongoing deleveraging initiative. Fitch assesses the infrastructure segment's credit profile in line with a low 'BBB' category. Moderate Government Support: BCG's ratings continue to benefit from a two-notch uplift due to its moderately strong linkage with the Beijing municipal government. BCG acts as an aggregator of private capital to be channelled towards investment in public goods, such as subways, environmental facilities and primary land development in the greater Beijing region, as well as financial services - such as government-guaranteed loans for Beijing's SME and agriculture businesses. DERIVATION SUMMARY BCG's standalone credit profile assessment at 'BB+'/Negative is based on the weighted-average credit profile of BCG's three core business segments: property, infrastructure and environment protection. The standalone rating encompasses a high 'BB' category consolidated property segment (including Daxing and Tianjin land directly held by BCG, as well as BCL), a low 'BBB' category infrastructure segment, and a high 'B' category environment-protection segment. BCG's final rating pf 'BBB'/Negative includes a two-notch uplift based on a bottom-up approach in accordance with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Linkage criteria; reflecting its moderately strong operational and strategic linkage with the Beijing municipal government. The government linkage is comparable with Beijing Capital Development Holding (Group) Co., Ltd. (BBB-/Stable) which also received a two-notch uplift, but is less than the three notches applied to Beijing Automotive Group Co Ltd (BAIC Group, BBB+/Stable) - because the auto industry is a pillar industry and BAIC Group is Beijing's largest tax-payer and employs over 100,000 people, the majority being local residents. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - the same assumptions as for BCL's rating case - Beijing MTR's revenue to increase by 40% in 2016; Line 14's CNY13 billion capex to be paid off mostly by debt in 2017 - BCC's revenue to drop by 10% in 2016. Capex sustained above CNY6 billion in 2017-2018 RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - holdco's land failing to generate sustainable cash inflow, so that BCG's ratio of dividend and interest income to interest expense remains below 1.2x (2015: 0.4x) - further deterioration of the credit profiles of BCG's three core subsidiaries Positive: The Negative Outlook on BCG's IDR may be revised to Stable if the above factors do not materialise within 12 months. LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: Fitch expects BCG to have sufficient liquidity to service its interest expenses at the holdco level, given CNY57 billion in undrawn committed bank facilities as of end-March 2017. The dividends continue to be lower than the interest expenses at the holdco level, although BCG has bank facilities and lending to subsidiaries that it can call back to meet its liquidity needs. The major use of funds other than for debt servicing would apply in the event of acquisitions. Such acquisitions are usually discussed at length with the banks and Beijing SASAC to ensure funding is in place before the whole acquisition goes ahead.

KEY RATING DRIVERS Established, Diversified Homebuilder: Longfor has built a defensive business covering over 20 Tier 1 and 2 cities in China. In 2016, around 31% of its 41.5 million square metres (sq m) of land bank was in western China, where Longfor is a leading player, with a strong brand name in key cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu. Longfor's expansion outside western China has reduced contracted sales from the region to 22% of total sales in 2016 from 41% in 2013. Early Mover in Land Replenishment: Longfor added land in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Suzhou in 2015, before prices ran up in 2016. This head start in land replenishment is likely to support contracted sales growth for the next two years and improve its profitability. These cities, which accounted for 49% of the gross floor area (GFA) Longfor acquired in 2015, made up over 45% of its 2016 contracted sales and over 25% of its GFA sold. In addition, Longfor replenished land in Beijing and Hangzhou in 1H16, but not in Shanghai, Nanjing or Suzhou, as land prices in these cities had risen rapidly. Longfor is focused on acquiring land in cities with lagging growth, such as Jinan and Qingdao, which accounted for around 40% of Longfor's total GFA acquired in 2016. Quality IP Portfolio: Fitch expects Longfor to continue to expand its IP portfolio in 2017-2019. Longfor's urban retail malls in prime locations in Chongqing, Chengdu, Beijing and Hangzhou made up over 80% of its IP portfolio, with the rest made up of community malls that are part of its large residential projects. Fitch estimates the GFA of Longfor's retail malls increased by CAGR of 34.7% to 1.9 million sq m over 2011-2016, and we expect this to increase to 2.5 million-2.7 million sq m by 2017-2018. Its IP revenue increased to CNY1.9 billion in 2016 from only CNY0.4 billion in 2011. Longfor has maintained a high occupancy rate of over 95% for past four years in spite of the expansion, and we forecast the occupancy rate at 93% over 2017-2019. Positive Operating Cash Flow: Fitch expects Longfor to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations (CFO) in 2017 and 2018, extending a trend that started in 2012. The continued positive CFO will support the gradual expansion of its homebuilding and IP businesses. Longfor typically adds two to three new malls a year for its IP business, which was the key contributor of its negative free cash flow. Fitch estimates that Longfor maintained neutral operating cash flow for its homebuilding business segment between 2012 and 2016, even though it more than doubled its contracted sales. Healthy Financials: We expect Longfor's business profile to continue strengthening. Contracted sales in January-May 2017 was CNY76 billion, which was 79% of Fitch's full-year forecast of around CNY96 billion, and compared with CNY88 billion in 2016 and CNY54 billion in 2015. Fitch forecasts Longfor's recurring rental revenue to rise by 20% to around CNY2.3 billion in 2017. Fitch expects Longfor's leverage, as measured by net debt to adjusted inventory (including IP valued at higher of cost or 5% yield), of 31% in 2016 to be little changed for the next 12-18 months, while its total contracted sales to total debt should improve from 1.5x in 2016. Access to Low-Cost Funding: Longfor has access to diversified funding sources and strong access to both domestic and offshore bond markets and banks. Its average cost of borrowing fell to 4.9% in 2016 from 6.7% in 2012 after the company refinanced its offshore debt, which also extended the offshore debt's average maturity. Fitch expects Longfor's interest costs to remain low, with management's focus on maintaining ample liquidity and ready access to various funding channels helping to support its ratings. Constrained by IP Expansion: Longfor's rental revenue of CNY1.9 billion for 2016 was still insufficient to cover its cash investments in this segment of CNY3 billion-5 billion. This was, however, an improvement from 2014, when its rental income was CNY876 million and its cash investments in IP was CNY3.8 billion. The scale of its IP business is still small and accounted for less than 15% of its total EBITDA, leaving the company reliant on its homebuilding operation to support its IP expansion and resulting in persistent negative free cash flow for this segment. DERIVATION SUMMARY Longfor has had stable and healthy positive cash flow from operations (CFO) since 2012. The continued positive CFO will support the gradual expansion of its homebuilding and IP businesses. It is well-positioned among its peers. Its 2016 contracted sales of CNY88 billion is comparable with peers rated 'BBB-' to 'BB+', and its EBITDA margin of 22% in 2015-2016 is comparable with 'BBB' to 'BBB+' rated peers, such as China Resources Land Ltd (BBB+/Stable) and China Vanke Co., Ltd (BBB+/Stable). Longfor's leverage of around 30%-32% is comparable with that of Shimao Property Holding Limited (BBB-/Stable). No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect Longfor' s rating. Operating environment risks make it difficult for companies in this sector to be rated above 'BBB+'. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: -Investment property income reaches CNY2.5 billion-3.0 billion in 2017-2018 -Contracted sales by GFA to decrease by 0%-6% over 2017-2019 -Average selling price for contracted sales to increase by 2% for 2017-2019 -EBITDA margin of around 22%-23% in 2017-2019 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that may individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Net debt/adjusted inventory (investment property valued at higher of cost or 5% yield) sustained above 40% - Contracted sales/total debt sustained below 1.0x - EBITDA margin sustained below 22% - Sustained weakening of cash flow from operations Developments that may individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: -Net debt/adjusted inventory (investment property valued at higher of cost or 5% yield) sustained below 30% -The company's investment property operation stabilises at a larger scale and generates substantially higher recurring income. LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: Longfor had CNY17 billion of cash, of which CNY0.1 billion was restricted, at end-2016. The company has made opportunistic early repayment for most of its US dollar debt financing in the past. Fitch expects the group to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund development costs, land premium payments and debt obligations during 2016-2018 due to its diversified funding channels and flexible land acquisition strategy.

The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was flat at 96.275, having slid from a one-week high of 96.512 touched on Wednesday. The greenback had rallied earlier in the week after upbeat U.S. economic indicators lifted Treasury yields to multi-week highs. The surge helped the dollar index come off a nine-month low of 95.470 reached last week as investors increased expectations for central banks in Europe to begin scaling back monetary stimulus later this year. But the dollar's advance stalled after the Fed's minutes on its June 13-14 policy meeting released on Wednesday showed a rift among policymakers over the pace of future U.S. rate increases and disappointed some dollar bulls.  Overall, the Fed's meeting minutes sounded hawkish in my view, as the possibility was mentioned for the reduction of its balance sheet in the near-term. But the dollar still slipped, showing that it has become top-heavy,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  The market has gotten used to the dollar strengthening this week. So even if upcoming indicators like the U.S. ISM report are in line with expectations, the dollar may drop on disappointment. The currency may need a strong upside data surprise to move further up.  The dollar was little changed at 113.240 yen, pulling back from a seven-week high of 113.690 reached overnight.  The dollar is expected to move in a 110-115 yen range through to September. The bias is for a stronger dollar as the Fed appears determined to normalise monetary policy,  said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. The euro inched down 0.1 percent to $1.1338 following its decline to a one-week trough of $1.1313 on Wednesday. U.S. data on tap later in the day includes the ADP employment report, ISM non-manufacturing PMI and the initial jobless claims. Investors will also look to comments from San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell for their potential impact on U.S. yields. For the euro and European bond markets, markets await the European Central Bank's June policy meeting minutes due later on Thursday. ECB executive board member Peter Praet is also scheduled to take part in a conference in Paris. The Australian dollar was 0.1 percent lower at $0.7593 . It showed little reaction to data showing that Australia's trade surplus rebounded sharply in May. The Aussie had plumbed a nine-day low of $0.7570 overnight, dragged down by declines in prices of commodities like copper and crude oil. The overnight fall in oil also jerked the Canadian dollar away from 10-month highs. The loonie was 0.15 percent weaker at C$1.2976 per dollar. It had reached $1.2912 per dollar on Tuesday, its strongest since September 2016, after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz added more support to the view the central bank will raise interest rates as early as next week.

The firm, which spun off from Yum Brands Inc late last year, said same-store sales rose 3 percent in the second quarter of 2017, driven by a 4 percent jump at fried chicken chain KFC. Pizza Hut's same-store sales were flat. Yum, China's biggest fast food chain with over 7,685 outlets, has been looking to rev up growth in the market which has slowed since 2012, hit by food safety scares, changing consumer tastes and a wider economic slowdown. The Pizza Hut division, which has been off-setting stronger growth at KFC since before Yum China's listing, fell short of analyst estimates of a 1.5 percent same-store sales rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.

For the overall market, shares were on the defensive on continued tensions in the Korean peninsula after North Korea fired a missile into Japanese waters on Tuesday. Investors are also focused on major events this week such as U.S. jobs data and the Group of 20 nations' meeting in Germany, where U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders are expected to discuss steps to rein in North Korea's weapons programme. The Nikkei dropped 0.3 percent to 20,018.87 in midmorning trade, and the broader Topix shed 0.1 percent to 1,616.43.  Investors took profits on stocks such as financials, which gained recently on rising U.S. yields,  said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities.  They are risk averse now, and they want to secure profits before they see the outcome of G20 meeting.  Kuramochi also said demand for overbought Japanese financial companies, which invest in high-yielding products such as foreign bonds, will be determined by whether benchmark U.S. 10-year yields rise to 2.4 or 2.5 percent in the coming weeks. They are currently trading above 2.3 percent. The banking sector fell 0.5 percent, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropping 0.7 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group declining 1.0 percent. The retail sector also lost ground, falling 0.6 percent. Convenience-store operator Lawson Inc shed 3.6 percent after its operating profit dropped 6.9 percent on the year to 16.25 billion yen for the first quarter ended May. Ministop Co stumbled 3.5 percent after it posted an operating loss of 269 million yen for the first quarter ended May. Meanwhile, retail investors sought investment opportunities in shares in construction companies in the Kyushu region on post-disaster damage repair demand after the region was hit by heavy rain overnight. Parts of Fukuoka prefecture on the southwestern island of Kyushu were hit by 774 mm (30.5 inches) of rain in nine hours on Wednesday, about 2.2 times the amount of rain that falls in a normal July, NHK national television said.

Slim's lawyers argued that unfair  asymmetrical  rules prohibit America Movil from charging other telephone carriers for connecting their calls made to customers on its network, but let those companies charge America Movil for connecting its calls to their customers. The so-called  zero tariff  applied to Slim's company has undermined the power of the sector's regulator IFT as well as the rights of America Movil units Telmex and Telcel under past concessions awarded to them by the government, the statement said. The company said it has been harmed by the elimination of its rights to  cost recovery, economic stability and financial balance  granted by the concessions.  Asymmetrical (rules) does not mean free,  the company said in the statement. America Movil holds over two-thirds of Mexico's mobile subscriptions. The landmark telecommunications reform was a major political victory for President Enrique Pena Nieto, and from the beginning was designed to rein in America Movil and help smaller players in the market. The Supreme Court has not said when it might rule on the case. Reporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Edwina Gibbs","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-america-movil-idUSL1N1JX023"},

The Mets lost the first two games of the series Monday and Tuesday, respectively, and then were rained out Wednesday night in the series finale. There was no word of a makeup date. That means New York will most likely have to wait until Aug. 25, when they return to Washington, for a chance to gain ground head-to-head against the Nationals. And by then, the Mets could have been sellers before the trade deadline at the end of this month. Right-hander Jake deGrom (8-3, 3.55 ERA), who was slated to start Wednesday at Washington, will pitch Friday in St. Louis against the Cardinals, according to Mets spokesman Ethan Wilson. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at NationalsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchA Stetson product, deGrom left the Mets clubhouse soon after the game was called after a delay of about two hours Wednesday. Right-hander Zack Wheeler was originally slated to start Friday in St. Louis for the Mets, who are off Thursday. The Mets did not announce a rotation after Friday. The Nationals will begin a series at home Thursday with the Atlanta Braves and lefty Gio Gonzalez (7-3, 2.77 ERA), as scheduled, will be the starter. Max Scherzer is slated to start Friday and Stephen Strasburg will go Saturday. Washington has not announced a starter for Sunday but it could be Tanner Roark (6-6, 5.27), who was slated to pitch against the Mets on Wednesday. The Mets were short-handed in the series in Washington as outfielder Curtis Granderson (hip) was limited to pinch-hit appearances in both games. The veteran, hitting .236 with 13 homers, clubbed a two-run homer in the ninth to tie the game Monday but the Mets lost 3-2 in the last of the ninth. The same night, left fielder Yoenis Cespedes (.281, nine hime runs) got a leg cramp when he tried to make a shoestring catch on the game-winning hit in the last of the ninth by Ryan Raburn. All-Star Michael Conforto (.285, 14 homers), another Mets outfielder, will report to Port St. Lucie, Fla., on Thursday, according to Wilson. There is a chance he could begin a rehab assignment with the minor league team there, which is also the spring training home of the Mets.  He will see how he feels,  Wilson said. Conforto went on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 28, with a bruised left hand. Neither manager or any players were available to the media after the game was rained out Wednesday. The Nationals (50-34) won the two games of the series by a combined score of 14-6 over the Mets (38-45), who are 3-9 against Washington this year. NOTES: Washington will face Atlanta RHP Mike Foltynewicz (6-5, 3.83 ERA) at Nationals Park on Thursday, though rain is in the forecast for most of the day. ... The Mets will face Cardinals RHP Carlos Martinez (6-7, 3.15 ERA) on Friday in St. Louis. ... Washington RF Bryce Harper was not in the starting lineup before the rainout as manager Dusty Baker tries to rest his regulars. ... Washington 2B Daniel Murphy has the highest batting average of any active player with at least 100 at-bats against his former team. Murphy is hitting .405 in 121 at-bats against the Mets since the start of the 2016 season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mets-nationals-writethru-idUSMTZED76NCTB1Q"},

The fiscal 2018 budget plan, which has drawn both Democratic and Republican support in the legislature, does not guarantee funding for public schools to open on time next month. The plan identifies only enough funding to pay down roughly a third of the state's record $15 billion unpaid bill backlog.  In addition, no substantial progress was made to reduce Illinois’ paralyzing $130 billion unfunded pension liability.  The state's pension contribution is set to consume more than $7.8 billion of the state's $36 billion budget in the fiscal year that began July 1. Illinois on Thursday could end its dubious status as the only state to ever go multiple years without a full operating budget if the Democratic-led legislative chamber overturns the vetoes from Republican Governor Bruce Rauner. One of the bills increases the state's personal income tax from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and corporate income tax from 5.25 percent to 7 percent.  Moody’s Investors Service issued a warning on Wednesday that even if the House follows identical Senate action Monday and  overrides Rauner’s vetoes, the nation’s fifth-largest state risks a credit rating downgrade to junk because of unaddressed fiscal woes. Moody's said the budget plan falls short of adequately addressing pensions and the backlog of unpaid bills.  It's not clear to me that they won't quickly find themselves with a comparable backlog and more long-term bonded debt,  said Moody's analyst Ted Hampton. Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based government finance watchdog, said the bill does not provide stability. “What rating agencies are pointing to, even with the tax increase if the General Assembly overrides the governor and with the spending plan as approved, the state still has severe financial challenges going forward,” he said.  Drafters of the budget package inserted language that ties release of billions of dollars for K-12 education to enactment of a school-funding overhaul that Rauner has called a “bailout” for Chicago’s cash-strapped school system. The House and Senate have passed the funding revamp, but Rauner has threatened to veto it. If Republicans and Democrats do not reconcile their differences before the first state payment goes to schools in August, about a dozen financially struggling public school systems might not open for classes next month, said Roger Eddy, executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards. “We’re talking about children that are going to be affected by this stalemate at this point. That is absolutely not an exaggeration. This is real, and it’s going to happen,” Eddy told Reuters. The budget impasse also resulted in a halt of construction projects and Illinois suspended sales of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets. In another key area--the state's $14.7 billion backlog of unpaid bills--the plan authorizes only $6 billion of general obligation bonds, as well as $1.5 billion in borrowings and transfers from other state funds for that purpose. Sufficient money exists only to support $3 billion of $6 billion in authorized bonding, which in turn would generate $2 billion in federal matching Medicaid dollars for unpaid bills. The budget also purports to save $500 million from pension changes, although there were slim details on how those savings would be realized. “The pension reform in (the legislation) doesn’t look like it’s really revolutionary or will move the needle in any big way,” Hampton said.

The Democratic-controlled House on Thursday will attempt to overturn Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's vetoes of spending and tax increase measures aimed at ending the state's unprecedented two-year budget impasse. Moody's said it placed Illinois' Baa3 rating, which is one step above the junk level, on review for a possible downgrade.  The $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion income tax increase passed by lawmakers over the extended Fourth of July holiday weekend, may fall short in addressing the state's financial woes, particularly its huge unfunded pension liability and $15 billion unpaid bill backlog, according to Moody's.  On both those fronts, it's not yet clear if the legislation being enacted will have a substantial and clear positive effect,  said Moody's analyst Ted Hampton. Related CoveragePossible Illinois budget fix poses big financial questionsA stalemate between the Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two-straight fiscal years. Since fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, the House and Senate in bipartisan votes passed budget bills to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Rauner vetoed the bills on Tuesday only to have that action quickly overridden by the Senate, leaving the fate of the budget in the hands of the House.  Prior to Moody's announcement, Rauner said his Democratic opponents should prioritize the opinions of Illinois residents over credit ratings agencies. “Don’t listen to some Wall Street firm,” Rauner told reporters Wednesday at a Chicago event. “That’s not what matters.” The governor also said he is working to sustain his vetoes.  I can tell you this, we are doing everything we can to push that my veto is not overridden,  he said.  He lashed out at those who defied his wishes by voting for the Democrats' budget package, including 15 House Republicans.  What we have is a continuing failure by elected officials in Springfield on both sides of the aisle that’s been led by Speaker Madigan for 35 years,” Rauner said, referring to House Speaker Michael Madigan. “The system is broken.” House Republican Leader Jim Durkin told Reuters that he and Rauner are attempting to persuade House Republicans supporters of the Democratic tax hike to reconsider their votes because “there’s a better deal to be had.” But Durkin stopped short of predicting the overrides could be blocked. “I think the Democrats, if they want to get it done, find the votes,” Durkin said. “I’ve seen this before.” Durkin said he had no plans to take punitive actions against those Republicans for their votes, but predicted “it’s definitely a possibility” some will face primary challenges from the Republican Party’s anti-tax wing in the 2018 elections. Illinois has relied on court-ordered and state-mandated spending to keep operating. The absence of a fiscal 2018 budget shuttered major transportation projects and forced the state out of the lucrative Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries.

Moody’s Investors Service issued a warning on Wednesday that even if the House follows identical Senate action Monday and overrides Rauner’s vetoes, the nation’s fifth-largest state risks a credit rating downgrade to junk because of unaddressed fiscal woes. Moody's said the budget plan falls short of adequately addressing pensions and the backlog of unpaid bills.  It's not clear to me that they won't quickly find themselves with a comparable backlog and more long-term bonded debt,  said Moody's analyst Ted Hampton. Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based government finance watchdog, said the bill does not provide stability. “What rating agencies are pointing to, even with the tax increase if the General Assembly overrides the governor and with the spending plan as approved, the state still has severe financial challenges going forward,” he said. Drafters of the budget package inserted language that ties release of billions of dollars for K-12 education to enactment of a school-funding overhaul that Rauner has called a “bailout” for Chicago’s cash-strapped school system. The House and Senate have passed the funding revamp, but Rauner has threatened to veto it. If Republicans and Democrats do not reconcile their differences before the first state payment goes to schools in August, about a dozen financially struggling public school systems might not open for classes next month, said Roger Eddy, executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards. “We’re talking about children that are going to be affected by this stalemate at this point. That is absolutely not an exaggeration. This is real, and it’s going to happen,” Eddy told Reuters. The budget impasse also resulted in a halt of construction projects and Illinois suspended sales of Powerball and Mega Millions tickets. In another key area--the state's $14.7 billion backlog of unpaid bills--the plan authorizes only $6 billion of general obligation bonds, as well as $1.5 billion in borrowings and transfers from other state funds for that purpose. Sufficient money exists only to support $3 billion of $6 billion in authorized bonding, which in turn would generate $2 billion in federal matching Medicaid dollars for unpaid bills. The budget also purports to save $500 million from pension changes, although there were slim details on how those savings would be realized. “The pension reform in (the legislation) doesn’t look like it’s really revolutionary or will move the needle in any big way,” Hampton said.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 28 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $48.07 per barrel by 0132 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.39 per barrel, up 26 cents, or 0.6 percent. Traders said the gains reflected firm fuel demand in the United States, where data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) late on Wednesday showed that U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.8 million barrels in the week to June 30 to 503.7 million. However, overall market conditions remain weak. Crude prices tumbled about 4 percent on Wednesday on rising exports by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), despite its pledge to hold back production between January this year and March 2018 to prop up prices. OPEC's oil exports rose for the second month in a row in June, according to Thomson Reuters Oil Research. OPEC exported 25.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, 450,000 bpd above May and 1.9 million bpd more than a year earlier. Energy research house and brokerage firm Sanford C. Bernstein said it was reducing its average Brent crude oil price forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to $50 per barrel each, down from $60 and $70 previously. Bernstein said that the reduction was a result of an expected increase in U.S. shale oil output, especially from the Permian field.  Permian supply pummels our near term estimates,  Bernstein said, adding that conventional supply additions would likely exceed or match production declines of mature fields. Denmark's Saxo Bank said that oil prices could rise towards $55 per barrel in the coming months, but said it expected lower prices towards the end of the year and into 2018.  The price of Brent crude oil is likely to rally back towards $55 per barrel during the coming months before renewed weakness sets in as the focus turns to 2018 and the potential risk of additional barrels hitting the market if OPEC and Russia fail to extend the production cut deal beyond Q1 2018,  Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a quarterly market outlook.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council that North Korea's actions were  quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution  and the United States was prepared to defend itself and its allies.  One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction,  Haley said. She urged China, North Korea's only major ally, to do more to rein in Pyongyang.  Speaking with his Japanese counterpart on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis underscored the  ironclad commitment  of the United States to defending Japan and providing  extended deterrence using the full range of U.S. capabilities,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement. Mattis' assurances to Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada came during a phone call to discuss the North Korean test, the statement said. Taking a major step in its missile program, North Korea on Tuesday test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea says the missile could carry a large nuclear warhead. The missile test is a direct challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile.  He has frequently urged China to press the isolated country's leadership to give up its nuclear program.         Haley said the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions on North Korea in coming days and warned that  if Russia and China did not support the move, then “we will go our own path.” Related CoverageCan U.S. defend against North Korea missiles? Not everyone agreesRussia says military force against N.Korea should be excludedU.S. diplomat heads to Asia but no talks with North Korea scheduled    She did not give details on what sanctions would be proposed, but outlined possible options.  The international community can cut off the major sources of hard currency to the North Korean regime. We can restrict the flow of oil to their military and their weapons programs. We can increase air and maritime restrictions. We can hold senior regime officials accountable,  Haley said.     Diplomats say Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbor and has resisted tougher measures, such as an oil embargo, bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers, and measures against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with the North.     “Much of the burden of enforcing U.N. sanctions rests with China,” Haley said.  The United States might seek to take unilateral action and sanction more Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, especially banks, U.S. officials have said.  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un looks on during the test-launch of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 5, 2017. KCNA/via REUTERSChina's U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, told the Security Council meeting that the missile launch was a  flagrant violation  of U.N. resolutions and  unacceptable.   We call on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions and belligerent rhetoric, demonstrate the will for unconditional dialogue and work actively together to defuse the tension,  Liu said. Tensions With u.s. The United States has remained technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty and the past six decades have been punctuated by periodic rises in antagonism and rhetoric that have always stopped short of a resumption of active hostilities. Tensions have risen sharply after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests                 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the ICBM test completed his country's strategic weapons capability that includes atomic and hydrogen bombs, the state KCNA news agency said. Slideshow (18 Images)Pyongyang will not negotiate with the United States to give up those weapons until Washington abandons its hostile policy against the North, KCNA quoted Kim as saying.  He, with a broad smile on his face, told officials, scientists and technicians that the U.S. would be displeased ... as it was given a 'package of gifts' on its 'Independence Day,'  KCNA said, referring to the missile launch on July 4.  Trump and other leaders from the Group of 20 nations meeting in Germany this week are due to discuss steps to rein in North Korea's weapons program, which it has pursued in defiance of Security Council sanctions. Russia's deputy U.N. envoy said on Wednesday that military force should not be considered against North Korea and called for a halt to the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea. He also said that attempts to strangle North Korea economically were  unacceptable  and that sanctions would not resolve the issue. The U.S. military assured Americans that it was capable of defending the United States against a North Korean ICBM.         Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis noted a successful test last month in which a U.S.-based missile interceptor knocked down a simulated incoming North Korean ICBM.  So we do have confidence in our ability to defend against the limited threat, the nascent threat that is there,  he told reporters. He acknowledged though that previous U.S. missile defense tests had shown  mixed results.          The North Korean launch this week was both earlier and  far more successful than expected,  said U.S.-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North. It would now probably only be a year or two before a North Korean ICBM achieved  minimal operational capability,  he added. Schilling said the U.S. national missile defense system was  only minimally operational  and would take more than two years to upgrade to provide more reliable defense.

The decision was criticized by the Obama administration which said the European Union was helping itself to cash that should have ended up in the United States.

The agreement, signed during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Germany, is for 100 A320 family aircraft and 40 A350 planes, Airbus said.  It's one of the biggest deals that we've signed in a long time,  Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders told journalists after signing the deal in Berlin. The planes will be purchased by state-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, which will then allocate them to Chinese airlines. The A320 planes will be a mixture of the older CEO and the new NEO version with revamped engines, while the majority of the A350 orders are for the -900 model. The deal is flexible pending negotiations with the airlines. Enders said he expected up to 50 percent of the A320 family planes would come from the Airbus final assembly line in China.  The logo of Airbus Group is seen on the company's headquarters building in Toulouse, Southwestern France, April 18, 2017.Regis DuvignauEnders was making his first public appearance since Airbus rolled out a new structure, completing a recent merger between its parent company and its dominant planemaking arm, changes which included a shift in the reporting line for its commercial sales team to Enders. Enders said the shift in reporting lines for the sales team reflected the fact that commercial aircraft head Fabrice Bregier had been given more tasks in his new role as group-wide chief operating officer.      With orders slowing and the focus shifting to the backlog, Enders said the shake-up allows Bregier to concentrate on deliveries.  This is merely a burden sharing mechanism because the focus should be on execution and this is what it's all about,  Enders said.     We have plenty of challenges on the execution side, be it the transition to the NEO, the ramp-up of the A320 family, the 350 family, not to mention the A400M, which is not entirely solved,  he said.  Enders also said the group was in talks with the Chinese over the A380 superjumbo, which has suffered slow sales.  It won't happen overnight. It has to be intensively discussed,  he said.

Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus retorted that his country was not declaring war but that its forces would respond to any hostile move by the YPG, which he described as a small-scale army formed by the United States. The mounting tensions between two U.S. allies in northwestern Syria risk opening yet another front in the multi-sided conflict, in which outside powers are playing ever greater roles. They could also distract the YPG from the U.S.-backed campaign it is spearheading to capture Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa, some 200 km (125 miles) away. Asked by Reuters whether he expected a conflict with Turkey in northern Syria, where the two sides have exchanged artillery fire in recent days, YPG Commander Sipan Hemo accused Turkey of preparing for a major military campaign in the Aleppo and Afrin area.  These (Turkish) preparations have reached level of a declaration of war and could lead to the outbreak of actual clashes in the coming days,  he said in emailed comments.  We will not stand idly by against this potential aggression.  Turkey's policy in northern Syria has been focused on containing the growing sway of Kurdish groups that have established autonomous regions since Syria's war began in 2011. Ankara says the YPG represents a security threat, seeing it as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been fighting an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades.  This is not a declaration of war. We are making preparations against potential threats,  Kurtulmus told Reuters in an interview.  Their (YPG) primary goal is a threat to Turkey, and if Turkey sees a YPG movement in northern Syria that is a threat to it, it will retaliate in kind.   President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was ready to carry out ground operations against Kurdish forces in northern Syria along with the rebel forces it backs there if necessary.  If there is a threat against us, our troops will conduct any operations with the Free Syrian Army (FSA) on the ground,  he told France 24 television in an interview shown later on Wednesday. Turkish forces deployed in northern Syria last year in support of FSA groups in an operation that forced Islamic State away from the border and also drove a wedge between YPG-held areas. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus attends an interview with Reuters in Ankara, Turkey, July 5, 2017.Umit BektasIn recent weeks, Turkey has sent reinforcements into the area north of Aleppo, according to Turkey-backed rebel groups who have established control over a section of the Turkish-Syrian frontier with Ankara's support. Hemo was last week cited as saying the YPG had a plan to capture that area between the towns of Azaz and Jarablus. Asked about that remark, he described the Turkish intervention as  occupation  of Syrian land, and said the YPG had never  threatened Turkey or its security . Long-Term Plans Turkey, a NATO member, has been incensed by the U.S. decision to ally with the YPG. Washington took the decision to arm the group before the final assault on Raqqa began in June. Slideshow (4 Images)The YPG is fighting under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes Arab fighters. In separate comments to the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper published on Wednesday, Hemo said the United States had established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria controlled by the YPG or SDF, including a major airbase near Kobani, a town at the border with Turkey. Citing operational security, the coalition said it did not confirm or deny information about  specific capabilities, force numbers, locations or movement of forces in Iraq and Syria . Hemo indicated the YPG would keep fighting Islamic State even after its defeat in Raqqa, saying it was committed with  the international coalition to cleansing Syria of terrorism and establishing a political system capable of achieving real democratic transformation . Turkish defense ministry sources said last month the United States had pledged that weapons provided to the YPG would be taken back once Islamic State was defeated. Turkey says that is not credible.   There has never been an incident where a group in the Middle East has been armed, and they returned the weapons,  Kurtulmus said. The United States  have formed more than a terrorist organization there, they formed a small-scale army.  He also warned the YPG not to try to drive out Arab or Turkmen residents from the town of Tel Rifaat, which is close to Afrin and controlled by YPG and Arab allies in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has left open the possibility of longer-term assistance to the YPG, saying the U.S. may need to supply them with weapons and equipment even after the capture of Raqqa. Hemo said U.S. officials had denied any intention to take away the YPG's weapons and that the YPG would be needing more support due to its longer-term plans to tackle the remnants of Islamic State.

The issuance consists of notes ultimately backed by New Zealand finance and operating vehicle leases originated by Fleet Holding (NZ) Limited (FleetPartners NZ), a subsidiary of FleetPartners Pty Limited (FleetPartners) and a part of Eclipx Group Limited (ECX:ASX), an ASX-listed entity. The ratings are as follows: NZD146.3 million Class A notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable NZD11.4 million Class B notes: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable NZD19.5 million Class C notes: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable NZD13.5 million Class D notes: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable NZD15.7 million Class E notes: 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable NZD4.5 million Class F notes: 'B+sf'; Outlook Stable NZD2.2 million Class G notes: 'NRsf' NZD11.2 million Originator notes: 'NRsf' The notes were issued by NZGT (FP) Trustee Limited in its capacity as trustee of FP Ignition 2017 - B Trust. The total underlying collateral pool consisted of 7,802 leases totalling NZD220.1 million at the 30 June 2017 cut-off date. The portfolio consists of operating and finances leases to obligors across a wide range of industries, with the largest industry exposure being manufacturing (23.2%) and wholesale trade (10.6%). The concentration of vehicle manufacturer in the portfolio is dominated by Ford Motor Company (27.2%), General Motors Holden (14.8%) and Toyota Motor Corporation (10.7%), with the remainder including several established Japanese and European car manufacturers. KEY RATING DRIVERS Residual Value Risk Present: This is the third term securitisation, and the first in New Zealand, by FleetPartners that includes operating leases within the lease portfolio. The lessees are a broad mix of small-to-medium entities (SMEs) through to large corporations and government entities. Residual value (RV) and vehicle-servicing risk are present within the transaction due to the inclusion of operating leases, along with credit risk. Fitch assumes 'AAAsf' RV losses of 15.6%. Large Lessee Concentration: The pool's 20-largest obligors account for about 26.6% of the asset balance. Fitch deems this concentration higher than usually observed in consumer ABS transactions and has therefore derived default assumptions while considering lessee concentrations and correlation risks, in line with its SME criteria. Sufficient Enhancement: The transaction incorporates a sequential pay/pro rata pay structure, consistent with other ABS transactions. Pro rata paydown will commence when hard credit enhancement (CE) reaches 45.0% for the class A notes, subject to transaction performance. Overall CE is sufficient to cover the Fitch-stressed cumulative net loss assumptions in all Fitch scenarios. The transaction also comprises a vehicle-servicing account to enable the issuer to fund operating lease vehicle-servicing obligations. Mixed Collateral Included: The collateral backing the transaction comprises of lease receivables backed by a mix of passenger vehicles as well as light and heavy commercial vehicles, with a weighted-average seasoning of 18.1 months and an average receivable size of NZD28,205. Operating leases comprise 94% of the portfolio and finance leases 6%. Historically, FleetPartners' 30+ day delinquencies for their New Zealand and Australian assets have generally tracked below Fitch's Dinkum ABS Index. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unexpected decreases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case, possibly resulting in negative rating action on the notes. Fitch has evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased defaults and reduced recovery rates over the life of the transaction. Expected impact on note ratings from increased defaults: Final rating AAAsf/AAsf/Asf/BBBsf/BBsf/B+sf Increase defaults by 10%: AAAsf/AA-sf/BBB+sf/BBB-sf/BB-sf/B+sf Increase defaults by 25%: AA+sf/A+sf/BBB+sf/BBB-sf/BB-sf/B+sf Increase defaults by 50%: AA-sf/BBBsf/BBBsf/BB+sf/B+sf/Bsf Expected impact on note ratings from decreased recovery rates and RV sale proceeds: Final rating AAAsf/AAsf/Asf/BBBsf/BBsf/B+sf Reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 10%: AAAsf/AAsf/A-sf/BBB-sf/BB-sf/B+sf Reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 25%: AAAsf/AAsf/A-sf/BBB-sf/BB-sf/B+sf Reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 50%: AA+sf/A+sf/BBB+sf/BB+sf/B+sf/Bsf Expected impact on note ratings from multiple factors: Final rating AAAsf/AAsf/Asf/BBBsf/BBsf/B+sf Increase defaults by 10%; reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 10%: AAAsf/AA-sf/A-sf/BBB-sf/BB-sf/B+sf Increase defaults by 25%; reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 25%: AAsf/A+sf/A-sf/BB+sf/B+sf/B+sf Increase defaults by 50%; reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 50%: A+sf/BBB+sf/BBB-sf/BBsf/Bsf/CCCsf USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es;) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under  Related Research  below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es; to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled  Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,  dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of FleetPartners' origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the portfolio information, but none was available for this transaction. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable.

Russia and Iran, which back President Bashar al-Assad's government, and Turkey, which supports some of the rebels, aim to reach a consensus on the zones by the end of August, when their delegations are set to meet again in the Kazakh capital. The failure is a setback for Moscow, the main architect of the plan, as it seeks to take the lead in global efforts to settle the Syrian civil war.  During these consultations, the Turkish side said it needed more time in order ... to make an appropriate decision,  said senior Russian negotiator Alexander Lavrentyev. Bashar al-Ja'afari, the lead negotiator from the Damascus government, was more direct. Related CoverageSyrian government says Turkey blocked new Astana agreement The Turkish delegation objected to the adoption of any documents related to the implementation of mechanisms of the agreement on the de-escalation zones,  he said. Russia, Turkey and Iran have set up a working group to reconcile their positions before the next Astana meeting set for the final week of August. Lavrentyev said details related to the southern de-escalation zone needed to be agreed with the United States and Jordan, which support the rebels based there.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised the possibility on Wednesday of several joint steps with Moscow to promote stability in Syria and urged all parties fighting Islamic State militants in the country to avoid conflict with one another. Slideshow (2 Images) The United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on the ground ceasefire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance,  Tillerson said in a statement issued by the State Department.  If our two countries work together to establish stability on the ground, it will lay a foundation for progress on the settlement of Syria's political future,  he said in the statement, which did not directly address the Astana talks. The Kazakh talks, which began in January, come at a time when Turkey and Russia each want to disentangle themselves from the fighting. That has led them into an ad hoc alliance, although they still trade barbs. Since the May agreement was announced, the rebel-held stronghold of Idlib province in the northwest of Syria has been mostly calm. But fighting has continued on other frontlines in western Syria, including Eastern Ghouta of Damascus and the southwestern city of Deraa, where government forces and their allies are trying to crush remaining pockets of rebellion. If the agreement on de-escalation zones is finalised, Russia, Iran and Turkey will be able to quickly - within weeks - deploy forces such as military police on the borders of those zones, Lavrentyev has said.

Qatar earlier in the day accused Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt of  clear aggression  and said the accusations cited when they severed ties a month ago  were clearly designed to create anti-Qatar sentiment in the West . The four Arab nations accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and allying with regional foe Iran, which Doha denies. Their foreign ministers met in Cairo on Wednesday after a deadline they gave Qatar to meet 13 demands expired. They had been expected to consider further sanctions at the gathering, but announced no new measures.  The response the four states got was overall negative and lacked any content. We find it did not provide a basis for Qatar to retreat from its policies,  Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said, reading out a joint statement after the meeting.  The political and economic boycott will continue until Qatar changes its policies for the better,  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference. Qatar's response to the demands has not been made public.  The United Arab Emirates' minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said in a tweet that Qatar faced  greater isolation, incremental measures and reputational damage  if it did not heed the demands.  For any real discussion with Doha to gain traction, it has to be responsible for past actions and recognize the necessity of changing course. The message from Cairo is zero tolerance for terrorism, (a) powerful message from Arab world to international community. Qatar can't miss the bus,  Gargash said. Shoukry later told an Egyptian privately-owned broadcaster that the demands were non-negotiable.  The matter from the beginning was not up for negotiations ... there is no middle ground,  he told the On television channel. The foreign ministers said they would meet again soon in the  Bahraini capital, Manama, but gave no date. Intelligence chiefs from the four countries also met in Cairo on Tuesday night, officials said.

The Arab countries have demanded Qatar curtail its support for the Muslim Brotherhood, shut down the pan-Arab al Jazeera  satellite TV channel, close a Turkish military base and downgrade its relations with rival Iran. Turkey, the biggest regional power to stand by Qatar, has sent to Doha 100 cargo planes with supplies since its neighbors cut air and sea links. It has also rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Doha.  Two contingents of Turkish troops with columns of armored vehicles have arrived since the crisis erupted on June 5. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday dismissed calls for closure of the base and said the list of Arab demands amounted to an unlawful intervention against Qatari sovereignty. Saudi Arabia's Jubeir said he hoped Turkey would stay neutral and Egypt's Shoukry rejected any non-Arab interference. Qatar along with Turkey backed a Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt before it was overthrown in 2013. The Arab states have demanded Qatar sever any links to the Brotherhood and other groups they deem to be terrorist, ideological or sectarian. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and Bahraini Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa attend a press conference after their meeting that discussed the diplomatic situation with Qatar, in Cairo, Egypt July 5, 2017.Khaled Elfiqi/PoolEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump by telephone about Qatar, Sisi's office said on Wednesday.  The visions of the two presidents on dealing with current regional crises were in line, especially when it comes to reaching political settlements which contribute to regional security and stability,  Sisi's office said in a statement. Trump has voiced concern to both sides. Qatar, a small peninsular country protruding into the Gulf, hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the region as a bulwark against Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday, a State Department official said. Shoukry said Trump's call had not affected the statement coming from the foreign ministers. The Qatari foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, told a session of London's Chatham House think-tank that Doha was continuing to call for dialogue to settle the dispute. He said that this was  despite the separation of 12,000 families, despite the siege that is a clear aggression and an insult to all international treaties, bodies and jurisdictions.  Slideshow (17 Images)Qatar Girds for Long Stalemate He suggested Qatar, the world's biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and second largest gas exporter after Russia, was preparing for a more protracted rift.  What we've done in the last few weeks is develop different alternative for ways to ensure the supply chain for the country not to be cut off.  Qatar announced on Tuesday that it planned to raise LNG production capacity by 30 percent in the next five years.  Company and industry sources told Reuters that the West's three biggest energy firms are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas output, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in the dispute. Qatar has invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Western countries and works closely with the United States and other allies on Syria's civil war.  Reading between the lines, the blockading countries (are) demanding that we have to surrender our sovereignty to end the siege, something which ... Qatar will never do,  Sheikh Mohammed said. Responding to the accusation that it has drawn too close to Iran, he said Doha had to live alongside Tehran since the two states shared an offshore gas field. Gulf newspapers close to their governments appeared also to see little prospect of any immediate deal. The editor of the Abu Dhabi government-linked al-Ittihad newspaper wrote that Qatar, with a population of two million compared to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, was  walking alone in its dreams and illusions, far away from its Gulf Arab brothers . Qatari officials say the Gulf states' demands are so stiff they suspect they were never seriously meant for negotiation. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, on a tour of Gulf countries, said he was cautiously optimistic the feuding states would reach a solution once they had talks.

Gray (4-4) allowed two runs on three hits over six innings, struck out five and walked two in his third straight quality start, a 7-4 victory over the White Sox at the Oakland Coliseum.  I didn't feel great, but you're not going to feel great all the time,  Gray said.  It's just something you're going to have to get through.  Gray started the season on the disabled list with a strained right shoulder and didn't make his first start until May 2. It took him some time to get untracked, but in his past three starts he has allowed four earned runs over 21 innings with 15 strikeouts and four walks.  I think I just got into a little bit of a groove, a little bit of a rhythm,  Gray said.  Throwing a lot of fastballs that kind of move both ways. A lot of ground balls, and that's when I'm at my best. I'm not necessarily going to strike a lot of people out, but I'm going to get a lot of groundballs. I've been getting that a lot lately.  Oakland took two of three games from Chicago in the series and won the season series 5-1. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at AthleticsChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchGray received plenty of support from Oakland's hitters. Rookie Jaycob Brugman went 2-for-3 with his second career home run and also walked. Jed Lowrie had three hits, drove in two runs and scored once for the A's. Rajai Davis stole four bases, matching his career high, and had two hits and a run. Matt Davidson and Todd Frazier each hit a two-run homer for the White Sox. White Sox right-hander Mike Pelfrey (3-7) allowed four runs on five hits and lasted only 3 1/3 innings as his pitch count soared to 99. Pelfrey struck out five and walked three. He fell to 0-6 in six career starts against Oakland, two of those losses coming this season.  These guys kept fouling balls off and fouling balls off,  Pelfrey said.  I had a lot of pretty long at-bats and that's how you throw (99) pitches in 3 1/3. I obviously killed the bullpen and you know these guys played good defense behind me. We obviously didn't give up, we kept fighting and I didn't do my part especially going up against somebody like Sonny Gray on the other side.  The A's grabbed a 1-0 lead in the first. Matt Joyce hit a leadoff double, moved to third on Lowrie's single and scored when Khris Davis grounded into a double play. Oakland extended its lead to 3-0 in the third. Lowrie grounded a leadoff single to right, Yonder Alonso walked with one out and Bruce Maxwell hit a two-run, opposite-field double to left. Brugman made it 4-0 with a home run to right-center with one out in the fourth, ending Pelfrey's day. He sent Pelfrey's 3-2 pitch over the right-center field fence. Brugman hit his first home on June 24 on the road off White Sox right-hander James Shields.  It felt better because it was a better swing,  Brugman said of his second homer.  I hit it a little better. That's all you can ask for, hitting the ball hard and squaring it up and good things happen.  Rajai Davis worked a walk against reliever Gregory Infante, then stole second and third without a throw. Joyce walked and stole second without a throw, and Lowrie grounded a two-run single to center past a drawn in infield, increasing Oakland's lead to 6-0.  That's definitely something I'd like to do ideally every time,  Davis said of his exploits on the base paths.  Just don't get that opportunity most of the time. I just tried to take advantage.  Davidson cut the A's lead to 6-2 with a two-run blast off Gray in the fifth inning, his 18th home run of the season, after Frazier's leadoff walk. Davidson launched Gray's 2-1 fastball over the center field fence an estimated 424 feet.  Sonny's pretty tough,  Davidson said.  Everything kind of moves a little differently and has a different speed on all of them. I just tried to keep him in the zone and get a good pitch and he left one out over and I hit it.  The A's added a run in the seventh when Maxwell walked, moved to third on Brugman's single and scored on a wild pitch to make it 7-2. Frazier sent Sean Doolittle's 0-2 pitch deep into the left field seats with two outs in the ninth and Jose Abreu on base after singling. The home run was Frazier's 16th.

The rare setback for Keytruda sent Merck shares more than 1 percent lower. Merck has been on a roll with the medicine, jumping to the front of the pack of companies with new immuno-oncology drugs, particularly after Keytruda extended survival as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) had been the perceived leader in the field until last year, when its Opdivo failed to match Keytruda's lung cancer success. Merck last month said it had stopped enrolling patients in the trials testing Keytruda in combination with standard multiple myeloma regimens including Celgene Corp (CELG.O) drugs. The decision was taken after independent safety monitors observed more deaths in patients receiving the Keytruda combination than in the control groups in two of the studies. The FDA said based on available data the risks of combining Keytruda with either of the Celgene medicines outweigh any potential benefit for patients with multiple myeloma. The trials were testing Keytruda with either Revlimid or Pomalyst and dexamethasone against the regimens without Keytruda. All patients who were receiving Keytruda in combination with a Celgene drug will no longer take the Merck drug. The clinical hold does not apply to other studies with Keytruda, Merck said. The drug, which helps the immune system fight cancer by blocking a protein tumors use to avoid detection, is currently being tested in hundreds of combination trials in a wide variety of cancers. So far, Keytruda is only approved for one type of blood cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma. But Merck has had a string of successes in solid tumor cancers with approvals for advanced melanoma, advanced bladder cancer and a type of head and neck cancer, in addition to lung. In May, Keytruda became the first cancer drug to win U.S.  approval based on a patient's specific genetic traits, regardless of where in the body the disease originated, known as microsatellite instability-high cancer.

The dollar was little changed at 113.240 yen, pulling back from a seven-week high of 113.690 reached overnight. The euro inched down 0.1 percent to $1.1339 following its decline to a one-week trough of $1.1313 on Wednesday. The greenback had rallied earlier in the week after upbeat U.S. economic indicators lifted Treasury yields to multi-week highs. But its advance stalled after the Fed's minutes on its June 13-14 policy meeting released on Wednesday showed a rift among policymakers over the pace of future U.S. rate increases and disappointed some dollar bulls.  Overall, the Fed's meeting minutes sounded hawkish in my view, as the possibility was mentioned for the reduction of its balance sheet in the near-term. But the dollar still slipped, showing that it has become top-heavy,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  The market has gotten used to the dollar strengthening this week. So even if upcoming indicators like the U.S. ISM report are in line with expectations, the dollar may drop on disappointment. The currency may need a strong upside data surprise to move further up.  U.S. data on tap later in the day include the ADP employment report, ISM non-manufacturing PMI and the initial jobless claims. Investors will also look to comments from San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell for their potential impact on U.S. yields.

Kensington and Chelsea council has been criticized by victims' relatives and survivors for its handling of the disaster in Grenfell Tower on June 14 and its leader quit last week over the response to the fire.   The delivery of the initial response on the ground was simply not good enough,  housing minister Alok Sharma told parliament. He said the task force sent to help the council would focus on housing, regeneration and community engagement.  Within days of the fire, Prime Minister Theresa May promised that all residents from the tower would be offered good temporary homes in the local area within three weeks.  But that deadline passed on Wednesday and, while 139 families had been offered homes, only 14 had been accepted and just three had moved in. Many rejected the homes offered as unsuitable.  No one will be forced into a home they do not want to move to,  said Sharma. The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, Elizabeth Campbell, speaks to members of the community at a Grenfell Tower fire response team community meeting in London, Britain July 5, 2017.Hannah McKayThe main opposition Labour party accused May's Conservative government of being consistently slow to act.   It's been off the pace at each stage following this terrible tragedy,  said John Healey, Labour's housing spokesman.  The three weeks are up, yet whole families who've lost everything are still in hotels and hostels.  Slideshow (5 Images)Anger also persists over the failure to provide definitive answers about those still missing since the fire. Some local people say the scale of the death toll is deliberately being kept low.  I completely understand their desire for answers and we are committed to providing as much information we can, as soon as we can,  police commander Stuart Cundy said on Wednesday, adding that all visible human remains had been recovered.  In total we have made 87 recoveries, but I must stress that the catastrophic damage inside Grenfell Tower means that is not 87 people. Until formal identification has been completed to the coroner's satisfaction I cannot say how many people have now been recovered.  The fire has also thrown a spotlight on the safety of exterior cladding used to provide insulation and improve the external appearance of Grenfell Tower and other high-rise blocks. Since the blaze, the government said cladding tested at nearly 200 sites had failed fire tests.

Yet since Modi arrived on Tuesday, military ties -- for decades the secretive bedrock of India-Israel relations -- have taken a back seat. The governments have instead spent time discussing companies that sell medical devices, hi-tech and water systems. Rather than making the visit, the first by a sitting Indian prime minister, all about the value of deals signed, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Modi appear intent on playing up shared culture and values, in the hope this will give commercial ties deeper roots. Under Arab pressure, India kept its distance from Israel for  decades but is now seeing advantages in a complementary relationship with Israel. There is interest on both sides in building a broad economic base, rather than merely a contractual exchange based around defense. The timing reflects a diplomatic shift toward Israel being more accepted in the region. Modi, who is acutely conscious of the need to adopt innovation and new technology to update India's infrastructure has always had a personal affinity for Israel and came to learn more about the country before he became premier.  India and Israel are walking hand in hand into the future as partners,  Modi and Netanyahu wrote in a joint editorial this week.  From start-ups to space, communications to cybernetics, Israel's technological capabilities are merging with India's.  The two men are spending 48 hours together with Modi, accompanied by Indian business leaders, getting a political and business tour that covers Israeli history, culture and innovation, as well as the signing of economic agreements. Hopes for More Deals  What's it going to take to get Israeli money to take India seriously? Just open their eyes,  Jon Medved, CEO of Israeli equity crowdfunding group OurCrowd said.  The problem is their eyes are ... blinded by the China opportunity,  he added. There have only been a handful of Indian investments in Israel over the past decade, as opposed to the $16.5 billion received from China in 2016 alone. OurCrowd just closed three deals with India, joining with Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) for a hi-tech incubator that helps to grow young companies in Jerusalem, bringing Israeli technology to India with Reliance Capital (RLCP.NS), and collaborating with India's Lets Venture to invest in start-ups. During Modi's visit, Zebra Medical Vision, a company from a kibbutz near Tel Aviv, and Bangalore-based Teleradiology Solutions will sign a partnership to use analytics in 150 health-care centers. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they deliver joint statements during an exchange of co-operation agreements ceremony in Jerusalem July 5, 2017.Amir CohenLooking to reorient Israel's economy toward Asia, Netanyahu hopes more deals will follow, setting a goal of increasing exports to India by 25 percent in the next four years. But it may take a while before the Modi-Netanyahu relationship sparks a serious expansion in investment and trade, both of which remain relatively negligible. In many respects export-dependent Israel and India, which is focused on supplying its huge population, are complementary. Israel is a global leader in water and food systems, two critical fields India needs to upgrade. India wants to strengthen its manufacturing base and is looking to do so with technologies coming from Israel. Both countries host major diamond trading and polishing hubs. Diamond Trade Sparkles Slideshow (9 Images)Israeli exports to India last year totaled $1.15 billion, excluding diamonds, just 2.5 percent of total exports. Bilateral trade was less than $2 billion, which jumped to $4.13 billion including diamonds. Israel's foreign direct investment in India totals only $100 million.  It's nothing, it's a blip. Why hasn't the relationship grown to the level it should have?  said A. Didar Singh, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce. Singh said more needed to be done to ease regulations, lower non-tariff barriers and solve licensing problems. Incentives and lifting of red tape could help overcome what diplomats, lobbyists and business owners say is a cultural divide between the breakneck pace of Israel's start-up scene and India's more gradual approach. It can take time to cement negotiations in India, where building trust and a relationship is paramount, said Elias Ghosalkar, a former investment banker from Mumbai who is director of corporate development for OurCrowd after moving to Israel last year.   Israelis on the other hand are quite direct and lack patience in their business approach,  he told Reuters. Israel's ambassador to India, Daniel Carmon, said it is becoming easier to do business between the two countries, even if there may remain some differences in practice.  It could be that the Israeli businessman arrives on a Monday flight and wants to return on Thursday with a deal in hand. I say to him 'forget it'. It's not going to happen. There are processes, the processes take time, not four days,  he said. Editing by Luke Baker and Peter Millership","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-india-modi-idUSKBN19Q2B2"},

That should push Chinese steelmakers to use more of the material in coming years, potentially sapping demand for steel ingredient iron ore from the world's biggest metals consumer. Faltering appetite for iron ore could hit a critical lifeline for international mining giants which have banked on China continuing to suck up hundreds of millions of tonnes of the most widely traded bulk commodity.  In the medium to long term, scrap is the real threat to iron ore, for sure,  said Daniel Meng, an analyst at brokerage CLSA in Hong Kong.  We believe by 2020, replacement would become faster and the risk on iron ore from scrap would become more serious.  China currently only produces around 11 percent of its steel from scrap, compared to over 70 percent in the United States, suggesting it may have plenty of room to grow in recycling the material. The recent abundance of scrap in China followed Beijing's decision to shut mills churning out low-quality steel from induction furnaces - typically big users of scrap - as part of its drive against pollution and a glut in steel supply. The closure of these mills, with a combined production capacity of 120 million tonnes, helped push the nation's scrap exports to an all-time high in May. China last year generated a record 143 million tonnes of steel scrap, up nearly fourfold from 2002, data from the World Steel Association and CLSA showed. That could potentially replace around 200 million tonnes of iron ore, equivalent to about a fifth of China's imports of the commodity last year. China's steel scrap generation should rise to 200 million tonnes by 2020, the China Association of Metal Scrap Utilization said. Electrifying The bulk of China's steel is produced via blast furnaces where iron ore is melted and later mixed with steel scrap. As domestic scrap prices ST-SCCNDHV-MB tumbled 20 percent in May from this year's peak, mills increased scrap use in these furnaces to 20 percent from 8 percent, Chinese traders and mills said. But as demand picked up in June, some scrap traders say profits have doubled. And renewed interest in electric arc furnaces (EAFs), or mini-mills that use only scrap, could fire up demand for recycled steel. EAFs emit far less carbon than blast furnaces, which use coal as fuel, suiting China's anti-pollution campaign.  In the long term, I believe the authorities do support EAFs in China,  said Wang Guangrui, vice-general manager at Xuzhou Jinhong Steel Group in Jiangsu province, which restarted a 1-million-tonne EAF. The company first launched its EAF in 2011, but was forced to shut it to switch to a much cheaper induction furnace. It moved back to the EAF after the closure of all the nation's induction furnaces. Up to 20 million tonnes in EAF capacity may be installed this year, said CLSA's Meng. China's current EAF capacity is around 100 million tonnes and could grow by 10-20 million tonnes a year over the next three years, he said. Over 60 EAFs will be running in August-October and 20 more next year, said Guo Xianzhen, vice general manager at Anyang Steel Group which plans to launch a 1-million-tonne capacity EAF in September and another 1 million-tonne plant in 2018. But Australia's Fortescue Metals Group, the world's No. 4 iron ore miner, believes China's iron ore appetite won't wane any time soon, as its scrap supply - usually tied to growth in car ownership - remains low compared to the size of its population.  Currently, there are more than 700 vehicles per 1,000 people in the U.S. and Australia, with this figure at around 140 in China,  Fortescue CEO Nev Power said by email.  Given the high marginal cost of electricity, the level of scrap contribution will likely be lower overall in China than has been the case in the developed economies,  he said. Top iron ore miners Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP  declined to comment.

Temer's lawyer Antonio Mariz de Oliveira made the arguments in the written defense he delivered to a congressional committee looking into a charge the conservative leader took bribes.  The defense believes that the charge is not based on facts; that it's a piece of fiction based on hypothesis and assumptions,  Mariz told reporters after delivering the written defense to congress.   Temer has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He refuses to resign despite opposition calls to do so and polls showing his government's approval rating is in the single digits. In the defense, Temer's legal team said a March audio recording, which prosecutors said captured the president condoning payment of hush money to a potential witness, was illegal because it was secretly recorded.  Temer also argued the recording was altered and that the man who made it - billionaire Joesley Batista, whose family controls meatpacking giant JBS SA - was a criminal who had admitted to bribing hundreds of politicians in plea bargain testimony to avoid jail time. The defense said Temer's remarks in the audio were too vague to support the charge against him. Temer was charged last week in connection with a graft scheme involving JBS. Executives said the president took bribes for resolving tax matters and facilitating loans from state-run banks.  Antonio Claudio Mariz de Oliveira, Lawyer for Brazil President Michel Temer arrives at the commission of constitution and justice, for presents his defense in Lower House, in Brasilia, Brazil July 5, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoProsecutor General Rodrigo Janot alleged in the charge that Temer made deals under which JBS would have paid him 38 million reais ($11.54 million) over the next nine months. Janot's office declined to comment on Temer's written defense or comments from his attorney including the contention that the recording and plea-bargain testimony are the entirety of the case. However, the prosecution has said it has more proof it will reveal. Slideshow (3 Images)Janot has said he expects to also charge Temer with racketeering and money laundering in the coming weeks. Under Brazilian law, two-thirds of the lower house of congress must vote to allow a criminal charge against a sitting president to move to the Supreme Court. The full house is expected to vote by mid-July, although it is possible that could be delayed to early August after a congressional recess.  If the top court accepts a charge and puts the president on trial, he would be suspended for 180 days and replaced by the house speaker, Rodrigo Maia.      Investigators have uncovered corruption in the last three years that has engulfed Brazil's political class and business elites. Much of it centers on companies paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises in return for contracts.     Temer and nine ministers as well as four former presidents and dozens of lawmakers are under investigation or already charged in the schemes.  Nearly 100 people have been convicted on corruption charges  in just over three years.

Since then, he has been embroiled in a corruption scandal that has been investigated in a half-dozen countries. Yet the avuncular leader with an aristocratic pedigree was still expecting to cruise to another election victory in polls due by mid-2018, maintaining his coalition's record of unbroken rule since independence in 1957.  Now, all bets are off.  That's because his former mentor and prime minister for 22 years, Mahathir Mohamad, who turns 92 next week, has agreed to join a fractured opposition alliance and head the government again if it wins. He would be the world's oldest prime minister if that happened. Mahathir, along with Najib's former deputy, Muhyiddin Yassin - fired last year for questioning his boss about the scandal - have formed a new party called Bersatu (Unite). It has opened branches in 165 of parliament's 222 constituencies, Muhyiddin told Reuters, a feat few opposition parties have managed. During his 1981-2003 rule, Mahathir championed modernization by switching Malaysia's focus from plantations and mining to a diversified high-tech manufacturing base on the back of foreign investment. He built the world's tallest buildings at the time, the Petronas Twin Towers. A considerable fan base is excited about his comeback.  I was still young when Mahathir was prime minister. And I thought anything was possible ... maybe cars could fly,  said Nazariah Harun, a former government party supporter in the southern state of Johor, bordering Singapore. Mahathir also dealt ruthlessly with opponents, jailing his former deputy - and now alliance partner - Anwar Ibrahim on corruption and sodomy charges in the late 1990s.  The opposition alliance hopes to capitalize on a couple of scandals that are resonating in rural Malaysia. One is around the state's 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) strategic development fund that Najib, 63, founded after taking power in 2009. Its murky transactions through overseas front companies and Middle Eastern partners, many of them exposed by foreign media reports, have bewildered the public over the past two years. Najib insisted he did nothing wrong when it leaked to the media that $700 million wound up in his bank account before the 2013 election. The other scandal, involving state plantation company FELDA, is more problematic because it directly affects tens of thousands of small landholders in the heartlands. They are a key vote bank for Najib's party, the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO). Umno Patronage The 1,600 residents of Kuala Sin, a village of farmers and rubber tappers in Mahathir's home state of Kedah, are switching from UMNO to Bersatu, says UMNO's former chief there.  I’ve held the ballot box here (for UMNO) from 1962 until 2014... but this year, God willing, UMNO will lose,  said 77-year-old Ramli Mat Akib at his weathered two-storey wooden home in Kuala Sin. The UMNO branch office opposite his home has closed. Mahthir's son Mukhriz, who leads Bersatu's campaign in Kedah, believes it is  making huge headway  in rural Malaysia.  It goes all the way down to the branches, and in Kedah very many UMNO branches have dissolved,  Mukhriz told Reuters. UMNO says that isn't true nationwide.  We have a lot of young people queuing up to sign up at our headquarters as new party members. I don't see a problem at all,  said UMNO's secretary general Tengku Adnan Mansor. Despite the scandals, Najib commands the loyalty of UMNO chieftains. Patronage has much to do with that.  An UMNO leader needs to distribute largesse to guarantee chiefs' support and they, in turn, operate an affirmative action plan for ethnic Malays first introduced in 1971. The policy gives majority Malays government contracts, cheap housing, guaranteed university admissions and preferential stock shares. Government-appointed village committees also provide cradle-to-grave assistance.  This makes the villagers closely dependent on the committee, and that makes the committee supreme and also makes UMNO supreme,  said Radzi Ayob, 54, a veteran UMNO leader in Kedah, who joined Bersatu last year. But most Malays have moved to cities and even those in the countryside are less reliant on the rural welfare model.      As it is now, UMNO still needs Malaysians but Malaysians may not need UMNO,  Radzi said. An Ipo That Flopped  No leadership surveys have been published in Malaysia recently, but sources in UMNO say an internal poll in April showed Najib winning 128 of the 222 parliamentary seats, down  from the current 131. A government source told Reuters Najib's cabinet had been preparing to call polls in September, but the timing has since become less clear in the wake of the scandals.  Now nothing is firm,  he said. Malaysia's opposition won only 40 percent of the seats in the 2013 election despite winning 51 percent of the popular vote, thanks to a  first-past-the-post  system that awards seats based on a plurality of votes. Just before the 2013 election, Najib spun off a listed company of FELDA and gave its Malay landowners and suppliers, known as settlers, the opportunity to buy preferential shares. They are less than thrilled about it today. The shares have plunged 70 percent since the $3 billion listing. The anti-corruption agency is investigating officials  at the listed company, Felda Global Ventures Holdings, with the FELDA chairman himself raising questions about what happened to the IPO proceeds.  They basically told us we will be rich,  said Md Isa Md Yassan, 59, a palm oil grower in Muhyiddin's home constituency of Pagoh.  The settlers are just dissatisfied and it's not just me feeling it... everyone feels the same way.  Curtailing Dissent Najib has kept a lid on the scandals by curbing dissent.  The main media outlets are allied to his government. Anwar, the charismatic opposition figure, is in jail on what critics say was another trumped-up sodomy conviction in 2014. Najib has revived a colonial-era subversion law allowing him to jail opponents without trial. The only conviction in the 1MDB scandal was of a legislator -- who publicized alleged wrongdoing at the fund. But Najib is riding a good economy into the election. The ringgit has been one of Asia's strongest currencies, stocks have hit a two-year high, and economic growth was 5.6 percent in the first quarter. And an opposition victory, however unlikely, would put Malaysia into uncharted waters and likely trigger fears of a short-term plunge in financial markets. Analysts, however, say Mahathir's entry into the electoral fray supporting an Anwar-led opposition alliance does represents a real threat to UMNO.      If the two leaders can revive a reversed role of their previous partnership displayed so effectively when they were in national leadership in the 1990s, the opposition could have a winning formula,  said Yang Razali Kassim, senior fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore.  Mahathir supporting Anwar, in a spirit of genuine reconciliation, will be a powerful combination.   Salbiah Kassim, a member of the UMNO women's wing in Kedah, saw parallels to Brexit and U.S. President Donald Trump's election win.  Just like overseas, things can change,  she said.  We don't know where the silent voters will go.

Brazil's Energy Ministry released the proposals as it opened a period of public consultations regarding the changes. President Michel Temer's administration is seeking to attract private investment to the sector, which has struggled financially partly because of changes made in 2012 when the former administration renewed operating licenses for hydroelectric power plants at conditions now seen as unprofitable. Among the proposals, the ministry is opening the possibility for companies owning dams that were targets of the 2012 changes to increase the price for the energy they sell. That would sharply benefit Eletrobras, or Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA, which controls most of those hydro plants. Another proposed measure boosts prospects for the privatization of some of those dams. It says the government would reduce taxes on those assets, helping elevate returns for companies that buy them. Eletrobras, which has sought to sell subsidiaries as a way to cut debt, is likely to benefit from the proposed changes. The public consultation will receive contributions until the end of August.

Just don't tell the auto guys!: Andy Home","keywords":"Canada,Democratic Republic of the Congo,United States,Vietnam,Anthony Milewski,COBALT27,IPO/AHOME (COLUMN,REPEAT),Investment Banking and Investment Services (TRBC),Precious Metals and Minerals (TRBC),Western Europe,Initial Public Offerings,Industrial Goods (TRBC),Equity Financing,Government Borrowing Requirement,Industrials (TRBC),Auto : Truck and Motorcycle Parts (TRBC),Machinery : Equipment and Components (TRBC),United Kingdom,Minor Metals / Minerals,Canada,Automobiles / Auto Parts (Legacy),Commodities Markets,Basic Materials (TRBC),Americas,Company News,Financials (TRBC),Financials (Legacy),All Precious Metals and Minerals,Corporate Events,Automobiles and Auto Parts (TRBC),Financial and Commodity Market Operators (TRBC),Electrical Components and Equipment (TRBC),Mining,Metals Markets,Banking and Investment Services (TRBC),Metals and Mining (TRBC),Europe,Mineral Resources (TRBC),Cobalt,Cyclical Consumer Goods and Services (TRBC),Regulation","sector":"Markets","content":"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Andy Home LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - Wanna buy into one of the hottest commodities in town? No, it's not lithium. That's so much last year's thing. We're talking about cobalt. And this one's really hot. On the London Metal Exchange (LME) the price for three-month cobalt has leapt from $32,750 per tonne at the start of January to a current $58,500. This stellar near 80-percent price surge mirrors what happened to lithium prices a year or so ago. The linkage is both metals' evolution from niche applications to mainstream usage in the batteries that are now powering the green technology revolution. If a minimum $58,500 bet is a bit too much for you, some bright hedge fund guys have come up with a cheaper option. For just nine Canadian dollars you can now buy a share in Cobalt 27 Capital Corp, which made its C$200 million ($150.7 million) debut on Canada's Venture Exchange last month. Cobalt 27 describes itself as a  pure-play cobalt investment vehicle , an alternative to investing in producers such as Glencore, for whom cobalt is one small part of a much wider portfolio. Just don't tell the automotive guys. Because if Cobalt 27 is right in its assessment there is much more upside to the cobalt price, there's going to be some sort of reaction to a bunch of investors holding physical stocks of a strategic metal in short supply. Getting Physical Cobalt 27 has used a sizeable chunk of its IPO proceeds to exercise options to buy a total 2,157.50 tonnes of physical cobalt. To put that figure into perspective, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates global production of refined cobalt was 97,400 tonnes in 2015. The metal will be stored in LME warehouses operated by C. Steinweg (Baltimore, Rotterdam and Antwerp) and the Vollers Group (Rotterdam). A smaller part of the proceeds will be used to purchase royalties and cobalt streaming agreements from eight exploration-stage properties. Seven are prospects in Canada, three of them operated by Palisade Resources Corp, and one in Vietnam, operated by Asian Mineral Resources. The company's ambition is to add to this list. In essence, Cobalt 27 will offer capital appreciation, assuming the price of cobalt does indeed rise, and cash flow from royalties. The whole thing is the brain-child of Pala Investments, which describes itself as  a multi-strategy investment company focused on the mining and metals value chain . Cobalt 27 Chairman and Chief Executive Anthony Milewski is also a managing director of the Pala team. Pala is the largest shareholder with 19.64 percent at the time of the IPO, although the stake may have fallen slightly as an over-allotment option has since been partially declared. Part of Pala's holding represents payment for the supply of 626 tonnes of cobalt under one of the physical supply options. Pala was one of several funds to have scooped up physical cobalt last year, which was when the metal first emerged from the specialist shadows into the investment limelight. Another was Green Energy Metals Fund, part of the Portal Capital investment group, which is the second-largest shareholder in the new public entity having also supplied physical metal. Not all of the cobalt sellers chose to convert to Cobalt 27 shares. According to the company's final prospectus,  a total of 961.9 metric tonnes of cobalt are being acquired for cash . But Pala and Portal evidently think there is more to come from the cobalt story. The Only Way Is Up? Or to quote Cobalt 27's prospectus,  the company believes strong cobalt demand, coupled with challenged supply due to a lack of primary cobalt mines and political instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the largest supplier of mined cobalt, creates an attractive proposition for cobalt price appreciation.  This is a market that is widely viewed by analysts as being in transition from a state of supply surplus to one of shortfall. And as Cobalt 27 is happy to remind us,  in 2008, during the last multi-year cobalt supply deficit, the price of cobalt exceeded US$50/lb . That's equivalent to just over $110,000 per tonne. There are any number of uncertainties in trying to forecast the price in such a fast-evolving market as cobalt, or lithium for that matter. Everyone agrees that the electric vehicle revolution has arrived but beyond that there is no consensus as to how fast it might evolve. And what sort of batteries will those vehicles use? Noting that cobalt is currently used in six main types of lithium-ion battery, analysts at RFC Ambrian write that  what the demand for cobalt as a constituent for future batteries will be is open to question.  ( The Alchemist, Issue 31: Cobalt , July 2017). If prices rise too fast, they argue, battery makes will try and reduce the amount of cobalt used, even if they can't eliminate it altogether. Ambrian's conclusion is that cobalt demand in the year 2021 could be anything from marginally lower to 80 percent higher than today. Pala and Portal evidently believe in the more bullish of those scenarios. Supply Chain vs Speculators The irony is that if they're right and the cobalt price does go stratospheric, it will be because there's not enough of it around to meet burgeoning demand from the battery sector. And that's going to draw a lot of unwelcome attention from a physical supply chain desperately seeking spare units. There's a precedent for this sort of manufacturer-speculator showdown in the industrial metal space. In 2010 JPMorgan and BlackRock near simultaneously filed prospectuses for copper funds backed by physical metal. Copper processors were outraged. They viewed the funds as competition for physical units in a market that was at that stage suffering chronic supply shortfall. Although the regulatory and legal reactions were eventually cleared, such was the furore in the copper industry that neither fund was ever launched. Those two funds envisaged combined holdings of around 180,000 tonnes of copper, equivalent to less than 1 percent of global refined metal production at the time Cobalt 27's holding is already more than double that level in terms of global output. Might it too risk the wrath of a supply chain struggling to keep up with demand? Only time will tell, but if that scenario does materialise, it will, of course, mean that Cobalt 27's fund backers will have already been rewarded for their bullish views.

The face-to-face talks will be the first between Pena Nieto and Trump as presidents. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray warned not to expect too much.  We have to put it in context and not have expectations that are unjustified,  Videgaray said. Trump's election and his early days in office strained relations between the two neighbors because of his threats to apply tariffs to Mexican-made goods and a plan to build a wall on the southern U.S. border and force Mexico to pay for it. Trump and Pena Nieto will discuss renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement scheduled for August, as well as cooperation in combating drug cartels and development in Central America, the Foreign Ministry said. Pena Nieto will also talk about the rights of Mexican migrants in the United States, the ministry said. FILE PHOTO - Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray (R), as he arrives to the Organization of American States (OAS) 47th General Assembly in Cancun, Mexico June 21, 2017.Carlos JassoLater on Wednesday, Pena Nieto and Videgaray met with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who was visiting Mexico ahead of the G20 summit along with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. According to a statement from Pena Nieto's office, both sides agreed to work together on security and Pena Nieto praised the Trump administration's decision to keep in place a program that allows some immigrants, brought into the country illegally by their parents, to stay. One topic not on the agenda at the encounter in Hamburg is Trump's pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, Videgaray said in an earlier television interview.   In late January, a planned meeting between the two presidents was canceled following a Twitter dispute over Trump's pledge to make Mexico pay for the wall, which the Mexican government has insisted it will not do. Trump has since said he will find a way for Mexico to repay the United States for construction of the wall but that Congress would need to fund it first. His administration also toned down threats to pull out of the NAFTA pact with Mexico and Canada. Last August, during Trump's presidential campaign, he accepted an invitation to visit Mexico in what became a public relations disaster for Pena Nieto, who was widely condemned for inviting a man who has united Mexicans like few others in shared disdain.

The battle for Benghazi between Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) and an array of Islamist militants and other fighters has been part of a broader conflict since Libya slipped into turmoil following the 2011 fall of strongman Muammar Gaddafi.  Victory would mark a major advance for the one-time commander in Gaddafi's army, who has slowly gained ground in eastern and southern Libya in defiance of a U.N.-backed government that is struggling to extend its influence from the capital, Tripoli.  Your armed forces declare to you the liberation of Benghazi from terrorism, a full liberation and a victory of dignity,  Haftar said, wearing a white uniform in a televised speech.  Benghazi has entered into a new era of safety and peace.  Before he spoke, LNA forces made rapid progress through the seafront district of Sabri, using heavy artillery to blast their way through some of the final pockets of resistance. As they have after past retreats in the battle for the city, rival armed groups may fall back on using guerrilla tactics against Haftar's forces. A tank belonging to special forces from the Libyan army clashes with Islamist militants in their last stronghold in Benghazi, Libya, July 5, 2017.Esam Omran Al-FetoriHaftar launched his  Operation Dignity  in Benghazi in May 2014, promising to crush Islamists blamed for a wave of assassinations and bombings. Over three years his forces have clashed with militants as well as with former anti-Gaddafi rebels resisting what they saw as an attempt to reimpose autocratic rule. The LNA suffered heavy losses, which its own officials put at more than 5,000 men. Slideshow (14 Images)Haftar's critics accuse him of dragging Benghazi into a war that he has used to establish military control over much of eastern Libya. Parts of Benghazi have been wrecked by heavy shelling and air strikes. In Sabri, where the LNA advanced on Wednesday, deserted streets were littered with debris and the shells of rusting cars. Some buildings have been destroyed and others peppered with holes from bullets and shrapnel.  Having seized a string of key oil ports and southern air bases since last year, Haftar has made little secret of ambitions to enter Tripoli, where he portrays his rivals as beholden to Islamists and militia rule.  He has backing from foreign powers including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and has cultivated closer ties with Moscow. The LNA has gradually grown bigger and better equipped but is still heavily dependent on alliances with local brigades and tribes. Though weak, the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli retains the formal support of most Western powers.

Darren Blanton, a Dallas-based biotechnology investor who appeared in Brooklyn federal court as a witness for U.S. prosecutors, told jurors he invested in Shkreli's hedge fund MSMB Capital after being told the fund was managing $35 million in assets and had an independent auditor. He said he later learned both of those claims were false and found Shkreli evasive when he tried to get some of his money back. Blanton said he eventually filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under cross-examination by Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, Blanton conceded that despite his misgivings, his $1.25 million investment with Shkreli paid off, largely through an agreement in which Shkreli gave him shares in his drug company Retrophin Inc. Blanton said he still holds 150,000 shares of Retrophin, worth nearly $3 million at Wednesday's closing price of $19.83 per share, and previously sold shares worth $2.4 million. He also said he received a cash payment of $200,000. Prosecutors have claimed the agreement between Blanton and Shkreli, termed a consulting agreement, was a sham. Blanton said Shkreli founded Retrophin after learning that a friend of Blanton's had lost a son to a rare disease, myotubular myopathy, and vowed to find a cure. Brafman's cross-examination is expected to continue on Thursday. The testimony came after U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto ordered Shkreli to stop talking about his case in or around the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial is taking place. Five days earlier Shkreli had burst into a room full of spectators and attacked the credibility of a government witness. Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety in 2015 when he raised the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, sparking outrage among patients and U.S. lawmakers. He at times reveled in the negative publicity as he came to be known as  pharma bro  and his Twitter harassment of a journalist led to him being banned from the social media platform. The charges he now faces stem not from his time at Turing, but from his management of MSMB Capital, another fund called MSMB Healthcare and Retrophin between 2009 and 2014. Prosecutors say he deceived investors in the funds and eventually repaid them with money stolen from Retrophin.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-shkreli-idUSL1N1JW0AV"},

Trump arrived on Wednesday in Warsaw, Poland, where the White House said he would showcase his commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a speech and in meetings with a group of nations closest to Russia on his way to the G20 summit in Germany on Friday and Saturday.  He will lay out a vision not only for America's future relationship with Europe, but the future of our trans-Atlantic alliance, and what that means for American security and American prosperity,  Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, told reporters last week.   Aside from shoring up the U.S. relationship with NATO allies, the speech is symbolically significant given Poland's proximity to Russia and regional fears about Moscow's ambitions following its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. It was only six weeks ago when Trump, meeting with NATO leaders in Brussels, scolded them for failing to spend enough on defense during a speech in which the Republican president was expected to explicitly endorse NATO's Article 5, the collective defense provision of the treaty. He slammed Germany for its trade practices, and shortly after returning home, pulled out of the 2015 Paris climate deal, leaving his officials to try to smooth ruffled feelings.  They have spent a lot of their time trying to undo or explain away some of the images and the mood that came out of the last trip to Europe,  said Derek Chollet, a top defense official for former Democratic President Barack Obama. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the host of the Group of 20 meeting of leading economies, has signaled she will not back down on climate and trade.

Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us?   Under Pressure Slideshow (12 Images)That is not the only tough meeting for Trump during his trip. He will meet for the second time with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with whom he has expressed some frustration for failing to use enough leverage to curb North Korea's nuclear program. Pyongyang said on Tuesday it successfully test-launched a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts said could put all of the U.S. state of Alaska in range for the first time. Trump is under pressure at home to take a tough line in his first face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on issues such as Moscow's support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war and allegations of Russian meddling in last year's U.S. election. But first, there is Poland: a NATO member near Russia that meets its defense spending goals, hosts close to 1,000 U.S. troops and is eager to buy liquefied natural gas from U.S. companies to counterbalance Russian gas supplies in the region.  The threat that Russia poses cannot be overstated,  Poland's ambassador to the United States, Piotr Wilczek, told reporters last week.  Now is the time for allied solidarity,  Wilczek said.

Temer's lawyer Antonio Mariz de Oliveira made the arguments in the written defense he delivered to a congressional committee looking into a charge the conservative leader took bribes.  The defense believes that the charge is not based on facts; that it's a piece of fiction based on hypothesis and assumptions,  Mariz told reporters after delivering the written defense to congress.   Temer has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He refuses to resign despite opposition calls to do so and polls showing his government's approval rating is in the single digits. In the defense, Temer's legal team said a March audio recording, which prosecutors said captured the president condoning payment of hush money to a potential witness, was illegal because it was secretly recorded.  Temer also argued the recording was altered and that the man who made it - billionaire Joesley Batista, whose family controls meatpacking giant JBS SA - was a criminal who had admitted to bribing hundreds of politicians in plea bargain testimony to avoid jail time. The defense said Temer's remarks in the audio were too vague to support the charge against him. Temer was charged last week in connection with a graft scheme involving JBS. Executives said the president took bribes for resolving tax matters and facilitating loans from state-run banks.  Antonio Claudio Mariz de Oliveira, Lawyer for Brazil President Michel Temer arrives at the commission of constitution and justice, for presents his defense in Lower House, in Brasilia, Brazil July 5, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoProsecutor General Rodrigo Janot alleged in the charge that Temer made deals under which JBS would have paid him 38 million reais ($11.54 million) over the next nine months. Janot's office declined to comment on Temer's written defense or comments from his attorney including the contention that the recording and plea-bargain testimony are the entirety of the case. However, the prosecution has said it has more proof it will reveal. Slideshow (3 Images)Janot has said he expects to also charge Temer with racketeering and money laundering in the coming weeks. Under Brazilian law, two-thirds of the lower house of congress must vote to allow a criminal charge against a sitting president to move to the Supreme Court. The full house is expected to vote by mid-July, although it is possible that could be delayed to early August after a congressional recess.  If the top court accepts a charge and puts the president on trial, he would be suspended for 180 days and replaced by the house speaker, Rodrigo Maia.      Investigators have uncovered corruption in the last three years that has engulfed Brazil's political class and business elites. Much of it centers on companies paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises in return for contracts.     Temer and nine ministers as well as four former presidents and dozens of lawmakers are under investigation or already charged in the schemes.  Nearly 100 people have been convicted on corruption charges  in just over three years.

But Vantiv Inc's (VNTV.N) plan to acquire Worldpay Group PLC (WPG.L) shows that the sheer size of some legacy players - and the inertia of their customers - makes them more interested in buying one another than newer rivals, bankers and analysts said. The two companies facilitate payments by linking stores to customers' bank and credit-card accounts.   It's a pretty sticky product,  said Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group.  Once merchants find a processor that works for them, they are unlikely to change. Merchants aren't in the business of payments, they are in the business of selling stuff.   Vantiv started as a project inside of Cincinnati-based regional lender Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) during the Nixon era. Worldpay, headquartered in London, was launched by a British lender in 1989 and absorbed into Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L).  Both companies were spun out of their banks after the financial crisis and thrived on their own continents. Now they are poised to become the singular middleman for more sales globally than any other wholly-owned merchant payments processor based on the $1.3 trillion worth of transactions they handled in 2016, according to data from The Nilson Report.  The next largest, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), had looked at Worldpay but ultimately did not put in a bid, a spokesman said. Buying Worldpay would have helped JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, expand outside of its home country where it has been getting about four-fifths of its merchant business.     Infographic ID: '2sN7LvJ'     The Vantiv-Worldpay deal comes at a time when more purchases are being made online, and the payments industry - long considered a backwater of banking - is facing fresh competition.  PayPal Holdings Inc's (PYPL.O) Braintree, Amsterdam-based Adyen and San Francisco-based Stripe Inc are among the newcomers trying to disrupt the way merchants get paid. They have managed to secure deals with high-profile technology companies including video-on-demand platform Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), ride-hailing app Uber and streaming music service Spotify.  Despite the buzz surrounding these companies, they represent a small slice of the market.  In the United States, for example, the top 10 processors account for about 90 percent of transactions, according to estimates from Mizuho Securities. They are mostly big banks or companies like First Data Corp (FDC.N), which also grew out of the banking industry.  Even with that much concentration, big players want to get bigger to gain economies of scale, said one investment banker to the industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The banker predicted more traditional companies will combine, while newcomers remain independent because their stocks are much more highly valued.  Once processors have the scale of big banks, the real competitive advantage comes from allowing merchants to sell products through any channel to customers anywhere in the world, analysts and executives said.  Future mergers could be driven by a need to access new geographies or improve digital offerings, similar to the rationale behind Vantiv buying Worldpay, the banker said.

Judge Eric Long of the U.S. District Court in Urbana, Illinois, denied bail to Brendt Christensen, 28, who was arrested last week in Champaign, Illinois, on kidnapping charges in the June 9 disappearance of Yingying Zhang, 26, according to court records. Christensen's attorney, Evan Bruno, could not be reached Wednesday, but said earlier that his client was presumed innocent of the charges. He has not yet been indicted. A preliminary hearing is set for July 14. No body has been found but authorities have said they believe Zhang is dead, although they have not disclosed why. Zhang was recorded by surveillance video on June 9 waiting for a bus and then getting in a black car when a motorist pulled up to the bus stop.  The police eventually connected the car to Christensen, who first told investigators he did not recall his whereabouts on that day, but later said he picked up an Asian female and dropped her off a few blocks later. Federal agents then put Christensen under surveillance and heard him  explaining  that he kidnapped Zhang, according to court documents. A search of the suspect's cellphone also found he had visited a website that included threads on  perfect abduction fantasy,  and  planning a kidnapping,  according to a criminal complaint. Prosecutors said they argued at Wednesday's hearing that Christensen was a danger to the community, citing his attendance at a June 29 vigil for Zhang. He was already under federal surveillance at that point, according to the complaint. Christensen has talked about the characteristics of the  ideal victim,  prosecutors said in a statement, and threatened another person who was not identified, but to whom he made incriminating statements.  Prosecutors also said that Zhang  fought and resisted,  according to the statement.  Zhang, a scholar in photosynthesis and crop productivity, came to the University of Illinois several months ago. The case has shaken the Chinese community at the university, which draws thousands of students from China.  Zhang's father and other family members traveled from China to join in the search. Her case has garnered news coverage in China. Christensen graduated from the university in May with a master's degree in physics. Court documents show he is married.

Borrowing from nature, some machines now have arms that curl and grip like an octopus, others wriggle their way inside an airplane engine or forage underwater to create their own energy. This is technology that challenges how we think of, and interact with, the robots of the not-too-distant future. Robots are big business: by 2020, the industry will have more than doubled to $188 billion, predicts IDC, a consultancy. But there's still a lot that today's models can't do, partly because they are mostly made of rigid metal or plastic. Softer, lighter and less reliant on external power, future robots could interact more safely and predictably with humans, go where humans can't, and do some of the robotic jobs that other robots still can't manage. A recent academic conference in Singapore showcased the latest advances in soft robotics, highlighting how far they are moving away from what we see as traditional robots.   The theme here,  says Nikolaus Correll of Colorado University,  is a departure from gears, joints and links.  One robot on display was made of origami paper; another resembled a rolling colostomy bag. They are more likely to move via muscles that expand and contract through heat or hydraulics than by electricity. Some combine sensing and movement into the same component - just as our fingertips react to touch without needing our brain to make a decision. These ideas are already escaping from the lab. Small, Agile Rolls-Royce, for example, is testing a snake-like robot that can worm its way inside an aircraft engine mounted on the wing, saving the days it can take to remove the engine, inspect it and put it back. Of all the technologies Rolls-Royce is exploring to solve this bottleneck,  this is the killer one,  says Oliver Walker-Jones, head of communications. The snake, says its creator, Arnau Garriga Casanovas, is made largely of pressurized silicone chambers, allowing the controller to propel and bend it through the engine with bursts of air. Using soft materials, he says, means it can be small and agile. For now, much of the commercial action for softer robots is in logistics, replacing production-line jobs that can't yet be handled by hard robots.  Food preparation companies and growers like Blue Apron, Plated and HelloFresh already use soft robotics for handling produce, says Mike Rocky, of recruiter PrincetonOne. REFILE - CLARIFYING CAPTION  A soft robot designed by a team from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in the U.S., in the form of a salamander, is displayed in Singapore June 5, 2017. Picture taken June 5, 2017.Edgar SuThe challenge, says Cambridge Consultants' Nathan Wrench, is to overcome the uncertainty when handling something - which humans deal with unconsciously: figuring out its shape and location and how hard to grip it, and distinguishing one object from another.  This is an area robots traditionally can't do, but where (soft robots) are on the cusp of being able to,  said Wrench. Marine Inspiration Investors are excited, says Leif Jentoft, co-founder of RightHand Robotics, because it addresses a major pain point in the logistics industry.  Ecommerce is growing rapidly and warehouses are struggling to find enough labor, especially in remote areas where warehouses tend to be located.  Some hope to ditch the idea that robots need hands. German automation company Festo and China's Beihang University have built a prototype OctopusGripper, which has a pneumatic tentacle made of silicone that gently wraps itself around an object, while air is pumped in or out of suction cups to grasp it. Slideshow (2 Images)The ocean has inspired other robots, too. A soft robot fish from China's Zhejiang University swims by ditching the usual rigid motors and propellers for an artificial muscle which flexes. It's lifelike enough, says creator Tiefeng Li, to fool other fish into embracing it as one of their own, and is being tested to explore or monitor water salinity. And Bristol University in the UK is working on underwater robots that generate electrical energy by foraging for biomatter to feed a chain of microbial fuel-cell stomachs. Hemma Philamore says her team is talking to companies and environmental organizations about using its soft robots to decontaminate polluted waterways and monitor industrial infrastructure. This doesn't mean the end of hard-shelled robots. Part of the problem, says Mark Freudenberg, executive technology director at frog, a design company, is that soft materials break easily, noting that most animatronic dolls like Teddy Ruxpin and Furby have rigid motors and plastic casings beneath their fur exteriors. To be sure, the nascent soft robot industry lacks an ecosystem of software, hardware components and standards - and some companies have already failed. Empire Robotics, one of the first soft robot gripper companies, closed last year. RightHand's Jentoft says the problem is that customers don't just want a robot, but the whole package, including computer vision and machine learning.  It's hard to be a standalone gripper company,  he says. And even if soft robots find a niche, chances are they still won't replace all the jobs done by human or hard-shelled robots. Wrench, whose Cambridge Consultants has built its own fruit picking robot, says he expects to see soft robots working with humans to harvest fruit like apples and pears which are harder to damage. Once the robot has passed through, human pickers would follow to grab fruit hidden behind leaves and in hard-to-reach spots.  It's a constant race to the bottom, so there's a pressing business need,  Wrench said.

He said he later learned both of those claims were false and found Shkreli evasive when he tried to get some of his money back. Blanton said he eventually filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under cross-examination by Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, Blanton conceded that despite his misgivings, his $1.25 million investment with Shkreli paid off, largely through an agreement in which Shkreli gave him shares in his drug company Retrophin Inc. Blanton said he still holds 150,000 shares of Retrophin, worth nearly $3 million at Wednesday's closing price of $19.83 per share, and previously sold shares worth $2.4 million.

Pyongyang's first test on Tuesday of an ICBM with a potential to strike the state of Alaska has raised the question: How capable is the U.S. military of knocking down an incoming missile or barrage of missiles? Briefing reporters on Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis said:  We do have confidence in our ability to defend against the limited threat, the nascent threat that is there.      Davis cited a successful test in May in which a U.S.-based missile interceptor knocked down a simulated incoming North Korean ICBM. But he acknowledged the test program's track program was not perfect.  It's something we have mixed results on. But we also have an ability to shoot more than one interceptor,  Davis said. An internal memo seen by Reuters also showed that the Pentagon upgraded its assessment of U.S. defenses after the May  test. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent on a multi-layered missile defense system, the United States may not be able to seal itself off entirely from a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile attack. Experts caution that U.S. missile defenses are now geared to shooting down one, or perhaps a small number of basic, incoming missiles. Were North Korea's technology and production to keep advancing, U.S. defenses could be overwhelmed unless they keep pace with the threat.  Over the next four years, the United States has to increase its current capacity of our deployed systems, aggressively push for more and faster deployment,  said Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.  Mixed Results The test records of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), charged with the mission to develop, test and field a ballistic missile defense system, also show mixed results.  The intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 is seen during its test launch in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency. KCNA/via REUTERSMDA systems have multiple layers and ranges and use sensors in space at sea and on land that altogether form a defense for different U.S. regions and territories.      One component, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD), demonstrated a success rate just above 55 percent. A second component, the Aegis system deployed aboard U.S. Navy ships and on land, had about an 83 percent success rate, according to the agency.  A third, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-missile system, has a 100 percent success rate in 13 tests conducted since 2006, according to the MDA. Lockheed Martin Corp is the prime contractor for THAAD and Aegis. Boeing Co is the lead contractor for GMD.      Since President Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s, the U.S. government has spent more than $200 billion to develop and field a range of ballistic missile defense systems ranging from satellite detection to the sea-based Aegis system, according to the Congressional Research Service.     Funding for MDA was on average $8.12 billion during President Barack Obama's administration that ended on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump has requested $7.8 billion for fiscal year 2018. 'Another Year or Two' Last month, Vice Admiral James Syring, then director of the Missile Defense Agency, told a congressional panel that North Korean advancements in the past six months had caused him great concern. U.S.-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North said the pace of North Korea's missile development was quicker than expected.  However, it will probably require another year or two of development before this missile can reliably and accurately hit high-value continental U.S. targets, particularly if fired under wartime conditions,  he said. Michael Elleman, a fellow for Missile Defence at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that although North Korea was several steps from creating a dependable ICBM,  There are absolutely no guarantees  the United States can protect itself.  In missile defense,  Even if it had a test record of 100 percent, there are no guarantees.

The study, by Insigniam Holding LLC, which was seen by Reuters, also urges extending foreign postings for U.S. diplomats by one year and ensuring overlap between arriving and departing diplomats to improve efficiency and impact. The 110-page study was based on online surveys of 35,386 people within the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development as well as one-on-one interviews with about 300 workers. It was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Tillerson commissioned the study as he looks to reorganize the State Department to cut its budget by roughly 30 percent, as laid out in President Donald Trump's budget proposal. Influential members of Congress, which has the power of the purse, have made clear that they are not willing to institute such sharp budget reductions, which have contributed to anxiety and low morale among many State Department employees. In the report, the consultants recommended that Tillerson  move issuance of passports, visas and other travel documents to Homeland Security.   There may be an opportunity to elevate efficiency and reduce cost by this change,  it said.  Indications are that doing so would elevate security at our borders.  Jeffrey Gorsky, a former State Department consular official, said the idea of shifting visa issuance from the State Department had been around since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but that improved U.S. security had undercut the argument for this. Such a shift, he said, would likely require congressional action and could erode the principle of  non-reviewability,  the current doctrine under which consular decisions may not be reviewed by the courts. The report also called for crafting  a unifying, clear and vibrant mission  for the State Department and USAID, though the recommendations did not specify one; focusing on  front-line  staff at U.S. embassies and consulates rather than headquarters personnel; and improving management to measure performance, remove  poor performers  and update personnel policies.

The militants from a faction known as the Maute group, seized the town or Marawi on May 23 and are resisting daily assaults by government forces using aircraft and artillery, and with help from allies the United States and Australia. The fighting in the largely Muslim town in south of the predominantly Christian Philippines has alarmed neighbors, fearful that Islamic State is bent on gaining a foothold in the  region as it loses ground in the Middle East. Security forces raided a village not far from Marawi and detained three suspects found with ammunition and material for making bombs, an army spokesman, Brigadier-General Gilbert Gapay, said. One of those detained was an important supporter of the Maute group who Gapay identified as Monaliza Romato, alias Monay. The woman is a niece of the matriarch of the Maute clan, whose men-folk lead the Marawi attack. Two of seven Maute brothers, Omar and Abdullah, were educated in the Middle East, and were the main planners of the assault on Marawi, the military has said.  Monay has replaced her aunt as the main financier and logistic supporter of the militant group,  Gapay said in a statement.  The arrest will adversely affect the logistics support network of the group,  he said. The raid, seizure of weapons and the arrests would also prevent the militants from mounting diversionary attacks, he said. Replenishing Weapons  More than 400 people have been killed in the fighting in Marawi. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and about 20 percent of the center of the town has been destroyed.

President Rodrigo Duterte imposed martial law on Mindanao island, where Marawi is located, for 60 days when the fighting erupted and Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said there was pressure on the military to defeat the militants before it expires on July 23. That is also a day before Duterte is due to deliver his annual state of the nation address in Congress. Lorenzana said the military last week sent an aircraft to the United States to stock up on various bombs and rockets, supplies of which were running out. Slideshow (5 Images)U.S. forces are providing Philippine troops with technical assistance for the battle while Australia has sent two surveillance planes. In another part of Mindanao, soldiers on Tuesday found the beheaded bodies of two Vietnamese sailors abducted a year ago by militants from the Abu Sayyaf group. Three Vietnamese sailors are still being held by Abu Sayyaf, who, in all, hold 14 foreigners and eight Philippine citizens. Vietnam denounced the killing of its citizens.  Vietnam strongly condemns all savage and inhumane kidnapping and murderous acts and believes that these acts must be punished properly,  foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters. The Abu Sayyaf militants are allied with the Maute group. The fighting in Marawi erupted on May 23 when security forces tried to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf leader who the government believes is Islamic State's  emir , or leader, in the Philippines, and who was in the town with Maute fighters at the time.  Lorenzana said this week Hapilon is believed to be hiding in a Marawi mosque.

U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan dismissed McAfee's September 2016 lawsuit and a countersuit by Intel on Wednesday, five days after a settlement agreement was signed. McAfee said he sued after Intel warned him that using his name, including by renaming his digital gaming and cybersecurity company MGT Capital Investments Inc (MGTI.PK) as  John McAfee Global Technologies Inc,  would infringe its trademarks. Intel countered by accusing McAfee of trademark infringement and unfair competition, and sought unspecified damages. Under the settlement, McAfee agreed not to use his name, trademark his name or the phrase  John McAfee Privacy Phone,  or use  John McAfee Global Technologies  in connection with cybersecurity- and security-related products and services. He retained the right in other contexts to use his name in advertising, promotions and presentations, including with regard to his role at McAfee Associates, which he sold to Intel for $7.7 billion in 2010. Neither McAfee nor Intel admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which was amicable, according to court papers. McAfee's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Intel said the Santa Clara, California-based company was pleased to settle. Intel spun off its cybersecurity division, now called McAfee LLC, in April, after agreeing to sell a 51 percent stake to private investment firm TPG Capital. TPG later accepted a minority investment in the business from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Intel retained a 49 percent stake in McAfee, which the spinoff valued at $4.2 billion including debt. John McAfee unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party's nomination for the U.S. presidency last year.

The rookie outfielder went 2-for-4 with his second game-winning RBI and sixth go-ahead RBI of the season as the Chicago Cubs beat the Tampa Bay Rays 7-3 on Wednesday.  He's slowing things down,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  When he comes to the plate, he takes that big breath as he steps into the batter's box. I think that has a lot to do with it.  Happ delivered a two-run go-ahead single in the seventh inning.  I think it's a lot about controlling your breathing and making sure you're understanding the situation and understanding what your job is,  he said.  As long as you can prepare yourself mentally and make sure you're in the right state, that's the process that you're looking for. If you do that more often than not, the results will come.  Chicago scored seven runs between the sixth and eighth innings to overtake Tampa Bay and earn a split in the two-game series at Wrigley Field. Reliever Pedro Strop (3-2) worked a perfect seventh inning to earn the victory for the Cubs (42-42). Related CoveragePreview: Rays at CubsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchErasmo Ramirez (4-3) gave up four runs through the decisive sixth and seventh innings in relief and took the loss for the Rays (44-42). Happ's one-out base hit to shallow center drove in Kris Bryant and Anthony RIzzo to snap a 3-3 tie. Rizzo, who went 2-for-3, added a two-out double in the eighth to drive in Tommy La Stella and Bryant to open a four-run lead. Tampa Bay outfielder Mallex Smith went a career-high 4-for-4 and scored three times. Cubs pinch hitter Jon Jay delivered three runs with one swing of the bat with a pinch-hit homer as the teams were temporarily deadlocked 3-3 in the sixth inning. Smith had two singles and a two-base hit while Evan Longoria drove him in twice. Corey Dickerson doubled him home for a third run. Rays left-handed starter Blake Snell received a no-decision, missing a chance for his first victory since Sept. 22, 2016. He gave up four hits, walked four and struck out five in a five-inning outing.  Tough loss, obviously,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  Three-nothing ballgame with 12 outs to get. We started the inning with six-seven-eight (in the batting order), whatever it was, two outs with men on first and second, and they get a big pinch-hit home run.  Cubs starter John Lackey (5-9) avoided his third straight loss with the no-decision. He allowed three runs on six hits, struck out three and walked none over six innings. Lackey was efficient despite being troubled by a sore right foot.  A lot of it has to do with his competitive nature,  Maddon said.  He got it up to 92, 93 (miles per hour) when he wanted to on occasion. ... Game in progress he might have a tough start but he normally is there fifth, sixth, seventh inning.  Smith led off the game with a single to right, stole second and gave the Rays a 1-0 lead when he scored on Longoria's one-out base hit to center. Smith singled to right again in the third and came home for a 2-0 lead on Dickerson's one-out double into the left field corner. Dickerson tried to extend the hit into a triple, but was thrown out as Happ fired to Bryant for the tag. Smith led off the sixth with a double to left, reached third on Dickerson's fielder's choice grounder and scored his third run as Longoria send a sacrifice to deep center. The Cubs evened the score in the bottom of the sixth on Jay's three-run homer. Jay, who pinch hit for Lackey, launched a 1-2 pitch off Ramirez to left for his second homer of the season, which brought home Happ and Javier Baez.  He gives you a good at-bat in that situation,  Maddon said.  But I wasn't expecting a home run.  NOTES: Tampa Bay 2B Brad Miller (right groin strain) went 1-for-3 with a walk in Tuesday's rehab game at Triple-A Durham. He was expected to DH on Wednesday. ... The Rays return home Thursday to meet Boston for a four-game series and send RHP James Faria (3-0, 2.23 ERA) against Red Sox LHP Chris Sale (11-3, 2.61 ERA) in Friday's opener. ...

The Sahel stretches coast to coast from Mauritania and Mali in the west to Sudan and Eritrea in the east, and skirts the southern edge of the Sahara desert. It is home to more than 100 million people.  The region has seen worsening extreme weather - including more frequent droughts - in recent years. But if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, the resulting global warming - of more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - could change major weather patterns in the Sahel, and in many different parts of the world, scientists say. Some weather models predict a small increase in rainfall for the Sahel, but there is a risk that the entire weather pattern will change by the end of the century, researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) said.  The sheer size of the possible change is mindboggling - this is one of the very few elements in the Earth system that we might witness tipping soon,  said co-author Anders Levermann from PIK and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of New York's Columbia University.  If the Sahel becomes much rainier, it will mean more water for agriculture, industry and domestic use. But in the first few years of the transition, people are likely to experience very erratic weather - extreme droughts followed by destructive floods, the researchers said.     This level of unpredictability makes it very hard for people to plan for coming changes, they said.  The enormous change that we might see would clearly pose a huge adaptation challenge to the Sahel,  said Levermann.   More than 100 million people are potentially affected that already now are confronted with a (multitude) of instabilities, including war,  he said.  The region faces a range of conflicts, including some driven by groups such as Boko Haram and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The researchers studied rainfall patterns in the months of July, August and September when the region receives most of its annual rain.  There's a range of possible outcomes for societies in the Sahel which depend on the climate that eventually (develops)... and whether they are prepared for fluctuations,  lead author Jacob Schewe, from PIK, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.          Climate change from burning fossil fuels  really has the power to shake things up , he said.  It is driving risks for crop yields in many regions and generally increases dangerous weather extremes around the globe,  he added.

Daesh (Islamic State) forced us out of our home, so we moved to a relative's house nearby. Yesterday the house was bombed,  he said after the army evacuated him on Monday.  We moved to my cousin's house and this morning it was also bombed.  Adnan, who has shrapnel lodged in his skull from an earlier mortar attack, said he survived, with others, by hiding in the houses' underground cellars. Thousands of people in the last patch of Mosul still controlled by the insurgents have been huddling for weeks in similar conditions, with little food and no electricity. They fear being bombed if they remain in place and being shot by snipers if they try to flee. Iraqi forces have pushed Islamic State into a shrinking rectangle no more than 300 by 500 meters beside the Tigris river, but slowed their advance on Tuesday out of caution for an estimated 10,000 civilians trapped there alongside the militants. Residents have been caught in the crossfire - and often intentionally targeted by Islamic State - since the offensive began more than eight months ago. Thousands have been killed and around 900,000 - around half of Mosul's pre-war population - have been displaced. Those in the historic Old City, the offensive's final target, have been besieged and under fire for longer than those in any other part of Mosul, and the toll is apparent. Children are emerging bone thin and severely dehydrated, elderly people are collapsing en route. In many cases there is nothing to eat besides boiled wheat. At a mustering point less than a kilometer from the frontline, residents rattled off the latest prices of basic goods which they said had become prohibitively expensive in the past three months: a kilogram of lentils for 60,000 Iraqi dinars ($51), rice for 25,000 and flour for 22,000. Mohammed Taher, a young man from the Makawi area of the Old City, said Russian-speaking IS fighters spread out across the neighborhood had impeded civilian movement. Displaced Iraqi families who fled from Islamic State militants wait for a security check in Mosul, Iraq July 3, 2017. Picture taken  July 3, 2017.Alaa Al-Marjani It was a prison,  he said.  Five days ago they locked the door on us. They said, 'Don't come out, die inside'. But the army came and freed us.  A European medic at a field hospital said he has seen more severe trauma cases among civilians fleeing the fighting in the past week than he had in 20 years of service back home. Screening From the mustering point, camouflaged army trucks carry the evacuees across the Tigris river to a security screening center in the shadow of the Nineveh Oberoi Hotel, a former five-star hotel which Islamic State once used to house foreign fighters and suicide bombers. Slideshow (9 Images)More than 4,000 people have passed through that screening center since mid-May, said Lieutenant Colonel Khalid al-Jabouri, who runs the site. In that time, security forces have detained around 400 suspected IS members, he said.  They are wanted so they cross with the civilians like they are one of them,  he told Reuters.  In order to relieve our country from these pigs, we have to check every person who comes and goes.  Jabouri pointed out two middle-aged men who intelligence officers had pulled aside from among several dozen others for suspected links to Islamic State. One wore a traditional white robe and black headdress, the other had a shaved head and a bandage on one leg.  That person is a Daesh member,  he said, pointing at the second man.  He crossed without papers but he is Daesh. He crossed wounded or pretending to be wounded.  The number of Islamic State militants fighting in Mosul, by far the biggest city it has ever controlled, has dwindled from thousands at the start of the U.S.-backed offensive to a couple of hundred now, according to the Iraqi military. The security forces rely on a list of names and witness testimonies to identify suspected Islamic State members. Even as the military offensive draws to a close, though, it is clear that some militants have managed to slip through the cracks. Suspected militants are arrested on a daily basis in Mosul neighborhoods proclaimed  liberated  from Islamic State months ago, and several suicide attacks have already been carried out in those areas.

The report from Britain's most powerful financial lobby group said continental Europe might eventually become the preferred destination for banks, insurers and asset managers as they relocate business there to retain access to the EU single market.  Although companies may begin by initially shifting a small number of jobs to Europe this may begin to accelerate when property leases expire, they carry out business reviews, or when the cost of capital becomes uneconomical.    Shifts out of the UK may gradually erode the 'cluster effect' of the financial ecosystem, with the threat of a tipping point in the ecosystem being reached,  the group said in a 83-page document outlining how the industry can thrive over the next decade. Securing a favorable deal for financial services from the Brexit negotiations is one of the biggest challenges for the British government because it is its largest export sector and biggest source of corporate tax. Britain's finance industry could lose up to 38 billion pounds ($49 billion) in revenue in a so-called  hard Brexit  that would restrict its access to the EU single market, according to some estimates. The report said the government must ensure businesses can recruit people to fill skill gaps and must simplify the process of getting a visa. Brexit has already made it harder to attract people to Britain and the government is introducing policies making immigration more restrictive and expensive, the report said.   FILE PHOTO: Workers walk to work during the morning rush hour in the financial district of Canary Wharf in London, Britain, January 26, 2017.Eddie KeoghIt said the cost of hiring an employee on a five-year visa has risen by 250 percent to 7,000 pounds over the last year and the minimum salary a business may recruit staff for a visa has risen by almost half since 2015. Aside from Brexit, the report also looks at broader issues that threaten the competitiveness of the City of London as financial services hub, including a need to invest in transport networks and technology. It calls for government and financial services to work together closely to develop international trade policies and to improve the country's digital and physical infrastructure, including speeding up travel times between airports and different financial centers around Britain.  One financial services industry veteran who had independent access to the report said it lacked urgency and there was too little on the impact of Britain leaving the EU given that  Brexit is a catastrophe for the City.   Mark Hoban, a former financial services minister who chaired the report, said that Brexit was only one of several challenges facing financial services.   The challenges facing financial services are much more than just about Brexit. It is about emerging financial centers and also, to a degree, about unmet needs in the UK as well,  Hoban told Reuters.  There is a very clear appetite to tackle these issues at various levels of government.   ($1 = 0.7748 pounds) Reporting By Andrew MacAskill and Huw Jones.

Braskem, whose stock market quotes are being given separately as a result of the delay, had until June 22 to formally present a defense.  The case will be ruled on this week and could result in the suspension of the company,  the bourse said. If the problem persists, at the end of the process Braskem may be compulsorily delisted from Level 1 trading, the bourse said in an emailed statement. Local newspaper Valor Economico said on Wednesday a ruling on the suspension would be made this week. It said Braskem had submitted only unaudited statements for the first quarter, the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full 2016 result. Braskem said it is working with independent auditors to finish the financial statements. According to Valor, Braskem said the delay was due to a pending analysis by independent auditors related to internal controls and procedures after the company signed plea deals with federal prosecutors in Brazil, the United States and Switzerland in connection with a massive graft scheme known as Operation Car Wash. Brazil-based construction firm Odebrecht SA and Braskem agreed to pay at least $3.5 billion in the leniency deal it signed to resolve some international charges involving payoffs to former executives at Brazil's state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, politicians and others. Braskem is jointly owned by Odebrecht and Petrobras. According to B3, other listed companies have been suspended from trading due to delays in submitting financial statements, including mining concern MMX Mineração e Metálicos in 2014 and engineering firm Inepar SA Industria e Construções in 2016. Level 1 trading requires companies to maintain a free-float of at least 25 percent of capital. The deadline to cure delays in the submission of financial statements is 30 days, B3 said. Braskem's shares closed flat on Wednesday in Sao Paulo, at 34.34 reais.

The battle for Benghazi between Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) and an array of Islamist militants and other fighters has been part of a broader conflict since Libya slipped into turmoil following the 2011 fall of strongman Muammar Gaddafi.  Victory would mark a major advance for the one-time commander in Gaddafi's army, who has slowly gained ground in eastern and southern Libya in defiance of a U.N.-backed government that is struggling to extend its influence from the capital, Tripoli.  Your armed forces declare to you the liberation of Benghazi from terrorism, a full liberation and a victory of dignity,  Haftar said, wearing a white uniform in a televised speech.  Benghazi has entered into a new era of safety and peace.  Before he spoke, LNA forces made rapid progress through the seafront district of Sabri, using heavy artillery to blast their way through some of the final pockets of resistance. As they have after past retreats in the battle for the city, rival armed groups may fall back on using guerrilla tactics against Haftar's forces. A tank belonging to special forces from the Libyan army clashes with Islamist militants in their last stronghold in Benghazi, Libya, July 5, 2017.Esam Omran Al-FetoriHaftar launched his  Operation Dignity  in Benghazi in May 2014, promising to crush Islamists blamed for a wave of assassinations and bombings. Over three years his forces have clashed with militants as well as with former anti-Gaddafi rebels resisting what they saw as an attempt to reimpose autocratic rule. The LNA suffered heavy losses, which its own officials put at more than 5,000 men. Slideshow (14 Images)Haftar's critics accuse him of dragging Benghazi into a war that he has used to establish military control over much of eastern Libya. Parts of Benghazi have been wrecked by heavy shelling and air strikes. In Sabri, where the LNA advanced on Wednesday, deserted streets were littered with debris and the shells of rusting cars. Some buildings have been destroyed and others peppered with holes from bullets and shrapnel.  Having seized a string of key oil ports and southern air bases since last year, Haftar has made little secret of ambitions to enter Tripoli, where he portrays his rivals as beholden to Islamists and militia rule.  He has backing from foreign powers including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and has cultivated closer ties with Moscow. The LNA has gradually grown bigger and better equipped but is still heavily dependent on alliances with local brigades and tribes. Though weak, the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli retains the formal support of most Western powers.

But Vantiv Inc's (VNTV.N) plan to acquire Worldpay Group PLC (WPG.L) shows that the sheer size of some legacy players - and the inertia of their customers - makes them more interested in buying one another than newer rivals, bankers and analysts said. The two companies facilitate payments by linking stores to customers' bank and credit-card accounts.   It's a pretty sticky product,  said Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group.  Once merchants find a processor that works for them, they are unlikely to change. Merchants aren't in the business of payments, they are in the business of selling stuff.   Vantiv started as a project inside of Cincinnati-based regional lender Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) during the Nixon era. Worldpay, headquartered in London, was launched by a British lender in 1989 and absorbed into Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L).  Both companies were spun out of their banks after the financial crisis and thrived on their own continents. Now they are poised to become the singular middleman for more sales globally than any other wholly-owned merchant payments processor based on the $1.3 trillion worth of transactions they handled in 2016, according to data from The Nilson Report.  The next largest, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), had looked at Worldpay but ultimately did not put in a bid, a spokesman said. Buying Worldpay would have helped JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, expand outside of its home country where it has been getting about four-fifths of its merchant business.     Infographic ID: '2sN7LvJ'     The Vantiv-Worldpay deal comes at a time when more purchases are being made online, and the payments industry - long considered a backwater of banking - is facing fresh competition.  PayPal Holdings Inc's (PYPL.O) Braintree, Amsterdam-based Adyen and San Francisco-based Stripe Inc are among the newcomers trying to disrupt the way merchants get paid. They have managed to secure deals with high-profile technology companies including video-on-demand platform Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), ride-hailing app Uber and streaming music service Spotify.  Despite the buzz surrounding these companies, they represent a small slice of the market.  In the United States, for example, the top 10 processors account for about 90 percent of transactions, according to estimates from Mizuho Securities. They are mostly big banks or companies like First Data Corp (FDC.N), which also grew out of the banking industry.  Even with that much concentration, big players want to get bigger to gain economies of scale, said one investment banker to the industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The banker predicted more traditional companies will combine, while newcomers remain independent because their stocks are much more highly valued.  Once processors have the scale of big banks, the real competitive advantage comes from allowing merchants to sell products through any channel to customers anywhere in the world, analysts and executives said.  Future mergers could be driven by a need to access new geographies or improve digital offerings, similar to the rationale behind Vantiv buying Worldpay, the banker said.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposed total volume marked a slight decline from current levels and was more than 20 percent below targets laid out in a 2007 law. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, requires increased volumes of renewable fuels each year, but the proposal would keep targets for use of conventional biofuels at current levels. The agency has begun preparations to reset future biofuel targets, said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. His proposal was met with praise and calls for broader reform from the petroleum industry and mixed response from biofuels producers. Environmentalists, who have been critical of ethanol, called for Congress to reform the program. The RFS has become a battlefield between corn and oil interests. The law has been a boon to agriculture, supporting economies across the Midwest's Corn Belt. The EPA's proposed cuts to advanced and cellulosic biofuels  will have a chilling effect on the push toward next generation biofuels,  said Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. Petroleum companies say the biofuel targets are impossible to meet and add billions of dollars in costs. The plan would require companies to blend a total of 19.24 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the country's fuel supply next year. The proposal is  consistent with market realities focused on actual production and consumer demand while being cognizant of the challenges that exist in bringing advanced biofuels into the marketplace,  Pruitt said in a statement. The agency would keep the 2018 target for conventional ethanol at 15 billion gallons, unchanged from 2017, and set the requirement for advanced biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol, at 4.24 billion gallons. These latest volumes confirmed an earlier Reuters report for volumes well below the 26 billion gallons of renewable fuels outlined by Congress in 2007. The law was aimed at cutting U.S. oil imports and boosting the use of renewable fuels. The EPA also requested comments related to concerns that the biofuels requirements increasingly are being met by supplies from Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia. The agency proposed setting the requirements for cellulosic below the current year's levels at 238 million gallons and kept biomass-based diesel requirements at 2.1 billion gallons for 2019, unchanged from the levels set for 2018 under former President Barack Obama. Development of cellulosic biofuels has been slower than expected by lawmakers when they set up the program, stymied by regulatory delays and the economic downturn. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil companies, including BP America and Chevron Corp, praised the move to lower the overall requirements but said the proposal did not go far enough. Ethanol groups praised the agency for maintaining the target for conventional ethanol, which is mostly produced from corn in the United States, but were critical of the move to lower the advanced targets.  We are concerned that by reducing the cellulosic (requirement), this proposal may weaken the signal to the marketplace,  said Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association. “Today’s proposal underscores the need for the U.S. Congress to take the bull by the horns and reform the Renewable Fuel Standard to protect our clean water, our public health, and our wildlife,  said National Wildlife Federation President and CEO Collin O’Mara.

Martin drew a bases-loaded, tiebreaking walk in the eighth against Betances and hit one of four homers for the Toronto Blue Jays in a 7-6 victory over the New York Yankees Wednesday afternoon.  He's known to do that every once in a while,  Martin said.  He's not the kind of guy that gets banged around by contact. He kind of gets himself in trouble with his command, and today you could tell he was fighting with his mechanics or something. He didn't really feel that. When that happens, you got to force him to throw balls in the strike zone.  The Blue Jays showcased plenty of power by tying a season high with four homers as Justin Smoak, Kendrys Morales and Kevin Pillar homered in the first four innings off Michael Pineda. Martin displayed his power by opening the seventh with a game-tying homer off Chad Green. Ultimately, it was the Blue Jays' willingness not to bite on pitches out of the strike zone that made the difference. Martin drove in the game-deciding run after Betances (3-4) was unable to end the at-bat after getting to a 2-2 count. After swinging and missing on a curveball, Martin did not swing at the next two curves, and that gave Toronto the lead. Martin's walk chased Betances from the mound and the All-Star reliever heard boos after issuing four walks for the second time in his career and first time since becoming a late-inning reliever in 2014. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at YankeesToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchBefore walking Martin, Betances also walked Miguel Montero, Pillar and Ryan Goins. Two of those walks were on fastballs, including a pitch clocked at 100 mph to Goins.  Right now, physically he's off (with his mechanics) and we have to get him back,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  We have to get him back on line to where he's throwing consistent strikes because we've seen him do it and when he does it he's dominant.  Betances threw 18 of his 27 pitches out of the strike zone, including 10 in a row at one point. In his last four outings, the 6-foot-8 right-hander has issued 10 walks and allowed seven runs in a span of 2 2/3 innings.  I feel like I'm too inconsistent with my delivery,  Betances said.  My timing is just not there right now. I got to find it. My stuff is there but the timing of my delivery is not there and it's causing me to fall behind guys and walk them.  Betances' latest wild outing sent the Yankees to their 16th loss in 22 games since June 13. It also came on a day when Aaron Judge tied the team rookie record set by Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio with his 29th homer. Five innings after matching DiMaggio with his latest homer, Judge was unable to come through again as he struck out swinging at a 2-2 slider against Roberto Osuna as Brett Gardner was the tying run in the ninth inning.  That's the moment you want to be up, runner on, chance to win the ballgame,  Judge said.  It's what you dream of. Just wasn't able to come up and get the job done.  Osuna converted his 21st save and became the fifth pitcher in team history to convert at least 20 straight save chances.  He's a pretty good hitter,  Osuna said.  I'm trying to focus on throwing strikes. He's one of the best, so you got to pitch him really careful.  Said Toronto manager John Gibbons:  Our best against their best and our best won.  Long before the game was decided by the bullpens, the Blue Jays took a 5-0 lead on a two-run homer by Smoak in the third, a solo shot by Morales in the third and a solo homer by Pillar in the fourth off Pineda. Those homers occurred after Toronto's Jose Bautista scored the first run when center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury bobbled Smoak's base hit for an error. The Yankees stormed back against Marco Estrada, getting two in the fourth on Judge's latest homer. New York made it a one-run game on Ji-Man Choi's two-run homer in the fifth and took a 6-5 lead on a two-run bases-loaded double by Didi Gregorius. Neither starter got past the fifth inning. Pineda allowed five runs and nine hits in three-plus innings. Estrada allowed six runs and five hits in 4 2/3 innings. Three relievers pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings as Toronto won a series for the first time since June 9-11. Danny Barnes (2-2) struck out three, including Gary Sanchez with two on in the seventh. NOTES: Yankees OF Dustin Fowler said the rehab for his ruptured patellar tendon will take about four to six months and should be completed in time for spring training next season. ... Toronto C Luke Maile underwent an MRI Tuesday that showed a torn meniscus and surgery is a possibility. ... Toronto manager John Gibbons said RHP Aaron Sanchez (blister) will start Friday after missing over a month on the disabled list for the second time this season. ... 1B Ji-Man Choi became the seventh player to start a game at first base for the Yankees and the 10th player to appear there this season for New York.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-bluejays-yankees-writethru-idUSMTZED75MY5JI3"},

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called it a  flagrant violation  of Tracy Petrocelli's constitutional rights to a lawyer and against self-incrimination when a psychiatrist who examined him at the behest of prosecutors was allowed to testify during his trial's penalty phase. By a 3-0 vote, the San Francisco-based court also upheld Petrocelli's conviction for first-degree murder and robbery, rejecting his claim that statements he made to detectives after his arrest were admitted improperly. Petrocelli, 65, had been sentenced for the March 29, 1982 shooting death of used car salesman James Wilson during a test drive of a Volkswagen pickup. Wilson's body was found in a remote area about 35 miles (56 km) north of Reno. The defendant first sought a federal writ of habeas corpus challenging his detention in 1988, court records show. He had been one of Nevada's longest-serving death row inmates. A spokeswoman for Nevada Attorney General Adam Paul Laxalt, whose office defended the death sentence, had no immediate comment. A. Richard Ellis, a lawyer for Petrocelli, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The psychiatrist, Lynn Gerow, had testified that Petrocelli had a rare, incurable  psychopathic  personality, suggesting he could have a  quite high  propensity for further violence and would not learn from punishment. But in Wednesday's decision, Circuit Judge William Fletcher noted that Petrocelli already had a lawyer by the time Gerow interviewed him in jail, three days after his arrest, to help prosecutors determine his competence to stand trial. He said the psychiatrist's testimony, combined with a jury instruction raising the prospect of Petrocelli's eventual parole,  had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict,  and therefore was not harmless. The 9th Circuit returned the case to Nevada's state courts, which can resentence Petrocelli or open a new penalty hearing. The case is Petrocelli v. Baker, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-99006.

Judge Eric Long of the U.S. District Court in Urbana, Illinois, denied bail to Brendt Christensen, 28, who was arrested last week in Champaign, Illinois, on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of Yingying Zhang, 26, on June 9, according to the court clerk's office. Christensen's attorney, Evan Bruno, could not be reached Wednesday but said earlier that his client was presumed innocent of the charges. He has not yet been indicted. A preliminary hearing is set for July 14. No body has been found but authorities believe Zhang is dead, although they have not disclosed why. Zhang was recorded by surveillance video on June 9 waiting for a bus and then getting in a black car when a motorist pulled up to the bus stop. Police connected the car to Christensen and he first told investigators he did not recall his whereabouts on that day. Later he said he picked up an Asian female and then dropped her off a few blocks later. Federal agents then put Christensen under surveillance and heard him  explaining  that he kidnapped Zhang, although they did not disclose to whom he was speaking, according to court documents. A search of the suspect's cell phone also found he had visited a website that included threads on  perfect abduction fantasy  and  planning a kidnapping,  according to a criminal complaint. Zhang, a scholar in photosynthesis and crop productivity, came to the University of Illinois several months ago. The case shook the Chinese community at the university, which draws thousands of students from China. Zhang's father and other family members travelled from China to join in the search. Her case has garnered news coverage in China. People holding signs of support for Zhang have gathered at the courthouse for Christensen's appearances.

The company said sales at stores open for at least 12 months rose 1.7 percent, compared with its forecast of an increase of 3 percent to 5 percent. Analysts on average were expecting O'Reilly's quarterly same-store sales to rise about 4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Romanian went into last month's Roland Garros final against then 47th-ranked Jelena Ostapenko as the overwhelming favorite to win the French Open title. When she was a set and 3-0 up, it seemed as if she was minutes away from becoming the first Romanian to win a grand slam crown since her manager Virginia Ruzici in Paris in 1978. Yet, astonishingly, Ostapenko blew a hole into that theory, and into Halep's psyche, by belting winners from the baseline to become the first Latvian to win a major. The defeat hurt - really, really badly.     I watched the final after few days (at) home,  said Halep following her 7-5 6-3 second-round win at Wimbledon over Brazilian Beatriz Haddad Maia.   Of course, I would change something if I have to repeat the match, that final. To be more aggressive when I was leading.   But to be honest, I'm not thinking any more of that match because I was suffering about that result. It's already gone,  added Halep, who finished runner-up in Paris for the second time in four years.   I'm here. I'm just trying to make another chance, to go to the end of the tournament.  To add to her woes, the Paris meltdown also denied her a chance to become world number one. Halep is once again in the mix to claim that coveted ranking at the end of Wimbledon but after her Paris heartache, she does not want to think too far ahead.  I'm not thinking about (being number one). I had some chances also in the final in French Open but I didn't get it. Of course, it's a nice goal for me to get the No. 1, but it's not easy,  said Halep, who will next face China's Peng Shuai. In keeping with her policy to stay as stress-free as possible during her pursuit of a maiden Wimbledon title, Halep has rented a house within walking distance of the All England Club to save herself the commute of traveling in from the tournament's official hotel in central London.  It's first time when I stay here in the village. I have a house, very nice house. I'm just chilling,  she said.  I had some bread with Nutella in the morning. This is my dessert for this tournament,  she added with a smile. Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-halep-idUSKBN19Q2ZP"},

For the second match running the 13th seed's level fluctuated wildly but she finally made her extra firepower count to see off the Canadian as darkness descended on Court 12. Fans could have been excused for wondering what all the fuss was about as Ostapenko, who blazed to the Roland Garros title last month, flailed forehands high and wide and into the net in a scrappy first set against her fellow 20-year-old. The Latvian was three points from defeat in the second set tiebreak but world number 142 Abanda wavered with a nervy double-fault and Ostapenko seized her chance to level the match. Yet more unforced errors handed Abanda a 2-0 lead in the deciding set but a fired-up Ostapenko won six of the last seven games to move through to a clash with unseeded Italian Camila Giorgi who knocked out big-hitting American Madison Keys.  I wasn't very happy with the way I played but I'm happy that I could fight and win,  Ostapenko told reporters.  From 3-3 in the third set I played how I play normally.  Ostapenko stunned the tennis world when she beat experienced Romanian Simona Halep in the French Open final with a memorable display of fearless hitting - racking up 54 winners. It booked her an appointment with the Latvian president Raimonds Vejonis and had former American great Chris Evert proclaiming the birth of the sport's next star. Yet there is still a rawness about her game and errors are never far away. On Wednesday her balance sheet was alarmingly in the red throughout a match against a player she had lost to twice when competing on the junior circuit. She ended the contest with 31 winners and 39 errors - 20 of which flowed off her racket in the opening set. The willowy Abanda, playing in her first Wimbledon, looked in danger of being knocked off her feet by Ostapenko's fierce strokes at times, but she weathered the storm and her steady approach paid dividends as Ostapenko self-destructed. She moved into a 5-2 lead doing little more than making sure she kept the ball in play and although Ostapenko crept back to 5-4 the Latvian sent a backhand wide to lose the opener. Ostapenko, watched by mother and coach Jelena and Spanish WTA player Annibel Medina Garrigues, who she works with, took a 3-1 lead in the second set, was pegged back to 3-3 before breaking to love to lead 5-4, only to drop serve again. Abanda, playing some elegant tennis, led 4-3 in the tiebreak but double-faulted. Ostapenko let out a frightening roar when she put a volley away to take it. Eventually her extra quality shone through and while there are clearly areas that need to improved, namely a second serve that begs to be whacked and a weak net game, she has already proved that on her day she can be almost unplayable.  People are expecting more from me but I just focus on my game,  she said.  I'm happy I'm in the third round (for the first time) and it's important to win when you don't play your best tennis.

A day after Britain’s biggest payment processor said it had received approaches from both Vantiv and JPMorgan, the company plumped for the former’s offer of nearly $10 billion in a mix of cash and shares. That took the shine off the share price of both the buyer and its target. Perhaps because the deal only makes sense with some very charitable assumptions. If the acquisition goes ahead, Worldpay investors will receive 55 pence for each share they own as well as 0.0672 new Vantiv shares. The total package is worth a fifth more than Worldpay’s June 30 closing price of just under 315 pence and means that investors in the British company would own roughly 41 percent of the larger group. That’s decent but not quite as lofty as the 450 pence offer that several analysts said might be in the offing. Probably just as well from Vantiv’s point of view. Worldpay says the two boards have identified substantial potential savings but neither side has yet to produce any estimates. But to justify a premium of around $1.6 billion, they would need to make roughly $225 million of pre-tax cost savings per year, according to a Breakingviews calculation. Eliminating duplicated costs in the United States will no doubt play a central role, but even so the goal appears ambitious. There are a couple of other niggling concerns. One is why JPMorgan decided not to bid. Another is that Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker and his Worldpay peer, Philip Jansen, will jointly run the company. Such setups can be a recipe for conflicts and muddled visions. However, neither is as worrying as investors’ knee-jerk reaction to the deal. Vantiv shares fell as much as 5 percent from their previous close, before recovering slightly later. The less enthusiastic investors in the U.S. company are about the deal, the less appealing it becomes for those who own its British peer.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-worldpay-m-a-breakingviews-idUSKBN19Q2PH"},

Payments companies have become targets for credit card companies and banks seeking to capitalize on a switch from cash transactions to paying by smartphone or other mobile device, with Danish payment services firm Nets A/S (NETS.CO) revealing it had been approached by potential buyers. Shares in Worldpay (WPG.L) rose by nearly 28 percent on Tuesday when Britain's largest payments firm said it had received approaches from both Vantiv (VNTV.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N), which is Worldpay's corporate broker. The U.S. bank said that while it had shown a preliminary interest, it does not plan to make a rival bid.  Given the current price, strategic rationale for Vantiv and lack of significant EPS (earnings per share) accretion we believe it is unlikely other suitors will emerge at this point,  analysts at Cowen said following the announcement of the deal. Under the terms revealed on Wednesday, Vantiv will pay 55 pence in cash, 0.0672 of a new Vantiv share and a 5 pence cash dividend per Worldpay share, totaling 385 pence per share. Related CoverageVantiv sets punchy price on WorldpayAlthough this is an 18.9 percent premium to Worldpay's closing share price on Monday, it is below the 409.5 pence hit on Wednesday before the announcement, which comes only 20 months after Worldpay listed in London with a 4.8 billion pound price tag. Worldpay's stock was down 9.3 percent at 370 pence at 1425 GMT while Vantiv, which has a market capitalization of $12.3 billion, saw its shares fall 3.9 percent to $60.51.  Shareholders in the British firm will own about 41 percent of the new company, which will be run by Vantiv Chief Charles Drucker and Worldpay CEO Philip Jansen. Traders wait for news at the post where U.S. credit card technology firm Vantiv Inc is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 5, 2017.Brendan McDermidSet up in 1989, London-based Worldpay was spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) to private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent International in 2010. The firm employs 4,500 people, and says it processes around 31 million mobile, online and in-store transactions every day.  While banks have been trying to develop and buy more sophisticated technology, companies like PayPal (PYPL.O) and Worldpay have gained a large market share as consumers have adopted online shopping and cashless transactions. Global Appeal Slideshow (2 Images)Analysts say the most likely target is Worldpay's e-commerce business, especially outside the United States where Vantiv is largely focused. Worldpay says it supports 400,000 merchants in 126 currencies across 146 countries.   While Vantiv owns one of the most enviable U.S. acquiring businesses - over 30 percent of revenue from integrated channels - it has no exposure outside of North America,  Cowen analysts said.  Worldpay's e-commerce payments revenue, which accounts for more than a third of its total, rose by 21.7 percent to 386.6 million pounds in 2016, driven by new business wins and strength in its global retail and digital content units. Analysts at Berenberg said before the announcement that Vantiv - as well as JP Morgan, is suffering from excessive exposure to the offline U.S. market.  The acquisition of Worldpay would give them international e-commerce capabilities that they would be able to cross-sell to their U.S. client base.  Increased exposure to the United States would also help Worldpay, which reported a lower than expected rise in 2016 revenue, hurt by weakness in its American business which accounts for more than a quarter of its revenue..  Worldpay would gain scale in the U.S. market, a geography where frankly the company has floundered relative to rivals,  Cowen analysts said. $1 = 0.7740 pounds","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-worldpay-m-a-vantiv-inc-idUSKBN19Q1JK"},

André Rocha, head of the National Sugar and Ethanol Council, said the government will issue a presidential decree to implement the program, called RenovaBio.  He said a decision was reached on the strategy for the new legislation after a meeting on Tuesday gathering industry representatives and high-level government officials.  That is the fastest way to put the program to work. A normal draft-bill would take years to get approved by the Congress,  said Rocha. A presidential decree takes effect immediately after its publication but needs to be voted in Congress within four months. The RenovaBio plan aims to cut carbon emissions by boosting use of biofuels, helping Brazil meet its pledge to cut heat-trapping gases under the Paris climate agreement. According to the program, ethanol and biodiesel mills would issue certificates of emissions reductions (CERs) that would be transferred to fuel distributors when they buy the biofuels. Each distributor would be required to hold a certain number of CERs at the end of a year, according to mandates that would be set by the government. The system is expected to create a secondary market for the certificates, possibly at local stock exchange B3, since fuel distributors that do not have enough certificates would have to buy them to fulfill their annual mandates. RenovaBio is seen by sugar and ethanol experts as a lifeline to mills in Brazil struggling to compete with cheaper gasoline and diesel in local market.

Qatar earlier in the day accused Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt of  clear aggression  and said the accusations cited when they severed ties a month ago  were clearly designed to create anti-Qatar sentiment in the West . The four Arab nations accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and allying with regional foe Iran, which Doha denies. Their foreign ministers met in Cairo on Wednesday after a deadline they gave Qatar to meet 13 demands expired. They had been expected to consider further sanctions at the gathering, but announced no new measures.  The response the four states got was overall negative and lacked any content. We find it did not provide a basis for Qatar to retreat from its policies,  Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said, reading out a joint statement after the meeting.  The political and economic boycott will continue until Qatar changes its policies for the better,  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference. Qatar's response to the demands has not been made public.  The United Arab Emirates' minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said in a tweet that Qatar faced  greater isolation, incremental measures and reputational damage  if it did not heed the demands.  For any real discussion with Doha to gain traction, it has to be responsible for past actions and recognize the necessity of changing course. The message from Cairo is zero tolerance for terrorism, (a) powerful message from Arab world to international community. Qatar can't miss the bus,  Gargash said. Shoukry later told an Egyptian privately-owned broadcaster that the demands were non-negotiable.  The matter from the beginning was not up for negotiations ... there is no middle ground,  he told the On television channel. The foreign ministers said they would meet again soon in the  Bahraini capital, Manama, but gave no date. Intelligence chiefs from the four countries also met in Cairo on Tuesday night, officials said.

The Arab countries have demanded Qatar curtail its support for the Muslim Brotherhood, shut down the pan-Arab al Jazeera  satellite TV channel, close a Turkish military base and downgrade its relations with rival Iran. Turkey, the biggest regional power to stand by Qatar, has sent to Doha 100 cargo planes with supplies since its neighbors cut air and sea links. It has also rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Doha.  Two contingents of Turkish troops with columns of armored vehicles have arrived since the crisis erupted on June 5. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday dismissed calls for closure of the base and said the list of Arab demands amounted to an unlawful intervention against Qatari sovereignty. Saudi Arabia's Jubeir said he hoped Turkey would stay neutral and Egypt's Shoukry rejected any non-Arab interference. Qatar along with Turkey backed a Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt before it was overthrown in 2013. The Arab states have demanded Qatar sever any links to the Brotherhood and other groups they deem to be terrorist, ideological or sectarian. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and Bahraini Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa attend a press conference after their meeting that discussed the diplomatic situation with Qatar, in Cairo, Egypt July 5, 2017.Khaled Elfiqi/PoolEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump by telephone about Qatar, Sisi's office said on Wednesday.  The visions of the two presidents on dealing with current regional crises were in line, especially when it comes to reaching political settlements which contribute to regional security and stability,  Sisi's office said in a statement. Trump has voiced concern to both sides. Qatar, a small peninsular country protruding into the Gulf, hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the region as a bulwark against Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday, a State Department official said. Shoukry said Trump's call had not affected the statement coming from the foreign ministers. The Qatari foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, told a session of London's Chatham House think-tank that Doha was continuing to call for dialogue to settle the dispute. He said that this was  despite the separation of 12,000 families, despite the siege that is a clear aggression and an insult to all international treaties, bodies and jurisdictions.  Slideshow (17 Images)Qatar Girds for Long Stalemate He suggested Qatar, the world's biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and second largest gas exporter after Russia, was preparing for a more protracted rift.  What we've done in the last few weeks is develop different alternative for ways to ensure the supply chain for the country not to be cut off.  Qatar announced on Tuesday that it planned to raise LNG production capacity by 30 percent in the next five years.  Company and industry sources told Reuters that the West's three biggest energy firms are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas output, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in the dispute. Qatar has invested heavily in infrastructure projects in Western countries and works closely with the United States and other allies on Syria's civil war.  Reading between the lines, the blockading countries (are) demanding that we have to surrender our sovereignty to end the siege, something which ... Qatar will never do,  Sheikh Mohammed said. Responding to the accusation that it has drawn too close to Iran, he said Doha had to live alongside Tehran since the two states shared an offshore gas field. Gulf newspapers close to their governments appeared also to see little prospect of any immediate deal. The editor of the Abu Dhabi government-linked al-Ittihad newspaper wrote that Qatar, with a population of two million compared to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, was  walking alone in its dreams and illusions, far away from its Gulf Arab brothers . Qatari officials say the Gulf states' demands are so stiff they suspect they were never seriously meant for negotiation. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, on a tour of Gulf countries, said he was cautiously optimistic the feuding states would reach a solution once they had talks.  But it is also possible that it will continue to be difficult for some days,  he told reporters in Kuwait where he met with the Gulf state's ruler who is mediating in the crisis. Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa said any decision on ending Qatar's membership of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) would come from the GCC itself and that such a measure would be considered when it next met.

Recent tepid economic data and an inflation rate below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target may have a bearing on the U.S. central bank's plans for interest rate hikes. New orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in May, data showed on Wednesday, but capital equipment orders were slightly stronger than previously reported, suggesting manufacturing remains on a path of moderate growth. Fed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it will affect the future pace of rate increases, according to minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting on June 13-14.

Researchers focused on what's known as body contouring surgery, which can range from a little bit of liposuction to a complete upper or lower body lift that removes substantial amounts of tissue. Body contouring is becoming more common, particularly for patients who lose around half of their weight after bariatric surgery and have substantial amounts of tissue hanging from their arms, legs and bellies that prevent them from looking and feeling like they want after shedding all those excess pounds.  The obvious direct reason for a patient to seek body contouring surgery is to get rid of a tummy apron and some fat rolls, but when we look a little deeper into why patients are willing to undertake expensive and sometimes risky procedures, some other reasons emerge,  said senior study author Dr. Stefan Danilla, a plastic surgeon at Hospital Clinico Universidad de Chile in Santiago.   Our research shows that the right procedure can improve self-esteem, self-image, sex life, social performance and physical symptoms,  Danilla said by email.  That improvement is shown as soon as three months after surgery and can last for years after.  For the study, researchers asked 112 women patients who had already undergone weight-loss surgery how they felt about their body and quality of life before they got body contouring procedures. Then, researchers followed up with 57 of these patients about four months afterwards and checked in with 84 of the women again more than two years after they got body contouring done. The patients averaged about 40 years old at the start of the study and most of them were at a healthy weight or slightly overweight.  To assess participants' quality of life, researchers asked them about body satisfaction, sex life, self-esteem, social performance and physical symptoms. Scores could range from 0 to 100, with higher marks indicating greater quality of life.  Women's average quality of life scores rose from 44 before body contouring to 86 in short-term assessments done from one to nine months after these procedures. They had a similar improvement in quality of life score of 84 in assessments done from one year to 2.7 years postoperatively, researchers report in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal. The primary shortcoming of the study is the lack of male participants, the authors note. Only two men at the hospital where the study was done had body contouring procedures during the period when researchers were asking patients to join the study, and both men declined to participate.  Another limitation is that the results are limited to one hospital in Chile, and the impact of body contouring on quality of life might be different elsewhere, especially because many of women's perceptions about their appearance are shaped by what's culturally acceptable or desirable where they live.   Researchers also lacked data on how any surgical complications might impact the extent to which women perceived body contouring as beneficial for their quality of life. Even so, body contouring may appeal to many patients who are surprised or disappointed to discover they don't necessarily look thin or conform with an ideal body type after weight loss surgery helps them shed most of their excess pounds, said Dr. Daniel Kalbermatten, a plastic surgeon at University Hospital Basel in Switzerland who wasn't involved in the study.   Often they lost many pounds but look worse and not at all as before weight gain,  Kalbermatten said by email.  It helps them find themselves.

I have been already talking about this point to some of the people in the WTA,  Azarenka said after reaching the third round at Wimbledon on Wednesday with a straight sets defeat of 15th seed Elena Vesnina.  From my own power, I'll do anything to make that happen, because I think it's really important.   The guys do have that luxury of having the nurseries and stuff at every event, and I think it's time for women to have the same benefit. For women, it's more important and harder,  added the Belarusian, who faces Britain's Heather Watson next. Creches are not mandatory facilities on the WTA Tour, although all the grand slam events cater for players traveling with young children and Wimbledon's was upgraded in 2015. The WTA does provide support for players who want to continue their careers after having children.  From a health care perspective, the WTA provide via Sport Sciences and Medicine and Athlete Assistance physical and psychological health and wellbeing support and services,  it said in a statement.  This includes attention to the special musculoskeletal, physiological and psychosocial needs of pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding mothers, including educational information, and specialized women's health physiotherapy and counseling services, if needed.  Judy Murray, mother of world number one Andy, has also thrown her support behind better child facilities.  It's not every player that has the money to employ an entourage of nannies.

The rare setback for Keytruda sent Merck shares more than 1 percent lower. Merck has been on a roll with the medicine, jumping to the front of the pack of companies with new immuno-oncology drugs, particularly after Keytruda extended survival as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) had been the perceived leader in the field until last year, when its Opdivo failed to match Keytruda's lung cancer success. Merck last month said it had stopped enrolling patients in the trials testing Keytruda in combination with standard multiple myeloma regimens including Celgene Corp (CELG.O) drugs. The decision was taken after independent safety monitors observed more deaths in patients receiving the Keytruda combination than in the control groups in two of the studies. The FDA said based on available data the risks of combining Keytruda with either of the Celgene medicines outweigh any potential benefit for patients with multiple myeloma. The trials were testing Keytruda with either Revlimid or Pomalyst and dexamethasone against the regimens without Keytruda. All patients who were receiving Keytruda in combination with a Celgene drug will no longer take the Merck drug. The clinical hold does not apply to other studies with Keytruda, Merck said. The drug, which helps the immune system fight cancer by blocking a protein tumors use to avoid detection, is currently being tested in hundreds of combination trials in a wide variety of cancers. So far, Keytruda is only approved for one type of blood cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma. But Merck has had a string of successes in solid tumor cancers with approvals for advanced melanoma, advanced bladder cancer and a type of head and neck cancer, in addition to lung. In May, Keytruda became the first cancer drug to win U.S.  approval based on a patient's specific genetic traits, regardless of where in the body the disease originated, known as microsatellite instability-high cancer.

The Democratic-controlled House on Thursday will attempt to overturn Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's vetoes of spending and tax increase measures aimed at ending the state's unprecedented two-year budget impasse. Moody's said it placed Illinois' Baa3 rating, which is one step above the junk level, on review for a possible downgrade.  The $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion income tax increase passed by lawmakers over the extended Fourth of July holiday weekend, may fall short in addressing the state's financial woes, particularly its huge unfunded pension liability and $15 billion unpaid bill backlog, according to Moody's.  On both those fronts, it's not yet clear if the legislation being enacted will have a substantial and clear positive effect,  said Moody's analyst Ted Hampton. Related CoveragePossible Illinois budget fix poses big financial questionsA stalemate between the Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two-straight fiscal years. Since fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, the House and Senate in bipartisan votes passed budget bills to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Rauner vetoed the bills on Tuesday only to have that action quickly overridden by the Senate, leaving the fate of the budget in the hands of the House.  Prior to Moody's announcement, Rauner said his Democratic opponents should prioritize the opinions of Illinois residents over credit ratings agencies. “Don’t listen to some Wall Street firm,” Rauner told reporters Wednesday at a Chicago event. “That’s not what matters.” The governor also said he is working to sustain his vetoes.  I can tell you this, we are doing everything we can to push that my veto is not overridden,  he said.  He lashed out at those who defied his wishes by voting for the Democrats' budget package, including 15 House Republicans.  What we have is a continuing failure by elected officials in Springfield on both sides of the aisle that’s been led by Speaker Madigan for 35 years,” Rauner said, referring to House Speaker Michael Madigan. “The system is broken.” House Republican Leader Jim Durkin told Reuters that he and Rauner are attempting to persuade House Republicans supporters of the Democratic tax hike to reconsider their votes because “there’s a better deal to be had.” But Durkin stopped short of predicting the overrides could be blocked. “I think the Democrats, if they want to get it done, find the votes,” Durkin said. “I’ve seen this before.” Durkin said he had no plans to take punitive actions against those Republicans for their votes, but predicted “it’s definitely a possibility” some will face primary challenges from the Republican Party’s anti-tax wing in the 2018 elections. Illinois has relied on court-ordered and state-mandated spending to keep operating. The absence of a fiscal 2018 budget shuttered major transportation projects and forced the state out of the lucrative Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries.

Brent crude futures settled down $1.82, or 3.7 percent, at $47.79 a barrel. Prices had climbed for eight straight sessions to Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.94, or 4.12 percent, to settle at $45.13 a barrel.  It's a transition from being overbought for a while,  said Tyche Capital Advisors senior research analyst John Macaluso.  I really don't think it's too much fundamentals driving the move today - seems more like a reversal of the trend. Eventually someone comes out of the market and everyone follows and you have to take profits.  Prices pared losses in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude inventories fell 5.8 million barrels in the week to June 30 to 503.7 million barrels, exceeding forecasts for a draw of 2.3 million barrels. The API data, normally released Tuesday, was delayed by the U.S. Fourth of July holiday. Official data from the U.S. Department of Energy is due on Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), also delayed a day. Oil traders hope vacationing motorists heading for the beach in July will help U.S. gasoline demand heat up along with sweltering summer temperatures, helping drain crude inventories. Oil exports by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries climbed for a second month in June, Thomson Reuters Oil Research data showed. OPEC exported 25.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, up 450,000 bpd from May and 1.9 million bpd more than a year earlier. The rise came despite OPEC's vow to rein in production until March 2018 and came on the heels of Reuters' monthly OPEC production survey which found output jumped to a 2017 high last month as Nigeria and Libya continued to pump more. Both OPEC members are exempt from the output cut deal. Russia, which led other non-OPEC producers to join the deal, would oppose any proposal for deeper cuts at OPEC ministerial meeting later this month, Bloomberg reported, citing four Russian government officials.  The air is getting thin for oil prices. The price increase just ran out of steam, which is not very surprising, given the news flow of rising OPEC supplies,  said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodity analyst at Commerzbank. Another analyst said the strong dollar provided less incentive to invest in greenback-denominated commodities such as crude oil. The dollar pared some early gains but remained near a one-week high. The head of the International Energy Agency told Reuters that rising output from key oil producers could hamper expectations that the oil market would rebalance in the second half of the year. Saxo Bank cut its year-end Brent crude price forecast to $53 a barrel from $58. Yet traders and analysts pointed to some technical signs that could lead to a recovery.  The longer term moving average systems need stronger moves over $51.50 in Brent and $49 to $49.50 in WTI which is where the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are,  said Scott Shelton, broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina.  Spending more time up here to get the shorter term moving averages to cross would also generate buying.

Following a lackluster 6-3 6-4 6-3 defeat by Germany's Mischa Zverev on Tuesday, Tomic detailed his struggles to stay motivated.  It's a roller-coaster and I just can't seem to find the commitment to work hard, to enjoy, and to lift trophies,  he told reporters.  The last two years, nothing motivates.  Wasn't mentally and physically there to perform. I don't know why, but I felt a little bit bored out there to be completely honest with you.  His comments irked a number of ex-players including Martina Navratilova who said it was time he looked for a new job, and six-times grand slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs said Tomic was an embarrassment to himself and to Australian tennis. But Wilander, in London leading Eurosport's coverage of Wimbledon, said on Wednesday Tomic was only saying out loud what many players feel.  Everybody jumped on one or two sentences, that is all. But he is just trying to explain how he feels... what is going on. I guarantee you every single player here at Wimbledon feels or has felt like Tomic is saying he feels,  the Swede said.  I really appreciate that he was honest about it.  Former world number one Wilander, who says he experienced similar losses of motivation during his career, believes more honesty is needed to confront these issues.  We need more honesty out there, but it is hard when you see what the media does to someone who is trying to be honest,  he said.  Are you saying that Andy Murray was not emotionally flat for some of this year? And I think it is exactly how Novak Djokovic was at the French Open.  Everybody gets bored or rather emotionally flat sometimes, but most players are not so honest as Tomic. They have sponsors that need to be happy, and they want to keep the tour happy.  Tomic is young, only 24, but already this is his eighth or ninth Wimbledon. People need to realize that this is a tough, tough individual sport.  If you don't get tired or bored then there is something wrong with you - you are not human. People maybe don't realize that.  Players try to hide it and try to be the perfect role model, but it is not always so easy.

But there was no happy ending for the Czech, whose bid to repeat her triumphs in 2011 and 2014, ended with a second-round loss to 95th-ranked American Madison Brengle on Wednesday. Kvitova was listed as one of the tournament favorites, largely due to her triumph in Birmingham last month in her second tournament back after an attacker, in her home in the Czech Republic, left her with badly damaged tendons in her left hand. But the player, who needed four hours of surgery and spent three months without even touching a racket, says she never bought into the hype and conceded she had struggled physically in her  6-3 1-6 6-2 loss to Brengle.  My body just didn't really do the best, unfortunately,  she said.   But I was really trying. I fight, but I could just not breathe and I was feeling a bit sick,  she added.  That sometimes happens. Unfortunately it happened at Wimbledon, which is not nice. It was just tough for me to still have the energy to play my aggressive game.  Kvitova said it proved the bookmakers had been wrong. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 5, 2017   Czech Republic's Petra Kvitova in action during her second round match against USA's Madison BrengleAndrew Couldridge I said before that I didn't really feel the favorite of the tournament and I didn't really think about the title here,  she said.  In Birmingham maybe it was a fairytale but I still have to work hard. The six months is missing. I need to play more matches. I need to practice a lot, as well,  she said. Slideshow (5 Images)Now Kvitova is hoping to get back to her traditional preparation schedule ahead of August's U.S. Open.  It was a difficult six months. It took a lot of energy, as well, and emotionally was tough,  she said.  But now, I should practice as I did before. I still probably will have an eye on the hand but otherwise I think it's getting better. I need to see the hand specialist once again,  added the 27-year-old. A hugely popular personality on the women's tour, Kvitova was able to put her loss in perspective.  No one knows how hard I had to work to be back, so probably that makes it feel more disappointing than normally it is,  she said.  It's been great to be here again. It was my goal to play this event this year, and that's what I did. But I feel sad that I have to leave so early.

The National Energy Board (NEB) commissioned the report to improve the equality of pipeline parts after TransCanada Corp and Enbridge Inc discovered that some parts they were using were substandard. Currently, operators often have to provide additional specifications for parts because standards are too low, placing them at a disadvantage, according to the report, which was provided to Reuters ahead of its public release.  This creates an uneven playing field where pipeline operators with comprehensive specifications are placed in an uncompetitive position due to higher procurement costs,  the report read. Canada, home to the world's third-largest oil reserves, relies heavily on pipelines, making it imperative for them to be secure. Policies should be developed  to ensure pipeline-operator quality strategies are transferred to all parties in the supply chain,  according to the paper. While the report's recommendations are not binding, NEB chief engineer Iain Colquhoun told Reuters this week the regulator's push for higher standards for manufacturers will ensure pipeline operators do not need to outline comprehensive additional specifications.  We'll absolutely level the playing field,  he said. The higher standards would apply to all manufacturers who provide parts to Canadian pipeline operators, including South Korea's TK Corp and Italy's Valvitalia Sp (IPO-VALIT.MI), which had provided some substandard parts to TransCanada and Enbridge, according to the NEB. TransCanada, which was among companies represented at an NEB workshop last week on quality assurance for pipeline parts, said it will use conclusions from the event to bolster its quality management program. Enbridge, TK Corp and Valvitalia did not respond to requests for comment. The Canadian Energy Pipelines Association, which includes TransCanada and Enbridge, said it is possible that manufacturers could still pass on some costs of the higher standards. But operators will not be heavily affected as they can make the money back through the lifecycle of their pipelines, CEPA said. Colquhoun said possible new measures for quality assurance include more standardization of manufacturing methods and training for certain employees of pipeline operators. The report recommended changes that also include more disclosures and tracking of materials from manufacturers. The NEB will decide on detailed measures this year. It could take up to 2023 for changes to be adopted formally by the external standards association, but the regulator will take action if quality assurance issues demand immediate attention, Colquhoun said.

Navarro-Valls, a Spaniard who had degrees in medicine and  psychiatry before becoming a journalist, had been suffering from cancer. He died in Rome. In 1984 Pope John Paul named Navarro-Valls, a layman, to be Vatican spokesman and gave him direct access to his inner circle to a degree that no papal spokesman had before or has had since. The photogenic Navarro-Valls became a celebrity in his own right, a global media personality often appearing on television to explain Catholic teachings in simple language.  Joaquin Navarro-Valls embodied what Ernest Hemingway defined as courage: grace under pressure,  said Greg Burke, the current Vatican spokesman. Navarro-Valls hardly ever lost his composure during his nearly 22 years at the side of John Paul, including during the twice daily medical briefings as the pope lay dying in the Vatican Apostolic Palace and the world waited. The one exception was when a reporter asked him to put aside the medical details and explain how he felt as a person. Navarro became choked up and held back tears before millions watching on television. For more than two decades the Polish-born Pope John Paul, his priest-secretary Stanislaw Dziwisz, and Navarro became a de-facto triumvirate in the Vatican. FILE PHOTO: The Pope's official spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls gestures during a news conference in the Holy See press office at the Vatican April 16, 2005.Tony Gentile/File PhotoHis privileged access to the pope irritated some cardinals in the Vatican administration, who had to wait in line. He occasionally took action without clearing it with the Secretariat of State, the Vatican's key administrative department. But such was his friendship with the pope that he always emerged from controversy unscathed. On one such occasion in the mid 1990s he decided that the Vatican could no longer keep quiet about the pope's evidently failing health and disclosed that the pontiff was suffering from Parkinson's disease. Pope John Paul also occasionally used Navarro for sensitive missions, bypassing the Vatican's own diplomats. In 1998 he went to Cuba to negotiate directly with Fidel Castro to iron out last-minute snags over Pope John Paul's historic visit. During an all-night conversation punctuated by cigars and rum, Navarro-Valls convinced Castro to restore Christmas as a national holiday. It had been suppressed after the revolution. After John Paul's death in 2005, Navarro-Valls stayed on as spokesman for Pope Benedict for more than a year to help his transition and then left Vatican service. Until his health began failing he was a director of a Rome hospital and medical school run by the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, of which he was a member.

Jana founder and managing partner Barry Rosenstein wrote in a letter to EQT's board of directors that the company was overpaying for Rice Energy and that the activist hedge fund's proposal would deliver more value. Jana disclosed a 5.8 percent stake in EQT on Monday, saying that it believed EQT shares were undervalued and it would vote against the Rice Energy deal.  EQT announced on June 19 that it would buy Rice for $6.7 billion in cash and stock, which would create the largest U.S. natural gas producer at a time when American energy firms are pumping in money to develop facilities in gas-rich states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.  A Rice acquisition would result in EQT paying away more than the value of the transaction synergies, the majority of which are questionable,  Rosenstein said in the letter, which was disclosed in a securities filing. The Rice deal would give away $1 billion in EQT shareholder value, according to the hedge fund, which also questions the assumed $2.5 billion of cost synergies in the Rice Energy deal that EQT envisions can be achieved. When asked about the Jana letter, EQT said it stands by its Monday statement that the company seeks to maintain an open dialogue with investors and respects their opinions. Rice declined to comment.  EQT has also said that there is a sum-of-the-parts discount associated with the company's valuation, which could be addressed by separating its pipeline operations. EQT said it has committed to evaluating options and devising a plan to address this discount by the end of 2018. Under the Rice Energy deal, EQT's pipeline arm, EQT Midstream Partners LP (EQM.N), would ultimately assume Rice Energy's pipelines. Analysts at Mizuho Securities estimate these Rice Energy pipeline assets to be worth around $1.3 billion. Among Jana's concerns is that extracting the maximum amount of value from the Rice combination would take too long.   If EQT were to consummate this (Rice Energy) transaction, the company would potentially be required to put off a separation for two years to avoid 'built-in' tax gains for certain Rice assets that would be part of a spinoff,  Rosenstein wrote in the letter. U.S. tax rules penalize companies that acquire assets and then spin them within a two-year window.

The photogenic Navarro-Valls became a celebrity in his own right, a global media personality often appearing on television to explain Catholic teachings in simple language.  Joaquin Navarro-Valls embodied what Ernest Hemingway defined as courage: grace under pressure,  said Greg Burke, the current Vatican spokesman. Navarro-Valls hardly ever lost his composure during his nearly 22 years at the side of John Paul, including during the twice daily medical briefings as the pope lay dying in the Vatican Apostolic Palace and the world waited. The one exception was when a reporter asked him to put aside the medical details and explain how he felt as a person. Navarro became choked up and held back tears before millions watching on television. For more than two decades the Polish-born Pope John Paul, his priest-secretary Stanislaw Dziwisz, and Navarro became a de-facto triumvirate in the Vatican.

He occasionally took action without clearing it with the Secretariat of State, the Vatican's key administrative department. But such was his friendship with the pope that he always emerged from controversy unscathed. On one such occasion in the mid 1990s he decided that the Vatican could no longer keep quiet about the pope's evidently failing health and disclosed that the pontiff was suffering from Parkinson's disease. Pope John Paul also occasionally used Navarro for sensitive missions, bypassing the Vatican's own diplomats. In 1998 he went to Cuba to negotiate directly with Fidel Castro to iron out last-minute snags over Pope John Paul's historic visit. During an all-night conversation punctuated by cigars and rum, Navarro-Valls convinced Castro to restore Christmas as a national holiday. It had been suppressed after the revolution. After John Paul's death in 2005, Navarro-Valls stayed on as spokesman for Pope Benedict for more than a year to help his transition and then left Vatican service. Until his health began failing he was a director of a Rome hospital and medical school run by the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, of which he was a member.

The IPO, the latest in a series of reforms and privatizations pursued by President Michel Temer's administration to bolster investment in Brazil's aging infrastructure, would come after the sale of some of Infraero's existing airports to private companies. Quintella said in an interview that a final decision on the process and whether it would result in handing over control of Infraero to private investors should be reached by the end of this month. Local media reported earlier this week that the government could downsize or even eliminate Infraero, with officials at odds over whether to dispose of all its stakes in 56 airports. The sale would provide badly needed revenue to the federal government, which has seen tax collection lag official forecasts as Latin America's largest economy has recovered at a slower-than-expected pace. Quintella said the government was also finalizing a plan to invest over 50 billion reais ($15.2 billion) in infrastructure projects, which could be announced as soon as next week. The so-called  Avançar , or  Advance  program would direct more than 20 billion reais to transportation ventures, Quintella said, as the government doubles down on efforts to bolster the fragile economic recovery. The program would entail investments of around 16 billion reais in highways, 1 billion reais in railroads, 1.79 billion reais in ports, 820 million reais in public airports and 400 million reais in waterways. It would replace an existing infrastructure investment plan put in place by former President Dilma Rousseff in 2007 when she was chief of staff under leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Economists have said the program had little effect on growth and weighed on public finances as Brazil's economy slipped into its deepest recession in decades. Rousseff and center-right Temer have slashed its budget repeatedly in recent years to try to curb ballooning public debt and regain investors' trust.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and allying with regional foe Iran, charges Doha denies, and have cut diplomatic and commercial ties. At a meeting in Cairo on Wednesday the four nations' foreign ministers refrained from slapping further sanctions on Qatar but voiced disappointment at Doha's failure to comply with their 13 demands after the expiry of the deadline.  When it comes to this list of 13 items ... it's not acceptable under any circumstances,  Erdogan said in an interview with France 24 television.  Some of the terms were tantamount to  stripping  Qatar of its statehood, he added.  Among their demands is for Qatar to end an accord under which Turkey maintains a military base in the Gulf state.   We remain loyal to our agreement with Qatar. If it requests us to leave, we will not stay where we are not wanted,  he said through an interpreter, adding there had been no such request. Turkey, the most powerful regional country to stand by Qatar, has sent 100 cargo planes with supplies since its neighbors cut air and sea links. It has also rushed through legislation to send more troops to the military base in Doha. Two contingents of Turkish troops with columns of armored vehicles have arrived since the crisis erupted on June 5. Kurds Erdogan, who was speaking ahead of the G20 leaders summit in Hamburg later this week, also took a swipe at the United States saying its arming of  terrorist  Kurdish groups would backfire and that it would be impossible for Washington to recover heavy weapons as it has promised to do so. He also said Ankara was ready to carry out ground operations in northern Syria against Kurdish forces if it felt threatened. The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near Kurdish-held areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a  declaration of war  which could trigger clashes within days.  If there is a threat against us, our troops will conduct any operations with the Free Syria Army on the ground,  Erdogan said when asked whether Turkey was prepared to intervene against the Kurds.  Elsewhere in Syria, Erdogan said he was optimistic on the implementation of de-escalation zones that are under discussion in the Kazakh capital Astana with Russia and Iran. He said he would discuss the next steps with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the G20 summit in Germany.  Erdogan added that he hoped the Astana talks would pave the way for political negotiations under U.N. auspices in Geneva, but said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had no future in the country. Russia and Iran are both allies of Assad.  Of course he has to leave,  Erdogan said.  Those who want Assad to remain are still going after their interests in Syria.

The study found no evidence that so-called fire-safe cigarettes reduced the number of fires overall or fires started by cigarettes in the states where they were mandated, leaving the jury still out on whether these laws are a good way to protect people, the authors report in Injury Prevention.  “Smoking-related fires are one of the most common causes of death due to fires in the United States, and fire safe cigarettes are an interesting and innovative way to combat this problem,” lead author Dr. Carl Bonander told Reuters Health in an email. “The enforcement of fire safety standards on cigarettes seems to be commonplace in many parts of the world today, but the evidence regarding the effects on fire mortality seemed quite ambiguous,” said Bonander, a researcher with the Department of Environmental and Life Sciences at Karlstad University in Sweden. Bonander and colleagues used data from several sources to examine the implementation of fire-safe cigarette laws in the U.S. By 2012, all 50 states had some sort of fire safe cigarette laws in place. “Generally, the laws mandate that cigarettes must pass a test where the cigarette is lit and placed on a filter paper substrate. Conventional cigarettes will usually burn their full length in this test, while fire safe (or more formally, reduced ignition propensity) cigarettes will self-extinguish before that,” Bonander said. To comply with the fire safety standards, a brand must extinguish more than 75 percent of the time under repeated testing, said Bonander. In real-world conditions, however, there is evidence that these fire-safe cigarettes can ignite sofas or mattresses just as easily as any other cigarette, the study team notes. Still, the researchers found some evidence of a reduction in deaths from fires caused by cigarettes after the laws were enacted. But when they adjusted for other factors and trends that might influence the number of deaths, the effect of fire-safe cigarette laws “disappeared,” the authors write.  “We find that the evidence regarding the effects of fire safe cigarette laws on fire mortality and cigarette-related fires is rather weak, which could indicate that they are not working as intended. It is not entirely clear whether this is due to the construction of the cigarettes themselves, or due to other circumstances surrounding the legislation,” Bonander said. Lorraine Carli, vice president of outreach and advocacy for the National Fire Protection Association in Quincy, Massachusetts, agrees that the study seems to conclude it is not possible to definitively state one way or another whether the fire-safe cigarettes are effective.   “Fire safe cigarettes are intended to reduce the likelihood of fires on upholstered furniture and bedding,” Carli told Reuters Health in an email. “Some studies indicate they are effective in these situations. There has been limited research so we will look to future studies to continue to chart impact.”  More evidence over time may yield more definitive results and some research has shown some positive results, said Carli, who was not involved in the study. According to the National Fire Protection Association, 610 Americans died due to cigarette-related fires in 2010, which was an all-time low since 1980. However, the number of smokers has gone down since the eighties and fire resistance standards have also gotten stricter over the years, the organization notes on its website (bit.ly/2sNoHSE).

The loonie had rallied in six of the seven previous sessions, boosted by rising expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates as early as next week.                   The rally in the Canadian dollar has been somewhat halted today  by the  jolt  to oil prices, said Darren Richardson, senior corporate dealer at CanadianForex.

The Sahel stretches coast to coast from Mauritania and Mali in the west to Sudan and Eritrea in the east, and skirts the southern edge of the Sahara desert. It is home to more than 100 million people.  The region has seen worsening extreme weather - including more frequent droughts - in recent years. But if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, the resulting global warming - of more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - could change major weather patterns in the Sahel, and in many different parts of the world, scientists say. Some weather models predict a small increase in rainfall for the Sahel, but there is a risk that the entire weather pattern will change by the end of the century, researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) said.  The sheer size of the possible change is mindboggling - this is one of the very few elements in the Earth system that we might witness tipping soon,  said co-author Anders Levermann from PIK and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of New York's Columbia University.  If the Sahel becomes much rainier, it will mean more water for agriculture, industry and domestic use. But in the first few years of the transition, people are likely to experience very erratic weather - extreme droughts followed by destructive floods, the researchers said.     This level of unpredictability makes it very hard for people to plan for coming changes, they said.  The enormous change that we might see would clearly pose a huge adaptation challenge to the Sahel,  said Levermann.   More than 100 million people are potentially affected that already now are confronted with a (multitude) of instabilities, including war,  he said.  The region faces a range of conflicts, including some driven by groups such as Boko Haram and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The researchers studied rainfall patterns in the months of July, August and September when the region receives most of its annual rain.  There's a range of possible outcomes for societies in the Sahel which depend on the climate that eventually (develops)... and whether they are prepared for fluctuations,  lead author Jacob Schewe, from PIK, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.          Climate change from burning fossil fuels  really has the power to shake things up , he said.  It is driving risks for crop yields in many regions and generally increases dangerous weather extremes around the globe,  he added.  The study was published on Wednesday in Earth System Dynamics, a journal of the European Geosciences Union.

The Swede, leading Eurosport's coverage of the grasscourt grand slam, says her second-round win over Donna Vekic could prove to be pivotal in her career.  Bigger than winning titles, bigger than other milestone wins... this could be the most important match of her career,  Wilander said.  Huge... just huge,  he added after her 7-6 4-6 10-8 win.  Centre Court was full, there was not one single seat available. This crowd was expecting her to win. The conditions were perfect, just a beautiful day.  All the conditions were there for her to choke. If she was going to choke, this was the day to do it. And she didn't - she delivered. This will give her huge confidence, and she will move up a level, really grow from this,  the seven-times grand slam champion added. On a searingly hot day in south-west London there could be no doubting that the British number one thoroughly deserved her win. She took everything her Croatian opponent threw at her, and came back time and time again with answers to all the problems she encountered in a more-than three-hour battle. Konta is looking to become the first British woman to win the Wimbledon singles since Virginia Wade in 1977, but there was no sign any pressure was getting to her. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 5, 2017   Great Britain's Johanna Konta in action during her second round match against Croatia’s Donna VekicTony O'Brien I'm approaching this event like I am every other event. I'm coming here to do the best that I can, to compete the best I can. I think I showed that today,  she told reporters. Show it she did, displaying an enviable armory. Wilander said her serve was key and could make all the difference to her assault on the title.  She has a really great serve that never lets her down. She used it a lot today when she was in trouble,  he said.  That is such an amazing weapon, to have when you are love-30 down you can just hit two unplayable serves. At 6-6 and 7-7 she was able to do that.  Another great weapon is the power of the crowd, and Konta, who faces Greece's Maria Sakkari in the third round, also wielded that to perfection.  It is huge that she is playing home at a grand slam,  Wilander said.  When the fans were rooting for her, she really delivered. And that is great going forward, because when they root for you and you respond like she did, they will support you even more, all the way, because they know you will give 100 percent.  There are maybe 10-15 women here who all believe they can win here... and for sure Konta can win this. She has the game, the shots, the weapons - and the confidence.

Mickelson has missed the cut in his three prior Greenbrier appearances but hopes to snap that barren run on the Old White TPC Course in White Sulphur Springs with younger brother Tim on the bag following last month's split with Jim  Bones  Mackay. The left-hander, who had Mackay on his bag for all but one of his 42 PGA Tour wins, has played in 15 tournaments this season with four top 10s and is yet to miss a cut. This week will mark his first start since a ninth-place finish at the St. Jude Classic in early June, but it comes on a course the five-times major winner once described as  brutally difficult.  Still, Mickelson enjoys the area so much that he owns a home on the property and last year became a member of the Greenbrier Sporting Club plus a Tour ambassador for the resort. Last year, a mere two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic, a devastating flash flood swept through the area and caused extensive damage to the course that was deemed beyond reasonable repair to conduct the tournament. Since there was no tournament last year, New Zealand's Danny Lee, who won the 2015 edition in a four-way playoff for his only PGA Tour win, is the returning champion. The world number 81, who will be grouped with Mickelson and twice U.S. Masters winner Bubba Watson for the first two rounds, says he has benefited from coaching changes and the addition of a mental coach to his team. After a share of fifth place at the AT&T; Byron Nelson in May, Lee returned a week later to finish sixth at Colonial and then 10 days ago tied for third at the Travelers Championship.  I had some good finishes, and I got to play in the final group on Colonial. I haven't been in that situation for a while. I kind of didn't sleep that well Saturday night,  said Lee.  But at Travelers I felt a lot better. Then I played great that week all week. I think I'm on the right track to do something great I think.

Higher corn futures       also boosted feed costs for fattening cattle, weighing on feeder cattle futures        , while lean hogs         rose to a fresh 2-1/2-year high.      There's a lack of any bullish or supportive news, so we continue to drift (lower),  Steiner Consulting Group analyst Altin Kalo said of cattle.     Chicago Mercantile Exchange August live cattle        fell 2.200 cents to 113.550 cents per pound, after earlier falling to 113.075 cents, the lowest since April 26. CME August feeder cattle        finished 3.875 cents lower at 142.225 cents per pound, a roughly two-week low.     About 400 head of cattle were sold of 2,000 offered at an average price of $117.70 per cwt at the online Fed Cattle Exchange auction, down from average sales a week ago of $119.51, according to the auction website.     The U.S. Department of Agriculture said after the close of futures trading that wholesale choice-grade beef eased 31 cents to $222.58 per cwt while select beef cuts fell $2.12 to $205.32.                Beef prices have been on a downtrend since hitting two-year highs in mid-May. Retailer beef demand, which surges ahead of the outdoor grilling season, generally declines when consumers cook fewer roasts and steaks during the peak summer heat.     CME July hog futures        hit a life-of-contract high of 92.575 cents before finishing at 92.050 cents, up 1.350. Several deferred contracts also reached lifetime highs and most-active August hog futures        settled up 0.175 cent at 84.575 cents.     Gains in cash hog prices and higher prices for wholesale pork have enticed investors to make long bets in hog futures, which reached the highest levels since October 2014 on a continuous hog futures chart       .      Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon,  Kalo said.     The USDA after the close said cash hogs in the top market of Iowa and southern Minnesota were up 10 cents at $87.96 per cwt and the pork cutout was up 9 cents at $104.41.

McDavid, who has one year left on his entry-level contract, agreed to an extension that will pay him an average of $12.5 million per season, the highest salary cap charge in the NHL, starting with the 2018-19 campaign, the team announced on Wednesday. After being made the youngest captain in NHL history last October at the age of 19, McDavid went on to win the scoring title with 100 points as he led Edmonton to their first playoff berth since 2006. The campaign earned McDavid his first Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's Most Valuable Player and the Ted Lindsay Award as the most  outstanding  player as voted by his peers. McDavid, whose skills have been compared to Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky's, said he was honored to know he will remain long-term with the Oilers and wants nothing more than to deliver the franchise their sixth Stanley Cup and first since 1990.  I'm in it for the long haul and I want to win here,  McDavid told a news conference.  This is a city that I think has such a rich history. It's important that we bring that back. We got a taste of that last year and we certainly have some unfinished business.  McDavid was the first overall pick in the 2015 NHL Draft where he was by far the most coveted prospect for years given his hockey sense, skating wizardry, deft passing and vision on the ice.  The Canadian center had 48 points in 45 games during a rookie campaign cut short by a broken collerbone. McDavid showed no drop in form in his second season, playing in all of his team's 82 games, registering 30 goals and 70 assists. The Oilers reached the second round of the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs where they lost a decisive seventh game to Anaheim.

Although so-called immunotherapy drugs from the likes of Merck and Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche are starting to revolutionize cancer care, they still only work for a limited number of patients. By adding a personalized cancer vaccine, scientists believe it should be possible to improve substantially the effectiveness of such immune-boosting medicines. Twelve skin cancer patients, out of a total of 19 across both the trials, avoided relapses for two years after receiving different vaccines developed by German and U.S. teams, researchers reported in the journal Nature on Wednesday. The small Phase I trials now need to be followed by larger studies, but the impressive early results suggest the new shots work far better than first-generation cancer vaccines that typically targeted a single cancer characteristic. The new treatments contain between 10 and 20 different mutated proteins, or  neoantigens,  that are specific to an individual's tumor. These proteins are not found on healthy cells and they look foreign to the immune system, prompting specialist T-cells to step up their attack on cancer cells. One vaccine was developed at the U.S.-based Dana-Farber Institute and Broad Institute and the other by privately owned German biotech firm BioNTech, which uses so-called messenger RNA to carry the code for making its therapeutic proteins. Roche, the world's largest cancer drugmaker, is already betting on BioNTech's technology after signing a $310 million deal last September allowing it to test the German vaccine with its immunotherapy drug Tecentriq. FILE PHOTO: A scientist prepares protein samples for analysis in a lab at the Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton, Britain July 15, 2013.Stefan Wermuth/File PhotoBioNTech's co-founder and CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters that combination trials using Roche's drug were due to start later this year against a number of different cancers. Rival biotech firm Neon Therapeutics, which was formed to exploit the U.S. research, initiated tests of its personalized neoantigen vaccine in combination with Bristol-Myer's Opdivo drug last year. Expensive Treatment FILE PHOTO: Swiss drugmaker Roche's logo is seen at their headquarters in Basel, Switzerland January 28, 2016.Arnd Wiegmann/File PhotoNew drugs like Opdivo and Tecentriq that enlist the body's immune system are improving the odds of survival, but their typical price tag of more than $150,000 a year is controversial and adding a personalized vaccine will jack costs up further. Sahin acknowledged such vaccines would be expensive at first but said costs could be brought down by economies of scale and automation.  In the mid to long term the cost will fall dramatically . . . it is an individual treatment but it is a universal process,  he said.  We are at a very early stage at the moment but in the long-run this approach could change everything.  Cornelius Melief of Leiden University Medical Center, who was not involved in either study, said the research confirmed the potential of neoantigen vaccines.   Controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials with more participants are now needed to establish the efficacy of these vaccines in patients with any type of cancer that has enough mutations to provide sufficient neoantigen targets for this type of approach,  he said.

Weak organic growth and a desire for diversification is driving M&A;, while rising minimum wages and the effects of restaurant refranchising are driving productivity and general and administrative cost reductions. The sector has few short-term financing needs due to significant refinancing and recapitalization activity over the past 12 months. Few companies in Fitch's sample have upcoming maturities within the next two years that are viewed as not manageable, because of companies' adequate liquidity and financial flexibility. In addition, the sector has more companies on a positive trajectory (Spectrum, Pinnacle, Aramark, US Foods Holding Co, Weight Watchers) than negative (Revlon and Avon). Consumer Products Changes in the retail sector are having the biggest impact on the consumer products sector.  Consolidation within the traditional retail sector has increased retailers' bargaining power,  says Ellen Itskovitz, Senior Director, U.S. Corporates.  This, combined with a heightened competitive environment, has led to further declines in retail inventory levels and additional pricing pressure for consumer product companies.  Product innovation and further diversification of distribution channels can help consumer companies combat these challenges.  Walmart is the largest retail customer for most of the high-yield consumer companies Fitch analyzes. It uses its scale as an advantage in continuing to pressure its supplier base for better terms and lower prices, especially in the increasingly competitive retail environment. Acquisitions have been and are expected to continue to be an important growth engine for high-yield consumer companies. These acquisitions often reflect key strategic objectives for the companies such as geographic expansion, new product platforms, and enhancing social media / online expertise. The online channel is increasingly important for growth and several companies have announced acquisitions or new initiatives in that space. Packaged Foods Consumer preferences for fresh, natural, organic and specialty products are pressuring volumes of traditional packaged foods.  With volumes down, acquisitions will be pervasive as companies seek to diversify their portfolio of products and brands that drive growth,  says Itskovitz. Distribution channels and pricing are also in focus due to two pending competitive threats: Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and the arrival of European discount grocers. The Whole Foods transaction provides Amazon with a hard-to-replicate distribution and supply chain infrastructure that will support home deliveries. This could eventually drive down prices, as would an American expansion by Aldi or Lidl, who are already known for their low prices in Europe. Restaurants and Food Service Restaurant industry sales growth has slowed due to less aggressive menu price increases and weak traffic. However, revenue and EBITDA growth trends across individual companies vary. The casual dining segment remains weak versus quick-service with national chains potentially losing share to stronger peers and independent restaurants. Heightened competition is forcing some companies to reconsider their value propositions with enhanced food quality and larger portions. These efforts could add additional pressure to margins with productivity initiatives providing a modest offset.  The challenging operating environment will continue to separate the winners from the losers,  says Carla Norfleet Taylor, Senior Director, U.S. Corporates.  Consumers' tastes and preferences are changing and restaurant companies must be able to quickly adjust.  Corporate actions, including acquisitions, spinoffs, recapitalizations to return capital to shareholders and IPOs, have been widespread among restaurant and foodservice companies. YUM! Brands, Inc. spun off its China operations and continues to push towards a fully franchised business model, while Restaurant Brands International, Inc. is well positioned to continue to expand internationally with its acquisition of Popeyes. Additionally, Brinker International, Inc. and YUM both recapitalized their balance sheets within the past 12 months, transitioning to high-yield credits for the second time in their histories, while US Foods Holdings Corp., which completed its IPO in 2016, and Aramark are delevering but remain open to tuck-in acquisitions. The U.S. High-Yield Consumer Handbook is a comprehensive review of the leveraged food, beverage, restaurant, and consumer products sector. Published annually, it contains both sector themes and individual credit profiles for 18 high-yield issuers with more than $70 billion of debt outstanding collectively.

Silicon Valley disruptor Tesla has upset the century-old automobile industry, and in April overtook General Motors to become the U.S. carmaker with the largest market capitalization. On Wednesday, its shares fell 7.2 percent to $327.09, its lowest in more than a month. It was the biggest daily percentage fall since June 22, 2016. That followed a 2.5 percent decline on Monday, when Tesla said it delivered 47,100 electric sedans and SUVs in the first half, at the lower end of its forecast of 47,000 to 50,000. Tesla said a  severe shortfall  of new battery packs had constrained vehicle manufacturing until June, and it said second-half deliveries of the Model S sedan and Model X sports utility vehicle should exceed those of the first half.  We see Tesla shares as an over-valued show-me story that has traded as a concept stock given the dislocation between share price performance and our/consensus estimates,  analysts at Cowen and Company said in a note. Despite, sharp losses over the last two days, Tesla shares remain up about 53 percent this year. The median price target on the stock is $309.50. Even after the two-day slide in the shares, the stock is about 7 percent above that. Less than 20 S&P; 500 Index constituents can top that. On average, S&P; 500 stocks trade between 7 and 9 percent below the Street's target, according to Thomson Reuters data. While Tesla has been trading above the median target price for months, that margin mushroomed in June with the stock trading as much as 25 percent above the median target. Some 14 of the 21 analysts who cover Tesla have a sell or hold rating on the shares. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group-owned Volvo said all its car models launched after 2019 will be electric or hybrids, making it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for phasing out vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion engine. While the Volvo announcement could be seen as validation for Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s vision, it also highlights the intense competition Tesla is likely to face, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a note.

The senior State Department official told reporters all parties to the agreement  have asked for a U.S. interlocutor that they can work with - some sort of Minsk coordinator or envoy ... and we are actively considering that.  The Minsk peace agreement, brokered by France and Germany and signed by Russia and Ukraine, calls for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy.

Poroshenko said after meeting with President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials in Washington last month that the two countries would soon sign a number of agreements boosting defense cooperation. Ukraine's foreign minister said the deal would involve defensive weapons only. Asked about a possible defensive weapons deal, the State Department official said:  We've neither ruled out providing such weapons to Ukraine, nor have we taken a decision to do so.

The Sweden-based carmaker on Wednesday said it will stop producing new gasoline-only engines from 2019 and shift to a variety of hybrid and all-electric models. That may not appear too significant at first – the company, after all, accounted for just 0.6 percent of global vehicle sales last year. But its plan sums up the challenges faced by Elon Musk’s firm.  Granted, Volvo is over-revving its engine by proclaiming it’s going “all electric.” It has no plans yet to drop existing gasoline vehicles. And it will keep the combustion engine in two of the three options it will introduce starting in two years’ time – a plug-in hybrid, which can use either gasoline or electric power, and what it calls the mild hybrid, like Toyota's Prius, which converts braking power into electricity.  REUTERS RECOMMENDSTesla's Model S fails to ace some tests in highway safety evaluationU.S. cars a tough sell in South Korea even as Trump targets trade dealFord's China sales bounce back in June as tax impact fades The industry sells more cars with these engines than pure electric-powered ones. That’s especially true in the fast-growing Chinese market, where around half the world’s electric and hybrid cars are sold and where Volvo’s owner, Geely, is based.  Tesla accounts for just 3 percent of electric vehicle and hybrid sales there, Barclays points out. Local players selling cheaper cars dominate; meanwhile, the likes of Daimler and General Motors are bulking up. That’s likely to bring down the cost of batteries even further, robbing Tesla of one of its major advantages.  It’s emblematic of the growing competition Tesla is facing around the world. Virtually all carmakers have electric and hybrid offerings of their own, whether smaller vehicles like the Nissan Leaf or BMW’s high-end i3 and i8.  That doesn’t mean Musk’s company is driving down a dead-end street. But it once again calls into question his aggressive target of selling 500,000 vehicles by the end of next year – five times this year’s run rate and just shy of what Volvo currently delivers - and 1 million by 2020.  Moreover, Tesla is still suffering from growing pains. The latest slip-up was a lack of batteries, which kept production 40 percent below demand for much of the second quarter, the company said just before the July 4 holiday.  That and Volvo’s news took more than 7 percent off Tesla’s stock on Wednesday. Even so, Musk’s carmaker trades at 25 times estimated 2020 earnings, compared with Toyota’s multiple of just over 10 times 2017 earnings. More pain lies ahead.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Political tensions in Zambia, seen as one of Africa's more stable and functional democracies, have been rising since the arrest on treason charges of main opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema, who narrowly lost to Lungu in a bruising election last year. Hichilema, along with five others, is accused of trying to overthrow the government after a column of opposition vehicles failed to make way for the president's motorcade. Under Zambian state of emergency laws, police can prohibit public meetings, close roads, impose curfews and restrict movements. The country's last state of emergency was declared in 1997 by then president Frederick Chiluba after an attempted coup. It was lifted the following year. Lungu said the fire, which destroyed the southern part of City Market in the capital Lusaka on Tuesday,  bordered on economic sabotage  and was aimed at making the country ungovernable. Nobody was killed or injured in the blaze.   I have issued a statutory instrument proclaiming that a situation exists in this country which if allowed to continue may lead to a state of public emergency. This proclamation will be tabled in the national assembly,  Lungu said in a televised address.  There is no doubt in my mind that the intention of these perpetrators is to make the country ungovernable and as president of this country it is my responsibility to respond to forestall chaos.  Police have said some people were planning to vandalise vital installations including bridges and power stations after the blaze.  They also said one person was taken into custody for trying to torch a bus station and are seeking those who vandalised electricity transmission lines to a suburb near the capital last month. Hichilema, leader of the United Party for National Development, was arrested in April when police raided his home and charged him with trying to overthrow the government. An economist and businessman widely known by his initials  HH , Hichilema was defeated last August by Lungu in an election the opposition politician denounced as fraudulent. His attempts to mount a legal challenge have been unsuccessful.

At the same time, investors moved $6.74 billion into international equity funds, a slight decline from the $8.56 billion invested in the category the week before. U.S. bond funds took in $5.38 billion, continuing an unbroken streak of positive weekly inflows for the year to date.  U.S. stocks  are not unduly expensive, but there are better values to be found elsewhere,  said Alan Gayle, head of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments, which has $40.2 billion in assets under management.  The benchmark S&P; 500 index trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.4, according to Thomson Reuters data, near the high end of its historical range, and investors have questioned whether the Trump Administration will be able to deliver on its promise of tax cuts and infrastructure spending that helped boost stocks in the wake of the U.S. presidential election in November.  The move away from U.S. stocks continues a year-long trend in which investors continue to favor bonds over domestic equities. Overall, investors pulled $12.4 billion out of U.S. stock and ETF equity funds between January and the end of May, according to Investment Company Institute data.

Yields edged lower on the day compared with Monday's closing levels, with analysts attributing the move to Commerce Department data showing factory goods orders dropped 0.8 percent in May. Economists had forecast factory orders falling 0.5 percent.     Yields were near the upper end of recent ranges, however, with benchmark 10-year yields last at 2.332 percent after touching a more than seven-week high of 2.357 percent in morning U.S. trading.      Analysts said yields remained at elevated levels on a historical basis given a growing chorus of hawkish comments from global central banks, including those from the heads of the European Central Bank and Bank of England last week.      In afternoon trading, yields jumped and almost touched their recent peaks after the release of minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting on June 13-14. But they reversed course to stand roughly unchanged from their prior levels as analysts said the messaging in the minutes did not reveal any major changes in the Fed's thinking.       Factory orders did send yields lower, and then obviously we sold off initially on the minutes, and then we came back,  said Stanley Sun, interest rate strategist at Nomura Securities International in New York.  By and large these minutes were still relatively neutral.      Three-year yields hit a roughly 3-1/2-month high of 1.598 percent before the release of the factory orders data. U.S. two-year yields were at 1.414 percent, near Monday's more than eight-year peak of 1.426 percent.      Fed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises, the minutes showed.     Analysts said Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report could show a jump in jobs growth for the month of June, which would pressure yields higher.     Economists polled by Reuters expect the report to show U.S. employers added 179,000 jobs last month, compared with just 138,000 in May.       Yields are holding in the upper end of the range as traders don’t expect any surprisingly weak data, about the only thing that is going to change sentiment in July,  said Jim Vogel, an interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.

So the government can’t dictate to the domestic industry whether to pump or not pump - they are going to keep pumping as long as it is profitable for them.  Shares of Exxon (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) fell by more than 1.5 percent and were among the biggest drags on the Dow and S&P.; The S&P; energy index .SPNY lost 2 percent and was the worst performing out of the 11 major S&P; sectors. Recent tepid economic data and an inflation rate below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target may have a bearing on the U.S. central bank's plans for interest rate hikes. New orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in May, data showed on Wednesday, but capital equipment orders were slightly stronger than previously reported, suggesting manufacturing remains on a path of moderate growth. Fed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it will affect the future pace of rate increases, according to minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting on June 13-14. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 5, 2017.Brendan McDermidThe minutes revealed a few officials viewed equity prices as high when compared to standard valuation measures, even though earnings growth had been robust.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.1 points, or 0.01 percent, to close at 21,478.17, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 3.53 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,432.54 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 40.80 points, or 0.67 percent, to 6,150.86. The tech sector's .SPLRCT 1 percent rise led the S&P; 500 gainers, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), Micron (MU.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) among the best performers in the sector. The PHLX semiconductor index .SOX jumped 2.1 percent. Slideshow (5 Images)Technology shares have been volatile in recent weeks as the sector's strong run this year raised concerns about their valuation. The tech sector index is up nearly 17 percent this year. O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY.O) plunged 18.9 percent to a near three-year low after its second-quarter same-store sales widely missed its own estimates. That move dragged down other auto-parts retailers, with Autozone (AZO.N) down 9.6 percent and Advance Auto Parts (AAP.N) down 11.15 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

At the same time, investors moved $6.74 billion into international equity funds, a slight decline from the $8.56 billion invested in the category the week before. U.S. bond funds took in $5.38 billion, continuing an unbroken streak of positive weekly inflows for the year to date.

The Politico-Morning Consult poll found 37 percent of voters said they  strongly supported  the new U.S. State Department guidelines that would deny visas to citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen who do not have close relatives in the United States. Another 23 percent of voters said they  somewhat support  the guidelines. The poll was conducted online on Thursday and Friday following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that partly upheld the ban, with 1,989 registered voters taking part. The poll results' margin of error was 2 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way. (Link to the poll: politi.co/2uJLfoO) The survey asked respondents whether they support or oppose the State Department's new guidelines,  which say visa applicants from six predominately Muslim countries must prove a close family relationship with a U.S. resident in order to enter the country.  It did not mention U.S. President Donald Trump, nor the president's executive orders on immigration.  The Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that the temporary travel ban could proceed so long as visa applicants with a  bona fide relationship  with a person or entity in the United States were exempted.  A year before his election, Trump promised voters he would seek a temporary  total and complete shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States. Trump said it was necessary to prevent attacks by Islamist militants, while critics said it was a needlessly discriminatory policy that could inflame prejudice against Muslims in the United States and abroad. The partial ban, which took effect on Thursday, was most strongly supported by Trump's fellow Republicans, 83 percent of whom approved. Even among Democratic voters, only 46 percent said they were opposed.  Forty-one percent of Democrats said they support it, and the remaining 13 percent said they  don't know.    The Supreme Court allowed the ban, which bars people from the designated six countries for 90 days and refugees from any country for 120 days, to take effect until it can take up the case during its next term starting in October.

Italy ratified the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture in 1988 but until Wednesday had never legislated to make it a criminal offence. More than four years after the bill was presented, the Chamber of Deputies finally passed it by 198 votes to 35 but most of the members of the 630 seat lower house were either absent of abstained. The bill, which says torture can by punished by up to 12 years in prison, was backed by the ruling Democratic Party (PD) and opposed by the center-right opposition which said it would make it harder for the police and military to do their job.  Almost 30 years after ratifying the U.N. Convention, we have filled a huge vacuum in our legal system that was repeatedly condemned by European and international bodies,  said the PD's Donatella Ferranti, head of the chamber's justice committee. Left-wing parties and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement abstained, saying the bill had been so heavily amended in parliament that it was now of little use. The senator who originally presented the bill in 2013 abstained for the same reason when it was approved in the upper house two months ago. Critics say the law's definition of torture is too narrow, requiring for example that violent conduct must be repeated and continuous and cause a  verifiable psychological trauma,  meaning many acts of cruelty may fall outside it.  When the bill was approved in the Senate in May, Amnesty International called it  unpresentable  and  incompatible with the U.N. Convention against Torture.  In its final version it had been designed to protect Italian military and police  at all costs,  the rights group said.

Mutombo told reporters at a news conference that the bank would start inspecting companies' bank accounts abroad as part of the new push and would also seek to verify their ore output to eliminate fraud. Congo, Africa's top copper producer, has been hit hard by low commodity prices over the last two years and cut its growth forecast for 2017 in May. With the oil and mining sectors accounting for 95 percent of the country's export revenue, the fall in prices has hurt the government's finances and it is in discussions with the International Monetary Fund about possible support. The central bank also raised its key interest rate to 20 percent from 14 percent last month to try to stabilize its volatile franc currency.  We will reinforce our verification and regulation of the main accounts abroad of mining companies in order to assure an actual repatriation of 40 percent,  Mutombo said.  It's unacceptable that to date ... the repatriation of currency still remains so low, without any improvement, while we are dealing with a shortage of foreign exchange in our country,  he said.  The central bank also said on Wednesday it had foreign reserves of nearly $708 million, the equivalent of just over three weeks' worth of imports.

Trump,Donald Trump,Jennifer Morgan,Steffen Seibert,US,G20,GERMANY,CLIMATECHANGE,Germany,G20,Western Europe,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Environment,France,Government / Politics,Climate Politics,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Europe,Science,United States","sector":"Technology","content":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Draft conclusions to this week's summit of the Group of 20 leading economies acknowledge the United States' isolation in opposing the Paris climate accord but agree to G20 collaboration on reducing emissions through innovation, a G20 source said. The text, dated July 3, makes plain a 19-1 split in the G20 over the Paris climate accord, the 2015 global accord to fight climate change from which U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he would withdraw. Under the agreement, which took years to reach, rich and poor countries committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases generated by burning fossil fuels that are blamed by scientists for warming the planet.  We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Agreement,  read the draft text of the conclusions on the climate chapter of which Reuters has seen a copy. A G20 source also confirmed the wording.  The United States affirms its strong commitment to a global approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs,  the text added, noting the other G20 leaders agreed the Paris accord is  irreversible . The German government, host of the G20 summit in Hamburg from Friday to Saturday, neither confirmed nor denied the draft agreement.  At the moment nothing is decided. There are many options,  said government spokesman Steffen Seibert. Greenpeace urged world powers to resist any attempts to water down the joint language on fighting climate change.   The G20, or G19 if necessary, must make it crystal clear that the Paris Agreement is the only game in town,  said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. Morgan said there was absolutely no evidence that Trump wanted to lower emissions.  The statement that the U.S. has a strong commitment to a global approach that lowers emissions smacks in the face what Trump is doing in reality - raising emissions,  Morgan said.  This is the moment for the G19 to stand together on the right side of history and reject any diversions from the Paris Agreement.  Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, said last month his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the Paris accord or to have a new agreement  on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.   By describing the accord as irreversible, the G20 text appeared to resist any renegotiation.  We don't want a parallel discussion on climate. For us, it's all about Paris,  said one EU diplomat.  But at the end of the day it's still the United States and if they want to renegotiate, we will probably still come to the table.  Another EU diplomat said some delegations, who were instrumental in negotiating the climate deal, were lobbying to have the sentence on supporting a  global approach  removed. In the draft, G20 countries agreed to collaborate closely to facilitate  well-balanced and economically viable  long-term strategies to enhance their economies in a way that is consistent with sustainable development.  We will continue to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions through innovation and energy efficiency,  the draft read. The conclusions remain subject to change as leaders only start arriving in Hamburg on Thursday, before gathering for their summit on Friday and Saturday. But a draft that both acknowledges U.S. isolation in its opposition to the Paris accord while securing the commitment of all G20 members to develop clean energy technologies through innovation may allow a conclusion that all countries can sign.

The minutes showed the central bank was split on how inflation might affect the future pace of interest rate increases.                    We changed our call for the next Fed hike by moving it to December (from September) and the June Fed minutes seem to confirm that the September meeting will instead be used to announce the start of the run-off of the central bank's balance sheet,  said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist for CIBC Capital Markets, in a note.     Spot gold        was down 0.02 percent at $1,223.37 an ounce by 3:08 p.m. EDT (1908 GMT), after touching $1,217.14, the lowest since May 10.      A missile launch by North Korea prompted only a brief rally for gold, seen as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.                  U.S. gold futures         for August delivery settled at $1,221.70, up 0.2 percent from Monday's settlement following a U.S. holiday on Tuesday.      The dollar index        was little changed after rising 0.3 percent. A stronger greenback makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, and higher bond yields raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.       We've seen the dollar rebound from recent lows and treasury yields moving higher. That is a very powerful driver of the gold market,  Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said.      Though yields eased later on Wednesday, they have risen sharply in recent weeks as several central banks signaled that they would tighten monetary policy, while Fed officials appeared undeterred by weak economic data and low inflation.      That has caused gold prices to tumble more than 3 percent from a high of $1,258.81 on June 23.      Investors were also looking ahead to U.S. employment data on Friday that could influence the pace of rate rises.              In other precious metals, silver        fell as low as $15.84, the weakest since December.     Platinum        dropped to a low of $896.25 per ounce, the lowest since May 9.      Strong technical support from Fibonacci retracement and previous lows was between $902.39 and $890.49, analysts at JPMorgan said in a note.

The shootout took place near the mountainous community of Las Varas, in the heart of one of Mexico's drug trafficking regions, and it involved two armed groups. It was unclear how many of the victims were dead and how many were alive at hospitals, spokesman Felix Gonzalez told Reuters. President Enrique Pena Nieto came to office in 2012 vowing to end years of drug violence, and although the murder rate fell initially, it has been rising steadily and is on track to hit its highest level since recent government records began in 1997.  The shootout coincided with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly visiting Mexico to meet with Pena Nieto and to discuss cooperation in fighting organized crime. More than 100,000 people have died in drug-related violence since 2007 when former President Felipe Calderon sent in the military to battle the cartels, and at least 30,000 people are missing.

French umpire Kader Nouni was seen slapping his face as he tried to squash the irritants, while Croatian Donna Vekic was spotted applying insect repellent during the changeovers of her match against Briton Johanna Konta on Centre Court.

I almost wanted to stop because they were hitting you in the face when you were trying to hit balls. (They were) all over the place,  Querrey said.  I lost a set when the ants came. If I had won that set, probably wouldn't have bugged me as much.  When the ants were too tired to continue flying, they crawled around the courts, causing unsightly black patches on Wimbledon's famous green grass.  The phenomenon behind the unlikely scenes witnessed at Wimbledon is known as  flying ant day  and is triggered when a queen leaves her nest in search of a mate to start a new colony. The colony sends out a large number of swarmers because only a very small percentage make it through mating to start a new generation.

The world number one was repeatedly dared by Brown to dash in from the baseline and scramble for a ball dying on the grass - but after his comfortable 6-3 6-2 6-2 victory the Briton said he felt good and that he had moved well. Murray gave as good as he got - and better - playing many of the same shots with more accuracy and control in a quickfire 96 minute palate-cleanser for the Centre Court crowd after the earlier epic three-setter won by compatriot Johanna Konta.  If he has a problem with his hip, I don't want to play against him when his hip is good,  Brown told reporters.

But he showed the frailties of such high stakes hotshot tennis, racking up 28 unforced errors to Murray's five. The home fans loved the show, though, temporarily forgetting their wildly partisan support for the Briton as Brown casually sliced and diced the ball over - and frequently into - the net. In the first game of the third set, the German acknowledged a shout of  We love you Dustin  by raising his racket to the crowd before serving.

He started very well and was coming up with great drop volleys and really going for the returns,  Murray said.   Slideshow (7 Images) Once I got the break in the first set, I felt the momentum was with me, I was starting to see the shots he was going to play a little bit quicker and that allowed me to get to some of the drop volleys and also come up with some good passing shots.      The top seed's win was greeted by huge cheers from a crowd hoping to see the 30-year-old twice champion become the first British player to retain a grand slam title since Fred Perry in the 1930s. After seeing off maverick Wimbledon debutant Alexander Bublik in round one and the clash with Brown, Murray faces another showman, Italian 28th seed Fabio Fognini, in round three.  Certainly, the first two matches have been, difficult to come up with game plans, because you don't know exactly how the two guys are going to play,  Murray said.  I think against Fabio ... it's maybe easier to come up with a game plan because there will be a bit more structure and strategy in the match rather than just, reacting and sort of more kind of instinctive points.

Konta has never previously reached the third round at the All England Club but having established herself in the world's top 10, expectations have risen and a partisan crowd added to the sense of this being a key match for the 26-year-old. There are times when Konta, with her repeated talk of  process  and  bubbles  can sound like she is reciting a text from a self-help book. But there is no doubt, after a tense, hard-fought three-set win lasting over three hours that years of attention to the mental side of sport have given her the focus and steel needed to cope with the big occasion.  You guys keep talking about this pressure, and I guess I keep sounding like a broken record, but for me, pressure is a very self-imposed thing,  she told reporters.  I'm approaching this event like I am every other event. I'm coming here to do the best that I can, to compete the best I can. I think I showed that today.  For years Konta worked with the late London-based Spanish mind guru Juan Coto, who died last year and was seen as a key influence on her development.  The momentum shifted throughout the 7-6(4) 4-6 10-8 contest, which Konta described as  one of the most epic matches I have been a part of . But she evidently did not let emotions take control.  Quite honestly, I really just tried to see the constructive and the positive things that I was doing and also accept the good things that she was doing, because she was doing very, very many good things.   I feel I competed well. I feel that even when the momentum shifted slightly to her side of the court, I still was competitive, and I still felt I kept my mind quite light and just really tried to, yeah, keep going,  she said. A  light mind  is another of those phrases that probably originates in mental training and she offered an explanation for it.  Personally, I look to just keep a good perspective. Appreciate the level that my opponent was playing. Acknowledge that some of the things weren't completely under my control. I think that also reinforced for me the good things I was doing and trusting in those things.  That just keeps my mindset quite clear, and in turn light, or that's kind of how I describe it.

Proton pump inhibitors or PPIs, have been tied to a wide range of side effects including fractures, dementia, heart disease, pneumonia and kidney disease, the study’s senior author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.  “We took it a bit further and asked is this class associated with a higher risk of death, and the answer is yes,” he said. About 50 million people in the U.S. are on PPIs, Al-Aly noted, and there is strong evidence that the drugs are overused. Popular drugs in this class include omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium) and lansoprazole (Prevacid). He and his colleagues looked at data on millions of U.S. military veterans to determine if taking PPIs was associated with an increased risk of dying during about six years of follow-up. Their analysis included nearly 350,000 new users of PPIs or H2 blockers, another type of acid-suppressing drug. They also compared PPI users and non-users within a group of nearly 3.3 million people, and PPI versus no PPI and no H2 blockers among about 2.9 million people. New users of PPIs were 25 percent more likely to die during follow-up than people who started taking H2 blockers, Al-Aly and his colleagues report in BMJ Open.  For new PPI users, death risk rose in tandem with the amount of time the person took the medication. Risk was also increased in people who were on PPIs without an appropriate medical reason. The most likely explanation for the increased mortality risk is the side effects associated with PPIs, Al-Aly said. In terms of the mechanisms that could be involved, he added, laboratory experiments have shown that lysosomes - tiny organs within cells that act like garbage disposals to get rid of waste - don’t function well in people taking PPIs. Other research has shown that PPIs may shorten the protective chromosome ends known as telomeres, in effect speeding up cell aging. When a person has heartburn or reflux, he added, possible root causes like obesity, poor diet or smoking should be addressed first. “Any intake or use of PPIs should be under the watchful and vigilant eye of a physician, for the smallest dose that’s effective and the shortest period of time,” he said.

The attack used a virus, dubbed  NotPetya  by some experts, to take down thousands of computers in dozens of countries, disrupting shipping and businesses. Investigators now say the hack may be far more nefarious than previously thought. A top official in the Ukrainian Presidential Administration said it remained unclear how many computers had been compromised and the state security service was trying to establish what the hackers would do with data stolen during the attack. A video released by Ukrainian police showed masked men in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles raiding the offices of software developer Intellect Service late on Tuesday, after cyber security researchers said they had found a  back door  written into some of the updates issued by its M.E.Doc accounting software. M.E.Doc is used by 80 percent of Ukrainian companies and installed on about 1 million computers in the country. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said police had blocked a second cyber attack from servers hosting the software. The company previously denied its servers had been compromised but when asked on Wednesday whether a back door had been inserted, Chief Executive Olesya Bilousova said:  Yes, there was. And the fact is that this back door needs to be closed.  Any computer on the same network as machines using M.E.Doc was now vulnerable to another attack, she said.

The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said the fragmented patchwork of national strategies across the bloc could hinder the orderly closure of any troubled cross-border insurers and result in  suboptimal outcomes . In an 88-page opinion addressed to the European Parliament, European Commission and European Council, the regulator said capital requirements for insurers, known as Solvency II, had reduced but not eliminated the risk that insurers could fail. Insurance companies have been reeling from years of ultra-low interest rates that have been eating away at the investment returns they use to help pay policyholders.  A comprehensive recovery and resolution framework is essential for effectively dealing with distressed undertakings, particularly in the current macroeconomic environment,  Gabriel Bernardino, chairman of the Frankurt-based EIOPA, said. Policymakers in Brussels, national regulators and individual companies will now debate EIOPA's opinion, in a process that could take years for any laws to change. An EU-wide plan for failing banks already exists and regulators ruled last month that Italian lenders Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza were failing, or likely to fail, and had to be wound down. There were mixed views within the insurance industry as to whether an EU scheme akin to the banking plan was necessary. Industry group Insurance Sweden wrote in a letter to EIOPA that it saw no case for a recovery and resolution framework because insurance activities played no part in the financial crisis and,  insurance failures are very rare .  The insurance business model is distinctly different from that of banking,  it wrote.  If a crisis does occur, insurers as opposed to banks can typically be wound up in an orderly manner.  The Czech Insurance Association also said in a response to EIOPA there was no real need for harmonization, saying new rules would only be needed if it were clearly established the Solvency II regime  contains loopholes and is insufficient.  By contrast, Allianz (ALVG.DE), Europe's largest insurer by market value, signaled broad agreement with an EU-wide scheme. In an emailed response to Reuters, Allianz said it,  shares EIOPA's view that recovery and resolution planning is important  though it had a  slight divergence of opinion  on a few points in EIOPA's opinion published on Wednesday. German insurer Talanx (TLXGn.DE) welcomed EIOPA's push for EU-wide harmonization.  Internationally active groups must consider the requirements of a large number of regulators, which we do not consider optimal,  Talanx said in an email to Reuters.

Police officials counted 71 shooting incidents and 14 murders between 6 p.m. CDT on Friday and early Wednesday, according to data provided by police spokesman Frank Giancamilli on Wednesday. The Chicago Tribune newspaper tallied the total number of victims shot in those incidents at 101 between Friday afternoon and early Wednesday. Police could not immediately provide the number of victims shot. Gangs were a major source of the violence, Chicago Police First Deputy Superintendent Kevin Navarro said at a news conference on Wednesday. Chicago police deployed 1,300 additional officers to patrol during the Fourth of July weekend, and had arrested 58 people on drug and gun charges ahead of the holiday in hopes of tamping down violence.  The number of shootings, which police said surged during a six-hour period on Monday night, was higher than in 2013, the last time the Fourth of July weekend spanned four days, when 74 people were shot, according to the Tribune. The weekend brought the total number of people shot in Chicago this year above 1,800, below the 2,035 recorded at this time last year when violence spiked sharply, the Tribune reported. The violence came less than a week after President Donald Trump tweeted that gun crime in Chicago had reached  epidemic proportions  and that he would be  sending in Federal help.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions later clarified that federal assistance for the city of 2.7 million will come in the form of the Chicago Crime Gun Strike Force, a collaboration between the police and the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Chicago's ongoing struggles with violence come amid an effort to reform its police department after a federal investigation found officers routinely violated citizens' civil rights and used excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, an activist who heads a large African-American Catholic church in Chicago, said in an interview on Wednesday that more needs to be done to address underlying causes of violence such as unemployment, foreclosures, poverty and neighborhood blight.

The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said the fragmented patchwork of national strategies across the bloc could hinder the orderly closure of any troubled cross-border insurers and result in  suboptimal outcomes . In an 88-page opinion addressed to the European Parliament, European Commission and European Council, the regulator said capital requirements for insurers, known as Solvency II, had reduced but not eliminated the risk that insurers could fail. Insurance companies have been reeling from years of ultra-low interest rates that have been eating away at the investment returns they use to help pay policyholders.  A comprehensive recovery and resolution framework is essential for effectively dealing with distressed undertakings, particularly in the current macroeconomic environment,  Gabriel Bernardino, chairman of the Frankurt-based EIOPA, said. Policymakers in Brussels, national regulators and individual companies will now debate EIOPA's opinion, in a process that could take years for any laws to change. An EU-wide plan for failing banks already exists and regulators ruled last month that Italian lenders Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza were failing, or likely to fail, and had to be wound down. There were mixed views within the insurance industry as to whether an EU scheme akin to the banking plan was necessary. Industry group Insurance Sweden wrote in a letter to EIOPA that it saw no case for a recovery and resolution framework because insurance activities played no part in the financial crisis and,  insurance failures are very rare .  The insurance business model is distinctly different from that of banking,  it wrote.  If a crisis does occur, insurers as opposed to banks can typically be wound up in an orderly manner.  The Czech Insurance Association also said in a response to EIOPA there was no real need for harmonization, saying new rules would only be needed if it were clearly established the Solvency II regime  contains loopholes and is insufficient.  By contrast, Allianz (ALVG.DE), Europe's largest insurer by market value, signaled broad agreement with an EU-wide scheme. In an emailed response to Reuters, Allianz said it,  shares EIOPA's view that recovery and resolution planning is important  though it had a  slight divergence of opinion  on a few points in EIOPA's opinion published on Wednesday. German insurer Talanx (TLXGn.DE) welcomed EIOPA's push for EU-wide harmonization.  Internationally active groups must consider the requirements of a large number of regulators, which we do not consider optimal,  Talanx said in an email to Reuters.

Tumbling oil prices put pressure on the energy sector, which limited gains for Wall Street's S&P; 500 benchmark. Federal Reserve policymakers were split on the outlook for inflation and how it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises, according to the minutes of the Fed's June policy meeting released on Wednesday. Investors had hoped for insight on the central bank's plans for interest rate hikes or possible balance sheet reduction.  I see a murky, opaque message,  Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco, said of the Fed minutes. Trading was also affected on Wednesday by lighter participation the day after the U.S. July 4 Independence Day holiday and ahead of the U.S. jobs report due on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.58 points, or 0.01 percent, to 21,477.69, the S&P; 500 gained 3.11 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,432.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 36.37 points, or 0.6 percent, to 6,146.43. U.S. Treasury yields were near multi-week or multi-month peaks after the minutes. While he described the Fed headlines as dovish, Aaron Kohli, interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said the details in the minutes were hawkish. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.3267 percent, from 2.346 percent. Analysts said yields remained near their recent highs due to the possibility that Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report would show a jump in jobs growth in June, which would also push yields higher. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies and was last up 0.1 percent. It briefly pared gains after the Fed minutes. U.S. crude fell 4.29 percent to $45.05 per barrel in its sharpest fall in almost a month and Brent was last at $47.73, down 3.79 percent on the day. Oil had risen for eight straight sessions before Wednesday.

Frederick.  It's right on the threshold where if it goes lower, it'll hurt the market.  The South African Rand fell 1.7 percent against the dollar after reports the ruling African National Congress party agreed the central bank should be nationalized and President Jacob Zuma said land expropriation without compensation should be allowed where  necessary and unavoidable.

No, it's not lithium. That's so much last year's thing. We're talking about cobalt. And this one's really hot.  On the London Metal Exchange (LME) the price for three-month cobalt has leapt from $32,750 per tonne at the start of January to a current $58,500.  This stellar near 80-percent price surge mirrors what happened to lithium prices a year or so ago.  The linkage is both metals' evolution from niche applications to mainstream usage in the batteries that are now powering the green technology revolution.  If a minimum $58,500 bet is a bit too much for you, some bright hedge fund guys have come up with a cheaper option.  For just nine Canadian dollars you can now buy a share in Cobalt 27 Capital Corp, which made its C$200 million ($150.7 million) debut on Canada's Venture Exchange last month. Cobalt 27 describes itself as a  pure-play cobalt investment vehicle , an alternative to investing in producers such as Glencore, for whom cobalt is one small part of a much wider portfolio.    Just don't tell the automotive guys. Because if Cobalt 27 is right in its assessment there is much more upside to the cobalt price, there's going to be some sort of reaction to a bunch of investors holding physical stocks of a strategic metal in short supply.  Getting Physical Cobalt 27 has used a sizeable chunk of its IPO proceeds to exercise options to buy a total 2,157.50 tonnes of physical cobalt. To put that figure into perspective, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates global production of refined cobalt was 97,400 tonnes in 2015.  The metal will be stored in LME warehouses operated by C. Steinweg (Baltimore, Rotterdam and Antwerp) and the Vollers Group (Rotterdam).  A smaller part of the proceeds will be used to purchase royalties and cobalt streaming agreements from eight exploration-stage properties.  Seven are prospects in Canada, three of them operated by Palisade Resources Corp, and one in Vietnam, operated by Asian Mineral Resources. The company's ambition is to add to this list. In essence, Cobalt 27 will offer capital appreciation, assuming the price of cobalt does indeed rise, and cash flow from royalties.  The whole thing is the brain-child of Pala Investments, which describes itself as  a multi-strategy investment company focused on the mining and metals value chain . Cobalt 27 Chairman and Chief Executive Anthony Milewski is also a managing director of the Pala team.  Pala is the largest shareholder with 19.64 percent at the time of the IPO, although the stake may have fallen slightly as an over-allotment option has since been partially declared. Part of Pala's holding represents payment for the supply of 626 tonnes of cobalt under one of the physical supply options.  Pala was one of several funds to have scooped up physical cobalt last year, which was when the metal first emerged from the specialist shadows into the investment limelight.  Another was Green Energy Metals Fund, part of the Portal Capital investment group, which is the second-largest shareholder in the new public entity having also supplied physical metal.  Not all of the cobalt sellers chose to convert to Cobalt 27 shares. According to the company's final prospectus,  a total of 961.9 metric tonnes of cobalt are being acquired for cash .  But Pala and Portal evidently think there is more to come from the cobalt story.  The Only Way Is Up? Or to quote Cobalt 27's prospectus,  the company believes strong cobalt demand, coupled with challenged supply due to a lack of primary cobalt mines and political instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the largest supplier of mined cobalt, creates an attractive proposition for cobalt price appreciation.  This is a market that is widely viewed by analysts as being in transition from a state of supply surplus to one of shortfall.  And as Cobalt 27 is happy to remind us,  in 2008, during the last multi-year cobalt supply deficit, the price of cobalt exceeded US$50/lb . That's equivalent to just over $110,000 per tonne.  There are any number of uncertainties in trying to forecast the price in such a fast-evolving market as cobalt, or lithium for that matter. Everyone agrees that the electric vehicle revolution has arrived but beyond that there is no consensus as to how fast it might evolve. And what sort of batteries will those vehicles use?  Noting that cobalt is currently used in six main types of lithium-ion battery, analysts at RFC Ambrian write that  what the demand for cobalt as a constituent for future batteries will be is open to question.  ( The Alchemist, Issue 31: Cobalt , July 2017).  If prices rise too fast, they argue, battery makes will try and reduce the amount of cobalt used, even if they can't eliminate it altogether.  Ambrian's conclusion is that cobalt demand in the year 2021 could be anything from marginally lower to 80 percent higher than today. Pala and Portal evidently believe in the more bullish of those scenarios. Supply Chain vs Speculators The irony is that if they're right and the cobalt price does go stratospheric, it will be because there's not enough of it around to meet burgeoning demand from the battery sector.  And that's going to draw a lot of unwelcome attention from a physical supply chain desperately seeking spare units.  There's a precedent for this sort of manufacturer-speculator showdown in the industrial metal space.  In 2010 JPMorgan and BlackRock near simultaneously filed prospectuses for copper funds backed by physical metal. Copper processors were outraged. They viewed the funds as competition for physical units in a market that was at that stage suffering chronic supply shortfall.  Although the regulatory and legal reactions were eventually cleared, such was the furor in the copper industry that neither fund was ever launched.  Those two funds envisaged combined holdings of around 180,000 tonnes of copper, equivalent to less than 1 percent of global refined metal production at the time  Cobalt 27's holding is already more than double that level in terms of global output.  Might it too risk the wrath of a supply chain struggling to keep up with demand?  Only time will tell, but if that scenario does materialize, it will, of course, mean that Cobalt 27's fund backers will have already been rewarded for their bullish views.

Trump launched an investigation into the matter in April, in a move that diplomats and trade experts say risks undermining the global rules-based trading system and sparking retaliatory action around the world in products beyond steel. The White House confirmed last week Trump plans to use the premise of the probe as a catalyst to demand action by the Group of 20 leaders to reduce excess capacity in steel, the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas. The U.S. recommendation on possible new tariffs will be released some time after the G20 summit, which starts on Friday. The U.S. is conducting a similar study into the case for aluminium tariffs. While tariffs on both products would be aimed primarily at China, U.S. allies fear they will bear the brunt of the measures because Chinese steel exports are already largely subject to U.S. restrictions and Canada and Mexico are likely to be exempt. Also, invoking national security is all but taboo at the World Trade Organisation, the arbiter of international trade rules, because it is largely seen as a way to wage economic warfare by citing arbitrary defence concerns. The European Union has already promised to retaliate if it is hit by U.S. steel tariffs. Moreover, trade diplomats fear U.S. security-based tariffs on steel would widen cracks in the global trading order, after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates cited national security at the WTO last week to justify their economic boycott of Qatar. Qatar has threatened legal action. Its WTO representative Ali Alwaleed Al-Thani said a national security claim was not a  free pass  and would need testing in court. WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told Reuters it would be concerning to see countries making national security demands within the WTO's dispute settlement system, the global trade court for the its 164 members.  That, I think, is a very sensitive course of action,  Azevedo said. William Reinsch, a fellow at the Stimson Centre said if the threat of tariffs are used to pressure members of the G20's forum on steel overcapacity - set up last year - to tackle the problem, a good outcome could yet prevail. He warned however, that a broad U.S. claim to national security would put global trade on a slippery slope.  It just opens the door to everyone else to do same thing, not just on steel,  Reinsch said.  The next one that comes up is food - there's already a debate on food security in number of countries - and then you start talking about agricultural protection, and then you really are unravelling big chunks of the trading system.  Policies that could fall under national security include China's new Cyber Security Act, which is under WTO scrutiny from Japan, South Korea, the United States and others; Ukraine's gas pipeline reforms; and Russia's trade restrictions on Ukraine.

Officer Ray Tensing was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter, but the juries at both trials, including one last month, could not agree on a verdict. Prosecutors are still free to pursue a third trial against Tensing, but have not disclosed their plans. However, attorneys for both sides said that before the second trial, prosecutors indicated they would accept a deal for the lesser charge of reckless homicide. The incident occurred in July 2015 and was captured by Tensing's body camera. He had stopped Samuel DuBose, 43, for missing a front license plate on his car. Tensing testified during both trials that he feared for his life and shot once, hitting DuBose in the head. An attorney for Tensing and a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said that prior to the start of the second trial the sides discussed a possible plea agreement.  Julie Wilson, a spokeswoman for the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office, told Reuters by telephone that prosecutor Joe Deters and Tensing's attorney, Stew Mathews, discussed a possible agreement after running into each other on the street.    Obviously, I don't have the exact words, but that Mr. Deters said to Mr. Mathews, 'If the defendant came to us with some possible plea, and it could be something like a reckless homicide, that we would consider it, and discuss it with the family,'  Wilson said.   Mathews made (it) clear that the defendant would not take any kind of plea to a felony,  she added.   It was unclear when and where the discussions between the two attorneys took place.  Mathews confirmed the two sides had discussed a plea agreement and said one was offered, but declined to provide details.  “It was offered, but I’m not going to go into it any further,” he told Reuters.  The university police fired Tensing after he was charged. DuBose's shooting added to the debate in the United States over the use of excessive force by police, especially against minorities.  The second mistrial was called after a police officer in Minnesota was acquitted of killing a black motorist and two days after a former Milwaukee cop was found not guilty of reckless homicide in the fatal shooting of a black man.

A source close to the commercial rights holder said Formula One Management had offered to take over the race for five years, absorbing annual losses of between two and three million pounds ($2.5-$3.8 million). The offer, and another to delay the deadline to the end of the month to allow more time for negotiation, had proved insufficient. Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), fear the annual rise in hosting fees agreed with previous F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone exposes them to a  potentially ruinous risk . They have argued that the break clause would allow more favorable terms to be reached. Silverstone, which hosted the first Formula One world championship race in 1950, has a contract to 2026 with a break clause from 2019 that has to be exercised two years in advance. First practice for this year's race starts on Friday next week, with the teams competing in Austria this weekend. Sources on both sides told Reuters that an announcement was likely on Tuesday, the day before a big event involving Formula One cars, teams and drivers in central London's Trafalgar Square. Formula One's commercial managing director Sean Bratches, appointed after Liberty Media took over the sport in January, said the new owners recognized Silverstone was one of the  jewels in the crown . Even if goodwill has been eroded, he expressed optimism that Britain would on the calendar.  We have great ambition for the sport, and are determined to raise the bar as fans expect more from their race weekend,  Bratches said.  We need promoters who share that vision. We have three years to achieve that objective and are optimistic that a new fan-centric solution can be found.  A Silverstone spokesperson said on Monday that a final decision had not been taken. Media reports have indicated Silverstone will have to pay nearly 17 million pounds ($22 million) to host the race this year, rising to 26 million by the end of the contract.  That is still far less than most other venues, many of which receive state backing. Wednesday's event in London is aimed at raising the profile of the sport ahead of a race that drew a Sunday crowd of 139,000 last year and is a home grand prix for triple champion Lewis Hamilton.

For the study, researchers followed 359 women for an average of almost six years after they had what’s known as uterine fibroid embolization, when doctors destroy fibroids by blocking the arteries supplying them with blood. By the end of the study, 149 of the women, or 42 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 women had a total of 150 live births.  “Uterine embolization procedure is a controversial matter because it is still seen as a risk to fertility,” said lead study author Dr. Joao Martins Pisco, a researcher at New University of Lisbon.  “With this study we were able to verify that women who could not conceive due to uterine fibroids, once subjected to embolization, could have a normal pregnancy with a live newborn,” Martins Pisco said by email.  Uterine fibroids, abnormal masses of fiber and muscle tissue in the wall of the uterus, are one of the most common causes of infertility and pregnancy complications, the study team writes in the journal Radiology. Previous research has found that one out of every four women with fibroids has problems related to fertility.  The standard treatment is myomectomy, a surgery that involves cutting through the skin on the lower abdomen to reach the uterus and removing fibroids from the uterine wall. This procedure isn’t always effective, and it can sometimes lead to complications that require a hysterectomy - surgical removal of all or part of the uterus.  While embolization is less invasive and can be done in women who have already had a myomectomy, some doctors have avoided this option out of a concern that it may restrict blood flow to the lining of the uterus and ovaries, making it harder for women to have babies, researchers note.  In the current study, conducted at a single medical center in Portugal, about 32 percent of the women had at least one previous pregnancy and 20 percent had a live birth at least once before.  Overall, 79 percent of the women had an improvement in fibroid-related symptoms, the study found. About 15 percent of women had complications with partial embolization, when only small vessels to the fibroids are blocked, and roughly 23 percent had problems with full embolization, when all uterine artery branches are blocked.  In 28 cases, women needed repeat embolization procedures because the fibroids weren’t fully treated.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that embolization is better than other fibroid treatments. Another limitation is that all of the embolization procedures were done at a single site, making it possible that results would be different at other hospitals or surgical centers, the authors note.  Even so, the results suggest that women may want to consider embolization for fibroids when they’re struggling to conceive, especially if they want to avoid the risk of hysterectomy with more invasive fibroid surgery, Martins Pisco said.  Fibroids won’t always get in the way of conception, however, and women should be sure to rule out other causes of infertility if they are only considering surgery to improve their chances of having a baby, said Dr. Mikulas Redecha, a researcher at the University Hospital Bratislava in Slovakia who wasn’t involved in the study.  Women should also avoid putting off pregnancy, Redecha added by email.  “With increasing age, the chances for spontaneous conception decrease and the chance of developing a fibroid increases,” Redecha said. “If you have a fibroid, that does not automatically mean that getting pregnant spontaneously is impossible.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uKkpwR Radiology, online June 13, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-fibroids-fertility-idUSKBN19Q2PJ"},

The Australian's BMC Racing team took up the pressure of controlling the peloton all day long, expending energy in chasing a six-man breakaway - a move that in cycling often suggests the leader is going for the stage win.  If I was Richie Porte I would not announce to the whole peloton that I was going to attack,  LeMond, on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, told Reuters. Teams take control of the peloton when they want to set up a massive sprint or when they are defending the yellow jersey, for instance. Chris Froome's Team Sky had the yellow jersey on Geraint Thomas's shoulders and it would have normally be their responsibility to chase on a searing hot day in eastern France.  If you are good, save your team until the later part of the stage. I did not see the point of what they were doing,  said LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990. He suggested that BMC Racing should have let Sky handle the chase.  Leave it to the favorites, put the pressure on them,  he said.  He put the pressure on himself. Why do that? It's a three-week race and you're 16 days out, you have to save your team.  As a result, Porte was on his own midway through the final ascent while Froome still had five team mates around him.     While he was targeting the stage win, he had to be content with fourth place, just behind Froome and 20 seconds adrift of stage winner Fabio Aru of Italy.  Overall, Porte is fifth, 39 seconds behind Froome.  I don't understand that type of strategy,  said LeMond.   There are no bragging rights. At the end of the day, it's a three-week race.   LeMond said Aru could have a key role to play.  Fabio Aru could be a player, he could be a factor,  said LeMond.   His acceleration was a pretty good effort, it was a real win. He was exciting to see, Froome did not just let him go.  Sunday's ninth stage is a punishing trek in the Alps, featuring three out-of-category climbs and ending with a treacherous descent to Chambery, where Froome could be exposed should his rivals attack him relentlessly.  Porte and Aru will probably go for it,  said LeMond, adding that France's Romain Bardet, runner-up last year, should also be in contention.

That should push Chinese steelmakers to use more of the material in coming years, potentially sapping demand for steel ingredient iron ore from the world's biggest metals consumer. Faltering appetite for iron ore could hit a critical lifeline for international mining giants which have banked on China continuing to suck up hundreds of millions of tons of the most widely traded bulk commodity.   In the medium to long term, scrap is the real threat to iron ore, for sure,  said Daniel Meng, an analyst at brokerage CLSA in Hong Kong.   We believe by 2020, replacement would become faster and the risk on iron ore from scrap would become more serious.  China currently only produces around 11 percent of its steel from scrap, compared to over 70 percent in the United States, suggesting it may have plenty of room to grow in recycling the material. The recent abundance of scrap in China followed Beijing's decision to shut mills churning out low-quality steel from induction furnaces - typically big users of scrap - as part of its drive against pollution and a glut in steel supply. The closure of these mills, with a combined production capacity of 120 million tons, helped push the nation's scrap exports to an all-time high in May. China last year generated a record 143 million tons of steel scrap, up nearly fourfold from 2002, data from the World Steel Association and CLSA showed.  That could potentially replace around 200 million tons of iron ore, equivalent to about a fifth of China's imports of the commodity last year. China's steel scrap generation should rise to 200 million tons by 2020, the China Association of Metal Scrap Utilization said. Electrifying Steel rods are piled up at a scrap metal recycling yard at the edge of Beijing, China, September 21, 2016.Thomas PeterThe bulk of China's steel is produced via blast furnaces where iron ore is melted and later mixed with steel scrap.  As domestic scrap prices ST-SCCNDHV-MB tumbled 20 percent in May from this year's peak, mills increased scrap use in these furnaces to 20 percent from 8 percent, Chinese traders and mills said. But as demand picked up in June, some scrap traders say profits have doubled. And renewed interest in electric arc furnaces (EAFs), or mini-mills that use only scrap, could fire up demand for recycled steel. EAFs emit far less carbon than blast furnaces, which use coal as fuel, suiting China's anti-pollution campaign.  In the long term, I believe the authorities do support EAFs in China,  said Wang Guangrui, vice-general manager at Xuzhou Jinhong Steel Group in Jiangsu province, which restarted a 1-million-ton EAF. The company first launched its EAF in 2011, but was forced to shut it to switch to a much cheaper induction furnace. It moved back to the EAF after the closure of all the nation's induction furnaces. Up to 20 million tons in EAF capacity may be installed this year, said CLSA's Meng. China's current EAF capacity is around 100 million tons and could grow by 10-20 million tons a year over the next three years, he said. Over 60 EAFs will be running in August-October and 20 more next year, said Guo Xianzhen, vice general manager at Anyang Steel Group which plans to launch a 1-million-ton capacity EAF in September and another 1 million-ton plant in 2018. But Australia's Fortescue Metals Group (FMG.AX), the world's No. 4 iron ore miner, believes China's iron ore appetite won't wane any time soon, as its scrap supply - usually tied to growth in car ownership - remains low compared to the size of its population.  Currently, there are more than 700 vehicles per 1,000 people in the U.S. and Australia, with this figure at around 140 in China,  Fortescue CEO Nev Power said by email.  Given the high marginal cost of electricity, the level of scrap contribution will likely be lower overall in China than has been the case in the developed economies,  he said.  Top iron ore miners Vale (VALE5.SA), Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) (RIO.L) and BHP (BHP.AX) (BLT.L) declined to comment.

Tomic was touted as a future major champion in his homeland after winning a slew of boy's titles, including junior grand slam triumphs at the Australian and U.S. Opens, but his career has stalled and he remains without a title since 2015. Following the 6-3 6-4 6-3 loss to Germany's Zverev, Tomic conducted an unconventional news conference at the All England Club in which he detailed his struggles to stay motivated.  Tomic's attitude irked a lot of his fellow countrymen, including former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash, who said Australians were not pleased with either his performance or his comments.  He can do a lot worse than that to ruin the image that we've created. But a lot of ex-players are cringing, Aussies, especially... the guys who started this pro circuit. We wouldn't be here without these guys,  Cash told the BBC. Australian six-time grand slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs also expressed her anger at Tomic.  To say the things that he said in the press conference today is a disgrace,  Stubbs said.  You're an embarrassment to yourself, and not only to the sport but to Australian tennis.   Women's nine-time Wimbledon winner Martina Navratilova suggested that Tomic's comments were ungracious and suggested he  stay at home .  It's disrespectful to the sport and disrespectful to the history of the sport. If you can't get motivated at Wimbledon it's time to find another job,  Navratilova added.  The spectators paid good money to come here and watch Wimbledon and the guy shows up and doesn't try, he can't be bothered. Just stay at home.

A source close to the commercial rights holder said Formula One Management had offered to take over the race for five years, absorbing annual losses of between two and three million pounds ($2.5-$3.8 million). The offer, and another to delay the deadline to the end of the month to allow more time for negotiation, had proved insufficient. Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), fear the annual rise in hosting fees agreed with previous F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone exposes them to a  potentially ruinous risk . They have argued that the break clause would allow more favorable terms to be reached. Silverstone, which hosted the first Formula One world championship race in 1950, has a contract to 2026 with a break clause from 2019 that has to be exercised two years in advance. First practice for this year's race starts on Friday next week, with the teams competing in Austria this weekend. Sources on both sides told Reuters that an announcement was likely on Tuesday, the day before a big event involving Formula One cars, teams and drivers in central London's Trafalgar Square. Formula One's commercial managing director Sean Bratches, appointed after Liberty Media took over the sport in January, said the new owners recognized Silverstone was one of the  jewels in the crown . Even if goodwill has been eroded, he expressed optimism that Britain would on the calendar.  We have great ambition for the sport, and are determined to raise the bar as fans expect more from their race weekend,  Bratches said.  We need promoters who share that vision. We have three years to achieve that objective and are optimistic that a new fan-centric solution can be found.  A Silverstone spokesperson said on Monday that a final decision had not been taken. Media reports have indicated Silverstone will have to pay nearly 17 million pounds ($22 million) to host the race this year, rising to 26 million by the end of the contract.  That is still far less than most other venues, many of which receive state backing. Wednesday's event in London is aimed at raising the profile of the sport ahead of a race that drew a Sunday crowd of 139,000 last year and is a home grand prix for triple champion Lewis Hamilton.

The sources were speaking after a High Court judge heard legal arguments from Dana Gas and Deutsche Bank, which is representing investors in the Islamic bonds, or sukuk. Dana Gas declared the bonds invalid last month, saying they were no longer compliant with changing interpretations of the Islamic sharia code and had therefore become unlawful in the United Arab Emirates. The company said it was halting payments on the mudaraba-style sukuk and proposed that creditors exchange them for new Islamic bonds with lower profit distributions. The judge upheld an interim High Court injunction blocking holders of the bonds, which are due to mature in October, from enforcing claims related to the securities against Dana Gas, the sources said. However, he imposed restrictions on asset sales by Dana and its ability to raise more debt or pay dividends. He also ordered Dana to cancel an injunction in a court in the emirate of Sharjah and seek a stay of proceedings there, the sources said. Dana obtained that injunction, which blocks claims for payments on its sukuk, last month when it applied to the Sharjah court to have the bonds declared unlawful and unenforceable. The case has worried the Islamic finance industry as it has raised the prospect that other firms with Islamic debt could justify not honouring obligations by claiming sharia-based financial standards had changed since the debt was issued.

(Reuters) - A federal judge entered a not guilty plea on Wednesday on behalf of a Canadian man charged with stabbing a Michigan airport police officer in an attack federal investigators are probing as an act of terrorism. Amor Ftouhi, 49, of Montreal, was indicted on charges of committing an act of violence at an international airport and interference with airport security. The charges carry a maximum penalty of up to life in prison and $500,000 in fines.     Ftouhi was previously charged with stabbing officer Jeff Neville at the Bishop International Airport in Flint on June 21. Neville survived the attack.      Ftouhi's attorney, Joan Morgan, said during the brief hearing at the federal courthouse in Flint that her client would  stand mute,  meaning he would not enter a plea, so U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis entered the not guilty pleas for him.  Ftouhi, shackled and wearing a white T-shirt and orange pants, chanted in Arabic  Allahu akbar  ( God is greatest ) four times as he entered the courtroom on Wednesday afternoon and spoke again only to acknowledge he understood the charges and possible prison sentence he faced. Morgan and prosecutors did not speak to reporters after the hearing. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Linda Parker, but no future hearings were scheduled.

He appeared last week before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis at the federal courthouse in Flint. Ftouhi's attorney, Joan Morgan, said at the time that her client was not seeking bond because of an immigration hold that would bar Ftouhi from being freed even if bail was granted. Ftouhi legally entered the United States at Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Officials said Ftouhi targeted a city with an international airport, but declined to say why Flint was chosen. According to a criminal complaint, Ftouhi yelled  Allahu akbar  before stabbing Neville. He also said something to the effect of  You have killed people in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and we are all going to die,  the complaint said. Ftouhi attempted to buy a gun before the attack, but was unable to do so, the FBI said. The 12-inch (30.5 cm), serrated knife he used in the attack was bought in the United States, the FBI said.

Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan announced the plan on Wednesday, saying  House Democrats look forward to working with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to begin healing the wounds of the last several years.  A stalemate between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two-straight fiscal years. Since fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, the House and Senate in bipartisan votes passed a $36 billion fiscal 2018 spending plan and $5 billion income tax hike to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Rauner vetoed the trio of budget-related bills on Tuesday only to have that action quickly overridden by the Senate. The House will now attempt to follow suit and enact the budget and tax hike by overturning the governor's vetoes. The governor said he is working to sustain his vetoes.  I can tell you this,” Rauner told reporters on Chicago’s South side on Wednesday. “We are doing everything we can to push that my veto is not overridden. My veto should not be overridden.” He lashed out at those who defied his wishes by voting for the Madigan-backed budget package, including 15 House Republicans.  What we have is a continuing failure by elected officials in Springfield on both sides of the aisle that’s been led by Speaker Madigan for 35 years,” Rauner said. “This is more of the same. The system is broken.” House Republican Leader Jim Durkin told Reuters that he and Rauner are attempting to persuade the House Republicans who offered pivotal support for the Democratic tax hike to reconsider their backing because “there’s a better deal to be had,” but Durkin stopped short of predicting he and the governor could block the overrides. “I think the Democrats, if they want to get it done, find the votes,” Durkin said. “I’ve seen this before.” Durkin said he had no plans to take any punitive actions against those Republicans for voting as they did, but predicted “it’s definitely a possibility” some will face primary challenges from the Republican Party’s anti-tax wing in the 2018 elections. Illinois has relied on court-ordered and state-mandated spending to keep operating over the past two fiscal years. The lack of a fiscal 2018 budget shut down major transportation projects and forced the state out of the lucrative Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries. Meanwhile, long waits for state bill payments forced some social service providers to drastically scale back operations.

Brown has dined out on his second-round Wimbledon victory over Rafa Nadal two years ago, though he has never really since come close to reproducing the sustained brilliance that stunned the Spaniard and he lost 6-3 6-2 6-2 to top seed Murray. The Jamaican-turned German, with massive dreadlocks and a smile to match, nevertheless continues to play the game the way he likes, and the way very few others ever consider these days. Delicate sliced approaches, audacious drop shots from the baseline, thumping drive volleys from mid-court and lobs galore thrilled the crowd and made Murray work for everything, particularly in a well-balanced first set. Brown's problem, however, was that he missed as many as he made, gifting Murray points alongside those the defending champion had to work for to win. For a Wimbledon crowd who these days are usually served generally predictable baseline fare, it was a rare treat and a flashback to the glory days of John McEnroe et al, when deftness and cute angles could still outwit raw power.

The Russian, who had sensationally beaten U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka on Monday, suffered a meltdown on Court 16 following his 6-4 6-2 3-6 2-6 6-3 second-round loss to Ruben Bemelmans. After shaking hands with his conqueror, Medvedev grabbed his wallet and pulled out some coins before hurling them toward the foot of the umpire's chair. Unsurprisingly, he was bombarded with questions about the bizarre behavior, with some suggesting that he was questioning the integrity of the official.  In the heat of the moment, I did a bad thing. I apologize for this,  the 21-year-old Russian said. So was he trying to say the Portuguese umpire was biased toward his Belgian rival?   No, not at all. No, no. I mean (that) would be really stupid,  added Medvedev.  It has no meaning.  (It) was very hot out there. So I actually don't remember what I said during the match.  In an incident-packed clash, Medvedev asked a supervisor to remove Alves from the match after she had docked him a point.  Medvedev admitted he was frustrated with a call made by Alves in the fifth set and that while packing up his belongings after the match, he saw his wallet and snapped.  I don't know why I did it. I was frustrated to lose the match. Maybe there were some bad calls. It can happen in sports,  he said.  I was just disappointed and did a stupid thing.  Tournament officials could charge Medvedev with unsportsmanlike conduct or he could be hit with a more severe sanction if the circumstances prove serious enough. The episode was not the first time he has clashed with officials. Last year he was disqualified from a Challenger tournament in the United States for making a racist comment after the umpire ruled in favor of his opponent Donald Young.

The number of CME open-outcry trading pits has declined from 32 in 2007 to nine today. The trading of most products today including equities, currencies, U.S. Treasuries, and most commodities have all become highly complex and computer-driven.  Driving this change has been a massive shift to Automated Trading Systems (ATSs) or computer-driven trading. Computers have proven to be faster, cheaper, and more precise than humans. Therefore, regulators have also adapted to focus on the computer-driven nature of trading. Nearly every significant regulator has voiced concerns about the need for heightened monitoring of the practices and it has become a central component of market surveillance.  The U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has taken the lead in enforcement actions centered on  spoofing  where traders quickly, and often through the use of automated programs, place and quickly cancel orders in markets before execution. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have also brought enforcement cases. In 2016 FINRA also sent  report cards  for layering and spoofing activities to firms as a compliance tool to complement firms' supervisory systems to detect and deter manipulative conduct. Now the market operator Nasdaq, a self-regulatory-organization (SRO) with leading software for trade surveillance, has also voiced its warnings about spoofing. Below is an update on the regulatory focus on  spoofing  and recently published guidance on the subject from Nasdaq. Nasdaq Shines a Light on Spoofing  In early June Nasdaq published a white paper on spoofing. Alan Jukes, a former director of market surveillance at ICE Europe, and now Nasdaq's lead product manager focusing on alerts and alert logic wrote in the paper,  Currently it takes a fairly high level of understanding of the behavior, in order to determine if spoofing is happening at an organization. There might be alerts that are being generated, but because firms get so many alerts, it’s very difficult to identify the specific behavior, especially when looking for patterns over time.  To meet that challenge, Nasdaq built a visualization tool that helps it see regular and consistent patterns. Because the patterns repeat themselves every time  a 'spoofing' event took place, it could be considered a 'signature.' This 'signature' behavior would typically repeat itself over a trading session and comprise the following key characteristics:  -- Large orders on one side of the book only, deleted rapidly after trading on the other side: Trader does not display large orders on both sides of the book. If the intention is to mislead others, in order to move price, one must concentrate their orders on one side only, in order to drive the direction the other way. Once this has been achieved, the orders are removed. -- Position oscillation: The spoofing trader does not want to be exposed to market risk, so ensures that any position is rapidly closed out (often by spoofing on the opposite side). ‘Spoofing’ is not generally a directional strategy, so when position oscillation is present, it can be a reliable signature. -- Direction of trade is always contrary to the weight of orders shown: Large bids while selling, large asks while buying. -- Position size is not reflected by order size: The large ‘spoof’ orders greatly exceed the average position taken. The weight of orders are contrary to the direction of the trade, and the size of position will often be significantly smaller that the weight of orders being shown. Jukes wrote, the  ability to ‘see’ into the order-book in this way was a revelation. I was able to provide evidence to demonstrate the intent behind the trader’s actions, to provide a visual representation of the behavior, as well as other very detailed analysis, to provide a visual representation of the behavior, as well as other very detailed analysis.  A Nasdaq commercial technology division sells a technology solution called SMARTS Surveillance.  Nasdaq purchased SMARTS in 2010 and the product powers surveillance and compliance for 40 marketplaces, 11 regulators and 100 market participants across 65 markets globally,  said Jukes, who is product manager for SMARTS Surveillance.  SMARTS draws on financial and technology professionals experienced in market surveillance, supervision and compliance, Jukes said in an email. The system examines scenarios across multiple venues and asset classes and provides intuitive visualizations and alerts into an easily readable snapshot to identify potentially abusive instances. Nasdaq's Faqs on Disruptive Trading  Nasdaq has also published Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to disruptive trading practices (here) and the associated rule Chapter III (here), Section 24(g)(4) regarding disruptive trading practices. Compliance departments will find these FAQs helpful in better understanding spoofing and similar disruptive trading practices. The FAQs offer salient explanations in realistic trading scenarios involving cancelations trading mistakes, and definitions of terms such as  mislead  and  actionable and non-actionable  messages. The Cftc's Enforcement Efforts and Proposed Rules  Regulation Automated Trading (Reg AT) was first proposed by the CFTC in November 2015 and has gone through multiple supplements and comment periods with the most recent comment period closing in May 2017.  Acting CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo, formerly a minority commissioner and Republican appointee opposed the proposed rule and its supplements. Giancarlo explained his dissenting vote was primarily based on the source code repository issue. He also voiced his opposition at a roundtable held in June 2016(here), saying,  Regulation AT is a 20th century analog response to the 21st century digital revolution in trading markets.  Despite the uncertainty with Reg AT, the CFTC has strung together an impressive string of 8 successful cases involving spoofing. Most recently cases involving David Liew(here) and two traders at Citigroup were featured in Regulatory Intelligence (here). The CFTC and the largest futures exchange, the CME, were empowered to crack down on this activity under Section 747 of Dodd-Frank which amended the Commodity Exchange Act(here) making it unlawful for a person to engage in any trading, practice or conduct subject to the rules of a registered entity such as a futures exchange that  is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, 'spoofing' (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).  With this change in law after Dodd-Frank, civil and criminal enforcement authorities had a mandate, but the first challenge for prosecutors was to more precisely define spoofing. The CFTC published interpretive guidance in 2013 on spoofing and other disruptive trading practices. The CFTC guidance clarified that a spoofing violation requires a market participant to act with some degree of intent beyond recklessness. It also states that legitimate, good-faith cancellation or modification of orders or properly placed stop-loss orders would not be considered unlawful spoofing. In order to distinguish legitimate trading from spoofing, the CFTC would evaluate the market context, the person's pattern of trading activity including fill characteristics and other relevant facts and circumstances. The prohibition on spoofing covers  bid and offer activity on all products, traded on all registered entities.  The CFTC also provided examples of unlawful spoofing, such as creating an appearance of false market depth, delaying another participant's executions, activity that could overload the quotation systems, and submitting or canceling bids or offers with the intent to create artificial price movements upward or downward. The CFTC has also cautioned that a pattern of spoofing was unnecessary and that  even a single instance  could constitute a violation. Finra and the Sec's Enforcement Efforts  Although the CFTC has taken the U.S. lead in cracking down on spoofing, the equities markets face similar challenges with flash crashes and HFT and have many easy enforcement targets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is not far behind as the SEC Enforcement Division and FINRA have jointly brought a case involving a brokerage firm Lek Securities and its owner Sam Lek where the SEC alleged Lek failed to monitor Russian and East European high speed traders suspected of market manipulation(here). FINRA also brought a case against a dark pool operator (here) Lightspeed Trading fining the firm $250,000 over allegations it aided and abetted violations by three unregistered dealers and failed to take action when it suspected one of the dealers was employing a spoofing scheme. The SEC brought a case in 2015(here) involving Briargate Trading where the firm agreed to settle the charges of spoofing for more than $1 million in disgorgement and fines. Compliance Advice  Despite the uncertain future of the Reg AT, compliance departments must be aware that other areas similar to automated trading such as high frequency trading (HFT), the use of  dark pools,  spoofing, and best execution are all priorities with the enforcement divisions of regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC. It is also clear that Nasdaq is working with firms and exchanges with their SMARTS Surveillance technology to detect manipulative activities such as spoofing. Compliance professionals need to immediately brush up on trading as well as their algorithm and computer-programming knowledge. The signal from regulators in recent spoofing cases is that algorithms may need to be updated and should definitely be reviewed and monitored.  Compliance departments should develop, test, and monitor in real-time any algorithms and trading activity. They also need to test algorithms before they are used and have a real-time monitoring system for the trading algorithms in an attempt to make sure traders are entering trades correctly and following rules. Compliance departments should undertake a thorough review and be sure to gain a complete understanding of the programs or algorithms being used. A good starting point is to review Nasdaq's FAQs mentioned above as well as to look at risk controls. Firms may need to adopt controls such as pre-trade risk controls and order cancellation systems. With this increased awareness surrounding trading desks and quality of executions, compliance officers must review policies and procedures and stay abreast of the evolving and technology-driven trading landscape.  A review should begin by focusing on trading strategies that deploy algorithms, involve a high volume of market activity, and have lower fill rates. Firms should consider whether any activity could raise red flags for regulators, especially if trading algorithms call for cancellation of bids and offers and be sure to document the reasoning behind cancels. Spoofing is clearly a concern with essentially every regulator and SRO including Nasdaq and Nasdaq with their surveillance capabilities, including SMARTS Surveillance are on the lookout. --Nasdaq whitepaper  Visualizing the 'signature' of spoofing :here --Proposed Regulation Automated Trading (Reg AT):here --CFTC interpretive guidance:here (Todd Ehret is a Senior Regulatory Intelligence Expert for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

Crude prices fell more than 3 percent, ending their longest bull run in more than five years, hurt by a stronger dollar and concerns about rising OPEC exports.  Energy I have a real hard time getting excited about,  said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.  The technology has come along where the cost of production just keeps coming down and down.  Shares of Exxon and Chevron fell by more than 1 percent and were among the biggest drags on the Dow and S&P.; The S&P; energy index lost 2.1 percent and was the worst performing out of the 11 major S&P; sectors. A recent set of tepid economic data and an inflation rate below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target may have a bearing on the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rate hikes. New orders for U.S.-made goods fell more than expected in May, data showed on Wednesday, but capital equipment orders were slightly stronger than previously reported, suggesting the manufacturing sector remained on a path of moderate growth. Fed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how it will affect the future pace of rate increases, according to minutes of the Fed's latest policy meeting on June 13-14.  We’ve gotten a little bit of weaker economic data of late and we seem to have deflation starting to set in. That does call into question whether or not we are going to see as aggressive a Fed as they are telling us to expect,  said Phipps.

The tech sector's 1.11 percent rise led the S&P; 500 gainers, with Advanced Micro Devices, Micron and Nvidia among the best performers in the sector. The PHLX semiconductor index jumped 2.02 percent Technology shares have been volatile in recent weeks as the sector's strong run this year raised concerns about their valuation. The tech sector index is up more than 16 percent this year. O'Reilly Automotive plunged and was last down 18.81 percent to a near three-year low after its second-quarter same-store sales widely missed its own estimates. That move dragged down other auto-parts retailers, with Autozone down 9.07 percent and Advance Auto Parts down 11.62 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The idea, they said, is to create a  more level playing field .  Under European Union regulations, rating agencies including S&P; Global, Fitch, Moody's and DBRS have to set out their planned review dates for any country rated by an analyst based in Europe. ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority which regulates the agencies and brought in the rule, already requires the publication to be on a Friday evening after markets in the relevant region have closed. It has created some disparities, however. S&P; tends to publish most of its reviews between 5-6 pm London time (currently 1600-1700 GMT) whereas the other main agencies tend to publish theirs later.  For markets it has also created issues. U.S. trading is still in full flow when Europe's markets close, meaning futures and derivatives that can move on rating changes are still changing hands, potentially disadvantaging solely European-based investors.  It is part of the role as a regulator to ensure there is level playing field,  a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity told Reuters.  The source said nothing formal has been written down but the agencies had been made aware of what ESMA wanted. ESMA declined to comment on whether it had urged the changes. The rating agencies were first given the guidance in the middle of last week, a source at one of the firms told Reuters. A spokesman for S&P; would not comment on whether it had been told to push its publications to later on Friday evenings.  Fitch said it continued  to act in accordance with EU regulation around the publication of sovereign ratings.   Moody's said its  sovereign rating actions are published in accordance with our policy for sovereign ratings and our regulatory obligations.  DBRS said it was already following the guidance.  Despite ESMA pushing for the changes last week, some European reviews were still published just after Europe's main markets closed on Friday. But it expects the agencies to start falling in line, the first source said.  We hope to see some convergence (in timing of publications).

The Italian champion won the stage after pedaling clear 2.3km from the top of La Planche des Belles Filles, a steep ascent where Britian's Froome himself won in 2012, as did overall race winner Vincenzo Nibali in 2014. His stage win put Aru third in the overall classification, 14 seconds behind Froome, who took the leader's yellow jersey from Sky team mate Geraint Thomas.  Froome has shown that he is in excellent condition, much better than on the Dauphine (last month) where he did not seem to be at his level of the previous years,  said the 27-year-old from Sardinia.  But every time I will have the strength, I will not miss an opportunity to attack him.  Froome was left to regret that the chasing pack had given Aru too much space.  He attacked just at the right moment, before the last kick,  said the three-time Tour de France champion. Froome, in the words of rival Richie Porte, then 'did his usual squeeze', producing a brutal acceleration that dropped a few riders including Alberto Contador and Nairo Quintana, but mind games between the chasing pack ruined that effort as Aru remained clear. The Astana rider's team manager Alexandre Vinokourov was delighted with his performance.  It was an incredible experience to see him like this with the Italian champion jersey on his shoulders, just like Nibali in 2014,  said Vinokourov, who was also Nibali's team manager when he won the Tour in 2014.  It gives a lot of confidence.  Aggressive riders who challenged on Wednesday, such as Aru, AG2R La Mondiale's Romain Bardet and Dan Martin of the Quick-Step Floors team, will have another opportunity to unsettle  Froome on Sunday.

Brazilian banks have remained conservative, with limited risk appetite and restrained growth prospects. Even government owned banks, with outstanding loans that grew by 83 percent versus 22 percent for private bank peers between 2011 and 2014, decided to decelerate loan growth and reviewed their underwriting standards,  said Claudio Gallina, Senior Director.  However, the distressed loans market is gaining traction as in Portugal, Greece and other economies that have faced severe economic turbulence.  Domestically, the bulk of the impaired loans have already been written off from the banks' balance sheets. Fitch estimates that total outstanding distressed loans in Brazil are around BRL500 billion, including BRL122 billion of non-performing loans that are still registered on the banks' balance sheet. Both local international banks are entering the Brazilian market. For the lenders, benefits include short-term cash flow generation, reduction of tenor mismatches between assets and liabilities, and favorable tax treatments. For buyers, pricing and loss recovery prospects are the determining factors and depend on the type of loans, tenors, interest rates and guarantees. Nevertheless, on average, distressed loans have been sold at around three to four percent of their face value. The average profitability of distressed debt investing is around 30 percent in Brazil, a solid return considering it involves a collection service fee and consumes very little capital. Foreign banks have been increasingly interested in Brazilian distressed loans, especially the ones originated in the retail / residential mortgage portfolios, given the strong potential for recovery due to the loan guarantees. The acquisition of Brazilian bank non-operating assets is another growing market. The bulk of transactions are foreclosed real estate owned by banks following the recovery of the collateral backing residential mortgage loans. Banks normally aim to reduce their foreclosed assets, given their high capital consumption, as well as the relatively high administrative and maintenance costs. While local players are actively managing distressed loans, international players are encountering challenges specific to Brazil with both distressed loans and non-operating assets. Complex contract structures, local characteristics of ownership and registration of guarantees, cumbersome notary procedures, and compliance issues are among the main difficulties. Executing partnerships with local players is a common, though still new, solution. Contact: Claudio Gallina Senior Director +55-11-4504-2216 Fitch Ratings Brasil Ltda.

Reuters was unable to determine if Siemens knew of or condoned the equipment transfer, but the move exposes the German company to potential accusations of indirect sanctions-busting and of not taking sufficient safeguards to ensure its equipment does not end up on territory most countries view as illegally annexed, say legal experts.   Siemens has not delivered turbines to Crimea and complies with all export control restrictions,  said Wolfram Trost, a spokesman for Siemens in Munich, when asked to confirm the turbine transfer to Crimea. Citing client confidentiality, he did not answer written questions asking whether Siemens was aware that the turbines had been shipped to Crimea and whether it would now be activating or servicing them. Russia needs the turbines for two Crimean power plants the Kremlin wants to get up and running to fulfill a promise, made by President Vladimir Putin, to ensure a stable power supply for the region's residents after it was annexed by Moscow from Ukraine in 2014. Delivery of the turbines, intended for the two new power stations under construction, had been delayed for over a year because the firms involved feared violating EU sanctions, people involved in the project have told Reuters. Russia's Energy Ministry, which oversees the Crimea power plants project, declined to comment. It referred questions to Technopromexport, the Russian state-owned firm which is building the plants. Technopromexport declined to comment. One source close to the project, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, told Reuters that two of the turbines had been delivered from Russia by sea to Crimea. He said they were destined for use in a power plant in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. He said the turbines were unloaded at Sevastopol port, and that preparatory work was underway at the power plant site to install and commission the turbines. The turbines were SGT5-2000E gas turbines, he said, a type manufactured only by Siemens and its subsidiaries. Russia or Crimea? An official in Crimea's energy sector who is familiar with the power plants project, and an employee with a company involved in the project, also said the turbines were Siemens turbines, and that they had been delivered to Crimea. EU sanctions bar European individuals and companies from providing energy technology to Crimea or from taking any actions designed to circumvent those rules due to the bloc's view that the peninsula was illegally stolen from Ukraine.  Legal experts say there are no court precedents to say whether Siemens could be held responsible if a third party brought the turbines to Crimea.  When asked about the matter, the European Commission has declined to comment on the Siemens case in the past, saying it is up to EU member states to enforce sanctions rules on their companies. When asked about the issue on Wednesday, a spokesman for German's Ministry for Economic Affairs said he had no immediate comment. The individual close to the project and the official in the Crimea energy sector told Reuters the turbines delivered to the port in Sevastopol had come from Taman, located in southern Russia, some 10 miles (16 km) from Crimea. Siemens told reporters in March that a Russian joint venture in which it has a majority stake supplied turbines for use in a power plant that was planned for construction in Taman. [nL5N1GT60D] The joint venture, Gas Turbine Technologies LLC, made the turbines that were sent to Taman at its factory in the Russian city of St Petersburg. Siemens has a 65 percent share in the joint venture, and Russian company Power Machines has a 35 percent stake. The sanctions barring the supply of energy technology to Crimea do not apply to the Taman project because it is located on internationally recognized Russian territory. The turbines for the Taman plant were bought by Technopromexport - the same company building the two Crimea plants - because, it previously said, it would be building the plant in Taman. Sources close to the Crimean project have previously told Reuters that one of the options under consideration was to use the Taman turbines in Crimea. Asked about that possibility last year, Siemens said it was supplying the turbines only for use in Taman, and not in Crimea. It said at the time it had  no reason  to believe the turbines would be diverted to Crimea, and said it respected and would abide by the sanctions regime.

The ship named San Jose, thought by historians to be carrying one of the largest unsalvaged maritime treasures, sank in 1708 near the historical Caribbean port of Cartagena, and its wreckage was located in 2015.   The discovery of this ship - one of the most important that navigated in our seas during colonial times - begins a new chapter in the cultural and scientific history, not only of Colombia, but of the entire world,  Santos said on national television from Cartagena.   Questions about navigation, world trade, about colonial costs, will be answered.   The government will accept further offers to recover the ship and its treasure, Santos said. A museum will be built to showcase artifacts found in the wreckage.  Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos speaks in Cartagena, Colombia July 5, 2017.

Some 600 people died in the shipwreck when an English fleet engaged the galleon in a gun fight. A team of international experts, the Colombian navy and the country's archaeology institute discovered the wreck in 2015. The San Jose was the subject of a legal dispute between Colombia and Sea Search Armada, a U.S.-based salvage company, which said in 1981 it had located the area where the ship sank. The company and the government agreed to split any proceeds from the wreckage, but the government later said all treasure would belong to Colombia, a view that was backed by a U.S. court in 2011.

The benchmark price for all types of residential properties in Metro Vancouver was C$998,700 ($769,240) in June, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said in a report. That marks an increase of 1.8 percent from the previous month and a gain of 7.9 percent from June last year. The once-hot market of Vancouver, the country's most expensive, has seen sales slow as it adjusts to a foreign buyers tax put in place by the provincial government last August amid concern that speculation from overseas buyers was leading to a housing bubble. Sales fell 11.5 percent in June from a year ago when a record number of homes were sold, the industry group said. Sales were also down 10.8 percent on a monthly basis, though they were still 14.5 percent above the 10-year sales average for June. Condominium prices were being lifted by multiple offers from competing buyers, while demand for detached homes has eased to more typical levels, Jill Oudil, the real estate board's president, said in a statement. Prices for detached homes were up 1.4 percent from last June, while the benchmark price for apartments jumped 17.6 percent.

Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, all hoping to join the European Union, will launch the project at a meeting with EU officials and financial institutions next week in Trieste, EBRD Vice President Pierre Heilbronn said. The aim is to create a single market of 20 million people with support from the EBRD, which has so far invested 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in the region. Heilbronn said removing trade barriers would be the fisrt step in an initiative the EBRD and its stakeholders hope will re-engage Balkan states unnerved by the EU's fading enthusiasm for enlargement and exposed to the growing influence of Russia. When asked what would was necessary to make the scheme work, he said:  To have as little as political interference as possible, to be as pragmatic and as practical as you can be at the same time you need ownership by the government ... and EU presence is important.   Investors we meet every day have competing choices for their investment, they look at Asia ... and in the Western Balkans they see small countries with different rules,  Heilbronn said by phone.  This region is very important for Europe,  he said. However, not all Western Balkan countries are wholly supportive of the idea. Kosovo fears being roped back into a Serbian-dominated union of the kind it fought to leave. Others worry it will only slow their accession to the EU, or worse still replace it.

Kurtulmus was responding to the head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, who told Reuters that Turkish military deployments near Kurdish-held areas of northwestern Syria were a declaration of war which could trigger clashes within days. The YPG forms a major part of the U.S.-backed campaign to capture Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa. It also controls a pocket of territory in Afrin, about 200 km (125 miles) west of Raqqa. Tensions between Turkish forces and the YPG have been mounting in the Afrin region in recent weeks.  This is not a declaration of war. We are making preparations against potential threats,  Kurtulmus said in an interview.  It's ... a legitimate measure so that we can protect our independence. We cannot remain silent against those sending missiles from Afrin.  Turkey's military, which launched an incursion last August into part of northern Syria which lies between Afrin and a larger Kurdish-controlled area further east, has said that it has returned fire against members of YPG militia near Afrin several times in the last few weeks.  Their (YPG) primary goal is a threat to Turkey, and if Turkey sees a YPG movement in northern Syria that is a threat to it, it will retaliate in kind,  Kurtulmus said.  Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus attends an interview with Reuters in Ankara, Turkey, July 5, 2017.Umit Bektas This isn't a fantasy for us...it is an indispensable approach to protect Turkey's border security.  Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK group which has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey since the 1980s. Turkey was angered by a U.S. decision to arm the YPG as it marched with it allies on Raqqa. Slideshow (3 Images)The Turkish defense ministry said last month the Pentagon had sought to give assurances that Washington would retrieve weapons provided to the YPG after Islamic State fighters were defeated. Turkey says that is not credible.   There has never been an incident where a group in the Middle East has been armed, and they returned the weapons,  Kurtulmus said. The United States  have formed more than a terrorist organization there, they formed a small-scale army.  He also warned the YPG not to try to drive out Arab or Turkmen residents from the town of Tel Rifaat, which is close to Afrin and controlled by YPG and Arab allies in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.  The majority of Tel Rifaat is Arab and Turkmen, and if the PYD says it will capitalize on (its control), then this means ethnic cleansing, and this will not benefit Syria,  he said.

This is a great threat and provocation,  Moon said at a joint news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who echoed his call for consideration of more sanctions. Moon said he would use the G20 summit of the world biggest developed and developing economies in Hamburg this week to drum up support for tougher sanctions against Pyongyang.  North Korea should stop (their missile program) immediately...We should work on more sanctions,  he said. But he also stressed that problems with North Korea had to be resolved through peaceful diplomacy.

For a full text, see here  In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains had moderated but had been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate had declined. Household spending had picked up in recent months, and business fixed investment had continued to expand.   Inflation on a 12-month basis had declined recently and was running somewhat below 2 percent. The measure of inflation excluding food and energy prices was likewise running somewhat below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.  With respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further. Inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term, but almost all members expected it to stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term, although they were monitoring inflation developments closely. Members continued to judge that there was significant uncertainty about the effects of possible changes in fiscal and other government policies but that near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared roughly balanced, especially as risks related to foreign economic and financial developments had diminished.  After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, all but one member agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.   Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal.They expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and they agreed that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.   The Committee also decided to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee expected to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program in 2017, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated. This program, which would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities, was described in an addendum to the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans to be released after this meeting.

On balance, the incoming data on aggregate spending were a little stronger than the staff had expected, and the forecast of real GDP growth for the current year was a bit higher than in the previous projection. Beyond this year, the projection for real GDP growth was essentially unchanged. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019, supported in part by the staff’s maintained assumption that fiscal policy would become more expansionary in the coming years. The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period.   The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by the change in the PCE price index, was revised down slightly for 2017 because of the weaker-than-expected incoming data for inflation. However, the projection was little changed thereafter, as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory. Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports. The staff projected that inflation would increase further in the next couple of years, and that it would be close to the Committee’s longer-run objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019.    The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. Many financial market indicators of uncertainty were subdued, and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook appeared to have subsided further, on balance, since late last year; these developments were judged as counterweights to elevated measures of economic policy uncertainty. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP and the unemployment rate as balanced; the staff’s assessment was that the downside risks associated with monetary policy not being well positioned to respond to adverse shocks had diminished since its previous forecast. The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as roughly balanced. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.  MAY 2-3 FOMC: Minutes released on May 24:  In the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the May FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was projected to bounce back in the second quarter from its weak first-quarter reading. The staff judged that the weakness in first-quarter real GDP was probably not attributable to residual seasonality and that it instead reflected transitorily soft consumer expenditures and inventory investment. Importantly, PCE growth was expected to pick up to a stronger pace in the spring, w hich would be more consistent with ongoing gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth. In addition, the sharp decrease in the contribution to GDP growth from the change in inventory investment in the first quarter was not expected to be repeated. Beyond the near term, the forecast for real GDP growth was a little stronger, on net, than in the previous projection, mostly due to the effect of a somewhat lower assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019, supported in part by the staff’s maintained assumption that fiscal policy would become more expansionary in the coming years. The unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to run somewhat below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period; the staff’s estimate of the natural rate was revised down slightly in this forecast.  The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by changes in the PCE price index, was revised down marginally for 2017 as a whole after incorporating the soft data on consumer prices for March, but it was essentially unrevised thereafter. Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports as well as a slightly faster increase in energy prices. The staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually in 2018 and 2019 and that it would be marginally below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019.  The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to respond to large positive shocks to the economic outlook than to substantial adverse ones. However, the staff viewed the risks to the forecast as less pronounced than late last year, with both somewhat diminished risks to the foreign outlook and an increase in U.S. consumer and business confidence. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. The risks to the projection for inflation were judged to be roughly balanced. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.  MARCH 14-15 FOMC: Minutes released on April 5:  In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, the near-term forecast for real GDP growth was a little weaker, on net, than in the previous projection. Real GDP was expected to expand at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter, reflecting some data for January that were judged to be transitorily weak, but growth was projected to move back up in the second quarter. The staff maintained its assumption -— provisionally included starting with the December 2016 forecast -— of a more expansionary fiscal policy in the coming years, but it pushed back the timing of when those policy changes were anticipated to take effect. The negative effect of this timing change on projected real GDP growth through 2019 was offset by a higher assumed path for equity prices and by a lower assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar. All told, the staff’s forecast for the level of real GDP at the end of 2019 was essentially unrevised from the previous forecast, and the staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019. The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2019 and to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection.  The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation, as measured by changes in the PCE price index, was unchanged for 2017 as a whole and over the next couple of years. The staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually over this period, as food and energy prices, along with the prices of non-energy imports, were expected to begin steadily rising this year. However, inflation was projected to be slightly below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019.  The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to respond to large positive shocks to the economic outlook than substantial adverse ones. However, the staff viewed the risks to the forecast as less pronounced than in the recent past, reflecting both somewhat diminished risks to the foreign outlook and an increase in U.S. consumer and business confidence over recent months. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand,the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly  balanced. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.  JAN. 31-FEB. 1 FOMC: Minutes released on Feb. 22:   In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for this FOMC meeting, the near-term forecast was little changed from the December meeting. Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was estimated to have been a little faster than the staff had expected in December, and the pace of economic growth in the first half of this year was projected to be essentially the same as in the fourth quarter. The staff’s forecast for real GDP growth over the next several years was little changed. The staff continued to project that real GDP would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in 2017 through 2019. The unemployment rate was forecast to edge down gradually through the end of 2019 and to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate; the path for the unemployment rate was little changed from the previous projection.   The staff’s forecast for consumer price inflation was unchanged on balance. The staff continued to project that inflation would increase over the next several years, as food and energy prices, along with the prices of non-energy imports, were expected to begin steadily rising either this year or next. However, inflation was projected to be marginally below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent in 2019.  The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, primarily reflecting the staff’s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones. However, the staff viewed the risks to the forecast from developments abroad as less pronounced than in the recent past. Consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. The risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced. The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.

But when it comes to whistleblowers, defining who qualifies for which protections isn’t Dodd-Frank’s only inconsistency.  A new decision by a federal judge in Madison, Wisconsin, exposes a weird discrepancy in how Dodd-Frank deals with whistleblowers whose employment contracts include mandatory arbitration provisions. As it turns out, the law explicitly says whistleblowers cannot be forced to arbitrate anti-retaliation claims under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act – but Dodd-Frank does not specifically address whether employers can compel whistleblowers to arbitrate their anti-retaliation claims under Dodd-Frank itself.  The only federal circuit to have looked at this peculiarity, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, held in 2014’s Khazin v. TD Ameritrade that Dodd-Frank language invalidating mandatory arbitration agreements for SOX whistleblowers does not extend to whistleblowers who sue under Dodd-Frank. The upshot, according to the 3rd Circuit (and similarly-minded federal trial courts in Los Angeles and Manhattan): Whistleblowers who claim they’re entitled to Dodd-Frank’s enhanced procedural and back pay provisions can be forced into arbitration, even though Dodd-Frank itself protects the right to sue for whistleblowers with claims under the less generous Sarbanes-Oxley Act. (One trial judge, U.S. District Judge Janet Hall of Connecticut, ruled in 2015’s Wiggins v. ING that Dodd-Frank requires litigation of whistleblower claims under the law itself, but she’s so far the only judge to have reached that conclusion.)  The Wisconsin whistleblower’s case decided last month presented a different wrinkle. Michael Wussow sued his former employer, the scientific instrument maker Bruker Corporation, for firing him after he complained to his colleagues and bosses about the company’s revenue recognition practices. Wussow, who is represented by Fox & Fox, asserted anti-retaliation claims under both Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank. His case, according to U.S. District Judge William Conley of Madison, is the first in the 7th Circuit (and apparently the third in the country) in which a judge had to decide the implications of Dodd-Frank’s internal tension on arbitrability in a case involving whistleblower claims under both SOX and Dodd-Frank.  The judge agreed with Bruker’s lawyers from Nixon Peabody and Axley Brynelson that Wussow’s arbitration agreement requires him to arbitrate his Dodd-Frank whistleblower allegations. Like the 3rd Circuit in the Khazin case, Judge Conley pointed out that Dodd-Frank’s amendment of Sarbanes-Oxley to invalidate mandatory arbitration was an entirely different part of the law than the enhanced protections for whistleblowers who report misconduct to the government. Nothing in Dodd-Frank’s text “introduced or applied” a prohibition on mandatory arbitration for those whistleblowers, the judge held.  But the judge also refused Bruker’s motion to stay the entire case until the conclusion of arbitration of Wussow’s Dodd-Frank claims. Acknowledging that the statute allows Wussow to litigate his SOX anti-retaliation case, Judge Conley said deferring to arbitration “would be effectively denying plaintiff the right to a federal forum in substantial part (if not entirely).”  Bruker lawyer Bonnie Glatzer of Nixon Peabody said the split outcome is “the worst of all possible worlds” for both sides. Bruker doesn’t get the benefit of its arbitration agreement because it has to litigate the SOX claim. Wussow still has to arbitrate the Dodd-Frank claim – assuming, of course, that the Supreme Court decides employees who report up the corporate chain qualify as Dodd-Frank whistleblowers. And even the court, Glatzer said, has to expend resources to conduct litigation exactly paralleling an arbitration proceeding.  I asked Glatzer whether she thought Congress intentionally created the divergence between SOX and Dodd-Frank whistleblowers when it comes to arbitration of their claims. “How can I answer that?” she said. “You would think someone would have put more thought into it….The discrepancy doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense.”  That’s for sure. It also means plaintiffs lawyers should think about following the lead of Wussow’s lawyers and suing under both SOX and Dodd-Frank if they want to stay out of arbitration – a tactic defendants aren’t going to like at all.  Wussow lawyer Mary Kennelly of Fox & Fox declined to comment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-otc-doddfrank-idUSKBN19Q2KL"},

True Religion became a part of popular culture a decade ago as celebrities donned the denim and hip hop artists cited the brand in songs. Under True Religion's plan, its lenders will receive most of the equity in the reorganized company, whose debt load will fall by $350 million to $140 million. The company aims to exit bankruptcy in about four months, according to court papers. True Religion's owner, private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners, has also approved the company's bankruptcy plans.  We are taking an important step to reduce our debt, reinvigorate True Religion's iconic brand and position the company for future growth and success,  True Religion Chief Executive John Ermatinger said in a statement. The company's restructuring plan provides for full payment of claims of its continuing trade creditors, which includes vendors, suppliers and landlords. True Religion has 128 retail stores, whose sales make up almost 75 percent of its total net sales for its most recent fiscal year. The company also sells its denim through department stores including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Sakes Fifth Avenue. The Manhattan Beach, California-based retailer secured a debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan from Citizens Bank for up to $60 million.

There is evidence that children whose parents divorce are at increased risk for illness both during their childhood and as adults,  said lead study author Michael Murphy, a psychology researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.   However, our study indicates that parental separation itself may not account for this increased risk,  Murphy said by email.  This is important because parental divorce is a common experience, affecting more than a million children annually in the United States alone.  For the study, researchers quarantined 201 healthy adults, exposed them to a virus that causes a common cold and monitored them for five days to see how their immune systems reacted and if they developed a respiratory illness.  Adults whose parents lived apart and never spoke during their childhood were more than three times as likely to develop a cold as participants who grew up in two-parent households, the study found. However, adults whose parents separated but communicated with each other were no more likely to catch a cold than people who came from intact families.  People whose parents separated and stopped speaking were 3.3 times more likely to develop a cold than people whose parents remained together during their childhood, the study found. These people also had higher levels of a marker of inflammation, which might help explain why they were more susceptible to catching a cold, the researchers speculate. Participants in the study were about 30 years old on average, and 92 of them, or 46 percent, reported that their parents had divorced or separated during their childhood. Among the people with separated parents, 51 said their parents weren't on speaking terms.  All of them were given nasal drops containing rhinovirus 39 (RV39), a virus that causes the common cold.  Then, for the next five days, researchers collected nasal secretions to check for evidence of the virus and inflammation as well as to assess how much mucus people produced and how congested they were.  Overall, 149 participants, or 74 percent, developed an infection with RV39 and 60 people met the criteria for a cold based on having both an infection and objective symptoms, researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Limitations of the study include its reliance on participants to accurately recall and report on whether their parents communicated after a separation, the authors note. Even though researchers accounted for a number of factors that can influence the odds of catching a cold such as medical and psychiatric history and prescription use, it's still possible something other than divorce or parents' communication influenced the results.   Although it's natural to suggest there's a causal process in play here from early parental divorce to later health, it's just as likely that the children of adults who never spoke with each other after their separation share many of the same personality dispositions as their parents - perhaps hostility, addiction or depression - and it is these variables that actually place the young adults at greater risk for colds,  David Sbarra, a psychology researcher at the University of Arizona who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.  Even so, the findings add to growing evidence linking divorce-related stress to an increased risk of physical health problems, said Sharlene Wolchik, a psychology researcher at Arizona State University who also wasn't involved in the study.   The good news is that we know a fair amount about the protective factors that reduce this risk,  Wolchik said by email.  When divorce is followed by a new family structure in which parents have high quality relationships with their children, children spend sufficient time with each parent so their relationships can be meaningful and children are not directly or indirectly exposed to conflict between the parents, children can be resilient and thrive despite the stress of divorce.

Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus retorted that his country was not declaring war but that its forces would respond to any hostile move by the YPG, which he described as a small-scale army formed by the United States. The mounting tensions between two U.S. allies in northwestern Syria risk opening yet another front in the multi-sided conflict, in which outside powers are playing ever greater roles. They could also distract the YPG from the U.S.-backed campaign to capture Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa, some 200 km (125 miles) away. The YPG is spearheading that campaign. Asked by Reuters whether he expected a conflict with Turkey in northern Syria, where the two sides have exchanged artillery fire in recent days, YPG Commander Sipan Hemo accused Turkey of preparing for a major military campaign in the Aleppo and Afrin area.  These (Turkish) preparations have reached level of a declaration of war and could lead to the outbreak of actual clashes in the coming days,  he said in emailed comments.  We will not stand idly by against this potential aggression.  Turkey's policy in northern Syria has been focused on containing the growing sway of Kurdish groups that have established autonomous regions since Syria's war began in 2011. Ankara says the YPG represents a security threat, seeing it as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been fighting an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. Turkish forces deployed in northern Syria last year in support of Ankara-backed Free Syrian Army rebel groups in an operation that forced Islamic State away from the border and at the same time drove a wedge between YPG-held areas. In recent weeks, Turkey has sent reinforcements into the area north of Aleppo, according to Turkey-backed rebel groups who have established control over a section of the Turkish-Syrian frontier with Ankara's support.  This is not a declaration of war. We are making preparations against potential threats,  Kurtulmus told Reuters in an interview.  Their (YPG) primary goal is a threat to Turkey, and if Turkey sees a YPG movement in northern Syria that is a threat to it, it will retaliate in kind.   Hemo was last week cited as saying the YPG had a plan to capture that area between the towns of Azaz and Jarablus. Asked about that remark, he described the Turkish intervention as  occupation  of Syrian land, and said the YPG had never  threatened Turkey or its security . Long-Term Plans Turkey, a NATO member, has been incensed by the U.S. decision to ally with the YPG. Washington took the decision to arm the group before the final assault on Raqqa began in June. The YPG is fighting under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes Arab fighters. In separate comments to the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper published on Wednesday, Hemo said the United States had established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria controlled by the YPG or SDF, including a major airbase near Kobani, a town at the border with Turkey. Citing operational security, the coalition said it did not confirm or deny information about  specific capabilities, force numbers, locations or movement of forces in Iraq and Syria . Hemo indicated the YPG would keep fighting Islamic State even after its defeat in Raqqa, saying it was committed with  the international coalition to cleansing Syria of terrorism and establishing a political system capable of achieving real democratic transformation . Turkish defense ministry sources said last month the United States had pledged that weapons provided to the YPG would be taken back once Islamic State was defeated. Turkey says that is not credible.   There has never been an incident where a group in the Middle East has been armed, and they returned the weapons,  Kurtulmus said. The United States  have formed more than a terrorist organization there, they formed a small-scale army.  He also warned the YPG not to try to drive out Arab or Turkmen residents from the town of Tel Rifaat, which is close to Afrin and controlled by YPG and Arab allies in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has left open the possibility of longer-term assistance to the YPG, saying the U.S. may need to supply them with weapons and equipment even after the capture of Raqqa. Hemo said U.S. officials had denied any intention to take away the YPG's weapons and that the YPG would be needing more support due to its longer-term plans to tackle the remnants of Islamic State.

Using a technique known as cryo-electron microscopy, a team from Britain's Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology mapped in fine detail the tau filaments extracted from the brain of a patient who had died with Alzheimer's. The most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's is characterised by two types of abnormal protein which form lesions or clumps in the brain. Tau forms filaments inside nerve cells and amyloid-beta forms filaments outside. In healthy brains tau protein normally helps brain cells to function but in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease tau clumps up in tangles inside the cells.  Knowing which parts of tau are important for filament formation is relevant for the development of drugs,  said Sjors Scheres, who co-led the research. Since many pharmaceutical companies are using different parts of tau to test the effect of potential drugs on filament formation, this new knowledge  should significantly increase the accuracy of such tests,  he said. Specialists not directly involved in the study, which was published in the journal Nature, said its findings would prove extremely important in future.  This study could take us into a new era of drug design,  said James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society medical charity - although he noted it can take 10 to 15 years to develop new medicines from this early stage of discovery. John Hardy, a professor of neuroscience at University College London said the work was a  tour de force  which  will help us understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's .

They were charged with participating in activities of a terrorist group,  prosecutors said of the two detained. In the same operation, which was conducted in cooperation with French police, a fifth person was detained across the border in northern France. Police had searched four houses and two garages overnight in the Anderlecht district of Brussels. In one garage they found three Kalashnikovs, ammunition, other firearms and four detonators, the prosecutors said. Police also found a blue police beacon, a security agency uniform, two police uniforms and a civil protection service uniform, suggesting that the group may have been planning an attack disguised as security forces.  Earlier Belgian state broadcasters said those arrested had links to a group called the Kamikaze Riders, a motor bike group based in the city whose members are mostly of North African origin and previously linked to jihadist groups. They had plans to carry out an attack, Flemish-language broadcaster VRT said, citing sources, adding those plans were still at a very early stage and no specific target had yet been chosen. There was no official confirmation of links to the Kamikaze Riders.

The people said Oaktree would pay 170 million reais ($51 million) for Light SA's 16 percent stake in Renova and spend another 1.2 billion reais to dilute Renova's controlling bloc. It also involves the refinancing of Renova bank loans maturing this year, freeing up collateral, the people said.     Los Angeles-based Oaktree [OAKCP.UL], the world's biggest distressed debt investor, is competing with Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) for Renova. Late on Tuesday, Renova confirmed a July 3 report by Reuters that Brookfield has made a non-binding proposal for control of the company.  Under the terms of that proposal, Light would get 200 million reais for the stake it has in Renova, which would also get 800 million reais in fresh capital. Newfound interest in Renova underscores a view among foreign investors that Brazil's renewable power industry remains resilient even as consumption suffers with the country's worst recession ever. Peer Omega Geração SA could raise up to 2 billion reais in an initial public offering slated to price this month     Renova and Oaktree, which oversees about $100 billion in assets, did not have an immediate comment. Light declined to comment. Units of Renova (RNEW11.SA), a blend of Renova's common and preferred shares, have jumped almost 30 percent since January 2 when Reuters first reported that the company could be taken over. That compares with a 4.5 percent gain in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP. According to one of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter, both non-binding bids from Brookfield and Oaktree would give equal treatment to minority shareholders. The so-called tag along will be based on the proportion of common and preferred shares contained in Renova's units - the company's most widely traded class of stock, the person said.     Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. By injecting capital, a new buyer would give Light (LIGT3.SA) the chance to exit Renova and reduce the stakes held by the other two members of Renova's controlling bloc - CiaEnergética de Minas Gerais SA (CMIG4.SA) and RR Participações SA.    Cemig and RR Participações declined to comment.    A transaction with Oaktree could reduce Renova's short-term debt by 6 percent while bolstering capital at least 13 percent, depending on the conclusion of the Alto Sertão III windfarm project, the same person said. Oaktree could opt to refinance Renova's short-term debt or just a loan with state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA, the person said.    Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc (SUNEQ.PK) collapsed weeks before the latter filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.    Reuters first reported in April last year that Renova has been looking for a partner and fresh capital.

The world's oldest bank said on Wednesday it expected a net profit of more than 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2021, from a loss of 3.2 billion euros last year, as part of a restructuring plan approved by European authorities.   It's a conservative plan. We're not shooting at unrealistic targets,  Chief Executive Marco Morelli told analysts on a conference call to present the new plan.  Morelli said no mergers were planned at the moment.  There is no Plan B on the table,  he said. Burdened by bad loans and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has for years been at the forefront of Italy's slow-brewing banking crisis. Italy's fourth-largest lender was forced to request state aid in December after its attempt to raise capital from private investors failed.  On Tuesday the European Union approved a 5.4 billion euro state bailout after it agreed to a drastic overhaul in a move that will leave Rome holding around 70 percent of the bank. EU officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Italy would have to exit the bank at the latest by the end of the 5-year plan.  What we experienced in the last nine months is pretty much unheard of: It's like an ER department with an emergency every five minutes,  Morelli said. Italy has pledged more than 20 billion euros of taxpayer money in the space of a week to rescue three of its banks, but the country's wider financial sector is still weighed down by around 300 billion euros of non-performing loans (NPLs). At the end of last month, Rome committed up to 17 billion euros to rescue regional banks Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca though it said the final bill would be much lower, adding the state might even turn a profit from the bailouts.  FILE PHOTO: The entrance of Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank's headquarters is seen in Siena, Italy, July 1, 2016.Stefano Rellandini/File Photo The Monte Paschi plan looks good but we need to see execution. Still, coming after the Veneto rescues it settles nerves about Italy's banking system,  said Zenit fund manager Stefano Fabiani. Path to Profit In its 2017-2021 plan, Monte dei Paschi sees a headcount reduction of around 5,500 to just over 20,000 and a fall in the number of branches to around 1,400 from some 2,000 in 2016 as it seeks to ensure the lender is profitable in the long term. It expects to reach a return on equity of more than 10 percent in 2021 while its CET1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, is seen at 14.7 percent from 8.2 percent in 2016.  Crucially, the bank will sell 28.6 billion euros of gross bad loans, of which 26.1 billion will be securitized through a transfer to a privately funded vehicle on market terms, with the operation partially funded by bank rescue fund Atlante II. The bank said it would sell securitized notes to Atlante II at 21 cents on the euro.  We are in line if not slightly above recent market transactions,  Morelli said. The CEO, who expects the bank's shares to relist in the second half of September, said 5.5 billion euros in deposits were recovered in the first quarter, adding liquidity was no longer an issue.  The bank managed to stay alive,  he said, referring to the close shadowing of the lender by European authorities.  We negotiated the plan with the EU Commission line by line.   Rome is under the spotlight for taking advantage of exceptions in EU rules designed to stop the use of taxpayer money to deal with bank crises. Policymakers now want Italy to come up with a solution for tackling NPLs without requiring any more government money to prop up its beleaguered banking sector. European Central Bank vice president Vitor Constancio said on Wednesday there needed to be swift action to establish a stronger secondary market in Europe for non-performing loans and policy changes to incentivise banks, investors and the authorities to tackle the issue more effectively.  Partial solutions and further delays are not options if we want to tackle the problem of NPLs  he wrote in Italy's main business newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.

Sainsbury's, the world's largest retailer of Fairtrade products, started stamping its own  Fairly Traded  label on its own brand tea in May as part of a pilot scheme to move to an internally managed ethical sourcing scheme. The retailer said its initiative improved on the 25-year-old Fairtrade model in which companies can use the trusted logo if they guaranteed farmers a fair price for crops and an extra premium to spend on community projects like roads and schools. But the supermarket's decision has prompted concerns that poor farmers would be impacted and the pilot could lead to the logo being dropped from other products and spread to other companies - especially after Cadbury quit the scheme last year.  An online petition opposing the move now has more than 70,000 signatures while on Wednesday campaigners from charities Oxfam and Cafod, in tea bag costumes and waving placards, protested outside the company's annual general meeting.  Sainsbury's is removing what little control some of the poorest tea farmers and producers have on how they spend the money they make,  Matthew Spencer, Oxfam's campaigns director, said in a statement. Under Fairtrade, on top of earnings from their produce, farming communities receive a bonus, or premium, worth about 10 percent of the tea price which they collectively decide how to spend.  The money usually goes towards healthcare, education and housing projects, said Spencer. But he said with Sainsbury's pilot, farmers would have to apply to a board set up by the supermarket in Britain to receive the money and described the change as a  power grab .  We don't believe the execution of this current model will, on balance, deliver positive changes for tea farmers,  added Michael Gidney, chief executive of the Fairtrade Foundation.  But a spokesman for Sainsbury's denied the farmers would lose out, saying farmers would continue to receive all the funding currently in place and the pilot had safeguards to ensure the money reached  those it is intended for .  'Fairly Traded' goes further than the current model with more benefits, including longer-term commercial relationships and individually-tailored data and support to help them make their businesses more resilient and sustainable,  Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe said in a statement.  Coupe added that the pilot didn't save the supermarket any money and had no impact on the price of its tea. Fairtrade products usually lead to a slightly higher retail price.  Rather than shout from the sidelines, we would encourage everyone to be open-minded and see if the pilot can be successful and improve lives,  Coupe said.  Fairtrade is a global operation that works with over a million farmers and workers in Africa and the Middle East, and more than 250,000 across both Latin America and Asia and the Pacific.

The officer, Miosotis Familia, 48, a 12-year veteran of the force, was shot as she sat in a mobile command truck with her partner at about 12:30 a.m. EDT (0430 GMT), the New York Police Department said. The suspect fired through the vehicle's window, hitting Familia in the head, police said.  It is clear that this was an unprovoked attack on police officers who were assigned to keep the people of this great city safe,  Police Commissioner James O'Neill told a news conference outside Saint Barnabas Hospital, where Familia was later pronounced dead.  She was on duty serving this city, protecting people, doing what she believed in, and doing the job she loved,  Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the news conference. The suspect, Alexander Bonds, 34, of the Bronx borough, was on parole for robbery in Syracuse, New York, according to a police source. The mobile command unit has been located since March in the area because of a rash of gang-related shootings, O'Neill said. Police officers lined the street outside the hospital and saluted as an ambulance drove her body to New York's Office of Chief Medical Examiner, police said. Officers chased the assailant on foot for a block before he drew a revolver and they shot and killed him, police said. A bystander was also shot and was in stable condition, police said. Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, urged the public to assist.  We need your help to watch our backs as we watch yours,  he said at the news conference. A total of 24 U.S. law enforcement officers have been killed by gunfire so far this year, a 9 percent increase from the same period in 2016, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial Fund, which tracks police deaths. Familia is the eighth New York City police officer shot and killed in the line of duty over the last five years. Her shooting was a chilling reminder of the December 2014 ambush of two New York City police officers who were slain as they sat in a patrol car in Brooklyn by a man who traveled to the city from Baltimore after pledging to kill officers. The deaths of the two officers stoked tensions between City Hall, the police department and reform-minded protesters who had voted de Blasio into office, turning out in large numbers. In 2014, 126 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty in the United States.

Carmat won clearance from the French medicines agency to resume an implant trial in May after a suspension following the death of a fifth patient in October. Chief Executive Stephane Piat, who took over in September, told Reuters that lessons from previous failures had been learned and Carmat was tightening its clinical trials procedure.  There was a need to better oversee the clinical trial. We are in the process of doing that, and today everything is back to normal,  he said during an interview. Carmat has hired Wenzel Hurtak, a Dutch national who has held top positions at U.S firm Johnson & Johnson, for the newly created post of director of manufacturing.  This will enable us to separate production from research and development and better work on the future generations of our products,  Piat said. Carmat says more than 100,000 patients in the United States and Europe could benefit from its artificial heart in the coming years, a market worth more than 16 billion euros ($18 billion). The company hopes to bring its existing battery-powered product to market in the European Union from 2019. The device is designed for people with end-stage heart failure, a fatal condition where the heart is unable to pump blood adequately around the body. It aims to be an alternative to heart transplants where there is a shortage of donor organs. Privately-held SynCardia Systems and Abiomed, both U.S. companies, are among Carmat's competitors, with SynCardia's artificial heart the only one approved for use both in North America and the EU. Piat said Carmat had been slow to develop a marketable product for a number of reasons but it expected to be able to develop prototypes more quickly using 3D printing.  We are already working on a simpler, more energy-efficient heart,  he said. The company, which has teamed up with tire maker Michelin and aerospace and defence group Airbus, has said it plans to open a new factory near Paris with more automated processes at the end of 2017.

Ismail Haniyeh, who has recently assumed the post of Hamas's leader, said in a speech in Gaza on Wednesday that relations with the Gaza Strip's neighbor to the south-west were warming.  We have launched a new chapter with Egypt and the relations have witnessed a big move,  he said.     For much of the last decade, Egypt has joined Israel in enforcing a land, sea and air blockade of the Gaza Strip, a move to punish Hamas and its armed wing, which seized the territory in 2007 and has controlled it since.  The situation has worsened in the past month as Israel, at the request of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA), has cut electricity to Gaza, leaving it with barely four hours of power a day.  The sanctions are part of a years-long effort by the PA, led by the rival Fatah party, to force Hamas to relinquish power in Gaza and join a unified government. Power cuts have hit hospitals and water treatment plants, squeezing Gaza's two million people amid a draining heatwave. Sensing the need to act, and worried about losing popular  support, Hamas sought to mend ties with Egypt, which controls their one border crossing and has, under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, been highly wary of ties between Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, which Sisi ousted from power after mass protests.     Hamas's newly appointed leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, whose background is with the group's militant wing, met Egyptian officials, including the intelligence chief, last month. Potential Challenge to Abbas The meetings in Cairo were believed to have been facilitated by Mohammad Dahlan, 55, a former senior Fatah official who is originally from Gaza and is now a staunch opponent of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Fatah's leader. Hanieyh said that Egypt has been helping improve Gazans' living conditions and the talks have already led to alleviating some hardships caused by the blockade.  We have found complete readiness by Egypt and their authorities have issued orders to implement a package of measures that has began with allowing fuel into Gaza.  In his speech, Hanieyh also thanked Qatar and Saudi Arabia for financial support.      Dahlan, who spends much of his time in the United Arab Emirates and is close to Egypt, has emerged as a powerbroker in the region, determined to bridge differences between Hamas and Cairo and potentially challenge Abbas for leadership. In that respect, closer ties between Hamas and Cairo are a serious threat to Abbas, regional analysts said. Members of Palestinian security forces loyal to Hamas patrol on border with Egypt, in Rafah in the southern of Gaza Strip July 5, 2017.Ibraheem Abu MustafaNot only because they help to bolster Hamas's credibility in the region, but because they empower Dahlan and undermine the ability of the Palestinian Authority to cast itself as the dominant political body for Palestinians, they said. Israel, which signed a 1979 peace treaty with Egypt and coordinates closely with it on security, is maintaining a wary eye on discussions between Egypt and Hamas. Like the United States and the European Union, it regards Hamas as a terrorist group and wants to keep its influence contained.   Message of Assurance  After the last round of meetings in Cairo, Hamas cleared land on its side of the border, creating a buffer zone with watchtowers, cameras and barbed-wire fences in a concession to security-conscious Egypt.   These measures serve as a message of assurance to the Egyptian side,  Tawfiq Abu Naeem, the Hamas-appointed head of security services in Gaza, told reporters. Slideshow (3 Images)Sources with knowledge of the talks said Hamas wants Egypt to open its Rafah crossing for longer and to increase energy supplies and imports.  Egypt wants information on  radical elements  entering and leaving Gaza and help with tracking Islamic State-affiliated militants attacking Egyptian forces in northern Sinai. Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the discussions. An Israeli foreign ministry official declined to comment. In a sign that the talks are rattling Palestinian politics, Abbas, 82, will visit Egyptian President Sisi this week. Akram Attallah, an independent analyst in Gaza, said that  for the first time we can say there is joint action between the two sides, a joint cooperation. That has never been official since the Hamas movement was founded 30 years ago.  Dahlan's Role Attallah sees Dahlan's mediation as critical. As Abbas has grown more frustrated with Hamas and tried to increase pressure on the group, it has strengthened Dahlan's role as a broker.  Abbas expelled Dahlan from Fatah in 2012 and Dahlan has been in self-imposed exile since. The last thing Abbas wants is for him to return to Gaza, with Egypt's approval, as a hero.  Dahlan employed this moment to present himself as the most efficient party in the Palestinian arena and a savior for Hamas,  said Attallah, suggesting each side had gained: Dahlan in terms of leverage and Hamas as a political partner.  Regional analysts are closely watching what closer ties with Egypt may mean for Hamas's relations with Qatar, which in recent years has spent more than $500 million improving infrastructure and building clinics in Gaza. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are now leading a Sunni-Arab drive against Qatar over its ties with Iran, accusing it of fomenting terrorism, a charge Doha denies. The analysts say if Egypt is forging better relations with Hamas, it may well insist on Hamas giving up its friendship with the emirate.

A renewed slide in oil prices kept a lid on the increase, with the pan-European STOXX 600  index ending up 0.2 percent while the euro zone blue chip index .STOXX50E closed flat. The top gainer on the STOXX was CHR Hansen (CHRH.CO) after the food ingredients maker beat third-quarter profit forecasts and raised its revenue growth guidance.     Adidas was the second biggest, up 4.9 percent as brokers sounded upbeat ahead of the sporting goods group's earnings release next month. While DZ Bank added the stock to its long list expecting strong numbers in Western Europe and China, HSBC said Adidas was likely to increase its outlook, upgrading it to  buy .  We believe the sales growth story and associated margin expansion plan make this stock a very visible compounder,  HSBC analysts said in a note.  In London, housebuilder Persimmon (PSN.L) jumped 2.4 percent after it reported a 7 percent rise in first-half sales. Oil prices retreated 3 percent, ending their longest bull run in more than five years as rising OPEC exports and a stronger dollar turned sentiment more bearish. That hurt energy stocks .SXEP, the biggest sectoral faller in Europe this year, which fell 1.4 percent, wiping most points off the STOXX index. Miners .SXPP, which also find support when oil prices rise, ended up 0.2 percent, paring earlier gains that were helped by a Credit Suisse sector upgrade to  overweight . Top faller in Europe was Worldpay (WPG.L), down 8.8 percent after U.S. credit card processor Vantiv (VNTV.N) agreed to buy the British payment company for 7.7 billion pounds. In the previous session the stock soared nearly 30 percent after news of rival approaches from Vantiv and JPMorgan (JPM.N), which said on Wednesday it did not plan to make a counter bid. Interest rate-sensitive utilities .SX6P were another weak spot, down 0.7 percent.  A rise in interest rates has been a focus for markets since central banks hinted at a possible tightening in monetary policy, with higher bond yields making high dividend-paying stocks like utilities less attractive.

The Lebanese army said on Tuesday that the four Syrian men arrested during a raid on a refugee camp on Friday had died while in detention from chronic illnesses that had been aggravated by the weather conditions. In separate statements on the deaths, a Lebanese human rights group and a Syrian opposition alliance accused the Lebanese army of torture that led to the deaths. A military source denied allegations of torture, saying they were baseless.  In light of the army’s own admission that the health conditions of the detainees deteriorated while in custody, a formal, transparent and independent investigation must be launched and in case of wrongdoing those responsible for the deaths should be held accountable,  Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. The army detained several hundred people during its raid in the Arsal area on Friday in what it called a preemptive security operation against militants planning attacks in Lebanon. The army said five suicide attackers had blown themselves up while attacking soldiers during the raid, and one civilian was killed. The Lebanese Center for Human Rights (CLDH) said torture had led to the deaths of at least four detainees at refugee camps in the Arsal area and demanded a judicial inquiry.  The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition (SNC) said 10 people had died in custody, some of them by torture, while it said 19 others had died in the raid itself. It also demanded an investigation.  We reject any attempt to justify these violations and crimes against Syrian refugees on the pretext of preserving security or allegations of confronting terror in Lebanon,  the SNC said in its statement. The U.N. refugee agency says Lebanon hosts more than 1 million registered Syrian refugees, equivalent to a quarter of its population, though the number is widely put at closer to 1.5 million.     They are scattered across Lebanon in informal tented settlements where many face the risk of arrest due to a lack of legal residency that they struggle to obtain.  The camps around Arsal town have long been a haven for militants coming from Syria who have clashed with Lebanese forces conducting security raids searching for suspects hiding among the refugees.

Using a technique known as cryo-electron microscopy, a team from Britain's Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology mapped in fine detail the tau filaments extracted from the brain of a patient who had died with Alzheimer's. The most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's is characterized by two types of abnormal protein which form lesions or clumps in the brain. Tau forms filaments inside nerve cells and amyloid-beta forms filaments outside.  In healthy brains tau protein normally helps brain cells to function but in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease  tau clumps up in tangles inside the cells.  Knowing which parts of tau are important for filament formation is relevant for the development of drugs,  said Sjors Scheres, who co-led the research.  Since many pharmaceutical companies are using different parts of tau to test the effect of potential drugs on filament formation, this new knowledge  should significantly increase the accuracy of such tests,  he said. Specialists not directly involved in the study, which was   published in the journal Nature, said its findings would prove extremely important in future.  This study could take us into a new era of drug design,  said James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society medical charity - although he noted it can take 10 to 15 years to develop new medicines from this early stage of discovery. John Hardy, a professor of neuroscience at University College London said the work was a  tour de force  which  will help us understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's .

Trump launched an investigation into the matter in April, in a move that diplomats and trade experts say risks undermining the global rules-based trading system and sparking retaliatory action around the world in products beyond steel. The White House confirmed last week Trump plans to use the premise of the probe as a catalyst to demand action by the Group of 20 leaders to reduce excess capacity in steel, the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas. The U.S. recommendation on possible new tariffs will be released some time after the G20 summit, which starts on Friday. The U.S. is conducting a similar study into the case for aluminium tariffs. While tariffs on both products would be aimed primarily at China, U.S. allies fear they will bear the brunt of the measures because Chinese steel exports are already largely subject to U.S. restrictions and Canada and Mexico are likely to be exempt. Also, invoking national security is all but taboo at the World Trade Organisation, the arbiter of international trade rules, because it is largely seen as a way to wage economic warfare by citing arbitrary defence concerns. The European Union has already promised to retaliate if it is hit by U.S. steel tariffs. Moreover, trade diplomats fear U.S. security-based tariffs on steel would widen cracks in the global trading order, after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates cited national security at the WTO last week to justify their economic boycott of Qatar. Qatar has threatened legal action. Its WTO representative Ali Alwaleed Al-Thani said a national security claim was not a  free pass  and would need testing in court. WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told Reuters it would be concerning to see countries making national security demands within the WTO's dispute settlement system, the global trade court for the its 164 members.  That, I think, is a very sensitive course of action,  Azevedo said. William Reinsch, a fellow at the Stimson Centre said if the threat of tariffs are used to pressure members of the G20's forum on steel overcapacity - set up last year - to tackle the problem, a good outcome could yet prevail. He warned however, that a broad U.S. claim to national security would put global trade on a slippery slope.  It just opens the door to everyone else to do same thing, not just on steel,  Reinsch said.  The next one that comes up is food - there's already a debate on food security in number of countries - and then you start talking about agricultural protection, and then you really are unravelling big chunks of the trading system.  Policies that could fall under national security include China's new Cyber Security Act, which is under WTO scrutiny from Japan, South Korea, the United States and others; Ukraine's gas pipeline reforms; and Russia's trade restrictions on Ukraine.

The slowdown at the ports and long wait times to clear customs may threaten a recent rally in Chinese soymeal prices and may stir concern about demand from major exporters Brazil and the United States. The worst congestion is at Rizhao, one of China's top ports for soybean imports, where around six or seven vessels carrying about 400,000 tonnes of the oilseed were waiting to discharge late last week, said a trader with an international firm who declined to be identified.  The beans can't be discharged because they don't have enough warehouses,  the trader said. Eleven boats were waiting to anchor at Rizhao the previous week, with two more waiting to unload, according to data from Shanghai JC Intelligence Co.  More vessels elsewhere in China, with around 300,000 tonnes of soybeans, were also stuck at ports, said another trader at an international firm that also runs processing plants in China.   China imported a record 9.59 million tonnes of soybeans in May, and arrivals last month probably reached about 9 million tonnes, traders said.  But while buyers rushed purchases, tougher customs inspections have slowed movement of cargoes through ports.   'Better to Wait' Soybeans discharged into port warehouses are often held for up to a week before being certified for import by quarantine authorities, the first trader said. A reduction in value-added tax on soybeans to 11 percent from 13 percent from July 1 also pushed some buyers to delay imports, added the second trader.  If your boat comes a few days before July 1, it is better to wait,  he said. The huge imports in recent months have already pushed soybean stocks at Rizhao port near a four-year high at 486,460 tonnes last week, while stocks in all ports have reached around 7 million tonnes, the China National Grain and Oils Information Center (CNGOIC) said on Wednesday. Weekly stocks of soymeal, crushers' main product, hit 1.2 million tonnes last week, the highest in at least six years, as supplies far outpaced demand.   Crushers in Shandong province were losing 200 yuan ($29) per tonne processing imported soybeans last week before a rally in Chicago helped lift prices. Port congestion is expected to continue with around 8.5 million to 9 million tonnes due to arrive this month, including 2 million tonnes into Shandong province alone, the CNGOIC said.

I went out the next morning just to inspect,  he said.  I swear to God, cats were eating the corpses.   We couldn't do anything with the dead bodies,  he told Reuters in a series of voice messages from the city, the global headquarters of Islamic State.  They were just abandoned. We informed the hospital.  The U.S.-led coalition battling to defeat the ultra-hardline militants in Raqqa says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Abu Ahmad said air and artillery attacks were relentless, leaving most people holed up inside, unable to bury the dead and paralyzed by fear of the warplanes and shelling by U.S.-backed forces fighting on the ground.  We don't dare come out of our houses,  he said.  There is death everywhere, the stench of death, of destruction. It's terrifying.  He declined to give his full name out of fear for his life and his account could not be independently verified: Islamic State has imposed tight controls on communications in Raqqa, and routinely executes people accused of spying or treachery. He said he had encountered few Islamic State militants or armored vehicles recently in his district, which lies close to a front line in the west of the city. Many of those he did see were teenage boys with Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenades.  Under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Kurdish and Arab militias are now fighting inside the historic Old City, after pushing into Raqqa last month.  Screamed for Help On one particularly bad day last month, Abu Ahmad had just returned from getting water at a nearby well when he said intense air strikes battered his district around Raqqa's al-Nour mosque.  Jets pounded buildings and cars near the neighborhood bakery, killing more than 30 people, he said. The U.S.-led coalition said it was investigating the allegation. FILE PHOTO: Smoke rises from the al-Mishlab district at Raqqa's southeastern outskirts, Syria June 7, 2017.Rodi Said/File PhotoPeople screamed for help in the dark and houses crumbled as the bombs fell, Abu Ahmad recalled.  Imagine...we couldn't even do anything. The rocket launchers, the warplanes. We left them to die under the rubble,  he said.  A few men went out to search for and rescue the injured, but they could not get any of the dead bodies out. The Kurdish-led SDF has said it is careful to safeguard civilians in Raqqa, which Islamic State has used as a hub to plot attacks abroad. The U.S.-led coalition also says it takes  all reasonable precautions  to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. Ahead of the final assault on Raqqa city, the U.N. human rights office raised concerns about increasing reports of civilian deaths in the area. In a May report, it said there had been  massive civilian casualties  already. The United Nations estimates that 50,000 to 100,000 people are trapped in Raqqa. Witnesses said the militants have shot at those trying to escape, and people who have left in recent months reported paying large sums to smugglers to get them out. Abu Ahmad said his parents and children had been smuggled out of the city.  We had stocked food a while ago in anticipation of the siege,  he added.  But this fierce attack, we hadn't expected even one percent of this, we would have left Raqqa immediately (if we'd known).  The U.S.-led coalition said before the assault on Raqqa that 3,000 to 4,000 IS militants were still there, even after leaders abandoned the city for territory further south. The SDF says that Islamic State has heavily mined the old quarters of Raqqa and that the militants are doing most of their fighting at night without moving much in the daytime. Reuters lost contact this week with Abu Ahmad. In his final message, he said he planned to get smuggled out of Raqqa and escape to the countryside.   That's it. It's unbearable,  he said.

I'm just happy I could do something to help the team win,  Martinez said.  That 2-for-20 shows I wasn't swing the bat very well. I was swinging pretty good up to the point I went on the disabled list.  LF Justin Upton returned to the Tigers' starting lineup Tuesday after missing three games with a sore right left side. He smoked a double down the left field line in his first plate appearance, walked, doubled and shot a tie-breaking two-run single to left that decided the game in the seventh. Upton had experienced some pain during batting practice prior to Saturday's first game of a doubleheader and had not swung a bat since.  I was very surprised,  Upton said.  I expected some rust. I was surprised at being on time (with my swing), and with the pitches I saw. And with the way I felt.  He also made a couple of solid catches in left as he made three of Detroit's first five putouts.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED75MN9QAU"},

Using a technique known as cryo-electron microscopy, a team from Britain's Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology mapped in fine detail the tau filaments extracted from the brain of a patient who had died with Alzheimer's. The most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's is characterized by two types of abnormal protein which form lesions or clumps in the brain. Tau forms filaments inside nerve cells and amyloid-beta forms filaments outside.  In healthy brains tau protein normally helps brain cells to function but in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease  tau clumps up in tangles inside the cells.  Knowing which parts of tau are important for filament formation is relevant for the development of drugs,  said Sjors Scheres, who co-led the research.  Since many pharmaceutical companies are using different parts of tau to test the effect of potential drugs on filament formation, this new knowledge  should significantly increase the accuracy of such tests,  he said. Specialists not directly involved in the study, which was   published in the journal Nature, said its findings would prove extremely important in future.  This study could take us into a new era of drug design,  said James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society medical charity - although he noted it can take 10 to 15 years to develop new medicines from this early stage of discovery. John Hardy, a professor of neuroscience at University College London said the work was a  tour de force  which  will help us understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's .

Although so-called immunotherapy drugs from the likes of Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche are starting to revolutionise cancer care, they still only work for a limited number of patients. By adding a personalised cancer vaccine, scientists believe it should be possible to improve substantially the effectiveness of such immune-boosting medicines. Twelve skin cancer patients, out of a total of 19 across both the trials, avoided relapses for two years after receiving different vaccines developed by German and U.S. teams, researchers reported in the journal Nature on Wednesday. The small Phase I trials now need to be followed by larger studies, but the impressive early results suggest the new shots work far better than first-generation cancer vaccines that typically targeted a single cancer characteristic. The new treatments contain between 10 and 20 different mutated proteins, or  neoantigens , that are specific to an individual's tumour. These proteins are not found on healthy cells and they look foreign to the immune system, prompting specialist T-cells to step up their attack on cancer cells. One vaccine was developed at the U.S.-based Dana-Farber Institute and Broad Institute and the other by privately owned German biotech firm BioNTech, which uses so-called messenger RNA to carry the code for making its therapeutic proteins. Roche, the world's largest cancer drugmaker, is already betting on BioNTech's technology after signing a $310 million deal last September allowing it to test the German vaccine with its immunotherapy drug Tecentriq. BioNTech's co-founder and CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters that combination trials using Roche's drug were due to start later this year against a number of different cancers. Rival biotech firm Neon Therapeutics, which was formed to exploit the U.S. research, initiated tests of its personalised neoantigen vaccine in combination with Bristol-Myer's Opdivo drug last year. Expensive Treatment New drugs like Opdivo and Tecentriq that enlist the body's immune system are improving the odds of survival, but their typical price tag of more than $150,000 a year is controversial and adding a personalised vaccine will jack costs up further. Sahin acknowledged such vaccines would be expensive at first but said costs could be brought down by economies of scale and automation.  In the mid to long term the cost will fall dramatically ... it is an individual treatment but it is a universal process,  he said.  We are at a very early stage at the moment but in the long-run this approach could change everything.  Cornelius Melief of Leiden University Medical Center, who was not involved in either study, said the research confirmed the potential of neoantigen vaccines.  Controlled, randomised Phase II clinical trials with more participants are now needed to establish the efficacy of these vaccines in patients with any type of cancer that has enough mutations to provide sufficient neoantigen targets for this type of approach,  he said. Mainz-based BioNTech is one of Europe's largest private biotech companies, with more than 500 employees and deals with Sanofi and Eli Lilly, as well as Roche. It is majority-owned by twin brothers Andreas and Thomas Struengmann, who sold generic drugmaker Hexal to Novartis in 2005. Sahin said BioNTech would probably stay private for another two to four years before deciding on an initial public offering.

Assuming the panel agrees with the initial case team's conclusions, it could pave the way for the European Commission to issue a decision against Alphabet's Google by the end of the year. The Commission in April last year charged Google with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to shut out rivals following a complaint by lobby group FairSearch, U.S.-based ad-blocking and privacy firm Disconnect Inc, Portuguese apps store Aptoide and Russia's Yandex. The move by the EU competition authority, which hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty for unfairly favouring its shopping service last month, could pose a bigger risk for the world's most popular internet search engine because of Android's huge growth potential. The potential fine is expected to top that 2.4 billion euro penalty. The EU's charge sheet issued to Google in April last year said the anti-competitive practices started from January 2011 and the Commission is likely to tell the company to stop them. They are still ongoing, telecoms industry sources said. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso and Google both declined to comment. The EU ruling has the scope to do the most damage compared with a third case against Google's AdSense, Richard Windsor, an independent financial analyst who tracks competition among the biggest U.S. and Asian internet and mobile companies, said in a recent note.  If Google was forced to unbundle Google Play from its other Digital Life services, handset makers and operators would be free to set whatever they like by default potentially triggering a decline in the usage of Google's services,  he said, referring to Google's apps store. Taking a Toll The long-running case is taking its toll on users and rivals, FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said.  A decision would come none too soon. Google is hurting Android users, including by surreptitiously commandeering ever-increasing amounts of personal data,  Vinje said. The EU competition enforcer said Google's tactics include requiring smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser in return for access to other Google apps, and barring the manufacturers from using rival versions of Android. The company was also accused of paying smartphone makers and mobile network operators to only install Google Search on their devices. Google said at the time that Android was a remarkable system based on open-source software and open innovation and was good for competition and for consumers. The Commission had planned to establish a peer review panel, also known as a devil's advocate, in June, the people said. Such panels are usually made up of three to four experienced officials who examine the case team's conclusions with a fresh pair of eyes to ensure that the case is robust. They usually take three to four weeks to complete their work although this could be extended.

O'Reilly's stock plunged as much as 21.1 percent to a more than two-year low of $173.89, while also recording its biggest intraday percentage loss in more than five years. The company — which will report second-quarter results on July 26 — said sales at stores open for at least 12 months rose only 1.7 percent, compared with its forecast of an increase of 3 percent to 5 percent. Analysts on average were expecting O'Reilly's quarterly same-store sales to rise about 4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Weak demand likely reflected muted confidence from lower-end consumers — earning less than $50,000 annually — as they were left cash-constrained, partly due to rising healthcare, debt and housing costs, Wedbush analyst Seth Basham said. These consumers are among the do-it-yourself (DIY) after-market auto parts industry's core customer group. Confidence among minorities — such as Hispanics, a key group for DIY auto retailers — was sinking as they felt less confident, avoided leisure trips, and saved money for fear of being detained under the Trump administration's immigration policy, Basham said. Rising competition from e-commerce players such as Amazon.com Inc may also have been one of the factors impacting O'Reilly's same store sales, analysts said. O'Reilly's, which generated about 58 percent of its 2016 sales from DIY customers, said comparable store-sales shortfall would also have an impact on its operating profitability in the second quarter. Shares of rivals Autozone Inc and Advance Auto Parts Inc, which also cater to the DIY customers, also hit multi-year lows. Advance Auto fell as much as 16.3 percent to a more than three-year low of $99.13, and Autozone as much as 10 percent to a more than two-year low of $514.47.

A vote on the proposal is expected to pass comfortably on Thursday, given support from the biggest parties, but the parliament has limited influence on the issue. The European Commission and EU governments have so far ignored calls for a formal suspension of a process already effectively in limbo.  We are not calling to stop all dialogue or cooperation, talking about integration is just not realistic at this moment,  Kati Piri, the lawmaker who drafted the recommendation that will be put to the vote, told reporters before the debate. EU leaders have been critical of Erdogan and his behavior toward opponents, both before and after an abortive coup against him a year ago. But they do not want to undermine an agreement struck last year whereby Turkey effectively stopped migrants reaching Greece, easing a crisis that had threatened EU unity. Johannes Hahn, the European commissioner responsible for membership talks, told lawmakers there could be no advance in those negotiations unless Turkey met EU demands to respect political freedoms. However, he said the EU would remain  engaged  and made no mention of halting the accession process. In reality, there has been little progress on Turkey's membership bid since negotiations were formally launched 12 years ago. Many EU leaders question whether Turkey, a large, relatively poor and overwhelmingly Muslim country, should ever be let in and many Turks have also cooled to the idea.

German defence officials have said they want a low-risk helicopter that already exists, which means the competition will likely be between the CH-47F built by Boeing Co and the CH-53K built by Sikorsky, a unit of Lockheed Martin Corp . Both companies already work closely with German industry and have said they would seek to form partnerships to build a future German helicopter.

A former Soviet republic of 31 million, run by strongman president Islam Karimov from 1989 until his death last September, Uzbekistan has had a rocky relationship with Moscow, and by extension the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO). It suspended its membership in the bloc between 1999 and 2006 and then quit it altogether in 2012. Following Karimov's death from a stroke and pledges by his successor, former prime minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev, to develop a strategic partnership with Russia, some have wondered whether Tashkent would rejoin the military alliance. But, answering a question about it in a televised interview on Wednesday, Kamilov said,  The question of renewing our CSTO membership is not on the agenda ... There are no plans to discuss or review this matter in the future.  Russia has used the CSTO, along with the Eurasian Economic Union, another regional bloc focused on trade, to project influence across most of the former Soviet Union. It regards Central Asia as an area of strategic interest. But only three out of the region's five nations - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, whose combined populations are smaller than that of Uzbekistan - are CSTO members.

The National Energy Board (NEB) commissioned the report to improve the equality of pipeline parts after TransCanada Corp and Enbridge Inc discovered that some they were using had been substandard. Currently, operators often have to provide additional specifications for parts because standards are too low, placing them at a disadvantage, according to the report, which was provided to Reuters ahead of its public release.  This creates an uneven playing field where pipeline operators with comprehensive specifications are placed in an uncompetitive position due to higher procurement costs,  the report read. Canada, home to the world's third-largest oil reserves, relies heavily on pipelines to move its product, making it imperative for pipelines to be secure. Policies should be developed  to ensure pipeline-operator quality strategies are transferred to all parties in the supply chain,  according to the paper. While the report's recommendations are not binding, NEB chief engineer Iain Colquhoun told Reuters on Tuesday the regulator's push for higher standards for manufacturers will ensure pipeline operators do not need to outline comprehensive additional specifications.  We'll absolutely level the playing field,  he said. The higher standards would apply to all manufacturers who provide parts to Canadian pipeline operators, including South Korea's TK Corp and Italy's Valvitalia Sp (IPO-VALIT.MI), which had provided some substandard parts to TransCanada and Enbridge, according to the NEB. Enbridge, TK Corp and Valvitalia did not respond to requests for comment. TransCanada was not immediately able to comment. The Canadian Energy Pipelines Association (CEPA), which includes TransCanada and Enbridge, said on Tuesday it is possible that manufacturers could still pass on some costs of the higher standards. But operators will not be heavily affected as they can make the money back through the lifecycle of their pipelines, CEPA said. Colquhoun said possible new measures for quality assurance include more standardization of manufacturing methods and training for certain employees of pipeline operators. The report recommended changes that also include more disclosures and tracking of materials from manufacturers. The NEB will decide on detailed measures this year, and while it could take up to 2023 for changes to formally be adopted by the external standards association, the regulator will take action if quality assurance issues demand immediate attention, Colquhoun said.

U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto's order did not bar Shkreli from making any public statements about the case, as prosecutors had requested in a motion filed Monday, according to John Marzulli, a spokesman for the prosecutors. Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety in 2015 when he raised the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, sparking outrage among patients and U.S. lawmakers and earning him the nickname  pharma bro.  The charges he now faces stem not from his time at Turing, but from his management of hedge funds MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare and of pharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc between 2009 and 2014. Shkreli last week told reporters that an alleged victim of his was not actually a victim, because she made money from his investments, attorneys for the government said in Monday's motion. He also directly spoke on camera to a journalist outside the courthouse, and appeared to be commenting on the case on Twitter under the handle @BLMBro, the prosecutors added. Shkreli previously used Twitter under his own name, but the social media platform banned him from doing so in January after he harassed a female journalist. In seeking a broad gag order on Monday, prosecutors said Shkreli's repeated public statements about his case could taint the jury and make a fair trial impossible. Shkreli's attorney, Benjamin Brafman, had opposed the prosecutors' request for a broad gag order, saying in a court filing that his client had a First Amendment right to speak freely. Brafman also disclosed in court Wednesday that he had discussed a possible guilty plea with prosecutors before the trial, though he said Shkreli himself rejected the possibility, according to Marzulli. Prosecutors have claimed that Shkreli ran a scheme in which he lied to lure investors in the MSMB funds, concealed huge trading losses from them and repaid them with millions of dollars stolen from Retrophin, where he was CEO. Shkreli was ousted from Retrophin in 2014. He has denied the charges against him.

African Petroleum said in a statement it was  surprised and disappointed  by comments from Gambian officials, reiterating its position that it still holds the rights to the licenses and vowing to defend them. The Gambian oil ministry's permanent secretary for petroleum Mod K. Ceesay initially revealed the government's decision in an interview with Reuters published on Tuesday.   That's the truth. You already got the message about the licenses,  Sanyang told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday, referring to Ceesay's comments. The oil ministry's commissioner for petroleum, Jarreh Barrow, was in charge of determining the legal status of the contracts, Sanyang added.  We are not responsible for what African Petroleum says or does not say and for your information the Ministry is NOT in talks with African Petroleum,  Barrow wrote in a response to a request for comment on the status of the companies' permits. A recent evaluation of the A1 and A4 license blocks cited by African Petroleum suggested they could contain over 3 billion barrels of oil. African Petroleum shares fell as much as 57 percent during trade on Tuesday before partially recovering. They were down 39 percent by 1631 GMT on Wednesday with nearly 38 million shares trade which was a record daily volume, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. The firm said it would host an investor conference call at 0900 GMT on Thursday to discuss the licenses.  The Licence agreements have dispute mechanism provisions which we fully intend to utilise if the Gambian authorities maintain this stance,  Chief Executive Jens Pace said on Wednesday.   However, our preferred route is to engage in more constructive dialogue in order to establish a way forward that is in the best interest of all stakeholders,  he added. Pace did not provide further clarity on the dispute mechanism. An African Petroleum spokesman added that the firm had invested over $64 million in the country and met with senior officials recently to put forward drilling proposals. Neighboring Senegal said it has canceled one of two contracts African Petroleum held there because it had not fulfilled its commitments. That block has since been attributed to Total but African Petroleum says it still holds the license. In a sign of growing interest in tiny Gambia's oil prospects, the government this week approved a deal for Australia's FAR to acquire an 80 percent stake in the A2 and A5 blocks held by New York-listed Erin Energy Corporation. The A1 and A4 license blocks are adjacent to blocks in Senegal's waters where Britain's Cairn Energy made the world's largest discovery of 2014.  African Petroleum, founded by Australian-Romanian billionaire Frank Timis, said in April it was in exclusive talks with an unnamed third party to sell a 70 percent stake in the blocks along with another one in neighboring Senegal. Timis is the largest single shareholder with a 16.72 pct stake, according to Thomson Reuters data, although the company said he is not involved in the day-to-day running of the firm.

The Financial Stability Board, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, the International Organization of Securities Commissioners and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, also raised new concerns around the interdependency of CCPs, which have become crucial financial infrastructures as a result of post-crisis reforms that forced much of the US$483trn over-the-counter derivatives market into central clearing. In a study of 26 CCPs across 15 jurisdictions, the committees found that many clearinghouses maintain relationships with the same financial entities. Concentration is high with 88% of financial resources, including initial margin and default funds, sitting in just 10 CCPs. Of the 307 clearing members included in the analysis, the largest 20 accounted for 75% of financial resources provided to CCPs. More than 80% of the CCPs surveyed were exposed to at least 10 global systemically important financial institutions, the study showed. In an analysis of the contagion effect of clearing member defaults, the study found that more than half of surveyed CCPs would suffer a default of at least two clearing members as a result of two clearing member defaults at another CCP.  This suggests a high degree of interconnectedness among the central clearing system's largest and most significant clearing members,  the committees said in their analysis. Additional CCP data will be collected through the year to quantify changes in central clearing interdependencies. The committee chairs also agreed to convene a Derivatives Assessment Team to assess incentives to central clearing arising from the interaction of post-crisis reforms, such as uncleared margin requirements. A report will be completed by the end of 2018. New Guidelines Revised guidelines on CCP resilience from CPMI and IOSCO clarify the role of the board of directors at a CCP. They note that responsibility for establishing a risk management framework and day-to-day risk management tasks lies with company management, with the board providing an evaluation and monitoring role. Clarity is also provided around the period of risk for stress testing purposes, with alternative techniques for analysing stress testing scenarios, models and underlying parameters and assumptions. A final framework for standard CCP stress tests will be completed in the next 12 months. While some CCPs will be required to make changes to rulebooks, governance or regulatory frameworks, CPMI and IOSCO said that the latest guidelines do not impose additional standards beyond those already included in the 2012 principles for financial market infrastructures.  CCPs should promptly identify any areas where changes are necessary and address them as expeditiously as practicable, so that implementation of the necessary changes is completed no later than the end of 2017.  Revised guidance for recovery and recovery planning, also issued by CPMI and IOSCO, clarifies the treatment non-default losses such as those stemming from operational failure or cyber attack. CCPs will be required to have sufficient liquid net assets funded by equity to implement plans for covering those losses. Additionally they must have a viable plan to raise new equity capital in the event of a shortfall.  Losses relating to general business risk are properly the responsibility of the owners of the [financial market infrastructures],  CPMI and IOSCO said in the guidance. Additional loss-absorbing arrangements, such as third-party insurance or indemnity agreements, should also be considered, though the guidance warns that indemnity providers could experience solvency and liquidity strains in a severe stress scenario. At the same time, the FSB provided new CCP resolution guidance, providing further clarification on loss allocation procedures and the steps authorities should take to establish crisis management groups for relevant CCPs.

Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange slipped 0.9 percent to a one-week low of $5,841 per tonne in official trade.  The threat of a strike will restrict the downside, without that sort of news the price might have fallen much further,  said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Societe Generale.  The supply side and disruptions are to some extent offsetting the more bearish news surrounding the stock increases.  STOCKS: On-warrant copper inventories in LME warehouses - those not earmarked for shipment and available to investors - have soared by 47 percent to 213,900 tonnes since June 28 after inflows into mostly Asian depots, LME data showed. MCUSTX-TOTAL ANTOFAGASTA: A decline in copper prices was offset by news that Chilean miner Antofagasta was facing potential strikes from workers and supervisors at two of its mines as contract talks continue. POTENTIAL STOPPAGE: The combined annual production at both Chilean mines is 160,000 tonnes of copper. TECHNICALS: Prices, which failed near resistance at $6,000 a tonne, are now easing to support at the 100-day moving average of $5,774. CHINA: China's services sector grew at a slower pace in June as new orders slumped, signalling renewed pressure on businesses and pointing to a softening outlook for the economy of the world's largest consumer of commodities such as copper. DOLLAR: A softer dollar has helped underpin prices as it makes dollar-denominated products cheaper for non-U.S. buyers, potentially boosting demand. BAUXITE, NICKEL: Indonesia has issued recommendations to two more companies to allow them to export mineral ores. NICKEL: Nickel ended 0.2 percent lower at $9,160 after touching a one-week low of $9,070. The metal fell 2.2 percent in the previous session on plentiful supply from Indonesia and the Philippines. SUPPLY:  With the caveat that Indonesian and Philippine supplies are perennially liable to disruption, weaker demand seems likely to exert downward pressure on prices, with support seen at $8,700 and resistance at $10,000,  Sucden Financial said in its third-quarter metals outlook. PRICES: Aluminium ended slightly firmer at $1,929, lead fell 1.5 percent to $2,265, tin lost 1.4 percent to $19,675 while zinc eased 0.4 percent to $2,781.50.

We ironed out the few remaining differences,  European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said after a meeting on Wednesday with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should now sign the  political agreement  with EU institutional chiefs Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk on Thursday in Brussels. The three men will then head to a G20 summit in Hamburg, where the EU and Japan will urge Trump not to weaken U.S. free trade traditions. Summit host Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, took aim at Trump on Wednesday, saying:  While we are looking at the possibilities of cooperation to benefit everyone, globalisation is seen by the American administration more as a process that is not about a win-win situation but about winners and losers.   Japan, which lost out when Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade accord, and the EU, which has seen talks on a U.S. trade deal called TTIP lapse into limbo, both see their accord as striking a blow against a feared increase in nationalistic protectionism in world trade.  Leaders will stress their commitment to promote an open and fair global economy and refrain from all forms of protectionism,  the European Council said. Germany's Chambers of Commerce hailed the  symbolic power  of a deal with Japan, saying it would not only bring economic benefits in itself but also benefit world trade policy. FILE PHOTO - European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstrom (L) and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida (2nd R) attend their meeting as a part of the Japan-EU Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations at Iikura guest house in Tokyo, Japan 30 June 2017.Franck Robichon/PoolCheese and Cars Senior EU officials acknowledged that it would take months to complete the full EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, with not just legal technicalities but also some substantive negotiations still outstanding. However, one insisted,  We agreed on almost everything that is important for either side.  Details have yet to be confirmed and it is unclear how much detail Thursday's political agreement will contain, but officials on both sides say differences have narrowed or disappeared in thorny areas including cars, where Europeans wanted to keep tariffs, and food, especially cheese, where Japan's protected dairy industry feared exposure to EU imports. The European carmakers' lobby had called for at least seven years to phase out tariffs of up to 10 percent on Japanese cars, and a senior EU official said they would  not be disappointed . More than 200 European products that benefit from geographic protections -- for example Parma smoked ham must come from around the Italian city -- would not face Japanese competition under those names, he added. Scotch whisky might not benefit from such a deal as Britain will be leaving the EU in 2019. Most EU food exports to Japan would see tariffs removed over time, the official said, although in some sensitive sectors such as cheese and other dairy products they would be limited by quota. Japan would make it much easier for European firms to tender for public contracts. There remain differences over how disputes under the trade agreement should be settled, he added. That could be significant as increasingly ambitious EU trade deals have faced vocal opposition, notably on the European left, over concerns that they give multinational corporations too much clout over national regulators. A deal with Canada nearly came unstuck last year when one small Belgian region refused to ratify it. Brussels is pushing Japan to accept an arbitration system less likely to meet opposition from European lawmakers.

Analysts said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had effectively devalued the rupee to its lowest level against the dollar since December 2013, but Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said he felt  deep concern and indignation  at what he called an artificial weakening.  The central bank is the biggest player in the thinly-traded rupee market and traders say it controls what is a managed float system. The rupee tumbled to 108.00/20 per dollar after closing at 104.9 on Tuesday. SBP said Pakistan's $300 billion economy had shown strong fundamentals but  the deficit in the external account has been rising .  Accordingly, the exchange rate adjusted in the market and SBP is of the view that this depreciation ...will address the emerging imbalance in the external account and strengthen the growth prospects of the country,  it said in a statement. Following a balance of payments crisis in 2013, improving security and vast infrastructure investment by China have spurred Pakistan's growth to above 5 percent for the first time in nearly a decade. But over the past year the current account deficit has ballooned again, and the International Monetary Fund last month said that eroding macroeconomic stability gains could pose risks to the economic outlook.  Disappointment  The IMF had previously said Pakistan's currency was about 20 percent overvalued but Dar had rejected that, saying in May the figure was no more than 5 percent. FILE PHOTO: A man is seen at a currency exchange office in Islamabad November 26, 2012.Faisal Mahmood/File Photo/File PhotoSBP said that the new rupee rate, which it put at 108.25, was broadly aligned with economic fundamentals and that it stood ready to ensure stability in the financial market. Analysts said the devaluation was expected.  We believe the devaluation is in response to ongoing external challenges that have seen FX reserves decline by about $4 billion from their peak of $24.5 billion last October,  an  analyst's note from Citibank said on Wednesday. Pakistani exporters have long complained that the rupee is overvalued, hurting their competitiveness. Saad Hashmey, research director at brokerage firm Topline Securities, said historically the rupee had been devalued by about 5 percent per year and the latest devaluation was overdue.   It should help some exports and it should help bring some equity investments as well,  he said. The rupee has traded in a tight range of between 104-105 per dollar since December 2015. Pakistan's stock market, which was one of the world's best performing in 2016, has come under pressure in recent months due to political instability stemming from a corruption probe into Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Commenting on the fall in the rupee, Finance Minister Dar  expressed deep concern, indignation and disappointment at the fact that the current political situation is being exploited by certain individuals, banks and entities .  The responsible persons and entities in this matter will be identified and appropriate action will be taken against them in the national interest,  he said in a statement.

But who is the greatest of them all in the men's game? Well, it depends on which stats you look at. Federer joined an exclusive club during his match on Tuesday. He became just the third man to hit the 10,000 mark since 1991, when the ATP World Tour began tracking the metric, after Ivo Karlovic (12,062 aces to date) and Goran Ivanisevic (10,131) who has now retired.        It's surreal,  18-times grand slam winner Federer told ESPN.  It puts me up there with the likes of Ivanisevic and Karlovic, to whom I look up to and think they have the most unbelievable serve.  But a glance at another statistic - aces per match - sees the Swiss maestro drop down the servers' leaderboard.  His 10,004 aces have come in 1,294 matches, giving him an average of 7.7 per match. This not only puts him behind Croatian pair Karlovic (19.4) and Ivanisevic (13.9), but also a number of other players including Americans John Isner (17.4), Andy Roddick (11.7) and Pete Sampras (11). And then there's the percentage of service games won - arguably a more telling statistic - where Federer boasts a mighty 89 percent but nonetheless trails Karlovic (92), Isner (91), Canada's Milos Raonic (91) and Roddick (90), according to ATP data. In terms of naked speed, meanwhile, no one can compete with Australian Sam Groth who fired a 163.7 mph (263.4 kph) bazooka across the net in 2012 - the fastest serve ever recorded.  Putting all the stats together, 6ft 11in tall Karlovic emerges as arguably the strongest contender. He tops the lists for number of aces, aces per match and percentage of service games won. He has also hammered down the fourth-fastest serve on record - 156 mph - and the quickest second serve at 144 mph. But of course, such numbers fail to take into account qualities that pundits say are the stuff of champions, like producing the best serves on big points - Federer, Sampras, Boris Becker - and ice-cool control under pressure. So, who's the greatest server of all time? Even armed with all the stats in the world, it's a matter of opinion.

A more than 3 percent slump in oil compounded matters, but it was the more than 2 percent slump in South Africa's rand that did the most damage, following reports that the ruling African National Congress had agreed at its party conference that the central bank should be nationalised. The latest falls saw the currency of Africa's most industrialised nation plumb lows it had last hit in mid-June when a row over the bank's mandate had also rattled markets just as the economy fell back into recession. Investors' nerves were tested further as Russia's rouble fell 1 percent on its third straight day of losses, Turkey's lira slumped 1.5 percent and Mexico's peso led Latin American currencies lower as it dropped as much as 1.3 percent .  The emerging markets' fish tend to swim together, and that is what is happening today,  said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank. Adding to strains were expectations about the minutes of the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting due for release later in the day. They will be scrutinised to see how much appetite there is for further rate hikes or for signs of more concern among policymakers about a downturn in U.S. inflation and growth. A shift towards more hawkish language by several major central banks has dominated the past week and left markets unsure of how much longer emergency stimulus in Europe will continue to support global asset prices.  It is unusual because we are not seeing a sell-off across G10 markets, bond markets are stable, equity markets are stable,  said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at Credit Agricole.  It is a pure emerging markets sell-off and that is surprising.  In Pakistan, analysts said the country had effectively devalued the currency after the central bank said a sudden 3 percent weakening of the rupee would help the country's external account and shore up economic growth. Stocks Spared Emerging assets elsewhere enjoyed a better session. MSCI's emerging stock index bounced 0.2 percent after its biggest fall in nearly three weeks. Bourses in the Gulf also recovered ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers of four Arab states in Egypt to consider further sanctions against Doha over accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Qatar's stock market index rose 0.4 percent while Kuwait stocks advanced 0.5 percent. However, Riyadh's bourse fell 0.4 percent, extending the previous day's sharp fall. After the market close, the ministers expressed disappointment with what they called Qatar's  negative  response to their demands, but did not announce new sanctions.

Four other cities - Budapest, Rome, Hamburg and Boston - had also expressed interest before quitting the bidding process, leaving the last two candidates, both of which are hoping to win the right to stage the Games for the third time. Paris hosted the 1900 and 1924 Olympics, with the 1932 and 1984 Games being in Los Angeles. The IOC will vote for the 2024 winner on Sept. 13. The organisation's executive board has recommended that the same session should also award the 2028 Games. That proposal is expected to be confirmed next week with the city that misses out on the 2024 Games likely to be named as host for the 2028 Olympics.  Over the course of our evaluation, these two world-class cities proved their ability to host exceptional Olympic Games,  wrote the head of the IOC evaluation committee, Patrick Baumann.  And they did so in a way that clearly reflects the unique circumstances and flavours each city has to offer to the world.  Both cities are praised in the report as having the potential to deliver successful Games, with Los Angeles being commended for its low-risk strategy of using existing or temporary venues.  There are only three new permanent venues proposed, and each one is already planned by private investors irrespective of the Olympic Games,  the report said. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti speaks next to LA 2024 Chairman Casey Wasserman during a news conference following meetings and tours with the International Olympic Committee Evaluation Commission as part of LA 2024's  bid for the Summer 2024 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 12, 2017.Mike Blake With so many world-class sports facilities at its disposal, the Los Angeles venue inventory exceeds Games’ needs.  Private Funding The Los Angeles bid is based on private funding and requires no major construction from the side of organisers with 97 percent of venues existing or temporary. It also has greater popular backing amongst locals than Paris - in an IOC-commissioned independent poll conducted in February, 78 percent of Los Angeles residents supported their city's bid, as opposed to 63 percent for Paris.    LA 2024 set out to redefine Olympic sustainability, guided by the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020 reforms, and we are delighted that our efforts have resonated so clearly with the IOC Evaluation Commission,  said LA 2024 bid chief Casey Wasserman in a statement.  Paris's plan to use iconic venues including the Eiffel Tower, the river Seine and the Louvre museum, and its compact two-cluster plan with 93 percent of venues existing or temporary also won approval along with the city's extensive public transportation.  But the IOC said creating an Olympic-sized atmosphere across the central Olympic zone remained a challenge, and noted that there was still some land which needed to be acquired for the construction of the Olympic village.  We are honoured that Paris’ compact, city-centre Games Plan received extensive praise,  said Paris 2024 co-chair Tony Estanguet.  We are absolutely delighted that the IOC’s report highlights that Paris would be an excellent host of the 2024 Games.

Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Summit ESP, which is backed by Oklahoma energy and banking billionaire George Kaiser, makes electric submersible pumps used to maintain well pressure to increase oil and gas production in aging wells. The devices, components in a business called artificial lift, increasingly are being used to prolong the life of shale wells. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction closed on Monday, Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said on Wednesday. Halliburton said it will fold Summit into its existing artificial lift business. Summit Chief Executive John Kenner will become senior director of Halliburton's ESP and Horizontal Pumping Systems (HSP) unit, reporting to Greg Schneider, Halliburton's vice president of artificial lift business, according to Mir. Summit, which will keep its offices in Tulsa, was founded in 2011 and is led by executives including Kenner, who earlier held senior posts at Baker Hughes. Summit had revenue of about $180 million last year, according to researcher Spears & Associates. Reuters reported in June that Halliburton was in late-stage talks to acquire Summit. While the acquisition gives Halliburton a stronger foothold in the artificial lift business, the company will still lack a dominant market position compared with competitors Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes, a General Electric Co firm.  The company may not be done expanding there,  energy investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt said in a note on Wednesday. Artificial lift is an approximately $12 billion-a-year global business, according to market researcher Frost & Sullivan, and dominated by Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Weatherford International PLC. Electric submersible pumps are an about $5 billion-a-year part of that, it estimates. Halliburton had been the second largest oilfield services company behind Schlumberger, but fell to third following the closing of a merger between Baker Hughes and GE Oil and Gas this week. Summit has expanded its business quickly in the United States and Canada as drillers seek to pump more oil from shale wells, which have a faster rate of production decline than conventional wells. In May announced it had installed its 8,000th electric submersible pump (ESP), an increase of 1,000 since November.

After a crackdown on insider trading there was a big drop in unusual market activity two days before takeover announcements, from around 30 percent to 15.2 percent between 2009 and 2014. Having crept back up from that level, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in its annual report the level has now stalled, being the same in 2016 as it was in 2015.  We will continue to monitor the results and gather market intelligence to enable us to draw robust conclusions about the underlying trend in insider trading activity,  the FCA said. The FCA, which is among the few regulators to publish so-called market cleanliness figures, also said the number of enforcement cases it opened, which include market abuse and insider dealing, more than doubled to over 250 in 2016/17 from the previous year.  However, it also closed around 60 percent of those cases without imposing any penalties, compared with 24 percent in 2015/16, one lawyer noted.

Paris hosted the 1900 and 1924 Olympics, with the 1932 and 1984 Games being in Los Angeles. The IOC will vote for the 2024 winner on Sept. 13. The organisation's executive board has recommended that the same session should also award the 2028 Games. That proposal is expected to be confirmed next week with the city that misses out on the 2024 Games likely to be named as host for the 2028 Olympics.  Over the course of our evaluation, these two world-class cities proved their ability to host exceptional Olympic Games,  wrote the head of the IOC evaluation committee, Patrick Baumann.  And they did so in a way that clearly reflects the unique circumstances and flavours each city has to offer to the world.  Both cities are praised in the report as having the potential to deliver successful Games, with Los Angeles being commended for its low-risk strategy of using existing or temporary venues.  There are only three new permanent venues proposed, and each one is already planned by private investors irrespective of the Olympic Games,  the report said. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti speaks next to LA 2024 Chairman Casey Wasserman during a news conference following meetings and tours with the International Olympic Committee Evaluation Commission as part of LA 2024's  bid for the Summer 2024 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 12, 2017.Mike Blake With so many world-class sports facilities at its disposal, the Los Angeles venue inventory exceeds Games’ needs.  Private Funding The Los Angeles bid is based on private funding and requires no major construction from the side of organisers with 97 percent of venues existing or temporary. It also has greater popular backing amongst locals than Paris - in an IOC-commissioned independent poll conducted in February, 78 percent of Los Angeles residents supported their city's bid, as opposed to 63 percent for Paris.    LA 2024 set out to redefine Olympic sustainability, guided by the IOC’s Olympic Agenda 2020 reforms, and we are delighted that our efforts have resonated so clearly with the IOC Evaluation Commission,  said LA 2024 bid chief Casey Wasserman in a statement.  Paris's plan to use iconic venues including the Eiffel Tower, the river Seine and the Louvre museum, and its compact two-cluster plan with 93 percent of venues existing or temporary also won approval along with the city's extensive public transportation.  But the IOC said creating an Olympic-sized atmosphere across the central Olympic zone remained a challenge, and noted that there was still some land which needed to be acquired for the construction of the Olympic village.  We are honoured that Paris’ compact, city-centre Games Plan received extensive praise,  said Paris 2024 co-chair Tony Estanguet.  We are absolutely delighted that the IOC’s report highlights that Paris would be an excellent host of the 2024 Games.

After a crackdown on insider trading there was a big drop in unusual market activity two days before takeover announcements, from around 30 percent to 15.2 percent between 2009 and 2014. Having crept back up from that level, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in its annual report the level has now stalled, being the same in 2016 as it was in 2015.  We will continue to monitor the results and gather market intelligence to enable us to draw robust conclusions about the underlying trend in insider trading activity,  the FCA said. The FCA, which is among the few regulators to publish so-called market cleanliness figures, also said the number of enforcement cases it opened, which include market abuse and insider dealing, more than doubled to over 250 in 2016/17 from the previous year.  However, it also closed around 60 percent of those cases without imposing any penalties, compared with 24 percent in 2015/16, one lawyer noted.  This surely prompts the question of whether investigations are now being opened simply to satisfy the criticisms leveled at the FCA in the Green report into HBOS, which said that the FCA was too cautious in its approach to opening investigations,  said Joanne Stephens, an associate at law firm Kingsley Napley. The Green report, published by independent lawyer Andrew Green in 2015, investigated the causes of HBOS bank's failure in 2008 and said authorities should review a decision at the time not to act against 10 executives.

The ruling comes as Airbnb, much like its ride-hailing peer Uber, is facing a growing crackdown from legislators worldwide triggered in part by lobbying from the hotel industry, who see the rental service as unfair competition. Airbnb and other rental platforms have also been criticized for driving up property prices and contributing to a housing shortage in some cities such as Paris or Berlin. With 350,000 listings, France is Airbnb's second-largest market after the United States, and Paris, the most visited city in the world, is its biggest single market, with 65,000 homes.

The ruling thus makes it harder for those renting out property to exceed the 120 days a year legal rental limit for a main residence, and makes it easier for authorities to track which properties are rented out, and also to collect local taxes.  This is a strong signal sent out to other municipalities. Local collectivities now have a tool to monitor the tourist offers and control the collection of tourist taxes,  Roland Heguy, the head of French hotel federation UMIH said in a statement.

A number of central bank policymakers, including Governor Mark Carney, have spoken in favour of soon reversing last year's interest rate cut, which followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The hawkish remarks have helped the pound to reverse the 2 percent drop against the dollar that came after a snap election on June 8 left no party with a clear majority. But readings of Britain's economy as it negotiates its exit from the EU could bolster arguments against raising rates too soon, even though inflation is well above the Bank's 2 percent target.  As the second half of 2017 gets underway, the negative impacts of Brexit (are being) reflected in the British pound and domestic economic data,  said FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga.  Uncertainty over Brexit has exposed sterling to heavy losses and this continues to fuel inflation. With rising inflation outpacing wage growth, consumers are feeling the pinch and as such, has raised questions over the sustainability of the UK’s consumer driven economic momentum.  Sterling has lost around 14 percent against the dollar and 13 percent against the euro since Britain voted to quit the EU last June, though it has recovered some ground since hitting 31-year lows last October.  Data on Wednesday showed growth across British services companies fell to a four-month low in June, with companies at their least optimistic in nearly a year.  Whilst the headline figures may do little to startle the Bank of England just yet, this will be a stark warning for the possibility of further trouble ahead for Carney and Co,  wrote Anthony Kurukgy, a sales trader at Foenix Partners, in a note to clients.    With a government in disarray, the business sector could continue on a sluggish path until nervy investors find a reason to feel confident again.    Sterling extended a dip below $1.29 after the data was released, falling as much as 0.3 percent lower to a one-week low of $1.2894 before recovering a touch to trade flat on the day at $1.2929 by 1555 GMT.

All we've had at the moment from the housebuilders is signs that things are going better than expected,  said Barry Gibb, research analyst at Beaufort Securities, adding that there was scope for a modest upgrade of estimates by the market in a sector under considerable scrutiny.  If any of the mainstream housebuilders were to suggest that they are seeing a greater pressure on pricing or reduced level of viewings, it could be taken quite badly by the market,  he added. Housebuilders Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey also rose on the more optimistic tone struck by Persimmon over the state of demand for houses. Another top gainer was supermarket chain Tesco, up 3.8 percent after forecast-beating sales figures from wholesaler Booker, which has been under scrutiny from investors since Tesco announced its plan to acquire it. Gains in Tesco helped the consumer staples sector provide the biggest sectoral boost to the FTSE, adding 9.4 points to the index, while energy stocks weighed as oil prices retreated. Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline inched 0.2 percent lower after Citigroup cut its rating on the stock to 'neutral' from 'buy, citing slowing HIV market growth. The broker said risks of a repeal of the U.S. Affordable Care Act could negatively affect volumes and/or price in the HIV treatment market. South Africa-exposed stocks Old Mutual and Investec were a weak spot, down 1.7 and 1 percent respectively, as the rand fell after the South African ruling party proposed at a policy conference to nationalise the central bank and expropriate land without compensation. But top faller was Worldpay, which fell 8.8 percent after U.S. credit card processor Vantiv agreed to buy the British payment company for 7.7 billion pounds. In the previous session the stock soared nearly 30 percent after the company said it had received rival approaches from Vantiv and JPMorgan, which said on Wednesday it did not plan to make a counter bid. Among mid-caps, construction materials supplier SIG jumped 4.5 percent after it said revenue rose 8.1 percent in the first half, helped by strength in mainland Europe.  Underlying trading has improved relative to the second half of 2016, with European growth outpacing that of the UK, and good progress has been made on reducing leverage,  said Jefferies analysts. Online grocer Ocado made more modest gains, up 0.6 percent, as investors seemed to shrug off its first half results, in which it said it expected a recently clinched international deal would be  the first of many . Ocado shares rose sharply in the aftermath of the Amazon-Whole Foods merger deal amid speculation the company could be the object of a future partnership with the U.S. retail giant as it pushes into food distribution. The company said it had seen a pick-up in interest from U.S. players since the deal.

A number of central bank policymakers, including Governor Mark Carney, have spoken in favour of soon reversing last year's interest rate cut, which followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The hawkish remarks have helped the pound to reverse the 2 percent drop against the dollar that came after a snap election on June 8 left no party with a clear majority. But readings of Britain's economy as it negotiates its exit from the EU could bolster arguments against raising rates too soon, even though inflation is well above the Bank's 2 percent target.  As the second half of 2017 gets underway, the negative impacts of Brexit (are being) reflected in the British pound and domestic economic data,  said FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga.  Uncertainty over Brexit has exposed sterling to heavy losses and this continues to fuel inflation. With rising inflation outpacing wage growth, consumers are feeling the pinch and as such, has raised questions over the sustainability of the UK’s consumer driven economic momentum.  Sterling has lost around 14 percent against the dollar and 13 percent against the euro since Britain voted to quit the EU last June, though it has recovered some ground since hitting 31-year lows last October.  Data on Wednesday showed growth across British services companies fell to a four-month low in June, with companies at their least optimistic in nearly a year.  Whilst the headline figures may do little to startle the Bank of England just yet, this will be a stark warning for the possibility of further trouble ahead for Carney and Co,  wrote Anthony Kurukgy, a sales trader at Foenix Partners, in a note to clients.    With a government in disarray, the business sector could continue on a sluggish path until nervy investors find a reason to feel confident again.    Sterling extended a dip below $1.29 after the data was released, falling as much as 0.3 percent lower to a one-week low of $1.2894 before recovering a touch to trade flat on the day at $1.2929 by 1555 GMT.

The retailer joins American Apparel LLC, Payless ShoeSource Inc and other chains in bankruptcy as shoppers increasingly buy online, turning away from brick-and-mortar specialty shops and department stores, where True Religion makes the majority of its sales. In court papers, a True Religion executive pinned the company's financial difficulties on the growth of  athleisure,  a move away from denim to casual sports clothing outside of the gym. True Religion became a part of popular culture a decade ago as celebrities donned the denim and hip hop artists cited the brand in songs. Under True Religion's plan, its lenders will receive most of the equity in the reorganized company, whose debt load will fall by $350 million to $140 million. The company aims to exit bankruptcy in about four months, according to court papers.  True Religion's owner, private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners, has also approved the company's bankruptcy plans.   We are taking an important step to reduce our debt, reinvigorate True Religion's iconic brand and position the company for future growth and success,  True Religion Chief Executive John Ermatinger said in a statement.  The company's restructuring plan provides for full payment of claims of its continuing trade creditors, which includes vendors, suppliers and landlords.   True Religion has 128 retail stores, whose sales make up almost 75 percent of its total net sales for its most recent fiscal year. The company also sells its denim through department stores including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Sakes Fifth Avenue. The Manhattan Beach, California-based retailer secured a debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan from Citizens Bank for up to $60 million. The premium denim maker filed its Chapter 11 petition in U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware. Reuters reported in October that the retailer had hired a legal adviser to explore several debt restructuring options.

Iraqi commanders have predicted final victory in Mosul this week after a grinding eight-month assault on the once two-million-strong city which has pushed Islamic State into an area no more than 300 meters (yards) by 500 meters beside the Tigris. Advances remain hard-won and the assault has destroyed at least six districts out of 44 in western Mosul. The fighting, involving Islamic State car bombs as well as air strikes and artillery by the Iraqi military and an international coalition backing it, has also displaced about half its pre-war population. An initial assessment showed that  stabilization , which includes repairing water, sewage and electricity infrastructure and reopening schools and hospitals, would cost more than twice initial estimates, Lise Grande, the United Nations' Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, told Reuters in an interview. The extent of damage was far greater than expected and much worse in the western half of the city than in the east, which was retaken from Islamic State six months ago, she said. Shi'ite humanitarian aid organisation distribute aid packages to civilians in Al Ghizlane district as the battle against Islamic State's fighters continues in western city of Mosul, Iraq, March 20, 2017.Youssef Boudlal In western Mosul what we're seeing is the worst damage of the entire conflict. In those neighborhoods where the fighting has been the fiercest, we're looking at levels of damage incomparable to anything else that has happened in Iraq so far.  Stabilization in eastern Mosul could be done in two months but it would take more than a year in the west, Grande said, and long-term reconstruction would cost many billions of dollars. Slideshow (7 Images)Since sweeping through large swathes of northern and western Iraq in 2014 and declaring a  caliphate  over that area and parts of Syria, Islamic State has lost most of that territory. Mosul was the largest city ever to come under its rule. All parts of the city have incurred light or moderate damage in the offensive, but six neighborhoods, including the historic Old City, 17 July district, and areas in and around Mosul airport, have been almost completely destroyed, and it would take years for these to return to normal, Grande said.  For families that come from other neighborhoods that are moderately destroyed, I think we can expect that many of them will try to go back and they'll do the best they can to try to rebuild,  she said. About 900,000 people have fled the fighting, with more than a third in camps outside the city and the rest living with family and friends in other neighborhoods. Grande said that surpassed the worst case scenario envisioned by the U.N. before the offensive began.  What that shows is that the level of damage is far higher than we expected, and that's why the cost of stabilization is far higher.

BMCI's Support Rating is affirmed at '2'. KEY RATING DRIVERS NATIONAL AND SUPPORT RATINGS BMCI's ratings are based on Fitch's opinion of a high probability of support from the bank's majority shareholder, BNP Paribas (BNPP; A+/Stable), if required. This reflects BNPP's strong ability (as indicated by the bank's rating) and willingness to provide support to BMCI. BMCI's Support Rating is constrained by Morocco's 'BBB' Country Ceiling. Fitch believes that BNPP has ample resources to support BMCI, whose consolidated assets represent less than 7% of group equity. BMCI is BNPP's largest African subsidiary. The bank controls a 6% domestic market share in loans and, in our view, it is strategically important to support BNPP's banking franchise in the Mediterranean. BNPP controls 66.7% of BMCI. The Moroccan subsidiary is highly integrated into BNPP, sharing branding, risk systems, internal processes and IT platforms. Its senior management is appointed by BNPP. BMCI has not required extraordinary support from BNPP. Ordinary support is provided on a day-to-day basis, notably in the form of a counter guarantee, which allows BMCI to meet regulatory requirements on large exposures. BNPP also provides foreign currency funding requirements, if required. RATING SENSITIVITIES NATIONAL AND SUPPROT RATINGS A downgrade of BMCI's Support and National Ratings may result from a reduction in BNPP's ownership stake in BMCI. A reduction in the subsidiary's strategic importance to the parent or weaker integration could also result in a rating downgrade. BMCI's ratings are also sensitive to a downgrade of BNPP's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR). BNPP's IDR would have to be downgraded by at least five notches before the Support Rating would be impacted and by at least four notches in the case of the National Rating. In our view, these scenarios are highly unlikely. BMCI's Support Rating would also be downgraded if Morocco's Country Ceiling is revised downwards by at least two notches.

The Commerce Department said factory goods orders dropped 0.8 percent in May. Economists had forecast factory orders falling 0.5 percent.     U.S. 10-year Treasuries were last up 3/32 in price to yield 2.334 percent, from a yield of 2.346 percent late Monday.      Fed officials have signaled they still plan another interest rate hike this year. Analysts said expectations are that the minutes, to be released at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), will reinforce that view.      Analysts said comments from the heads of the European Central Bank and Bank of England last week indicate that global central banks appear to be simultaneously leaning toward tighter monetary policy. This view has driven the recent push higher in yields.      The central banks all seem to be in agreement in kind of a hawkish signaling,  said John Herrmann, director of interest rates strategy at MUFG Securities in New York.      In morning U.S. trading, benchmark 10-year yields  hit their highest in more than seven weeks at 2.357 percent and three-year yields hit a roughly 3-1/2-month high of 1.598 percent. U.S. two-year yields  were at 1.410 percent, near Monday's more than eight-year peak of 1.426 percent.      Herrmann said the Fed minutes would likely indicate that the central bank saw the recent weakness in inflation as driven by transitory factors related to the oil, pharmaceutical and telecommunications sectors.      Analysts also said Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report could show a jump in jobs growth for the month of June, which would also pressure yields higher.     Economists polled by Reuters expect the report to show U.S. employers added 179,000 jobs last month, compared to just 138,000 in May.       People would lean towards a stronger rather than weaker number,  said John Briggs, head of strategy for the Americas at NatWest Markets.  The bias is for strength for a May payback,” he said in reference to the June report's potential strength compensating for the weak showing in May.

The retailer joins American Apparel LLC, Payless ShoeSource Inc and other chains in bankruptcy as shoppers increasingly buy online, turning away from brick-and-mortar specialty shops and department stores, where True Religion makes the majority of its sales. In court papers, a True Religion executive pinned the company's financial difficulties on the growth of  athleisure,  a move away from denim to casual sports clothing outside of the gym. True Religion became a part of popular culture a decade ago as celebrities donned the denim and hip hop artists cited the brand in songs. Under True Religion's plan, its lenders will receive most of the equity in the reorganized company, whose debt load will fall by $350 million to $140 million. The company aims to exit bankruptcy in about four months, according to court papers.  True Religion's owner, private equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners, has also approved the company's bankruptcy plans.   We are taking an important step to reduce our debt, reinvigorate True Religion's iconic brand and position the company for future growth and success,  True Religion Chief Executive John Ermatinger said in a statement.  The company's restructuring plan provides for full payment of claims of its continuing trade creditors, which includes vendors, suppliers and landlords.   True Religion has 128 retail stores, whose sales make up almost 75 percent of its total net sales for its most recent fiscal year. The company also sells its denim through department stores including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Sakes Fifth Avenue. The Manhattan Beach, California-based retailer secured a debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan from Citizens Bank for up to $60 million. The premium denim maker filed its Chapter 11 petition in U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware. Reuters reported in October that the retailer had hired a legal adviser to explore several debt restructuring options.

Private investors own about 6 percent of Sainsbury's shares, excluding holdings by Sainsbury family members, and they were out in force at the annual meeting in central London. Sainsbury's is not alone in facing tough trading conditions. British market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), third biggest player Asda (WMT.N), and fourth biggest Morrisons, are all in turnaround mode after a difficult few years. While the market share of Sainsbury's (SBRY.L), the second largest UK food retailer, has remained broadly stable over the last five years, its profits have fallen for three years in a row. On Tuesday it said in a trading update it was comfortable with analysts' average pre-tax profit forecast for 2017-18 of 572 million pounds ($739 million). Such an outcome would represent a fourth year of profit decline despite last year's purchase of Argos-owner Home Retail. One shareholder at the meeting, a Mr Muriel, said the decline in Sainsbury's key performance indicators (KPIs) over the last five years was  quite alarming in every way.   Can you please give us some indication that you think you've reached the bottom, that perhaps with any luck at all this coming year we might see some improvement in these KPIs,  he said. KPIs include profit, earnings per share and operating margin. Another investor, John Farmer, a regular dissenting shareholder on the UK Annual General Meeting circuit, also hit out at Sainsbury's falling profit, lower dividend, its strategy and board remuneration, which he called  a shambles . Chairman David Tyler responded by saying that while the board was disappointed by the reduction in earnings it was confident Sainsbury's strategy of building a distinctive food offer, growing its general merchandise, clothing and banking businesses, and bearing down on costs, would deliver.  Argos has started in a wonderful way, outperforming our expectations, our clothing business is scoring goal after goal ... our online business grows very rapidly and we continue to make a lot of progress in the bank,  he said, pointing to Tuesday's better-than-expected quarterly trading update.  Our objective is to improve on last year's profitability but I'm sure you recognize the world has changed over the last five years - it's very competitive and we have done rather better than a number of our competitors.

The ECB bought more than 2 billion euros of Italian and French bonds than it was supposed to in June, moving further away from a rule aimed at ensuring that its stimulus is evenly spread across the euro zone. The conflict for investors is that Italy, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB's bond buying scheme, is expected to be amongst the biggest losers as the central bank unwinds its extraordinary stimulus. However, if the ECB is going to buy more Italian bonds than expected in the months to come, that could soften the blow.  It is very hard as an investor to know whether to buy or sell on this news,  said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  At the end of the day, if the ECB is approaching its limit of (German) Bunds (it can buy), we may see a stronger deviation towards (Italian) BTPs. But it is still a relatively small amount of deviation so far and the overall picture is of tightening.  The gap between Italy's 10-year government bond yield and the German equivalent shrank to 163 basis points, its narrowest in over two weeks, 40 bps less than the April peak . It also emerged Tuesday that the European Union had approved a 5.4 billion-euro state bailout of Italy's fourth-largest lender, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, taking the total amount of Italian taxpayer funds deployed to rescue banks over the past week to more than 20 billion euros. Euro zone government bond yields have been rising across the board in recent weeks on comments from policymakers that suggest the ECB is moving towards normalising its ultra-loose monetary policy stance. Though some policymakers have since sought to play this down, German government bond yields are close to their highest levels all year. In late trade on Wednesday, Germany's 10-year bond yield was flat at 0.47 percent. Volatility in euro zone bond and currency markets over the past week has not been significant and partly reflects a misalignment between bond and equity prices, European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure said on Wednesday. Minutes of the ECB's June meeting are due on Thursday, which should provide further clues on how far the tapering debate has gone in Europe. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also due to publish minutes of its June 14 meeting later on Wednesday, with analysts waiting to see if the Fed drops any hints on whether it will push its next rate increase to later in the year.

Beachgoing, baseball and fireworks, Fourth of July traditions, were embraced throughout the country, along with family cookouts that favored hot dogs and hamburgers. An informal peace-and-love festival in an Oregon forest drew more than 13,000 people, including two men who died of apparently natural causes.The United States commemorated the Declaration of Independence, adopted by the 13 American colonies on July 4, 1776. The document proclaims unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In Philadelphia, where the Declaration was adopted, there was a ceremonial tapping of the Liberty Bell at Independence Hall. In many cities, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, crowds gathered under now-usual security precautions for concerts and fireworks displays. New York's display, billed as the largest, was set to go off over the East River where it could be seen from the boroughs of Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn.  New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the holiday. A deal between Governor Chris Christie and legislative leaders allowed New Jersey to reopen parks and beaches, including Island Beach State Park, where the Star-Ledger newspaper on Sunday captured photos of Christie with family and friends.

Joey Chestnut won his 10th Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest by downing a record 72 frankfurters in 10 minutes. In Washington, Molly Schuyler defended her title by chowing down 21 Z-Burger hamburgers in 10 minutes, according to media reports. Slideshow (14 Images)More than 13,000 people gathered for an informal peace-and-love celebration in Oregon's Malheur National Forest, where two people died of nonviolent causes, a spokeswoman said. Professing no leaders and no organization, the Rainbow Family Gathering marked July Fourth with  care-taking of mother earth, nonviolence and living a compassionate and loving life,  according to a blog. A 72-year-old man died on Monday and a 20-year-old man collapsed and died on Tuesday, forest spokeswoman Traci Weaver said. A doctor administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation to the 20-year-old for 15 to 20 minutes but could not revive him, Weaver said. There were 15 arrests, mostly for driving under the influence, drugs or disorderly conduct, in addition to 108 violations and 432 warnings. Visitors were both rowdy and respectful, Weaver said, and the large crowd inevitably degraded the forest with trash, waste and trampling.  We're concerned about redband trout that are spawning in the creeks nearby,  Weaver said.  Our big concern is what the long-term impact will be.

The talks are expected to be tricky as the agenda includes divisive issues such as free trade and climate change.    As G20 president, it is my job to work on possibilities for agreement and not to contribute to a situation where a lack of communication prevails,  she told Die Zeit weekly. However, she added that differences should not be pushed under the table.  While we are looking at the possibilities of cooperation to benefit everyone, globalization is seen by the American administration more as a process that is not about a win-win situation but about winners and losers,  she said.

Falling oil prices put pressure on the energy sector, which was the biggest drag on Wall Street's S&P; 500 as it moved between positive and negative territory. U.S. Treasury yields were near multi-week or multi-month peaks as traders expected the Fed's June meeting minutes - due Wednesday afternoon - would reinforce a hawkish shift in global central bank policy. Trading was likely affected by lighter participation the day after the U.S. July 4 Independence Day holiday and ahead of the Fed minutes and the U.S. jobs report due on Friday, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  There's not a whole lot driving the market, which is why we've seen it go both directions,  he said. At 11:53 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 13.03 points, or 0.06 percent, to 21,466.24, the S&P; 500 had gained 1.03 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,430.04 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 25.86 points, or 0.42 percent, to 6,135.92. Some stock investors were holding back ahead of the Fed minutes, which could provide insight on the central bank's plans for interest rate hikes or possible U.S. balance sheet reduction. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a more than seven-week high of 2.357 percent and three-year yields hit a roughly 3-1/2-month high of 1.598 percent in morning U.S. trading.  The central banks all seem to be in agreement in kind of a hawkish signaling,  said John Herrmann, director of interest rates strategy at MUFG Securities in New York. Analysts said yields remained near their recent highs due to the possibility that Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report would show a jump in jobs growth in June, which would also push yields higher. The dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies and was last up 0.16 percent as currency traders awaited clues on the Fed's plan to reduce its balance sheet. U.S. WTI crude futures were down 3.5 percent at $45.41 a barrel after climbing for eight straight sessions to Monday as higher OPEC exports and a stronger dollar turned sentiment more bearish. Benchmark Brent crude futures were down almost 3 percent, at $48.15 a barrel.  If you see oil dip from here and head below the mid-$40 range, it'll drag the (stock) market, said Schwab's Frederick.  It's right on the threshold where if it goes lower, it'll hurt the market.  The South African Rand fell 1.8 percent against the dollar after reports the ruling African National Congress party agreed the central bank should be nationalized and President Jacob Zuma said land expropriation without compensation should be allowed where  necessary and unavoidable.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 percent, erasing some of Tuesday's losses, when North Korea fired a missile into Japanese waters. MSCI's all world share index, however, was flat on the day.

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS NATIONAL AND SUPPORT RATINGS SGMB SGMB's ratings are based on Fitch's belief of a high probability of support from majority shareholder Societe Generale (SG; A/Stable), if required. This reflects SG's strong ability (as indicated by the bank's rating) and willingness to provide support to SGMB. SGMB's Support Rating is constrained by Morocco's Country Ceiling of 'BBB'. It is Fitch's view that SG has ample resources to support SGMB, whose liabilities accounted for just 0.5% of SG's at end-2016. Fitch views SGMB as a strategically important subsidiary for SG. Retail banking is one of SG's three strategic business lines (international retail banking and financial services). SGMB is SG's largest subsidiary in Africa and is seen as the group's entry point to the continent. SGMB has a reasonable franchise in Morocco (fourth-largest bank and largest foreign-owned bank with about a 9% market share in deposits) and SG's commitment to the country has not diminished in the past few years despite weaker performance at SGMB. Ownership has remained unchanged, with SG holding 57.4% of the capital and the balance being mainly held by a Moroccan family. SGMB is strongly integrated into SG. SG tightly controls its Moroccan subsidiary, at which senior management responsibilities are broadly shared with SG members. SG oversees SGMB's credit, country, market, operational and liquidity risks, and the subsidiary benefits greatly from SG's organisation, procedures, systems and tools. In addition, SGMB shares the same branding as its parent. Fitch understands from management that SGMB has never required any extraordinary support from SG. However, ordinary support in the day-to-day activities is well-entrenched, for instance in the form of counter-guarantees that allow SGMB to meet regulatory requirements on large exposures, and through short-term liquidity lines. EQDOM Eqdom's ratings are based on a high probability of support from ultimate majority shareholder (SG) in case of need. Eqdom's main shareholders are SG Consumer Finance (SGCF, 100%-owned by SG) and SGMB (AAA(mar)/Stable; 57.4%-controlled by SG). Their stakes in Eqdom are 34.9% and 18.8%, respectively. Fitch believes SG has ample resources to support Eqdom, whose assets accounted for less than 0.1% of SG's at end-2016. Fitch believes that Eqdom is of limited strategic importance to SG given its small size and negligible contribution to SG's operating profit. Nevertheless, SG is aiming to develop synergies between its specialised financial services and its retail banking subsidiaries globally, and Morocco is no exception. Eqdom is the second-largest consumer finance company in Morocco, with an overall 21% market share (more than half with civil servants, its historical core client base) and SG's commitment to the country has not diminished in the past few years despite a more challenging operating environment, including for consumer finance companies. Ownership has remained unchanged, with SG's subsidiaries owning total direct stake of 56.8% of capital at end-2016. Fitch views Eqdom's integration into SG as only moderate. Eqdom benefits from significant independence in its day-to-day management. Nevertheless, SG and SGMB together control Eqdom's board, with the CEO being an SG executive. Eqdom benefits from SGCF's credit risk tools and procedures and from funding support from SGMB. Integration with SGMB has been growing since 2013 to adapt to the more challenging domestic environment. Eqdom also receives funding support from SGMB. As a consumer finance company, it is wholesale-funded. Its non-equity funding is sourced from domestic medium-term debt issues and bank loans (near half of which are from SGMB). Refinancing needs are manageable and liquidity risk is mitigated by the potential support from SGMB. RATING SENSITIVITIES SUPPORT RATING SGMB A downgrade of SGMB's Support Rating could result from a reduction in SG's stake in SGMB, reduced strategic importance to or lower integration with SG. SGMB's Support Rating would also be downgraded if SG's Long-Term IDR is downgraded by at least four notches, which is very unlikely. Finally, SGMB's Support Rating would also be downgraded if Morocco's Country Ceiling is revised downwards by at least two notches, which Fitch also views as unlikely. EQDOM A downgrade of Eqdom's Support Rating could result from a reduction in SG's stake in Eqdom, reduced strategic importance to or lower integration with SG. Eqdom's Support Rating would also be downgraded if SG's Long-term IDR is downgraded. Finally, Eqdom's Support Rating would also be downgraded if Morocco's Country Ceiling is revised downwards by at least two notches, which Fitch also views as unlikely. NATIONAL RATINGS SGMB A downgrade of SGMB's National Ratings could result from a reduction in SG's stake in SGMB, reduced strategic importance to or lower integration with SG, or a three-notch downgrade of SG's Long-Term IDR, which Fitch does not expect. EQDOM A downgrade of Eqdom's National Ratings could result from a reduction in SG's stake in Eqdom, reduced strategic importance to or lower integration with SG. A one-notch downgrade of SG's Long-Term IDR would lead to a one-notch downgrade of Eqdom's National Long-Term Rating. An upgrade of Eqdom's National Ratings could result from greater levels of integration with SGMB or an increase in SG's ownership stake in Eqdom. A one-notch upgrade of SG's Long-Term IDR would result in an upgrade on Eqdom's National Ratings. The rating actions are as follows: Societe Generale Marocaine de Banques National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AAA(mar)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(mar)' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Eqdom National Long-term Rating affirmed at 'AA(mar)'; Outlook Stable National Short-term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(mar)' Support Rating affirmed at '2' Contact: Primary Analyst Janine Dow Senior Director +44 20 3530 1464 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Nicolas Charreyron Analyst +971 4 424 1208 Committee Chairperson Alexander Danilov Senior Director Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

A stalemate between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nation's fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two fiscal years. Since fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, lawmakers passed a spending and revenue plan to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Dan Solender, lead tax-free fixed-income portfolio manager at Lord Abbett, said on Wednesday that the price rise on Illinois' bonds in secondary market trading was also happening to debt sold by other issuers in the state, such as Chicago's Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority.  I guess there's optimism that (the state is) making progress,  he said. Over the extended Fourth of July holiday weekend, the Democratic-controlled Illinois House and Senate passed a $36 billion fiscal 2018 spending plan and $5 billion income tax hike aimed at ending a two-year budget impasse. While Rauner vetoed the trio of budget and revenue bills on Tuesday, the Senate quickly overrode his action. It is now up to the House to vote to overturn the vetoes and enact the budget and tax hike. The chamber was not able to meet on Wednesday due to the lack of a quorum and is scheduled to return to session on Thursday. Spreads on Illinois general obligation bonds due in 2025 tightened to a range of 238 to 210 basis points over Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A yield scale from a previous 276 basis points, according to MMD. For some bonds maturing in 2029, the spread narrowed to 220 basis points over the scale from 275 basis points.  It's clearly a pretty big (spread) tightening in the wake of the budget legislation,  said MMD analyst Greg Saulnier. Randy Smolik, another MMD analyst, added that the Illinois bond price rise was  definitely having a ripple effect for other Illinois credits.  Illinois has the widest so-called credit spreads over MMD's scale and the lowest credit ratings among the 50 U.S. states.

Payments companies have become targets for credit card companies and banks seeking to capitalise on a switch from cash transactions to paying by smartphone or other mobile device, with Danish payment services firm Nets A/S revealing it had been approached by potential buyers. Shares in Worldpay rose by nearly 28 percent on Tuesday when Britain's largest payments firm said it had received approaches from both Vantiv and JPMorgan , which is Worldpay's corporate broker. The U.S. bank said that while it had shown a preliminary interest, it does not plan to make a rival bid.  Given the current price, strategic rationale for Vantiv and lack of significant EPS (earnings per share) accretion we believe it is unlikely other suitors will emerge at this point,  analysts at Cowen said following the announcement of the deal. Under the terms revealed on Wednesday, Vantiv will pay 55 pence in cash, 0.0672 of a new Vantiv share and a 5 pence cash dividend per Worldpay share, totalling 385 pence per share. Although this is an 18.9 percent premium to Worldpay's closing share price on Monday, it is below the 409.5 pence hit on Wednesday before the announcement, which comes only 20 months after Worldpay listed in London with a 4.8 billion pound price tag. Worldpay's stock was down 9.3 percent at 370 pence at 1425 GMT while Vantiv, which has a market capitalisation of $12.3 billion, saw its shares fall 3.9 percent to $60.51. Shareholders in the British firm will own about 41 percent of the new company, which will be run by Vantiv Chief Charles Drucker and Worldpay CEO Philip Jansen. Set up in 1989, London-based Worldpay was spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland to private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent International in 2010. The firm employs 4,500 people, and says it processes around 31 million mobile, online and in-store transactions every day. While banks have been trying to develop and buy more sophisticated technology, companies like PayPal and Worldpay have gained a large market share as consumers have adopted online shopping and cashless transactions. Global Appeal Analysts say the most likely target is Worldpay's e-commerce business, especially outside the United States where Vantiv is largely focused. Worldpay says it supports 400,000 merchants in 126 currencies across 146 countries.  While Vantiv owns one of the most enviable U.S. acquiring businesses - over 30 percent of revenue from integrated channels - it has no exposure outside of North America,  Cowen analysts said. Worldpay's e-commerce payments revenue, which accounts for more than a third of its total, rose by 21.7 percent to 386.6 million pounds in 2016, driven by new business wins and strength in its global retail and digital content units. Analysts at Berenberg said before the announcement that Vantiv - as well as JP Morgan, is suffering from excessive exposure to the offline U.S. market.  The acquisition of Worldpay would give them international e-commerce capabilities that they would be able to cross-sell to their U.S. client base.  Increased exposure to the United States would also help Worldpay, which reported a lower than expected rise in 2016 revenue, hurt by weakness in its American business which accounts for more than a quarter of its revenue..

The zloty, the forint and the leu  weakened by 0.1-0.2 percent against the euro by 1451 GMT.     Regional equities rose, however, tracking a rebound in global share markets due to expectations that the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting later on Wednesday will not add to recent hawkish signals from central banks in the world.     Central banks in the European Union's eastern wing have mostly remained dovish.     The Hungarian central bank confirmed in the minutes of its June meeting that it stood ready to ease monetary conditions if needed, adding that inflation remained moderate.     The Polish central bank echoed that after its meeting.     Its new inflation and GDP forecasts showed little change and its governor Adam Glapinski said the new projections only strengthened his view that interest rates would not be changed this year and next.     Upcoming economic figures, if they show higher inflation pressure, may trigger expectations for a shift to more hawkish rhetoric and help support the zloty, analysts have said.      Erste analyst Katarzyna Rzentarzewska said inflation could remain below the bank's target in the medium term.      The economy should continue to expand at robust pace, however, is not enough to change the MPC's (central bank's)stance,  she said in a note.     Glapinski himself did not rule out the possibility that the bank may discuss rate changes before the end of 2018. Rate-setter Eugeniusz Gatnar said it was a risk that negative inflation-adjusted interest rates could hurt savings.     In regional equities markets, Romanian shares led the rise, with Bucharest's main index gaining more than 2.5 percent.     The index touched a 4-1/2-month low on Tuesday as investors fretted about Romania's proposal to overhaul its corporate tax system and shift to a progressive tax on a company's turnover, replacing its flat 16 percent corporate tax rate.     But on Wednesday the market drew relief from speculation in the Romanian media that the reform would be watered down in the planning process.     The ruling leftists' fiscal plans have kept Romanian markets on edge this year, fuelling worries that the budget deficit and inflation could rise.     Romanian central bank Governor Mugur Isarescu told a banking seminar on Tuesday that policymakers would not start hiking interest rates before inflation rebounded, but that higher price growth was inevitable.

The rand traded at 13.4200 per dollar, 1.6 percent weaker on the day and at the weakest since May 18, according to Thomson Reuters data. But the weaker currency sparked demand for shares in South African companies that earn the bulk of the profit overseas, pushing the benchmark index nearly 1 percent higher. TreasuryOne currency dealer Andre Botha said the rand had been pressured by a stronger dollar earlier in the session and extended losses after reports that the African National Congress (ANC) had agreed that the central bank should be state-owned. The ANC also proposed that land expropriation without compensation should be allowed where it is  necessary and unavoidable .  All these radical transformation policies there has been rumblings on them for a while now. The fact that they are thinking about it is worrisome and that's why the rand has tanked,  Botha said. The party's proposal on the central bank is likely to raise concerns about the independence of the Reserve Bank after an anti-graft watchdog recommended its mandate be changed to place more focus on growth and not just inflation and the rand currency. On the bourse, the blue-chip JSE Top-40 index added 0.9 percent at 42,241 and the broader All-share index was up 0.8 percent at 52,483. Companies such British American Tobacco, (BAT) drugmaker Aspen Pharmancare and foodservice firm Bidcorp were in demand thanks to a weaker rand. BAT was up 2.9 percent, Aspen climbed 2.5 percent and Bidcorp picked up 4.5 percent. These companies earn the bulk of the profits offshore and are considered safe bets when the rand weakens. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond duein 2026 jumped 9 basis points to 8.86 percent.

In a pointed message before U.S. President Donald Trump's first G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany later this week, the IMF said in an economic briefing note to the leaders that a rules-based and open trading system was vital for world prosperity.  Myopic pursuit of zero-sum policies can only end by hurting all countries, as history shows,  the IMF said.  Because national policies inevitably interact in a number of vital areas, creating strong spillovers across countries, the world economy works far better for all when policymakers engage in regular dialogue and work within agreed mechanisms to resolve disagreement.  The IMF's pitch to maintain multilateral cooperation comes as the Trump administration is considering imposing broad new steel tariffs or quotas based on national security grounds, a move that has not occurred since the World Trade Organization was launched in 1995. The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to wait until after the G20 summit this Friday and Saturday to issue its review of the steel industry's national security implications, part of an effort to persuade China and other countries to cut excess capacity in the sector. It is working on a similar report on the U.S. aluminum industry, also invoking provisions of a 1962 U.S. trade law. The IMF also said that while the global economic recovery remains on track, with growth this year and next year in the 3.5 percent range, its forecasts do not include a major trade disruption.

Braskem, whose stock market quotes are being given separately as a result of the delay, has until June 22 to formally present a defense.  The case will be ruled on this week and could result in the suspension of the company,  the bourse said. If the problem persists, at the end of the process Braskem may be compulsorily delisted from Level 1 trading, the bourse said. Level 1 trading requires companies to maintain a free-float of at least 25 percent of capital. The deadline to cure delays in the submission of financial statements is 30 days, B3 said. Braskem did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on a report on Wednesday in the newspaper Valor Economico, which said a ruling on the suspension would be made this week. The newspaper said that until now Braskem had only submitted unaudited statements for the first quarter, the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full 2016 result. According to Valor, Braskem said the delay was due to a pending analysis by independent auditors related to internal controls and procedures after the company signed plea deals with federal prosecutors in Brazil, the United States and Switzerland in connection with a massive graft scheme known as Operation Car Wash. Brazil-based construction firm Odebrecht SA and Braskem agreed to pay at least $3.5 billion in the leniency deal it signed to resolve some international charges involving payoffs to former executives at Brazil's state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, politicians and others. Braskem is jointly owned by Odebrecht and Petroleo Brasileiro. The decision to suspend the company from Level 1 trading could come as early as this week, Valor reported.

The companies are appealing against a ruling in May last year when a High Court judge decided the claim could proceed in the English courts on behalf of 1,826 Zambian villagers.   Zambia is overwhelmingly the proper place for this mass tort claim,  Charles Gibson Q.C., representing Vedanta, told the court on Wednesday. The villagers are represented by London law firm Leigh Day, which says the case has significance in defining the future liability of multinational companies for alleged human rights and environmental abuses abroad. Earlier this year the High Court ruled that Royal Dutch Shell could not be sued in London over oil spills in Nigeria. Leigh Day, which is also representing villagers in that case, has appealed. In the Vedanta case, a judge last year agreed the Zambian villagers had a legal right for their claim against Vedanta to be heard under English law and concluded the claimants were unlikely to get justice in Zambia.  The Zambian villagers are hopeful that the judgment is upheld and they can move forward with prosecuting their claims,    Martyn Day, a partner at Leigh Day, said in a statement. Given the complexity of the legal arguments and the looming August break, it could be months before a judgment is delivered following the appeal, legal experts say.

Private First Class Hansen Kirkpatrick of Wasilla, Alaska, died on Monday when he was struck by  indirect fire,  a military term that usually encompasses rockets, mortars, or artillery, the U.S. military command in Kabul said in a statement. Kirkpatrick was assigned to the U.S. Army's 1st Armored Division, which is based in Fort Bliss, Texas. Two other American soldiers were also wounded but their injuries were not expected to be life threatening and they were receiving medical treatment, the statement said. Large stretches of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, source of much of the world's illegal opium supply, are in the hands of Taliban fighters, who have steadily pushed back Afghan forces that now control less than 60 percent of the country. U.S. and NATO coalition troops are deployed in Helmand to train and advise Afghan security forces struggling against Taliban insurgents. Some American units also conduct partnered operations, special operations raids, and provide air support. Overall, around 13,000 U.S. and allied troops are deployed in Afghanistan. Several thousand additional American forces operate as part of a separate counterterrorism mission in the country. The Trump administration is considering adding several thousand troops, largely in a training and support capacity. A delegation of U.S. senators visited Kabul on Tuesday and called for a new strategy ahead of an expected Trump review later in July on the United States’ longest war, now in its 16th year.

Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 pct in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!  Trump said in a Twitter post. Even before Pyongyang said on Tuesday it had successfully test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile, Trump recently suggested he was running out of patience with China's modest steps to pressure North Korea and has been considering moving ahead on trade actions. Analysts said the latest missile could put all of the U.S. state of Alaska in range for the first time. Trump posted the tweet shortly before leaving for Warsaw, Poland, on his way to a Group of 20 summit in Germany on Friday and Saturday.   We're going to do very well,  Trump said in response to shouted questions as he left the White House. During his trip, Trump will meet for the second time with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with whom he has expressed frustration for failing to use enough leverage to curb North Korea's nuclear program. Trump spoke with Xi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - the leaders of Asia's two largest economies - about the threat posed by North Korea, the White House said on Sunday. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and ally. Data released in April by Beijing showed China's trade with North Korea grew 37.4 percent in the first quarter this year from the same period in 2016, according to reports in the New York Times and Financial Times. Chinese exports surged 54.5 percent and imports increased 18.4 percent, according to the reports citing China's General Administration of Customs. However, that data reflects only one month of China's Feb. 26 halt of North Korean coal imports, which has crimped Pyongyang's ability to raise hard currency through exports. The General Administration of Customs said on June 23 that imports of North Korean goods in May fell by more than 30 percent from a year ago, the latest sign that China's ban on coal purchases from the isolated country continues to curb trade between them. The world's second-largest economy bought goods worth $123.8 million in May from North Korea, down 31 percent from a year ago and third lowest on record from June 2014, according to data from the Chinese agency.

Four other cities - Budapest, Rome, Hamburg and Boston - also expressed interest before quitting the bidding process, leaving the last two candidates, both of which are hoping to win the right to stage the Games for the third time. Paris hosted the 1900 and 1924 Olympics, with the 1932 and 1984 Games being in Los Angeles. The IOC will vote for the 2024 winner on Sept. 13. The organisation's executive board has recommended that at the same session, the city that misses out on the 2024 Games should be named as host for the 2028 Olympics. That proposal is expected to be confirmed next week.  Over the course of our evaluation, these two world-class cities proved their ability to host exceptional Olympic Games,  wrote the head of the IOC evaluation committee, Patrick Baumann.  And they did so in a way that clearly reflects the unique circumstances and flavours each city has to offer to the world.  Both cities are praised in the report as having the potential to deliver successful Games, with Los Angeles being commended for its low-risk strategy of using existing or temporary venues.  There are only three new permanent venues proposed, and each one is already planned by private investors irrespective of the Olympic Games,  the report noted. The Los Angeles bid is based on private funding and requires no major construction from the side of organisers with 97 percent of venues existing or temporary. Paris's plan to use iconic venues including the Eiffel Tower, the river Seine and the Louvre museum, and its compact two-cluster plan with 93 percent of venues existing or temporary also won approval. But the IOC said creating an Olympic-sized atmosphere across the central Olympic zone remained a challenge, and noted that there was still some land which needed to be acquired for the construction of the Olympic village.

Crude prices fell 3 percent, ending their longest bull-run in more than five years, hurt by rising OPEC exports and a stronger dollar. Shares of Exxon and Chevron were down more than 1 percent, weighing the most on the S&P; and the Dow. The Federal Reserve is due to release minutes of its last meeting later in the day. Investors will look for more clues on its next rate hike and details on the central bank's plan to cut its crisis-era bond portfolio. A recent set of tepid economic data and an inflation rate below the central bank's 2 percent target may have a bearing on the Fed's rate hike plans.  The biggest question mark for investors today is going to be an indication as far as timing is concerned for when the Fed is going to begin their balance sheet reduction plans,  said Marcelle Daher, senior managing director, asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management.  In general they have indicated September, with the last rate hike for 2017 to fall in the December time frame, so anything that confirms or denies that assumption is going to be interesting for the market.

The tech sector led the S&P; gainers with a 0.69 percent rise, with Apple, Microsoft and Amazon lifting the sector. Tech stocks have been volatile in the past few weeks on concerns over the sector's valuation, after powering the S&P;'s record run this year.  In a world of muted growth, tech stocks can still be attractive for delivering attractive rates of earnings growth ... However, because of the positioning around tech, there is to be expected a period of consolidation,  Daher said. O'Reilly Automotive slumped as much as 19.9 percent to a near three-year low after its second-quarter same-store sales widely missed its own estimates. The stock dragged down other auto-parts retailers with Autozone and Advance Auto Parts falling 9.4 percent and 14 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,953 to 830.

The law envisages that as of July 1, 2018, mobile phone operators must store all user-generated data including voice calls and messages for six months, as part of wider regulations passed last year in response to growing terrorism threats. Lawmakers have suggested delaying the enforcement of the law, which is expected to inflate operators' costs, by five years to 2023, the Vedomosti business daily reported on Tuesday, citing sources and pushing telecoms stocks higher.   To simply postpone, delay the coming into force of these norms of the anti-terrorist package to 2023 we think is counter-productive,  Nikiforov told reporters. He said however that it would be impossible to enforce the law in a single step on one day and therefore a plan should be drawn up that could result in its implementation in stages over a two- to five-year period.  We are looking for a compromise... I think next week we'll see some kind of an agreed position,  Nikiforov said.     Russian telecoms operators MTS, Megafon, Veon's subsidiary Vimpelcom and Rostelecom's venture Tele2 have estimated that they would have to spend a total of 2.2 trillion roubles ($37 billion) to comply with the law.

The yen rose briefly on safe-haven demand after North Korea said on Wednesday it conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can carry a large nuclear warhead.     A sharp pullback in oil prices bogged down the Canadian dollar and other currencies of countries whose economies are reliant on commodity exports.       Traders are looking for more clarity on the Fed's strategy for the rest of the year,  said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.     The dollar index was up 0.18 percent at 96.388 after touching a one-week high earlier on Wednesday.     The euro was down 0.12 percent at $1.1329, retreating further from its highest levels in over a year reached last week.     The greenback hit a seven-week high against the yen at 113.68 yen before fading to 113.27 yen, little changed on the day.     The dollar slipped below 113 yen in overnight trading in the wake of Pyongyang's announcement on its latest missile launch.     U.S. financial markets were closed on Tuesday for the July Fourth holiday.      In addition to more details on how the Fed would reduce bond  reinvestments to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, traders are awaiting hints on the timing on the next interest rate increase even as inflation has softened in recent months.     The Fed will release the record of its June 13-14 policy meeting at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT).     As U.S. price growth has weakened and remained below the Fed's 2 percent inflation goal, some traders have piled on bets for the dollar to fall.     Bearish bets on the greenback rose in late June as the European Central Bank and Bank of England hinted they might consider scaling back monetary stimulus later this year.     A 3 percent drop in oil prices hurt the Canadian , Australian, New Zealand dollars and other commodity-sensitive currencies.       The Canadian dollar fell 0.5 percent at C$1.3002 per dollar after hitting C$1.2912 on Tuesday, which was its strongest against the greenback since Sept. 9. ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 11:17AM (1517 GMT)  Description      RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct Change     YTD Pct     High Bid    Low Bid                                               Previous                   Change                                                                Session                                             Euro/Dollar      EUR=        $1.1336        $1.1342     -0.05%         +7.83%      +1.1368     +1.1313  Dollar/Yen       JPY=        113.2500       113.2600    -0.01%         -3.10%      +113.6800   +112.8300  Euro/Yen         EURJPY=     128.37         128.48      -0.09%         +4.25%      +129.0700   +128.1700  Dollar/Swiss     CHF=        0.9651         0.9653      -0.02%         -5.18%      +0.9687     +0.9628  Sterling/Dollar  GBP=        1.2913         1.2916      -0.02%         +4.68%      +1.2948     +1.2894  Dollar/Canadian  CAD=        1.2996         1.2935      +0.47%         -3.23%      +1.3014     +1.2930  Australian/Doll  AUD=        0.7576         0.7600      -0.32%         +5.00%      +0.7632     +0.7572  ar                                                                                               Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=     1.0941         1.0953      -0.11%         +2.09%      +1.0965     +1.0942  Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=     0.8775         0.8777      -0.02%         +3.02%      +0.8809     +0.8761  NZ               NZD=        0.7265         0.7288      -0.32%         +4.67%      +0.7296     +0.7256  Dollar/Dollar                                                                                    Dollar/Norway    NOK=        8.3970         8.3531      +0.53%         -2.78%      +8.4147     +8.3320  Euro/Norway      EURNOK=     9.5201         9.4784      +0.44%         +4.78%      +9.5273     +9.4676  Dollar/Sweden    SEK=        8.4908         8.5252      -0.50%         -6.77%      +8.5301     +8.4904  Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=     9.6236         9.6717      -0.50%         +0.46%      +9.6770     +9.6202                         (Additional reporting by Saikat Chatterjee in LONDON, Hideyuki Sano in TOKYO; Editing by Toby Chopra and Meredith Mazzilli)       ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL8N1JW37N"},

KABUL (Reuters) - A bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators visiting Afghanistan on Tuesday called for a new strategy from the Trump administration to turn the tide against an increasingly strong Taliban insurgency and end the longest war in U.S. history. The delegation led by Senator John McCain was in Kabul on a regional trip that included two days in neighboring Pakistan. The visit preceded an expected Trump review later in the month of the strategy for the United States’ longest war, now in its 16th year, a subject that was largely absent from last year’s presidential campaign. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year and has made Afghanistan the second-ranking country in people seeking refugee status abroad last year, behind Syria. McCain said in a Kabul press briefing on Tuesday at NATO-coalition headquarters that  none of us would say that we are on a course to success here in Afghanistan .  That needs to change and quickly,  added McCain, a sharp critic of Trump within their Republican party.   McCain was accompanied by U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse and David Perdue on the regional tour. U.S. Senator John McCain speaks during a news conference in Kabul, Afghanistan July 4, 2017.Mohammad IsmailWarren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said she came to get  the view on the ground about what is happening  in Afghanistan.  We need a strategy in the United States that defines our role in Afghanistan, defines our objective and explains how we can get from here to there,  Warren said. U.S. officials have told Reuters that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will present Trump with strategic options for  Afghanistan by mid-July.  Slideshow (2 Images)Last month, Trump gave Mattis the authority to set American troop levels in Afghanistan, but as commander in chief Trump must sign off on an overall strategy for the war. U.S. security officials have privately said the most likely options will be to increase training and air support by 3,000-5,000 troops for still-inexperienced Afghan security forces, while also tracking down al Qaeda, Islamic State and other global Islamist militants based in Afghanistan.  The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has said  several thousand  more foreign troops – mostly trainers -  are needed to break a military stalemate with the Taliban. In 2001, a U.S.-backed military intervention in Afghanistan toppled the Taliban regime, whose ultra-hardline interpretation of sharia (Islamic law) banned most women from public life and executed people not seen as sufficiently pious, such as men with beards not considered long enough. More than 15 years later, about 13,000 U.S. and allied troops remain in Afghanistan as part of a training and advising mission in support of an elected government that has increasingly been losing ground to a Taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory.

The law envisages that as of July 1, 2018, mobile phone operators must store all user-generated data including voice calls and messages for six months, as part of wider regulations passed last year in response to growing terrorism threats. Lawmakers have suggested delaying the enforcement of the law, which is expected to inflate operators' costs, by five years to 2023, the Vedomosti business daily reported on Tuesday, citing sources and pushing telecoms stocks higher.   To simply postpone, delay the coming into force of these norms of the anti-terrorist package to 2023 we think is counter-productive,  Nikiforov told reporters. He said however that it would be impossible to enforce the law in a single step on one day and therefore a plan should be drawn up that could result in its implementation in stages over a two- to five-year period.  We are looking for a compromise... I think next week we'll see some kind of an agreed position,  Nikiforov said.     Russian telecoms operators MTS, Megafon, Veon's subsidiary Vimpelcom and Rostelecom's venture Tele2 have estimated that they would have to spend a total of 2.2 trillion roubles ($37 billion) to comply with the law.

In a letter to the Financial Times on Wednesday, Labour's Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer said the party understood that the future relationship with the European Court of Justice would have to change as Britain leaves the European Union, due in March 2019. But he said by ruling out any deal that would keep Britain under the jurisdiction of the court meant Prime Minister Theresa May has drawn a red line that  would prevent any future involvement of an EU-UK court-like body, even when such an arrangement is demonstrably in the national interest .

May faced calls to quit from inside and outside her ruling Conservative Party after losing its parliamentary majority in an ill-judged election that she did not need to call, plunging Britain into the worst political instability for decades. She has struggled since then to unite her government on policy and to assemble a new team of aides -- one Conservative lawmaker described it as  career suicide  to agree to serve a leader whose days in office may be numbered. But party sources say moves to oust May are now on hold after senior figures agreed she should be the one to at least make a start on two years of Brexit talks that are likely to stretch her government and possibly the public's patience, giving the world's fifth biggest economy some breathing space. If she fails to make headway or satisfy some of her more euroskeptic party members, then she can answer for it, the party sources said.  She'll stay for as long as we want her to,  one lawmaker told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.  Now is not that time.  Concerns over the reaction of Britons if asked to vote for the fourth time in just over two years, over losing Conservative seats and of having someone else take over the lead in talks  with the European Union have calmed calls to replace May. Even the most embittered lawmakers say a new leadership vote would simply deepen divisions in the party over Brexit and its austerity agenda, blamed by opposition politicians for a devastating fire in west London that killed at least 80 people and for straining a police service battling militant attacks. May, 60, has said she will carry on, despite her pride being  shattered  by the election, said one veteran Conservative Party member who spoke on condition of anonymity. Related CoverageBritain's Labour calls on government to drop European court red line But I suspect her sense of duty is bigger than (predecessor David) Cameron's,  the source said.  No one actually wants the job, well they do want the job but not now.  Clearing Up The  Mess  May, Britain's longest serving interior minister in over a century with a reputation as a tough and diligent politician, became the country's second female premier after Margaret Thatcher when Cameron resigned after Britons voted for Brexit. Her path then was cleared when two other hopefuls -- her now foreign minister Boris Johnson and environment minister Michael Gove - all but killed off each others' bids and she appealed to members with her straight-talking can-do attitude.    But her boast that she could never be found  drinking in parliament's bars  may come to haunt her - having not been part of one of the Conservative cliques, she is very much alone as others in the party plot their routes to power.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves after attending the annual Henley Royal Regatta rowing festival in Henley-on-Thames, Britain, June 30, 2017.Toby MelvilleThe veteran source said her pledge to clear up  the mess  she created by staging the June 8 election had softened many Conservatives, who have traditionally punished leaders over any sign of weakness. They are also driven by self-preservation. The election revealed the shortcomings of Conservative Campaign Headquarters and some Conservatives say it is time to take stock and restructure before the next election after Jeremy Corbyn's opposition Labour Party leapt in opinion polls.  We need to get campaigning again properly, get the message out,  the lawmaker said.   We have spent years mopping up the mess left by Labour and now we are opening the door to Corbyn. The country will go bankrupt if he gets in and it'll take us 20 years to get back.  May in Retreat May has promised to promote reform in the party, but forced to accept the resignations of her two closest aides and a steady departure of senior members of her Downing Street office team, her control is draining away. Appointed shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union, May ran a tight ship for months - giving little away, she tried to limit leaks by keeping some of her more publicity hungry ministers in check and sticking to the party line. Now, they have been let off the leash.  Differences over Brexit strategy and a pay cap on public sector workers are aired almost daily while the prime minister's projects to bring in more selective schools and give lawmakers a vote on lifting a ban on fox hunting have been dropped.  May, it seems, has retreated.  Before she could say you're not going on TV ... But now she can't crack the whip like a prime minister normally does,  the veteran Conservative said. She has reverted to type, the source said, of the  quiet girl in class who just got on with her homework , allowing her ministers such as finance minister Phillip Hammond to take some of the limelight and a more commanding role. For now, despite differences, her team of senior ministers is at least pulling in the same broad direction, toward a clean break with the European Union that sees Britain out of the bloc's single market to prioritize controlling immigration.  It's a bit like a rowing boat, where everyone is pulling at different speeds, but not hard enough to topple it over,  the veteran Conservative said.  It's loud and it's messy, but it's actually democracy.  Editing by Peter Millership","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-may-idUSKBN19Q0HU"},

It was the latest in a spate of attacks on Kenyan security services since Nairobi sent troops into Somalia in 2011 to join a African Union force charged with neutralizing militant and other armed groups and bolstering its U.N.-backed government.  Al Shabaab gunmen attacked the police station in the town of Pandanguo in the coastal district of Lamu around 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), forcing villagers to flee, according to residents. The area is near Kenya's long, porous border with Somalia.  The militants also raided a dispensary for drugs and houses for food items, clothes and other valuables, witnesses said. Smoke could be seen rising from the village later in the day. By 6 p.m., three policemen had been killed and a gunbattle was continuing, police said.   The attackers used RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades),  George Kinoti, Kenya's national police spokesman, said in a text message.  Reinforcements sent to engage the enemy have killed several terrorists.   In July 2014, more than 60 militants attacked the same village, torched houses and stole drugs at the same dispensary. Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, confirmed Wednesday's attack to Reuters by phone.   We burned the police station and captured cars. Now, today, there are sporadic exchanges of gunfire between us and the police in the outskirts of the town but we still control the town,  he said.  The raid follows a series of attacks in Kenya claimed by Somali militants that have killed at least 28 people in the last six weeks. Most have taken place near the Somali border.  The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militia is fighting to overthrow Somalia's weak, U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law in the Horn of Africa state. They ramped up attacks in neighboring Kenya after Kenyan troops entered Somalia to join the AU peacekeeping force there.  In a separate incident in Somalia, an air strike killed 10 al Shabaab militants near the southern port city of Kismayo, the Mogadishu government said. It was not immediately clear who carried out the air strike.  Somalia's government does not have aircraft but mentioned  international partners  in its press statement. Ethiopia, Kenya and the United States have all conducted air raids on Somali territory.

A number of gaps have been identified at clearing houses which warrant immediate high priority action, the regulators said, adding that gaps in compliance with rules for preventing them from becoming too-big-to-fail must be plugged by December. Following the financial crisis regulators required trillions of dollars of derivatives like interest rate and credit default swaps to go through clearing to boost safety and transparency. This has led to a sharp growth in volumes passing through a clearing house, a third party that ensures a trade is completed, even if one side of the transaction goes bust.  One area was recovery planning, where a number of clearing houses had not yet put in place the full set of recovery rules and procedures,  IOSCO and CPMI said. A number of clearers had also not put in place policies to ensure they maintain the required level of financial resources, such as cash and collateral, on an on-going basis. The updates were written by IOSCO, a global body of securities regulators, the Financial Stability Board, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) - part of the Bank for International Settlements - and the global Basel Committee of banking supervisors. Clearing houses should  promptly  identify any areas where changes are necessary and implement them by no later than the end of 2017, the regulators said. They also named for the first time the clearing houses which they deem to be  systemically important  in more than one country, and must each come under their own  crisis management group  of supervisors. These groups, founded on co-operation agreements signed by regulators, would monitor the clearing house in a crisis. BME Clearing in Spain, Cassa in Italy, CME in the United States, Eurex Clearing in Germany, EuroCCP in the Netherlands, HKFE Clearing in Hong Kong, ICE Clear units in Britain and the United States, LCH units in France and Britain, Nasdaq Clearing in Sweden, and SIX x-clear in Switzerland were all named as systemic.  The regulators noted how the sector has become concentrated, with the biggest two, unamed, clearing houses accounting for about a third of all financial resources in the sector.

Tellenes wind farm, a 50-turbine strong wind farm of 160-megawatt (MW) capacity that is currently under development, will become Norway's largest wind farm and Google's biggest in Europe.  We'll purchase power as soon as the wind farm becomes fully operational, which we expect will take place in early September 2017,  a Google spokesman told Reuters. Google last year signed a 12-year deal to buy 100 percent of the plant's output. The company, which has four European data centers in Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland, said the wind power will be used to supply one or several of them. The Tellenes wind farm's first turbine will begin to generate power by next week, said Olav Rommetveit, a spokesman for farm maker Zephyr, although Google will not receive the initial output. The Google sign is reflected in a rain puddle outside their offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., June 27, 2017.Brian Snyder Google will not immediately get the supply. It has an exclusive contract for 12 years and they will begin getting the electricity at some point after commercial operations begins,  said Rommetveit. The electricity produced until Google starts receiving the farm's full capacity, will be sold on the Nord Pool power exchange, he added. BlackRock (BLK.N), which provided the project's equity financing, confirmed the first turbine would be ready for production next week and said power sales would start a few days later. Arise (ARISE.ST), a Swedish wind power company, will be the farm's operator. Google has also bought the future output of a smaller wind farm in Sweden, due to start operation in 2018, bringing the total capacity of its renewable power purchases in Europe to 500 MW, the company said.

This will improve Hungary's energy security a great deal, so it is in our strategic interest for this cooperation to start,  state news agency MTI quoted Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto as saying. Natural gas supplies to eastern Europe have been a major area of competition between incumbent pipeline power Russia and the United States, which is touting its liquefied natural gas (LNG) potential in the region via onshore LNG terminals. Trump is expected to use fast-growing U.S. LNG supplies as a political tool when he meets in Poland on Thursday with leaders of a dozen countries, including Hungary, that are captive to Russia for their energy needs. Szijjarto, who is in Moscow, told MTI by phone that he had agreed with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller to join Turkish Stream with a link that could enable Hungary to import 8 billion cubic meters of gas a year, close to the country's total consumption. Hungary, which relies on Russian imports via Ukraine for nearly all of its gas use, has sought to diversify its imports geographically as well as by supplier for years. Asked by Reuters how the American LNG potential and Russian gas square up in Hungary's energy plans, a Foreign Ministry spokesman could not immediately comment. Hungary's ambassador to Washington told a business forum in Budapest earlier this week that he would be keen to import American LNG as well. A southern link to Russian pipelines has long been planned, with a previous project, South Stream, canceled by Russia in 2014 in the wake of the Ukrainian conflict and EU sanctions. The EU said it wanted to separate the owner of the pipeline from the owner of the gas, but analysts also said it wanted to prevent Russia from shipping gas to Europe bypassing Ukraine, downgrading its geopolitical significance. International interconnectors between Hungary and possible trade partners Romania and Croatia also remain to be built, while Szijjarto said Croatia is not expected to complete a long-planned LNG import terminal any time soon. That terminal, planned for the Adriatic island of Krk, would be capable of bringing U.S. gas to Hungary. Szijjarto noted Bulgaria and Serbia had already signed agreements with Gazprom, which stipulate financing to be cleared by the end of 2017, permits secured by end-2018, for the gas link to reach Hungary by 2019.  It is also a serious business opportunity for Hungary because despite all the communication hypocrisy European need for Russian gas is growing at an extraordinary rate,  he said.

A number of gaps have been identified at clearing houses which warrant immediate high priority action, the regulators said, adding that gaps in compliance with rules for preventing them from becoming too-big-to-fail must be plugged by December. Following the financial crisis regulators required trillions of dollars of derivatives like interest rate and credit default swaps to go through clearing to boost safety and transparency. This has led to a sharp growth in volumes passing through a clearing house, a third party that ensures a trade is completed, even if one side of the transaction goes bust.  One area was recovery planning, where a number of clearing houses had not yet put in place the full set of recovery rules and procedures,  IOSCO and CPMI said. A number of clearers had also not put in place policies to ensure they maintain the required level of financial resources, such as cash and collateral, on an on-going basis. The updates were written by IOSCO, a global body of securities regulators, the Financial Stability Board, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) - part of the Bank for International Settlements - and the global Basel Committee of banking supervisors. Clearing houses should  promptly  identify any areas where changes are necessary and implement them by no later than the end of 2017, the regulators said. They also named for the first time the clearing houses which they deem to be  systemically important  in more than one country, and must each come under their own  crisis management group  of supervisors. These groups, founded on co-operation agreements signed by regulators, would monitor the clearing house in a crisis. BME Clearing in Spain, Cassa in Italy, CME in the United States, Eurex Clearing in Germany, EuroCCP in the Netherlands, HKFE Clearing in Hong Kong, ICE Clear units in Britain and the United States, LCH units in France and Britain, Nasdaq Clearing in Sweden, and SIX x-clear in Switzerland were all named as systemic.  The regulators noted how the sector has become concentrated, with the biggest two, unamed, clearing houses accounting for about a third of all financial resources in the sector.

At 10:25 a.m. ET (1425 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index was down 28.32 points, or 0.19 percent, at 15,102.29. The energy group, which accounts for one-fifth of the index's weight, shed 2.5 percent as oil prices turned sharply lower after eight days of gains. The most influential movers on the index included some of its biggest energy companies, with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd off 2.4 percent at C$36.61 and Suncor Energy Inc down 1.4 percent to C$37.00. U.S. crude prices were down 3.7 percent to $45.32 a barrel, while Brent crude lost 3.1 percent to $48.05, as climbing OPEC exports and a stronger dollar weighed on sentiment.

Regional airline operator Exchange Income Corp was down 6.4 percent at C$30.55 after being targeted by a short-seller who said it does not generate enough cash to pay the dividends it provides investors. The company said it strenuously disagreed with a number of statements, assumptions and opinions in the report.

Tellenes wind farm, a 50-turbine strong wind farm of 160-megawatt (MW) capacity that is currently under development, will become Norway's largest wind farm and Google's biggest in Europe.  We'll purchase power as soon as the wind farm becomes fully operational, which we expect will take place in early September 2017,  a Google spokesman told Reuters. Google last year signed a 12-year deal to buy 100 percent of the plant's output. The company, which has four European data centers in Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Ireland, said the wind power will be used to supply one or several of them. The Tellenes wind farm's first turbine will begin to generate power by next week, said Olav Rommetveit, a spokesman for farm maker Zephyr, although Google will not receive the initial output. The Google sign is reflected in a rain puddle outside their offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., June 27, 2017.Brian Snyder Google will not immediately get the supply. It has an exclusive contract for 12 years and they will begin getting the electricity at some point after commercial operations begins,  said Rommetveit. The electricity produced until Google starts receiving the farm's full capacity, will be sold on the Nord Pool power exchange, he added. BlackRock (BLK.N), which provided the project's equity financing, confirmed the first turbine would be ready for production next week and said power sales would start a few days later. Arise (ARISE.ST), a Swedish wind power company, will be the farm's operator.

Unlike Pemberton’s existing funds that invest in senior secured paper, the latest strategy will invest down the credit spectrum, offering subordinated loans at higher returns. It will target strongly performing mid-market companies as well as offer recovery capital to businesses that may have had difficulties but are gearing up for growth mode again. Around 50% of the strategy will invest in senior and unitranche loans, 35%-40% will invest in second-lien loans and the rest will invest in mezzanine and deeply subordinated preferred pieces. Taking advantage of Pemberton’s pan-European platform and people on the ground across the continent to originate deals, some 75%-80% of the loans will be to European companies, while the rest will be made to UK companies. Non-sponsored corporates, family-owned businesses and small local sponsor-backed businesses with Ebitda ranging from €10m-€100m will be the focus. Working closely with banks, Pemberton is seeking to fill a funding gap that has emerged with a reduction in cross-border lending as banks shy away from foreign SME lending, retreating to their home markets to support local businesses. The asset manager will also take advantage of increasing regulation on banks, which has constrained more risky subordinated lending. “Forty percent owned by L&G;, there is a halo effect that comes from a large stable insurance company and Pemberton can leverage those relationships to fill the gap of foreign banks. A shift in regulatory pressures in how banks treat their capital means it is not as easy for them to do subordinated lending and there is a real need for a partner to not only fulfill final hold amounts but to also provide subordinated debt,” said Ben Gulliver, Strategic Credit Portfolio Manager at Pemberton. Unitranche lenders typically offer loans at 7.5%-8% on companies that are leveraged between 5.5-6.0 times debt to Ebitda. Pemberton is seeking to lend at significantly higher returns on lower leveraged companies. “Pemberton is giving LPs a different investment than other direct lending funds which are predominantly focused on the sponsor arena. It is a different collateral pool. The return profile of the strategy will be significantly higher than the current unitranche market for a significantly better risk profile,” said Gulliver. Pemberton raised €1.2bn for its European Mid-Market Debt Fund, that started fundraising in 2015 and closed in November 2016. It provides senior debt financing to mid-market borrowers in Europe, focusing on companies with a turnover between €75m and €1bn. In September 2016 Pemberton launched a £500m UK Mid-Market Direct Lending Strategy. (Editing by Christopher Mangham)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/pemberton-loans-idUSL8N1JW4DY"},

The effort to boost earnings and profits will bring benefits in terms of higher return to those who have claims towards Agrokor,  Ramljak said. Agrokor earlier said the 15-month loan had an interest rate of 4 percent annually and could be extended to 24 months, and was agreed under a so-called  roll-up  arrangement, meaning that on maturity, Agrokor will settle some of its other debts with the lenders at the same time as repaying the loan. Agrokor, which has around 60,000 employees, was put under state management in early April after it built up debts that amounted to at least 40.4 billion kuna ($6.2 billion) at the end of March.

English Premier League club Manchester City, managed by former Barca boss Pep Guardiola, were reported to have tabled a bid earlier this year for the 30-year-old, who scored 37 goals in La Liga and 11 times in the Champions League last season. Messi's father and agent Jorge opened negotiations with Barcelona officials last December, but their talks on the player's eighth professional contract there progressed slowly. The player joined the Catalan giants at the age of 13, made his debut in 2004 and has been there ever since, winning 30 major honours including eight domestic league titles and four Champions League trophies.  The No.10 has notched a record 507 goals for Barca in all competitions and is La Liga's record all-time scorer with 349 goals. Messi married childhood sweetheart Antonella Roccuzzo in their native Argentina last week and is set to put pen to paper on his new deal at Barcelona when he returns from his honeymoon later this month, the club said.  FC Barcelona and Leo Messi have agreed on a contract renewal that will keep the Argentinian at the club until June 30th, 2021,  a club statement read.  The club is very happy with both the renewal and the commitment of Messi, the best player in history, who has played his full professional career at Barca and has led the team to an era of extraordinary success.  Local media reports suggest Messi will remain the club's highest earner, while his buyout clause has been increased to 300 million euros ($340.08 million). New Deals The player follows in the footsteps of team mates Luis Suarez and Neymar, who signed new deals last season.  Messi was about to enter his last year with the club before the new contract was agreed. Messi and his father remain embroiled in a tax fraud case in Spain after a Catalan court last July found them guilty on three counts of fraud from 2007 to 2009 to the tune of 4.1 million euros ($4.6 million) on image rights. The two were handed 21-month prison sentences but may have that substituted for a fine after prosecutors said they were open to dropping the jail terms. Neither are expected to go to jail as under Spanish law sentences of less than two years can be served under probation. The judge in charge of the case will make a decision bearing in mind the prosecutor's recommendations. Judges usually follow the state prosecutor's guidance in Spain. The case was one of the first high-profile investigations by Spanish authorities into top football players' tax affairs.  The state prosecutor earlier this month accused Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo of knowingly using a complex business structure to hide image rights income in Spain. Ronaldo has denied any wrongdoing.  Reporting by Joseph Cassinelli and Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by Hugh Lawson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-barcelona-messi-idUSKBN19Q118"},

No, it's not lithium. That's so much last year's thing. We're talking about cobalt. And this one's really hot.  On the London Metal Exchange (LME) the price for three-month cobalt has leapt from $32,750 per tonne at the start of January to a current $58,500.  This stellar near 80-percent price surge mirrors what happened to lithium prices a year or so ago.  The linkage is both metals' evolution from niche applications to mainstream usage in the batteries that are now powering the green technology revolution.  If a minimum $58,500 bet is a bit too much for you, some bright hedge fund guys have come up with a cheaper option.  For just nine Canadian dollars you can now buy a share in Cobalt 27 Capital Corp, which made its C$200 million ($150.7 million) debut on Canada's Venture Exchange last month. Cobalt 27 describes itself as a  pure-play cobalt investment vehicle , an alternative to investing in producers such as Glencore, for whom cobalt is one small part of a much wider portfolio.    Just don't tell the automotive guys. Because if Cobalt 27 is right in its assessment there is much more upside to the cobalt price, there's going to be some sort of reaction to a bunch of investors holding physical stocks of a strategic metal in short supply.  Getting Physical Cobalt 27 has used a sizeable chunk of its IPO proceeds to exercise options to buy a total 2,157.50 tonnes of physical cobalt. To put that figure into perspective, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates global production of refined cobalt was 97,400 tonnes in 2015.  The metal will be stored in LME warehouses operated by C. Steinweg (Baltimore, Rotterdam and Antwerp) and the Vollers Group (Rotterdam).  A smaller part of the proceeds will be used to purchase royalties and cobalt streaming agreements from eight exploration-stage properties.  Seven are prospects in Canada, three of them operated by Palisade Resources Corp, and one in Vietnam, operated by Asian Mineral Resources. The company's ambition is to add to this list. In essence, Cobalt 27 will offer capital appreciation, assuming the price of cobalt does indeed rise, and cash flow from royalties.  The whole thing is the brain-child of Pala Investments, which describes itself as  a multi-strategy investment company focused on the mining and metals value chain . Cobalt 27 Chairman and Chief Executive Anthony Milewski is also a managing director of the Pala team.  Pala is the largest shareholder with 19.64 percent at the time of the IPO, although the stake may have fallen slightly as an over-allotment option has since been partially declared. Part of Pala's holding represents payment for the supply of 626 tonnes of cobalt under one of the physical supply options.  Pala was one of several funds to have scooped up physical cobalt last year, which was when the metal first emerged from the specialist shadows into the investment limelight.  Another was Green Energy Metals Fund, part of the Portal Capital investment group, which is the second-largest shareholder in the new public entity having also supplied physical metal.  Not all of the cobalt sellers chose to convert to Cobalt 27 shares. According to the company's final prospectus,  a total of 961.9 metric tonnes of cobalt are being acquired for cash .  But Pala and Portal evidently think there is more to come from the cobalt story.  The Only Way Is Up? Or to quote Cobalt 27's prospectus,  the company believes strong cobalt demand, coupled with challenged supply due to a lack of primary cobalt mines and political instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the largest supplier of mined cobalt, creates an attractive proposition for cobalt price appreciation.  This is a market that is widely viewed by analysts as being in transition from a state of supply surplus to one of shortfall.  And as Cobalt 27 is happy to remind us,  in 2008, during the last multi-year cobalt supply deficit, the price of cobalt exceeded US$50/lb . That's equivalent to just over $110,000 per tonne.  There are any number of uncertainties in trying to forecast the price in such a fast-evolving market as cobalt, or lithium for that matter. Everyone agrees that the electric vehicle revolution has arrived but beyond that there is no consensus as to how fast it might evolve. And what sort of batteries will those vehicles use?  Noting that cobalt is currently used in six main types of lithium-ion battery, analysts at RFC Ambrian write that  what the demand for cobalt as a constituent for future batteries will be is open to question.  ( The Alchemist, Issue 31: Cobalt , July 2017).  If prices rise too fast, they argue, battery makes will try and reduce the amount of cobalt used, even if they can't eliminate it altogether.  Ambrian's conclusion is that cobalt demand in the year 2021 could be anything from marginally lower to 80 percent higher than today. Pala and Portal evidently believe in the more bullish of those scenarios. Supply Chain vs Speculators The irony is that if they're right and the cobalt price does go stratospheric, it will be because there's not enough of it around to meet burgeoning demand from the battery sector.  And that's going to draw a lot of unwelcome attention from a physical supply chain desperately seeking spare units.  There's a precedent for this sort of manufacturer-speculator showdown in the industrial metal space.  In 2010 JPMorgan and BlackRock near simultaneously filed prospectuses for copper funds backed by physical metal. Copper processors were outraged. They viewed the funds as competition for physical units in a market that was at that stage suffering chronic supply shortfall.  Although the regulatory and legal reactions were eventually cleared, such was the furor in the copper industry that neither fund was ever launched.  Those two funds envisaged combined holdings of around 180,000 tonnes of copper, equivalent to less than 1 percent of global refined metal production at the time  Cobalt 27's holding is already more than double that level in terms of global output.  Might it too risk the wrath of a supply chain struggling to keep up with demand?  Only time will tell, but if that scenario does materialize, it will, of course, mean that Cobalt 27's fund backers will have already been rewarded for their bullish views.

The decision on an investigation, which ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda had said was  imminent  in November, was pushed back after prosecutors received  substantial  new information from Kabul. In an email, Bensouda's office said it had received a large amount of new information from the government of Afghanistan that could influence her decision. In a preliminary examination, ICC prosecutors identified what it called  potential cases  among three groups of alleged perpetrators: the Taliban and its affiliates, the Afghan authorities and members of the U.S. armed forces and the Central Intelligence Agency. A formal investigation into whether crimes were committed by U.S. personnel in Afghanistan would hurt already tenuous relations between the ICC and the United States, which is not a member of the court and has in the past vehemently opposed it.  Bensouda's November report  triggered reaction, notably from the government of Afghanistan, which subsequently submitted substantial information to the office earlier this year,  prosecutors said in the email. That information, which probably covered local prosecutions of alleged crimes, is now being carefully reviewed. The ICC only has jurisdiction in situations where a member state such as Afghanistan is unwilling or unable to undertake prosecutions itself.  When this review is completed, the prosecutor will make a final decision on whether to request the pre-trial chamber authorization to commence an investigation,  the prosecutor’s office said. It gave no timetable.  This has to be seen as a step down by the prosecutor’s office,  said Kevin Jon Heller, an expert on the ICC and international law at Amsterdam University.  It is very rare for Bensouda to say a decision is imminent and then not to follow through: her statements are usually carefully measured and deliberate,  he said.

A deadline for Qatar to comply with a list of demands made by the states expired overnight. Doha has submitted replies to mediator Kuwait that have not been disclosed. Doha has shown no sign of acquiescing to major demands, which raises the possibility of the four states imposing more sanctions. But it is not clear that any fresh steps - such as the withdrawal of deposits from Qatar's banking system - would be crippling, given Doha's large financial resources. Qatar's index added 0.4 percent as 10 traded shares rose, including ones favoured by foreign funds such as Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan, which added 1.0 percent. Foreign funds were net buyers of Qatari stocks by a very narrow margin, bourse data showed; local funds were also net buyers, while Gulf funds were sellers. Twenty-seven stocks declined. Saudi Arabia's index fell a further 0.5 percent, taking its losses over the last two sessions to 3.0 percent. Second-quarter earnings announcements are due to start around mid-July, and Alrajhi Capital predicted in a note that consumer-related sectors would do well because of the reinstatement of civil servants' allowances and the month of Ramadan, which traditionally sees strong consumer spending. Mobile phone and computer retailer United Electronics added 3.0 percent. Earnings momentum for the broader market, however, is expected to be weak, according to a note by EFG Hermes.  Upside is limited for most of our coverage,  it said, adding that it preferred banks over petrochemicals, and secular growth stories such as the insurance and supermarket industries.

The banking sector helped take Abu Dhabi's index 0.5 percent higher with bellwether First Abu Dhabi Bank adding 1.0 percent. In Cairo the blue-chip index closed near flat. The most heavily traded stock of the day was private equity firm Qalaa Holding, which jumped 6.9 percent. Earlier this week its mining subsidiary ASEC Co for Mining reported that first-quarter net profit jumped to 232.4 million Egyptian pounds ($13.0 million) from a year-earlier loss 8.9 million pounds.

No change to text) By Andrés González and Arno Schuetze MADRID/FRANKFURT, July 4 (Reuters) - Spanish power company Gas Natural has fired the starting gun in what is expected to be the biggest upheaval among European utility companies for a decade. Chairman Isidre Faine has contacted his counterpart at Portuguese rival Energias de Portugal (EDP) about a 35 billion euro ($40 billion) deal to create Europe's fourth biggest utility firm by market value, according to sources. While the companies denied on Tuesday there were talks, bankers and analysts say a new Iberian power champion would threaten the dominance of France's EDF and Italy's Enel and could unleash a wave of European mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) in a sector ripe for consolidation. The impetus for change is partly coming from the growing shift to green energy sources. Supplies of ever-cheaper wind and solar power are surging in Europe, forcing down wholesale electricity prices and posing a threat to the traditional model of centralised power generation and distribution from large coal, gas and nuclear plants. Utility companies are fighting back by joining the shift to renewables, as well as offering customers digital devices to keep closer tabs on their power consumption. As one banker puts it, power companies need to develop a  Utility 2.0 strategy , focused on renewables, networks and retail customers. Getting bigger through acquisitions would help utilities manage the transition better, and the impending loss of public subsidies and preferential access to power networks that have cushioned utility revenues is also spurring consolidation. The new rush to merge comes after some tough years. Several utilities had to swallow hefty writedowns after a wave of acquisitions a decade ago as the traditional power generation model, and nuclear power in particular, came under pressure. Now, companies such as Gas Natural and Germany's RWE have cleaned up their up balance sheets to make it easy to carry out acquisitions or share swaps, analysts say.  A lot of mistakes have been made with respect to big ticket M&A; in the past. Everyone is keen to avoid new missteps,  said one banker specialising in utility companies. The Stoxx Eurozone utilities index lost as much as 60 percent of its value over the past decade but has rallied strongly in 2017, helped by outages at EDF reactors pushing winter power prices up and a German court declaring a nuclear fuel tax to be illegal, triggering repayments to companies. Over the past six months, the index has gained more than 15 percent, while the broader index is 7 percent higher.  The sector is finally getting to the point where it can move on from a decade of value destruction ... Confidence around utilities' sustainable cash-flow generation could grow,  said Deutsche Bank in a research note. Germany at the Heart Spain may have fired the starting gun but Germany is at the heart of the current takeover speculation. The country's largest utilities, E.ON and RWE, have separated their faster-growing green energy and retail operations from their struggling centralised power businesses. E.ON has retained the renewables business and put its old power plants in a company called Uniper. RWE, on the other hand, kept its traditional plants and put the green and retail businesses in a new company called Innogy. But with market capitalisations of about 19 billion euros, E.ON and Innogy are less than half the size of southern European renewable energy giants Enel and Iberdrola, at 56 billion euros and 50 billion euros respectively. The Italian and Spanish firms started their switch to higher-earning activities such as solar power and transmission and distribution grids a decade ago. Activity is heating up in France too, where Engie Chief Executive Isabelle Kocher is pushing the former monopoly gas utility to focus more on grids and renewables. Several investment banks are trying to engineer a share swap between Engie and RWE which could create a Franco-German energy giant, sources said in May.  Enel and Engie are really active, analysing everything. German companies are ready to do a domestic merger, or to be bought by a foreigner,  said one utilities investment banker. Enel has renewables capacity of 37 gigawatts (GW), of which 27.4 comes from hydro plants and 6.5 GW from wind power. Innogy has a green energy capacity of just 3.7 GW, mainly in wind.  Everybody is talking to everybody. But there are only few deals which really make sense. Iberdrola-Innogy may be one of them. But mainly it's about smaller asset disposals, about streamlining at times of more competitive markets and increasing cost pressures,  another utilities banker said. Iberdrola, Europe's second-largest utility by market value, is working with U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley to study opportunities while Gas Natural has turned to Citigroup for advice, according to people close to the situation. Enel has repeatedly denied any interest in Innogy and that big deals tend to destroy value.  All this M&A; talk in Europe, it is just cinema,  Enel CEO Francesco Starace told Reuters. Potential bidders are also circling Uniper, bankers say. Finland's Fortum is said to be interested in the German company's Scandinavian assets but may be hesitant to add to its carbon emissions by acquiring Uniper's coal and gas plants, which account for the bulk of its operations. Banking sources said Uniper was also a target for Czech rivals CEZ and EPH, but they cautioned that its 6.2 billion euro value, boosted by a 70 percent rise in its shares since it was spun off in September, might cool suitors' ardour. Infrastructure Funds Besides the strategic shifts shaping the sector, demand for deals is also coming from infrastructure funds, insurance companies and pension funds. They are all hunting for assets to generate steady, reliable yields as the low returns from fixed-income securities they have traditionally held are making it increasingly difficult for them to fund their liabilities. But rather than buying companies focused on green energy, funds are increasingly buying a minority stake in the renewable energy assets themselves, leaving the developer as the main operator with a majority ownership. BlackRock's renewable infrastructure investment platform launched in 2012, for example, now manages more than $4 billion in client assets, mostly wind and solar projects. Infrastructure funds are among five bidders expected to place binding offers in September for the Italian assets of Gas Natural, which is working with Rothschild on the sale. Funds are also expected to bid for Steag's municipal heating activities, which the German utility, owned by seven local municipalities, is selling with the help of Rothschild, people close to the matter said.

BoE rate-setter Michael Saunders has said he is  reasonably confident  that lower consumer spending will be offset by higher exports and investment, justifying his vote to raise interest rates from a record low 0.25 percent. But other economists are less sure, a stance the latest Markit/CIPS surveys of British businesses would seem to support. Business expectations in the services sector sank in June to their weakest level since last summer's vote to leave the European Union, and they were not far off lows last reached in late 2011. This gauge has been an early guide for the future performance of the investment intentions indicator of the BoE's monthly agents summary, which is often cited by members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Governor Mark Carney and chief economist Andy Haldane both mentioned it in recent speeches.  The PMI's index is strongly correlated with the indicator with about a four-month lead. reut.rs/2tQ3WuB This suggests that recent progress in seen in the BoE's investment intentions indicator will reverse soon. Last month's election setback for Prime Minister Theresa May, who lost her parliamentary majority in the June 8 ballot, may have influenced the downturn in sentiment in services companies in June. But the overall trend is clear as the PMI's business expectations indicator has fallen in four of the last five months. Official data on business investment are volatile from quarter to quarter. Last week the Office for National Statistics said it grew 0.6 percent in the first three months of 2017, only partially offsetting a fall in the fourth quarter. The PMIs suggest another argument for higher interest rates - that exports will surge - may also be misplaced.  The export orders gauge of Monday's manufacturing PMI slid to a five-month low in June. While still indicating growth in exports, it left Britain as the weakest performer in terms of foreign orders - barring Greece - among big western European economies for a fourth month running.

The loan, agreed by a special purpose vehicle called Otas that was set up by Oger Telecom to acquire a 55% stake in Turk Telekom in 2005, was the biggest by a Turkish borrower when it signed. Otas used its shares in Turk Telekom as collateral against the loan, which was underwritten and arranged by mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners Akbank, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Garanti Bank and JP Morgan. Houlihan Lokey has been appointed by Otas to advise on a debt restructuring and lenders are in the process of appointing advisers. “We have been talking to the lenders -- they have not mandated anyone yet, but they are getting there,” said one financial restructuring adviser. This follows two missed payments of US$290m on the loan – one in September 2016 and another one in March this year. A coordinating committee of lenders is in place, which comprises three Turkish banks -- Akbank, Garanti and Isbank, according to the restructuring adviser. “This will be a Turkish-driven solution, there are no international banks on the co-com,” he said. Akbank and Garanti have a loan exposure of around US$1.5bn and US$960m, respectively. That represents around 3.2% and 1.8% of both banks’ gross loans as of FY16, respectively, according to company filings of both banks, MUFG said in a report in April. Otas has had a restructuring plan in place for the last six months and is waiting for the lenders to appoint a restructuring adviser before talks can begin, a source close to the situation said. “Turkish banks are not used to these restructuring situations, it is easier if they appoint an adviser,” he said. A&E; ANSWER? The most likely outcome of debt negotiations is an amend and extend of the loan, with the Turkish banks unlikely to want to takeover the underlying assets of Otas –which is the 55% stake in Turk Telekom - in a debt for equity swap, the sources said. “I think this will just be resolved quite quietly – given what the Turkish banks are owed it might just be amend and extend agreed over the summer,” the restructuring adviser said. The problems repaying the debt has stemmed predominately from the depreciation in the Turkish lira over the last year. Both Oger Telecom and Turk Telekom raise revenue in Turkish lira, which is then converted into US dollars. “Otas is now worth less because of these FX difficulties -- what was a US$7bn-$8bn asset with US$4.75bn of debt is now only worth US$3.5bn-$4bn,” a second restructuring source said. The loan has recently been priced at between 73.25%-75.25% of face value on Europe’s secondary loan market, according to Thomson Reuters LPC, although it is unclear how much if any has actually sold. Oger Telecom and Turk Telekom did not reply to a request for comment. (Editing by Chris Mangham)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/turk-telekom-loans-idUSL8N1JW494"},

The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) filed a complaint with the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) after leaked emails exposed links between President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, and the creation of a Bell Pottinger  narrative that grabs the attention of the grassroots population . Duduzane was working at the time for a company controlled by the Guptas, a family of wealthy Indian-born businessman widely accused of exerting undue influence over the president, including on the hiring and firing of cabinet ministers. They and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing. The Bell Pottinger campaign needed to stress the continued  existence of economic apartheid  and  should be along the lines of #EconomicEmancipation or whatever it is , according to one email reported in domestic media. The communications preceded a sustained campaign in South Africa condemning enemies of President Zuma and leftist elements of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) as agents of  white monopoly capital . The slogan quickly gained traction in a country where the white minority still wields disproportionate economic power two decades after the end of apartheid. However, there are fears it is spiralling out of control, with a protest last week by a group called Black First Land First outside the Johannesburg home of Peter Bruce, a white newspaper columnist. Another white journalist was roughed up. In its complaint, the DA, the political home of many white South Africans, accused Bell Pottinger of working with Duduzane to  divide and conquer the South African public by exploiting racial tensions in a bid to keep Jacob Zuma and the ANC in power.  The PRCA said it had opened a  formal process  to investigate the complaint. Its Code of Conduct states that its members should  take all reasonable care that professional duties are conducted without causing offence on the grounds of gender, race, religion, disability or any other form of discrimination . Bell Pottinger did not respond to an email request for comment.  White monopoly capital  featured prominently at a major ANC policy conference this week as a rallying cry for supporters of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zuma's ex-wife and a candidate to succeed him as party leader at the end of the year. Bell Pottinger dropped Oakbay, the holding company of the Guptas' mining-to-media empire, in April, alleging that it was the target of a  politically driven smear campaign  after domestic media criticism of its role. Bell Pottinger said last week it had launched an independent audit of its time working for Oakbay. Duduzane Zuma is director of an Oakbay subsidiary.

The consortium also includes Jefferies International Limited and Emirates NBD Capital Limited, the investment ministry said on Wednesday. The government is launching an IPO programme that will offer shares in dozens of state-owned companies over the next three to five years in areas such as petroleum, services, chemicals, shipping, maritime and real estate to help boost state finances. Investment Minister Sahar Nasr told Reuters shares in ENPPI would be traded during the fourth quarter of 2017. Egypt aims to raise up to $150 million from the ENPPI offering, which be will be the first in a state-owned company since shares in Telecom Egypt and oil companies Sidi Kerir Petrochemicals and AMOC were floated 12 years ago. It has said state company IPOs will raise 5-7 billion Egyptian pounds ($276 million-$387 million) during the 2017-2018 fiscal year beginning in July.

War for the Planet of the Apes  sees motion-capture performance specialist Andy Serkis return in his role as Caesar, leader of a super-intelligent band of apes who take on an army led by Woody Harrelson's ruthless colonel in a post-apocalyptic setting. Serkis said the conflict between apes and humans at the film's core was a warning against supremacist ideologies.   If you think your species is better, if you think your type of people or your type of religion or anything that your set of beliefs is better than someone else's, then that is the road to ruin,  he said.  Serkis's on-screen antagonist Harrelson, who has experience in dystopian cinema from his role in the  Hunger Games  films, said that he had been a fan of the renewed series before being asked to appear in it.  It was a privilege to be asked to do it. I don't think it's that I'm drawn to that (dark sci-fi films), I'm just drawn - some things make sense. Some things you can't say no to.   War  follows on from  Rise of the Planet of the Apes , and  Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , and is to be the final instalment of this series, but not the end of the franchise altogether, said the film's director and co-writer Matt Reeves. The original  Planet of the Apes  spawned a five-film series that ran from 1968 to 1973. The first film, an arresting science fiction classic that starred Charlton Heston, won an Oscar for its prosthetic make-up effects and was a critical and commercial hit, but the subsequent movies struggled to replicate the original's success.

The ruling comes as Airbnb, much like its ride-hailing peer Uber, is facing a growing crackdown from legislators worldwide triggered in part by lobbying from the hotel industry, who see the rental service as unfair competition. Airbnb and other rental platforms have also been criticised for driving up property prices and contributing to a housing shortage in some cities such as Paris or Berlin. With 350,000 listings, France is Airbnb's second-largest market after the United States, and Paris, the most visited city in the world, is its biggest single market, with 65,000 homes. On Tuesday the Paris City Council voted to make it mandatory from Dec. 1 to obtain a registration number from the town hall before posting an advertisement for a short-term rental on a website. The ruling thus makes it harder for those renting out property to exceed the 120 days a year legal rental limit for a main residence, and makes it easier for authorities to track which properties are rented out, and also to collect local taxes.  This is a strong signal sent out to other municipalities. Local collectivities now have a tool to monitor the tourist offers and control the collection of tourist taxes,  Roland Heguy, the head of French hotel federation UMIH said in a statement. Like a lot of big cities Paris is cracking down on illegal tourist rentals and trying to regulate and limit the legal element of the phenomenon. The French capital lost at least 20,000 rental properties from the market over the last five years, and in the central and western part of Paris tourist rentals now make up to 20 percent of the global rental offer, the City said in its ruling. Airbnb officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Due to pressure from hoteliers and officials Airbnb has agreed to charge visitors the traditional French  tourist tax . It began collecting the tax from guests in Paris in 2015 and now collects it in 50 French cities. It paid back to French authorities 7.3 million euros in tourist taxes in 2016.

Spreads on bonds due in 2025 tightened to a range of 238 to 210 basis points over Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A yield scale from a previous 276 basis points, according to MMD. For some bonds maturing in 2029, the spread narrowed to 220 basis points over the scale from 275 basis points.  It's clearly a pretty big (spread) tightening in the wake of the budget legislation,  said MMD analyst Greg Saulnier. Over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, the Democratic-controlled Illinois House and Senate passed a $36 billion fiscal 2018 spending plan and $5 billion income tax hike aimed at ending a two-year budget impasse. While Republican Governor Bruce Rauner vetoed the trio of budget and revenue bills on Tuesday, the Senate quickly overrode his action. It is now up to the House to vote to overturn the vetoes and enact the budget and tax hike. It was not clear when that chamber would take up the vetoes. Illinois has the widest so-called credit spreads over MMD's scale and the lowest credit ratings among the 50 U.S. states. With the budget impasse entering a third-straight year with Saturday's start of fiscal 2018, Illinois risked having its bond ratings sink to junk.

The Colombian United Nations contractor was seized on May 3 by gunmen close to Miraflores in southern Guaviare province, where coca cultivation has long formed a key part of Colombia's cocaine production. He was stopped by armed men in a convoy of vehicles.  The U.N. contractor kidnapped by organized crime in Guaviare has informed his superiors that he has been freed by his captors,  the defense ministry said via its Twitter account. The rebels, about 300 or so former FARC fighters who rejected a peace accord with the government late last year, want to take over coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking that was abandoned when the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) agreed to lay down their weapons.   The government is seeking to substitute coca - the raw material for cocaine - with legal crops such as coffee, fruits and cacao. The kidnapping came at the same time representatives of the U.N. Security Council were in Colombia to discuss the peace accord signed with the Marxist FARC to end more than five decades of conflict in the Andean country. While as many as 7,000 fighters agreed to the pact and have turned in most of their weapons to the United Nations, the dissidents refused. They have formed a new criminal gang and now engage in the same lucrative drug trafficking that the FARC had pursued for years, the military has said. The FARC's leadership expelled them. Opposition politicians, including former President Alvaro Uribe, are angry the peace accord allows former FARC fighters to avoid prison time and participate in national politics. Many Colombians say the government has not done enough to prevent other criminal groups and FARC dissidents from filling the void and taking over the drug business.

This will improve Hungary's energy security a great deal, so it is in our strategic interest for this cooperation to start,  state news agency MTI quoted Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto as saying. Natural gas supplies to eastern Europe have been a major area of competition between incumbent pipeline power Russia and the United States, which is touting its liquefied natural gas (LNG) potential in the region via onshore LNG terminals. Trump is expected to use fast-growing U.S. LNG supplies as a political tool when he meets in Poland on Thursday with leaders of a dozen countries, including Hungary, that are captive to Russia for their energy needs. Szijjarto, who is in Moscow, told MTI by phone that he had agreed with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller to join Turkish Stream with a link that could enable Hungary to import 8 billion cubic meters of gas a year, close to the country's total consumption. Hungary, which relies on Russian imports via Ukraine for nearly all of its gas use, has sought to diversify its imports geographically as well as by supplier for years. Asked by Reuters how the American LNG potential and Russian gas square up in Hungary's energy plans, a Foreign Ministry spokesman could not immediately comment. Hungary's ambassador to Washington told a business forum in Budapest earlier this week that he would be keen to import American LNG as well. A southern link to Russian pipelines has long been planned, with a previous project, South Stream, canceled by Russia in 2014 in the wake of the Ukrainian conflict and EU sanctions. The EU said it wanted to separate the owner of the pipeline from the owner of the gas, but analysts also said it wanted to prevent Russia from shipping gas to Europe bypassing Ukraine, downgrading its geopolitical significance. International interconnectors between Hungary and possible trade partners Romania and Croatia also remain to be built, while Szijjarto said Croatia is not expected to complete a long-planned LNG import terminal any time soon. That terminal, planned for the Adriatic island of Krk, would be capable of bringing U.S. gas to Hungary. Szijjarto noted Bulgaria and Serbia had already signed agreements with Gazprom, which stipulate financing to be cleared by the end of 2017, permits secured by end-2018, for the gas link to reach Hungary by 2019.  It is also a serious business opportunity for Hungary because despite all the communication hypocrisy European need for Russian gas is growing at an extraordinary rate,  he said.

It is  imperative that evidence should be taken from former president Goodluck Jonathan,  said a statement from the National Assembly committee investigating the deal. Jonathan's name featured in investigations launched by Milan's public prosecutor and it was his ministers that brokered the oilfield deal, the statement said The committee, set up in April, said it would write to the former president asking for his response and submissions, adding that its investigation  is drawing to a close . A spokesman for Jonathan, who led Nigeria from 2009 to 2015, said the former president  has not received such an invitation as of this moment , and was not aware of any invitation. Courts in Nigeria and Italy are also investigating the purchase of OPL 245, which was initially awarded in 1998 to Malabu Oil and Gas before Royal Dutch Shell and Eni were awarded the rights in 2011 for $1.3 billion. Shell has said it was aware that some of the payments it made to Nigeria for rights to the oilfield would go to Malabu, a company associated with former Nigerian oil minister and convicted money launderer Dan Etete.

India's federal think-tank, which is chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has partnered with companies including ride-sharing firm Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] to assess the economic and environmental impact of using private cars as taxis, a government official involved in the process said. Increasing the availability of cars that can be used as cabs would be welcome news for Uber and its SoftBank (9984.T) backed local rival Ola, although it could heighten tensions with taxi operators that typically pay higher fees for commercial licences while facing more rigorous vehicle testing. India's government wants to reduce private car ownership, the official said, adding the three-month study will look at the safety, regulatory, tax and insurance implications. While the study is in its early days, the broad idea is to set up a clear and reasonable regulatory framework for ride-sharing so it allows companies to operate in India without ambiguity, another source involved in the process said. Although Uber is allowed to use private cars for ride sharing in countries such as Australia and Singapore, their use has faced opposition from taxi operators in parts of North America.  An Uber spokesman said sharing private vehicles can help cut congestion and ensure more efficient use of cars.  We are engaging with a range of stakeholders in India about the best way to realize this vision,  he said. Car Sales Impact But such a move could dent car sales in India where the ownership ratio is already low compared with other countries. There are fewer than 20 cars for every 1,000 people in India. Maruti Suzuki (MRTI.NS), Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) are among the top-selling carmakers in the country, which is forecast to be the world's third-largest car market by 2020. Uber and Ola have built their taxi  fleets  in India by offering incentives such as free smartphones and cash bonuses to drivers, but both are now cutting back on these in an attempt to be profitable. Allowing the use of private cars as taxis would improve the supply of vehicles at a low cost, say analysts.  If most of these cars are affiliated with Ola and Uber then it's a win for them,  Neil Shah, research director at consultant Counterpoint Research, said. The proposal, however, could antagonize current drivers, who have paid hefty fees to get a commercial taxi license. Concerns around the safety of passengers would also need to be addressed, said Shah, adding that any new law must ensure private car drivers go through the same background and safety checks.

Myanmar's security forces launched a counter-offensive in the northern part of Rakhine state after attacks by Rohingya insurgents that killed nine border police in October. About 75,000 people fled across the nearby border with Bangladesh in a crisis that marred Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's first year in power. The United Nations has said the military committed rapes, killings and burnt down homes in what amounted to crimes against humanity. In the first detailed on-the-ground assessment of the community affected by the violence since October, the WFP interviewed 450 families in 45 villages in Maungdaw district in March and April.  The survey confirmed a worsening of the food security situation in already highly vulnerable areas (since October),  the U.N. agency said. About a third of those surveyed reported  extreme ...food insecurity  such as going a day and night without eating.  Not one of the children covered in the survey was getting a  minimum adequate diet,  the report said, adding that an estimated 80,500 children under the age of five would need treatment for acute malnutrition in the next year. Suu Kyi's administration is refusing to grant access to a United Nations-mandated mission tasked with investigating allegations of abuses by security forces in Rakhine and elsewhere.    The WFP does not distinguish between different communities, but more than 90 percent of residents in Maungdaw are Rohingya. Many in Myanmar see the group as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Following the attacks, the military declared an operation zone in Maungdaw, restricting aid access and preventing locals from fishing and farming. A WFP map shows that villages where the military was most active were highly vulnerable to hunger. The report also notes that households where the men left due to security operations were more likely to go hungry. Many Rohingya men fled their homes because they believed the military would target them as suspected militants. Suu Kyi's spokesman, Zaw Htay, said he was not familiar with the specific WFP findings, but that after initial security restrictions the government had been allowing aid agencies to operate in northern Rakhine.  The WFP is conducting many, many projects for the people in that region. The Myanmar government is allowing them to deliver food and other assistance,  he said. The government continued to restrict some access for foreign aid workers in northern Rakhine, but national staff could move freely, he said, adding the government has delivered aid to people in the area.

Chairman Henk Nijboer said he hoped the findings would spur parliament into action to reform the industry, given they showed  serious  problems. Trust offices help manage financial assets on behalf of their owners, and the Netherlands is home to many due to its favorable treatment of dividends and royalties, wide network of tax treaties, and long-standing tradition of pre-negotiating tax deals with companies. Holland Quaestor, an industry group that represents trust offices, said on Wednesday improvements in the sector were  certainly  needed.  We are on the right track, but there is still a lot of work to be done , president Jan van der Kolk told Reuters. Dutch Finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem introduced stricter rules for trust offices in 2015, but critics say oversight is still too lax. The inquiry's findings come after the largest Dutch trust office, Intertrust, listed on the stock market in 2015 and as rival TMF is considering an initial public offering.  At Intertrust, we adhere not only to the letter but also the spirit of laws and treaties, including those which govern our client’s dealings,  Intertrust said in its submission to the inquiry. The inquiry panel, which did not name any individuals or companies accused of breaking laws, compiled information from representatives of trust offices, tax advisers, regulators and other experts from eight days of hearings under oath last month. Among those interviewed was Jan Favie, manager of the Dutch companies that pop groups The Rolling Stones and U2 use to oversee their intellectual property rights. He argued it was a widespread misunderstanding that the musicians use Dutch trust offices to lower their taxes, but said, rather, they were attracted to the Netherlands because of the country's managerial  expertise, good infrastructure and stable legal environment.  The parliamentary panel concluded that oversight of trust offices was limited, due to insufficient staffing at the country's central bank (DNB) and national tax office. An area of particular concern was that trust offices often fail to identify the people behind capital flows, as they are required to do by law. That enables tax-dodging and other criminal behaviour, the committee said. In a statement included as part of Wednesday's report, the DNB called for the abolition of all trust office processes that help mask the identity of clients.

This should support macroeconomic adjustment and a recovery in growth. Brazil's National Monetary Council (CMN) last week cut the inflation target for 2019 to 4.25% and for 2020 to 4.0% from 4.5%, while leaving the +/?1.5% tolerance range unchanged. This is the first change in the target since 2005. The CMN, which consists of the ministers of finance and planning and the central bank governor, also said that next year it would start setting the inflation target three years in advance. The CMN's decision comes after inflation dropped below target for the first time since 2010. Food price deflation, exchange rate stability, and falling services inflation contributed to IPCA inflation falling to 3.6% in May. In our most recent Global Economic Outlook, published on 19 June, Fitch trimmed its year-end inflation forecasts for Brazil to 4.2% from 4.8% for 2017, and to 4.5% from 4.6% for 2018. Our 2019 forecast is also 4.5%. These forecasts could be brought down further as lower inflation targets set by CMN help reinforce lower inflation expectations. Lowering the target should help further anchor medium-term inflation expectations, underpinning greater macroeconomic stability. The fall in inflation expectations has enabled the central bank to step up monetary easing, cutting its key rate to 10.25% in May from 14.25% a year ago. We expect the policy rate to fall to the single digits this year. We expect monetary easing and real wage gains to support a demand-led recovery. Our latest forecasts see real GDP rising by 0.5% this year following a 3.6% contraction in 2016, with growth accelerating to 2.5% next year. Our 2019 forecast, published for the first time in the June Global Economic Outlook, is 2.7%. External adjustment has narrowed the current account deficit while international reserves remain strong, providing a buffer to possible domestic or external shocks. However, downside risks to our growth forecasts remain given the fluid and challenging political environment and stalling reform agenda. Moreover, high unemployment and household debt and private-sector deleveraging could also weigh on the recovery. Political uncertainty has increased in recent weeks, given corruption-related allegations against President Temer. These developments are undermining the prospects for fiscal reforms, especially the social security reform, which is key to making the public spending cap approved in December effective and credible over time. The recovery in business and consumer confidence indicators following last year's transfer of power has proved uneven, and the approach of presidential and congressional elections due in 2018 could reduce the political window to pursue reforms. Even as it accelerates, Brazil's recovery will be subdued relative to its ratings peers. Our latest forecasts show that Brazilian real GDP growth will be around 1pp lower than the 'BB' category median in 2018-2019. Weak growth prospects are a ratings weakness for Brazil, as we noted when we affirmed its 'BB'/Negative sovereign rating in May.

The announcements come three days after the ban was lifted on Etihad Airways' flights to the United States from Abu Dhabi International Airport. The ban on U.S. flights from Dubai International, the world's busiest airport for international travel, has been lifted after new security measures announced by the U.S. last week were implemented, an Emirates spokeswoman said in a statement. Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline and which flies to 12 U.S. cities, had blamed travel restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump's administration for a drop in demand on U.S. flights. The Dubai-based carrier cut flights to five U.S. cities from May but had since said demand was starting to return on some routes. Meanwhile, Turkish Airlines said in a statement that passengers traveling to the United States could now take their laptops onboard.  Emirates and Turkish Airlines are the only airlines that operate direct flights from Dubai and Istanbul, respectively, to the United States.

The three airlines have started the process to lift the in-cabin ban on laptops and other large electronic devices on U.S. bound flights by informing the TSA that they were ready to comply with the measures, TSA spokesman Mike England told Reuters in an emailed statement. Qatar Airways has not commented on the ban since the restrictions were lifted on Etihad Airways on Sunday. Turkish Airlines Chief Executive Bilal Eksi also tweeted that the airline expected similar restrictions on flights to Britain would soon be lifted.

I'm sure they will lift that ban. There is no reason for the ban to continue.  The U.K. ban does not apply to flights from Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Security officials were seen examining passengers' laptops at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport on Wednesday following the lifting of restrictions.

In March the United States imposed the ban on direct flights originating at 10 airports in eight countries -- Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey -- to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Some airlines affected by the ban tried to soften the impact of the restrictions by allowing passengers to check in banned devices shortly before boarding and offering to loan tablets for use during the flight to those traveling in first or business class.  Whilst it is difficult to quantify the actual financial impact of the ban it's positive for those carriers for whom it's been lifted,  aviation industry consultant John Strickland told Reuters.  Perception is important for lucrative business travelers and this restores a sense of ease and convenience in using these carriers.   The United States announced on June 29 enhanced security measures for flights to the country which require additional time to screen passengers and personal electronic devices for possible explosives. The new measures, which take effect within three weeks of the announcement, will affect around 325,000 daily passengers traveling on 180 airlines from 280 airports around the world, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Airlines that fail to meet the new security requirements could still face in-cabin electronics restrictions. Saudi Arabia Airlines (Saudia) expects the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19,  state news agency SPA reported on Tuesday.

The Fed, which lifted interest rates and unveiled details of its plan to cut its mammoth crisis-era bond portfolio at its mid-June meeting, will release minutes at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). A recent set of tepid economic data and an inflation rate below the central bank's 2 percent target may have a bearing on its rate hike plans.  Markets will also be paying very close attention to see if the minutes suggest that the recent fall in inflation is 'transitory', with suggestions of higher rates still on the cards, unless the U.S. economy decelerates,  said Lukman Otunuga, analyst with FXTM Research. U.S. factory goods orders are likely to drop 0.5 percent in May, compared with a 0.2 percent decline in April. The data is expected at 10 a.m. ET.

However, the Nasdaq Composite was up 9.72 points, or 0.16 percent, at 6,119.78. Eight of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.99 percent fall leading the decliners. Crude oil was down more than 1 percent as rising OPEC exports turned sentiment more bearish, dragging down shares of Exxon and Chevron by more than 1 percent. The tech sector led the gainers with a 0.59 percent gain. Tech stocks have been volatile in the past few weeks on concerns over the sector's valuation, after powering the S&P;'s record run this year.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. The hospital, in the northeastern city of Shenyang, made the decision at the request of the family and in consultation with the doctors already treating him, the Shenyang Bureau of Justice said in a short statement on its website. It provided no other details. Officials who picked up the telephone at the hospital said they were unaware of the case. A German government spokesman confirmed that a German doctor was part of the team treating Liu and that Berlin was in close contact with the Chinese government on the issue.  The Chinese government told us yesterday about their willingness to allow treatment for Mr Liu including access to foreign doctors, including a German specialist,  government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin.  We very much welcome this and are still pushing for a humanitarian solution,  Seibert said. A source close to Liu's family said the invitation was a positive step that greatly increased transparency around Liu's illness and the chance that he would receive the best possible treatment available.  The fact that they specially chose the U.S. and Germany suggests that the authorities are considering allowing Liu to travel to one of these two countries,  the source said, although there were still questions about how the doctors would be chosen and what access they would have. Asked if the move would lead to Liu leaving the country, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing:  We hope other countries can respect China's judicial sovereignty and not meddle in China's internal affairs.  Time  Running Out  FILE PHOTO: A protester holds a portrait of Chinese Nobel rights activist Liu Xiaobo as she step on portraits of Chinese President Xi Jinping during a candlelight vigil demanding the release of Liu, ahead of 20th anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule, in Hong Kong, China June 29, 2017.Tyrone Siu/File PhotoRights group Amnesty International said the move appeared in part  an attempt to limit international criticism  even as the government continued to refuse to allow Liu to be treated   overseas.  Time is running out for Liu Xiaobo,  said Salil Shetty, Amnesty's secretary general.  It is not too late for the authorities to end this cruel farce. They must let Liu Xiaobo and his wife, Liu Xia, travel abroad to get the medical treatment he so desperately needs.   The U.S. embassy in Beijing declined to comment. Newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said last week the United States would like to see Liu treated elsewhere for his cancer. FILE PHOTO: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoThe move comes ahead of President Xi Jinping's attendance at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany, on Friday and Saturday, where Xi will seek to project Chinese leadership on issues such as climate change and free trade.Diplomatic sources in Beijing say China has been nervous the issue over the Nobel Peace Prize winner could overshadow Xi's appearance. An open letter by a coalition of rights groups, including those representing Tibetans and Uighurs, on Wednesday urged G20 leaders to press China for the unconditional release of Liu and his freedom to travel.  Liu Xiaobo's 2010 Nobel Peace Prize illuminated the human and political rights of the people under China's rule, and created a real sense of hope,  the coalition said.  We urge you not to let that sense of hope fade.    The government has said Liu is getting the best care possible and is being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts. However, a growing number of Western politicians and international rights activists have expressed concern about the quality of Liu's treatment and say he should be given the choice to leave China if that was the best option. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein has met Chinese officials regarding Liu, a spokeswomen said on Tuesday. Chinese authorities told diplomats from Germany, the United States and the European Union on Friday that Liu could not be moved abroad due to his condition, sources briefed on the matter have told Reuters.

The case of 10-month-old Charlie Gard, who has a form of mitochondrial disease – a rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage - has gained global interest after his parents lost a long legal battle to give him experimental therapy in the United States. Trump tweeted an offer of help on Monday, a day after Pope Francis offered prayers for Gard and his family.

The reforms are a cornerstone of Sipila's plan to balance  public finances and boost the economy after a decade of stagnation. The reform aims to cut about 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) off health care cost in the 10 years up to 2029 as Finland struggles with an ageing population. But a parliamentary committee said last week that some of the government's proposal to boost competition between public and private service providers breached Finland's constitution, and that implementing the changes in January 2019 was unrealistic.     The government said in a statement it would bring an amended proposal to parliament and also draft a new bill that provides patients with new options for choosing between private and public services providers. The delay is the latest hurdle for the complex set of reforms spanning health care and regional administration, which the coalition partners agreed to in December after years of negotiations. The issue nearly toppled the government in 2015. Sipila told reporters that the government plans to pass necessary laws by summer 2018, less than a year before the next general election. The reform will establish 18 new counties and shift responsibility for the provision of services to new health care regions, from more than 300 local governments at present.

The reforms are a cornerstone of Sipila's plan to balance  public finances and boost the economy after a decade of stagnation. The reform aims to cut about 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) off health care cost in the 10 years up to 2029 as Finland struggles with an ageing population. But a parliamentary committee said last week that some of the government's proposal to boost competition between public and private service providers breached Finland's constitution, and that implementing the changes in January 2019 was unrealistic.     The government said in a statement it would bring an amended proposal to parliament and also draft a new bill that provides patients with new options for choosing between private and public services providers. The delay is the latest hurdle for the complex set of reforms spanning health care and regional administration, which the coalition partners agreed to in December after years of negotiations. The issue nearly toppled the government in 2015. Sipila told reporters that the government plans to pass necessary laws by summer 2018, less than a year before the next general election. The reform will establish 18 new counties and shift responsibility for the provision of services to new health care regions, from more than 300 local governments at present.

The case of 10-month-old Charlie Gard, who has a form of mitochondrial disease – a rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage - has gained global interest after his parents lost a long legal battle to give him experimental therapy in the United States. Trump tweeted an offer of help on Monday, a day after Pope Francis offered prayers for Gard and his family. The Vatican-owned pediatric hospital in Rome has also said it is ready to offered to take over the care of the baby.    I am confident that Great Ormond Street hospital have and always will consider any offers or new information that has come forward with consideration of the well-being of a desperately  ill child,  May told parliament. Gard's parents wanted him to undergo a U.S. therapy trial but specialists at the London hospital where he is being cared for said the treatment was experimental and would not help. Britain's Supreme Court ruled last month that going to the United States for treatment would prolong the baby's suffering without any realistic prospect of helping him.

A small group of U.S. Democrats have been demanding that Deutsche Bank come forward with information on Trump as a client, but the bank has refused.  Donald Trump himself revealed that he is among our customers, but we can't say anything because of bank confidentiality laws,  Cryan said.

U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields reached their highest levels in seven weeks early on Wednesday.

Short investors, or those who said they were holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks, outnumbered long investors who said they were holding more longer-dated bonds than their benchmarks by 21 points on Monday, which was the most net shorts since Dec. 12, 2016, JPMorgan said.     Last week, net shorts totaled 4 points, which were the fewest since April 17.     On Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield was 2.352 percent, up from 2.223 percent a week ago. It reached a seven-week peak of 2.355 percent earlier Wednesday, according to Reuters data.     U.S. financial markets were closed on Tuesday due to the July Fourth holiday.

Tens of thousands of people have joined the opposition CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu on his 425-km (265-mile) march from the capital Ankara to Istanbul, a protest launched after a deputy from the secularist CHP was jailed on spying charges. Kilicdaroglu, 68, said there had been rumors his  justice march , which has grown into a wider anti-government protest, could be targeted by  provocations  as it approached Istanbul, where it is set to end with a mass rally on Sunday.  Following a nice tip-off, our police detained a group of six Islamic State militants. They were planning to attack the convoy with a minibus,  Kayseri Governor Suleyman Kamci told the website of Hurriyet newspaper. Kamci did not specify what sort of assault was allegedly planned. Islamic State (IS) has carried out both bomb and gun attacks in Turkey in the past.  Police and officials declined to comment but state-run Anadolu news agency carried a similar report. Kamci said the suspects rented a black minibus in Kayseri on Tuesday, and that four of them were subsequently detained in Kayseri and two in Kocaeli province, through which the protesters were marching on Wednesday. A video purporting to show part of the police operation and published on Turkish news websites showed officers, some with  assault rifles, storming a black minibus waiting in traffic on a main highway and then leading away at least one man. Flags of the ruling AK Party were found in the minibus, Kamci said.  Provocation Attempts  Turkish media said earlier that police had detained 37 IS suspects in anti-terrorism operations in provinces across the country, while officials said another suspect was arrested at the border with Syria while carrying more than 5 kg (11 lb) of explosives.  CHP spokesman Bulent Tezcan said he had been told the police operation was routine and not related to the march itself.  We want to complete the march and hold our rally against all provocation attempts in a safe manner,  he told reporters. President Tayyip Erdogan has accused the protesters of  acting together with terrorist groups , referring to Kurdish militants and followers of the U.S.-based Islamic cleric accused of orchestrating the attempted coup in July 2016. The protesters deny the accusations, with Kilicdaroglu saying they are marching for  justice  and accusing the government of creating a one-party state in the wake of the failed military coup a year ago. In a security crackdown since then, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial, and 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs. Ankara has also closed 130 media outlets and jailed around 160 journalists, union data show. Stepping up his challenge to the government, Kilicdaroglu on Tuesday appealed to the European Court of Human Rights over the April referendum that granted Erdogan sweeping new powers.

Novo Banco was carved out of the country's biggest ever bank collapse in 2014 after a 4.9 billion euro rescue operation of Banco Espirito Santo. A group of bondholders led by U.S. fund BlackRock have sought an injunction to block the sale, fearing it would damage their claim to be compensated for an estimated 1.5 billion euros in losses suffered on Novo Banco bonds. A failed bidder for Novo Banco has also said it would go to court in a separate attempt to re-open the sale process.

The publication includes: - Balance sheet numbers as of 1 June 2017, as well as changes during May 2017 and since 1 January 2017 - Charts illustrating balance-sheet changes in 5M17 for the main state-related, privately owned, foreign-owned and retail banks Fitch notes the following key developments in the banking sector in May 2017: Corporate loans nominally decreased by RUB30 billion (0.1%), but after adjusting for a minor rouble appreciation against the dollar grew by RUB62 billion (0.2%). The largest FX-adjusted increases were reported by VTB group (RUB82 billion, 1.4%), Russian Agricultural Bank (Rusag, RUB33 billion, 2.2%), Sberbank of Russia (RUB31 billion, 0.3%), Credit Bank of Moscow (RUB51 billion, 5.4%, but was partly offset by a RUB35 billion decrease of reverse repo exposure in subsidiary SKS-Bank), VBRR and Trust (each by RUB17 billion, 13%), while considerable decreases occurred in National Clearing Centre (RUB50 billion, 8%, all corporate reverse repo), Gazprombank Joint-Stock Company) (RUB43 billion, 1.3%), Promsvyazbank (RUB23 billion, 3.4%) and AO Raiffeisenbank (RUB19 billion, 5.5%). Retail loans grew a moderate RUB76 billion (0.7%), with VTB group achieving a higher 1.5% and accounting for 40% of sector growth. Among the specialised retail banks Tinkoff Bank and Rencredit grew 2%-3%, Home Credit & Finance Bank and Russian Standard were around stable, while Joint Stock Company OTP Bank deleveraged by 1.5%. As the Ministry of Finance (Minfin) did not sell FX reserves in January-May, there was no rouble issuance by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), but customer funding inflow was still significant in May. Adjusting for rouble appreciation customer accounts (excluding those from government entities) grew RUB576 billion (1.2%), of which RUB516 billion was from corporate and RUB60 billion from retail clients. Large FX-adjusted corporate account inflows occurred in VTB group (RUB185 billion, 3.5%), Sberbank (RUB82 billion, 1.5%), Joint Stock Company Alfa-Bank (Alfa, RUB58 billion, 7%), Credit Bank of Moscow (RUB51 billion, 9%), AO UniCredit Bank (RUB55 billion, 9%), Rosbank (RUB36 billion, 14%) and Moscow Exchange group's National Clearing Centre and National Reserve Depositary (together RUB63 billion). Considerable outflows were seen in Gazprombank (RUB109 billion, 3.8%) and Rusag (RUB49 billion, 4.6%). Retail funding inflow was skewed towards VTB group and Rusag, which managed to attract, respectively, RUB35 billion (1.3%) and RUB25 billion (3.7%), making up the majority of the sector's monthly growth. State funding decreased RUB380 billion after adjusting for currency moves. This was a net result of repayments of RUB424 billion to CBR and RUB85 billion to Minfin and borrowing of RUB129 billion from regional and federal budgets. VTB group made the largest net repayment of RUB318 billion, returning RUB316 billion to CBR and RUB105 billion to Minfin, while borrowing RUB103 billion from regional and federal budgets. A further RUB75 billion was repaid by Alfa, mainly to CBR and MinFin. Gazprombank borrowed RUB68 billion, mainly from regional and federal budgets. Sector liquidity was generally sound (highly liquid assets, including cash, short-term bank placements and unpledged government bonds accounted for 19% of sector assets at end-May), although unevenly distributed. Sberbank and most foreign and large private banks had surplus liquidity as they have repaid the majority of CBR funding and kept RUB0.6 trillion on interest-bearing deposits with CBR. However, VTB group, Gazprombank and Rusag were still reliant on state funding, accounting for 74% of the RUB2.4 trillion still outstanding. Some smaller banks experienced tight liquidity, including Moscow Industrial Bank (6% of highly liquid assets, covering customer accounts by 8%) and Jugra (4%, 5%), which also had limited volumes of unpledged securities. The sector reported a moderate RUB75 billion net profit in May (annualised ROAE of 11%). Sberbank outperformed the sector earning RUB55 billion (22%). Large losses were reported by PJSC Sovcombank (RUB6.6 billion, 13% of end-April equity, mostly reversal of a similar technical gain in April) and Jugra (RUB2.8 billion, 10%, presumably due to creation of extra reserves). Among the specialised retail banks, Russian Standard reported high RUB2.8 billion net income (6% of end-April equity, but the nature of this profit is unclear), Tinkoff earned 4%, Home Credit and Rencredit about 2% and OTP was break-even. The sampled banks' average capital ratios were stable in May as lending growth was compensated by internal capital generation. All 10 systemically important banks complied with capital requirements including buffers (core Tier 1 ratio of 6.1%, Tier 1 ratio of 7.6% and total ratio of 9.6%); however, Promsvyazbank had only a minimal cushion with a Tier 1 ratio of 7.7%. Non-systemically important banks' requirements (including buffers) are slightly lower at 5.75%, 7.25% and 9.25%, respectively. Six of the sampled banks (excluding failed and rescued banks and those not reporting capital ratios) had capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements, but did not meet the regulatory buffers. These are Post Bank, Bank Rossiysky Capital, UBRIR, Moscow Industrial Bank, Orient Express Bank and PJSC Asian Pacific Bank. An inability to meet buffer requirements by the end of the quarter could lead to limitations on dividend payments, but would not represent grounds for a license withdrawal. In addition, Uraltransbank was in breach not only of the buffer but also the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement itself for 18 days in May (reported ratio 4.7% at end-May vs. required minimum of 6%), which according to Russian legislation may result in regulatory intervention. We estimated that at end-5M17 the capital buffers (excluding potential future profits) of 27 of the sampled banks (excluding failed and rescued banks, and those not reporting capital ratios) were sufficient to absorb potential losses equal to less than 5% of loans (based on minimal capital requirements) and five could absorb less than 1%. The latter are Post Bank, SKS-bank, UBRIR, Moscow Industrial and Uraltransbank. The latest Datawatch is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the above link.

Oil prices ended their longest bull run in more than five years, as climbing Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' exports and a stronger dollar turned sentiment more bearish.     U.S. crude        prices were down 1.04 percent at $46.58 a barrel.     The U.S. dollar        rose against a basket of major currencies ahead of the Fed minutes. U.S. manufacturing data on Monday had boosted expectations the Fed would raise interest rates again this year.     At 9:24 a.m. ET (1324 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2967 to the greenback, or 77.12 U.S. cents, down 0.2 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2930 to C$1.2975.     On Tuesday, the loonie touched its strongest since September at C$1.2912 as Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz added more support to the view the central bank will raise interest rates as early as next week.                  Chances of a rate hike on July 12 have increased to nearly 80 percent from less than 5 percent before top Bank of Canada officials asserted in June that a pair of 2015 interest rate cuts had done their job in cushioning the economy from collapsing oil prices, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                  Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve, with the two-year            up 3 Canadian cents to yield 1.123 percent and the 10-year             rising 18 Canadian cents to yield 1.818 percent.     Earlier in the session, the 2-year yield reached its highest since October 2014 at 1.143 percent.

The flood began last Friday when the 60 meter (yard) high wall of a reservoir at a phosphate factory partially collapsed, letting loose 100,000 cubic meters (26.4 million gallons) of highly acidic wastewater in the Ashalim riverbed. That was enough fluid to fill 40 Olympic-sized pools. The toxic torrent snaked through the desert, singeing anything in its path, before collecting again hours later in a pool several kilometers from the Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth. Days later, the ground is still stained a dark brown and giving off a nauseating acidic stench, more potent than a highly chlorinated swimming pool. One section of the Ashalim riverbed is made up of narrow canyons, popular for hiking, but no one was around when the wastewater first gushed through. A collapsed wall of a reservoir holding a highly acidic wastewater is seen in Mishor Rotem, in Southern Israel July 4, 2017.Baz RatnerIsrael’s Ministry of Environment has opened a criminal investigation into the plant’s owner, Rotem Amfert, and its parent company Israel Chemicals (ICL), a leading potash and fertilizer producer with exclusive rights in Israel to mine the Dead Sea. “All the plants and animals in the valley during the tsunami of acid were probably highly damaged, probably dead,  said Oded Netzer, an ecologist for the ministry.  In the long term, there will be soil damage and large functional ecological problems.  Residue of toxic wastewater is seen in the Ashalim riverbed in Mishor Rotem, Southern Israel July 4, 2017.Baz RatnerHe said weeks of intense clean-up work, including pumping out small pools of the wastewater that remain along the path, lay ahead, and complete rehabilitation would likely take years. ICL has stopped using the series of reservoirs where the breech occurred. They contained a production by-product called phosphogypsum water. The company declined to answer questions on the criminal investigation or about the impact the incident will have on its operations. Shares in ICL fell almost 4 percent after the spill but partially recovered to trade 1.3 percent higher on Tuesday. In a statement, Rotem Amfert said it was working  around the clock  in full coordination with authorities, and it would spare no resources to clean up the riverbed.

You can be sure: I have no plans to go elsewhere, not for a long time,  Cryan, who has been in the top job since 2015, told the paper. Cryan said he did not expect Deutsche Bank to make a loss this year.

He was also asked by the paper about one of his most prominent clients, U.S. President Donald Trump, who still owes the lender at least $130 million in loans for his real-estate ventures, according to an ethics disclosure last month. A small group of U.S. Democrats have been demanding that Deutsche Bank come forward with information on Trump as a client, but the bank has refused.  Donald Trump himself revealed that he is among our customers, but we can't say anything because of bank confidentiality laws,  Cryan said.

The PwC audit of the Italian business is coming under increasing scrutiny worldwide after a similar investigation launched in Britain last week. PwC said in an emailed statement it was not the company's policy to comment on client issues.  BT lost a fifth of its market value in January after revealing a 530 million-pound ($685 million) black hole in BT Italia's accounts as a result of  improper accounting practices and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions . In April the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) asked Italian market watchdog Consob to send it documentation regarding the audits carried out by PwC on BT in the period 2014-2017, the source said. Consob provided the data after getting the go-ahead from the Milan prosecutors office which is carrying out a criminal probe into alleged false accounting and embezzlement.  BT filed a criminal complaint in Italy in April accusing several former executives and other staff of unlawful conduct.  Current and former staff told Reuters efforts to hide the Italian unit's performance had gone on since at least 2013. A spokeswoman for PCAOB, which has the powers to fine or bar accounting firms or their individual associates, said the regulator did not confirm or comment on inspections as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The logo of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is seen on a board at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2017 (SPIEF 2017) in St. Petersburg, Russia, June 1, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinUnder the act the PCAOB is required to supervise and inspect all accounting firms that regularly audit companies whose securities trade in the United States. While BT's main listing is in London, its shares are also quoted on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depositary Shares. Consob declined to comment, but a source close to the watchdog said the  regulator was giving its attention to the PwC issue . Last week Britain's accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said it would investigate PwC audits of BT Group after the BT Italia scandal emerged. Reuters could not immediately confirm whether the FRC and the PCAOB were collaborating on the PwC issue, although a spokesman for the FRC said the British watchdog maintained close contact with its counterparts in other countries to improve audit quality. BT said last month it would drop PwC, its auditors since 1984, after an evaluation found  areas for improvement . It said it would move to KPMG [KPMG.UL], another one of the  Big Four  accounting firms.  Since the scandal erupted, various BT shareholders in the United States have launched class action cases, accusing the telecoms group of not informing the market and shareholders soon enough of the financial irregularities at its Italian unit. In March a Reuters investigation found allegations that a network of people in BT Italia had exaggerated revenues, faked contract renewals and invoices and invented bogus supplier transactions in order to meet bonus targets and disguise the unit's true financial performance.  A source also told Reuters in March that he and two other employees at BT Italia had warned their Madrid-based supervisor about possible accounting problems at the business in November 2015, nearly a year before BT announced that it had found accounting irregularities at the Italian company.

The former British colony celebrated the 20th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule on Saturday, when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the city and warned that it should crack down on moves toward  Hong Kong independence . In 2014, Lam spearheaded government efforts to push through a contentious, Beijing-backed political reform package that would have allowed a direct vote for the city's next leader.  However, China's demand that all candidates first be pre-screened by a largely pro-Beijing committee partly helped to trigger the 79-day  Occupy  pro-democracy civil disobedience movement later that year. The political reform package was eventually vetoed in 2015 by opposition lawmakers who described it as  fake democracy . Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, guarantees wide-ranging autonomy and universal suffrage as an  ultimate aim , but Lam played down the prospects of fresh political reforms being revived any time soon. Beijing officials have also suggested Hong Kong won't be given a second chance for democratic reforms.   Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam attends her first Question and Answer session at the Legislative Council in Hong Kong, China, July 5, 2017.Bobby Yip Political reform has always been very sensitive, very complicated and very difficult,  Lam told lawmakers.   If I ... restart political reform immediately, such that the society becomes embroiled in serious conflicts again and the economy and livelihood issues come to a standstill, then as the person with the utmost responsibility, I would have failed,  she said. Slideshow (4 Images)Lam, in her first week in office, spent about an hour answering lawmakers' questions in a specially arranged meeting, where the mood appeared less hostile compared with sessions involving her predecessor, the unpopular Leung Chun-ying. She stressed her desire to improve the executive's relations with the legislature.  I like coming to the Legislative Council. I don't say this to flatter anyone. It's because this is a place to discuss policies and to do work for the people,  Lam said.  In the past few years we saw conflict and fights, with people pulling out their swords and bows. This made me a bit sad,  she said.  Lam also said she would bring forward her maiden policy address to October from January, with land and housing, education and the economy her priorities.

BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs, Lloyds and UBS have committed to using the ADEPT platform from Droit Financial Technologies for compliance with the new rules that include pre-trade transparency, best execution requirements and transaction reporting for an expanded range of exchange-traded and over-the-counter instruments. Against a backdrop of sweeping post-crisis reforms, including Dodd-Frank in the US, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and MiFID II, counterparties are subject to a complex array of trading, clearing and reporting requirements that differ across jurisdictions. “Knowing who you can trade with, what you can trade and where you can trade is considerably more involved than even five years ago,  said Satya Pemmaraju, founding partner and CEO of Droit.  These real-time, point-of-inquiry demands provide further challenges for a strategic infrastructure.  MiFID II is the latest addition to the ADEPT platform, which has already incorporated more than 12 global regulatory regimes. The service offers real-time regulatory decision-making, ensuring that every transaction is executed within jurisdictional guidelines and on a timely basis, with accurate pre and post-trade obligations. Founded in 2012 by a team of derivatives traders, quants and technology specialists, Droit focuses on automation of global regulations and market micro-structure to create platforms that merge finance and computational law. Samy Beji, global head of structuring and deputy sponsor of the MiFID II programme for Credit Agricole CIB, said the platform will play a crucial role for the bank as it completes its MiFID II compliance transformation. “The complete digitalisation of capital markets pre and post-trade processes is a considerable challenge for investment banks, as it requires a deep understanding of the regulatory texts and mastering the use of data, products and cutting-edge technologies,  said Beji. Goldman Sachs has worked closely with Droit since late 2016 when it led a US$16m investment in the company with Wells Fargo, Pivot Investment Partners and principal trading firm DRW.  Droit is a central part of our eligibility architecture as we prepare for MiFID II,  said Jo Hannaford, managing director in Goldman Sachs' technology division.

The PwC audit of the Italian business is coming under increasing scrutiny worldwide after a similar investigation launched in Britain last week. PwC said in an emailed statement it was not the company's policy to comment on client issues.  BT lost a fifth of its market value in January after revealing a 530 million-pound ($685 million) black hole in BT Italia's accounts as a result of  improper accounting practices and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions . In April the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) asked Italian market watchdog Consob to send it documentation regarding the audits carried out by PwC on BT in the period 2014-2017, the source said. Consob provided the data after getting the go-ahead from the Milan prosecutors office which is carrying out a criminal probe into alleged false accounting and embezzlement.  BT filed a criminal complaint in Italy in April accusing several former executives and other staff of unlawful conduct.  Current and former staff told Reuters efforts to hide the Italian unit's performance had gone on since at least 2013. A spokeswoman for PCAOB, which has the powers to fine or bar accounting firms or their individual associates, said the regulator did not confirm or comment on inspections as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The logo of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is seen on a board at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2017 (SPIEF 2017) in St. Petersburg, Russia, June 1, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinUnder the act the PCAOB is required to supervise and inspect all accounting firms that regularly audit companies whose securities trade in the United States. While BT's main listing is in London, its shares are also quoted on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depositary Shares. Consob declined to comment, but a source close to the watchdog said the  regulator was giving its attention to the PwC issue . Last week Britain's accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said it would investigate PwC audits of BT Group after the BT Italia scandal emerged. Reuters could not immediately confirm whether the FRC and the PCAOB were collaborating on the PwC issue, although a spokesman for the FRC said the British watchdog maintained close contact with its counterparts in other countries to improve audit quality. BT said last month it would drop PwC, its auditors since 1984, after an evaluation found  areas for improvement . It said it would move to KPMG [KPMG.UL], another one of the  Big Four  accounting firms.  Since the scandal erupted, various BT shareholders in the United States have launched class action cases, accusing the telecoms group of not informing the market and shareholders soon enough of the financial irregularities at its Italian unit. In March a Reuters investigation found allegations that a network of people in BT Italia had exaggerated revenues, faked contract renewals and invoices and invented bogus supplier transactions in order to meet bonus targets and disguise the unit's true financial performance.  A source also told Reuters in March that he and two other employees at BT Italia had warned their Madrid-based supervisor about possible accounting problems at the business in November 2015, nearly a year before BT announced that it had found accounting irregularities at the Italian company.

In addition to the four solar and wind power firms, a fifth company that invests in renewable projects, Adani Group, has raised $250 million via a loan but has yet to publicly announce the borrowing, the sources told Reuters. A source working with one of the bond issues said foreign borrowing was attractive because state banks were reluctant to lend due to existing bad loans to the power sector, while domestic banks worried about falling tariffs for solar power. Foreign investors have been attracted to the sector by India's commitment to expand renewable power capacity, with plans to invest close to $150 billion to meet its 2022 targets, analysts and bankers said. New York-listed Azure Power Global Ltd (AZRE.N), which has projects in the states of Rajasthan, Punjab and elsewhere, planned to raise $500 million via a dollar issuance, two bankers said. Continuum Energy, a firm backed by U.S. bank Morgan Stanley that has projects in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and western state of Gujarat, planned to raise $400 million, the two bankers added. Wind and solar power firm Greenko Group (GRNKF.PK), backed by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), planned a $1 billion issuance to refinance a dollar bond raised three years ago, three bankers said. IL&FS; Energy, which has thermal and solar power projects, was considering a dollar bond issue worth $500 million, said a source with knowledge of the deal but not involved in the process. The fifth firm, Adani Group, which is controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani, has already raised $250 million via an offshore loan to invest in its solar power project in Karnataka, one of the bankers said. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Solar tariffs hit a new low in May when SBG Cleantech, which has SoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son as one of its promoters, bid 2.44 per unit for building a solar park in the western state of Rajasthan.  Solar power players bid for the right to build projects on parcels of land that are set aside by the government. The player agreeing to sell the power it generates at the lowest price per kilowatt hour, are leased the land at a nominal price.  Despite the decline in tariffs, overseas investors scouting for higher yields are keen on such dollar bond issues, the bankers said, adding many were drawn by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to boosting renewable power output. India, a signatory to the Paris climate accord, has an ambitious plan to raise renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022 from a current capacity of 57 GW. Abhishek Tyagi, senior analyst at Moody's, said India would have to invest  close to $150 billion to meet its 2022 renewable energy targets , adding much of that was expected to come from foreign financing due to constraints among domestic lenders.

The move by the Environmental Protection Agency to launch public debates between scientists on climate research, known as red-team, blue-team exercises, would be the first major effort by the Republican administration to challenge the long-standing scientific consensus on human-caused climate change.  Advocates who have petitioned the EPA to reverse the scientific finding underlying U.S. regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions see the proposal to scrutinize mainstream climate science as a first step in that direction.  It's a way to survey the landscape before reopening the endangerment finding,  said Myron Ebell, head of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, one of the groups that filed a petition with the agency to undo the 2009 scientific determination that formed the basis for the Democratic Obama administration's regulation of greenhouse gases. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had authority under the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from cars if the agency determined they endangered human health.  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has spoken several times about the merits of opening the climate change debate up to the public. The website Climatewire on Friday cited a senior administration official, who said Pruitt plans to launch the back-and-forth scientific critiques formally.  Francis Menton, a lawyer who filed an endangerment finding petition in January on behalf of the Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council, said Pruitt told an event at the Manhattan Institute think tank in New York on Friday that he would launch the debates in the next few months. Menton said he asked Pruitt whether he had made a decision on reopening the endangerment finding. Pruitt said the agency is weighing its options. The review  can create a body of scientific work that can be trustworthy and dependable to make regulatory choices and decisions,  said Rob Henneke, of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a third group that filed an endangerment finding petition.  Unlike the other two, it has challenged the legality of the endangerment finding, not the science. Environmental groups are confident that Pruitt will not be successful if he tries to undo the endangerment finding because they expect the courts will side with the scientific consensus that human beings cause climate change. Pruitt and the EPA would need to build up a new case that shows carbon dioxide is innocuous and counter the volumes of scientific research that support the finding.  If he has any grasp of scientific and legal reality, he would realize that it's a fool's errand to reverse the endangerment determination,  said David Doniger, climate director for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel.   This could be a way for him to keep the right-wing fringe groups occupied and also accomplish the goal of further confusing the public debate,  he said. Ebell, who was also the transition leader of the Trump EPA, had previously been critical of Pruitt's hesitation to take on the endangerment finding because of the time and staffing it would require.  The Trump administration has not yet appointed second-tier assistant administrators to run different policy divisions of the agency.  I think (the red-team, blue-team process) is a logical first step, but I don’t think it commits the administrator to anything yet,  Ebell said.

With world number two Rafa Nadal bringing down the curtain on the scheduled matches, taking on the United States' Donald Young, a few more chapters in the quest for this year's titles will be written by the end of the day. Sixth seed Konta, 26, lost to 21-year-old Vekic, ranked 58, in the final of the Nottingham grasscourt tournament last month.  It's another opportunity for me to try and find a way to come out on top this time,  Konta told reporters about the match-up after her first round win over Hsieh Su-Wei. Related CoverageAfter withdrawal woes, fans in for a treat at sunny WimbledonTwice champion Murray, who has been suffering with a sore hip, has already dispatched one player with an armory of unconventional shots, Kazakh Alexander Bublik.  He now takes on 97th ranked Dustin Brown of Germany, whose trademark dreadlocks are often sent flying as he leaps for seemingly ungettable balls. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 5, 2017   Great Britain's Johanna Konta celebrates during her second round match against Croatia’s Donna VekicTony O'Brien You know, he's unpredictable. You know he's going to go for it. Also you know he hits a lot of dropshots. He can play slice. Sometimes he hits two first serves, goes for a huge second serve. It's not easy to play players like that,  Murray said. One man who knows that all too well is Nadal, whom Brown famously beat in 2015 in the second round. Slideshow (5 Images)But this year, a rejuvenated Nadal, 31, is coming into the championship off the back of his 10th French Open win and looking to add to his two previous Wimbledon crowns. He plays fellow left-hander Young, ranked 43, who reached the second round after Denis Istomin retired on Monday.       He's a player that plays quick, hits the ball so quick,  Nadal said of Young.  Sometimes he's able to play at a very, very high level. Is a dangerous opponent, no? Is a lefty, too, so that makes a big difference.

GetBack said it found buyers for all 40 million shares offered in the IPO, including 20 million new shares and 20 million existing. The offering was expected to be priced within a range of 18.5 zlotys to 27 zlotys. The final price is lower than 20 zlotys indicated by sources on Tuesday when the bookbuilding ended and values the offering at 740 million zlotys ($198.3 million). GetBack had decided to price the shares at the bottom of the range to avoid a disappointing debut, two sources close to the matter said, despite signs of demand at a higher level. Fund managers contacted by Reuters on Wednesday said that there had been demand for shares at 20 zlotys each.  This transaction would have probably been closed (at the price of 20 zlotys), but with a small reduction. And if the reduction is small, there is a risk that the debut would be weak,  one fund manager said. GetBack declined to comment on the bookbuilding process.

Fitch has also affirmed CIH's Viability Rating (VR) at 'bb-', National Long-Term and Short-Term Ratings, respectively of 'AA-(mar)' and 'F1+(mar)' and Support Rating at '3'. The Outlooks on the Long-Term ratings are Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The IDRs and National Ratings are driven by potential support from CIH's majority shareholder, Caisse de Depot et Gestion (CDG). The VR, which measures the bank's standalone financial strength, indicates CIH's vulnerability to adverse changes in business or economic conditions but also the bank's moderate financial strength. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING The bank's IDRs, National Ratings and Support Rating reflect potential support from CDG, which controls 65.9% of the bank. CDG, a public sector establishment, is Morocco's leading institutional investor and a driver for development and change in the country's financial sector and capital markets. CDG is represented on CIH's board and key committees and is closely involved with the bank's strategic decisions and oversight. According to Moroccan law, public sector entities are not allowed to fail or be liquidated. In our view, the Moroccan state's propensity to support CDG in case of need is very high, as is CDG's propensity to support CIH if required. However, the overall probability of support for CIH from CDG is moderate and this is reflected in the bank's Support Rating. The Stable Outlook reflects that on Morocco's sovereign ratings. VR The VR reflects CIH's moderate franchise and concentrations in both real estate development and the retail mortgage market. It also factors in some weaknesses in asset quality, asset and liability maturity mismatches, which expose the bank to high interest rate risk, and expansion plans that will likely result in an erosion of capital adequacy ratios. The bank's experienced management team, sound knowledge of Morocco's real estate markets and good execution skills, combined with the bank's acceptable risk controls, are positive factors for the VR. CIH's share of banking sector assets is below 5%. However, its share of retail mortgages and real estate development loans is nearly 10%, reflecting the bank's origins as a specialist financier of Morocco's key tourism and real estate sectors. CIH plans to reduce its dependence on the real estate sector, but, in our view, this will take time. Impaired loans represent around 7% of CIH's gross loans, in line with the average for the sector's domestic, entirely Moroccan-based, loan portfolios. Stable deposits provide 50% of funding and the bank's access to domestic capital markets is good. Performance indicators are in line with the sector average. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING The bank's IDRs, National Ratings and Support Rating are sensitive to a change in our assumptions around CDG's propensity and ability to support CIH. This would most likely be triggered by a change in Morocco's sovereign rating. This is unlikely to happen in the near term, as indicated by the Stable Outlook on Morocco's rating. VR CIH shares other Moroccan banks' certain weaknesses, which constrain their VRs at somewhat low levels. We do not expect to see significant revenue diversification at CIH in the near term, nor do we expect to see a material reduction in concentration risk, impaired loans, or structural interest rate risk. Upside for CIH's VR is therefore currently limited. As the bank further builds up its presence in the consumer finance segment, expands its corporate lending business and continues to grow, this could lead to a modest upgrade of the VR over time, provided capital ratios are maintained. The rating actions are as follows: Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDR affirmed at 'B' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb-' Support Rating affirmed at '3' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA-(mar)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(mar)' Contact: Primary Analyst Janine Dow Senior Director +44 20 3530 1464 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Nicolas Charreyron Analyst +971 4 424 1208 Committee Chairperson Alexander Danilov Senior Director +7 495 956 24 08 Media Relations: Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

GSK pared losses to 0.8 percent by 1220 GMT but remained among the top losers in London's FTSE-100 index after Citigroup downgraded the stock to neutral from buy and cut earnings forecasts by up to 9 percent. HIV medicines, which GSK sells through its ViiV Healthcare unit, have been star performers in recent years and new CEO Emma Walmsley said in April that the  HIV portfolio continues to go from strength to strength . GSK, which plans to defend its patch with a new two-drug treatment regimen for controlling the virus behind AIDS, declined to comment further on Wednesday. Arch-rival Gilead Sciences is developing a three-in-one daily pill and Merck & Co also has a novel medicine that could challenge both companies. FILE PHOTO: The GlaxoSmithKline building is pictured in Hounslow, west London June 18, 2013.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoCiti analyst Andrew Baum said Merck could, in fact, end up beating both GSK and Gilead with its new drug EFdA, which may reach the market as early as 2021 and has the potential to be developed as both a daily pill and a twice-yearly injection. Given the early nature of Merck's experimental product, Citi currently forecasts heavily risk-adjusted peak annual sales of $150 million for EFdA but it believes commercial success could add more than $5 billion to forecasts. Nearer term, Citi said the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, could shrink the U.S. HIV market by increasing the number of uninsured patients as well as introducing greater cost-sensitivity among healthcare providers. GSK's HIV drug dolutegravir, which is used in the medicines Tivicay and Triumeq, has been the mainstay of the British group's HIV operation and investors are concerned about any threat to what is a highly profitable business. Antiretroviral therapy has turned HIV from a death sentence into a manageable condition but patients need to stay on the treatment for life, so there is a growing focus on making medication as convenient and well-tolerated as possible.

In addition to the four solar and wind power firms, a fifth company that invests in renewable projects, Adani Group, has raised $250 million via a loan but has yet to publicly announce the borrowing, the sources told Reuters. A source working with one of the bond issues said foreign borrowing was attractive because state banks were reluctant to lend due to existing bad loans to the power sector, while domestic banks worried about falling tariffs for solar power. Foreign investors have been attracted to the sector by India's commitment to expand renewable power capacity, with plans to invest close to $150 billion to meet its 2022 targets, analysts and bankers said. New York-listed Azure Power Global Ltd (AZRE.N), which has projects in the states of Rajasthan, Punjab and elsewhere, planned to raise $500 million via a dollar issuance, two bankers said. Continuum Energy, a firm backed by U.S. bank Morgan Stanley that has projects in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and western state of Gujarat, planned to raise $400 million, the two bankers added. Wind and solar power firm Greenko Group (GRNKF.PK), backed by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), planned a $1 billion issuance to refinance a dollar bond raised three years ago, three bankers said. IL&FS; Energy, which has thermal and solar power projects, was considering a dollar bond issue worth $500 million, said a source with knowledge of the deal but not involved in the process. The fifth firm, Adani Group, which is controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani, has already raised $250 million via an offshore loan to invest in its solar power project in Karnataka, one of the bankers said. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Solar tariffs hit a new low in May when SBG Cleantech, which has SoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son as one of its promoters, bid 2.44 per unit for building a solar park in the western state of Rajasthan.  Solar power players bid for the right to build projects on parcels of land that are set aside by the government. The player agreeing to sell the power it generates at the lowest price per kilowatt hour, are leased the land at a nominal price.  Despite the decline in tariffs, overseas investors scouting for higher yields are keen on such dollar bond issues, the bankers said, adding many were drawn by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to boosting renewable power output. India, a signatory to the Paris climate accord, has an ambitious plan to raise renewable energy capacity to 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022 from a current capacity of 57 GW. Abhishek Tyagi, senior analyst at Moody's, said India would have to invest  close to $150 billion to meet its 2022 renewable energy targets , adding much of that was expected to come from foreign financing due to constraints among domestic lenders.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties, including land, sea and air links, with Qatar in June in the worst diplomatic crisis in the region in years.

The new services will be operated by narrow-body Airbus (AIR.PA) A320 jets, which are also used by Qatar Airways on Middle East routes.

Qatar has called the accusations baseless and says the demands - which include closing Qatar-based al Jazeera TV and ejecting Turkish troops based there - are so severe that they seem designed to be rejected. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have raised the possibility of further sanctions against Qatar if it does not comply with the 13 demands presented to Doha through Kuwait, which is acting as a mediator. According to a joint statement on Saudi state news agency SPA, the four countries agreed to a request by Kuwait to extend by 48 hours Sunday's deadline for compliance. They have not specified what further sanctions they could impose on Doha, but commercial bankers in the region believe that Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini banks might receive official guidance to pull deposits and interbank loans from Qatar. Foreign ministers from the four countries will meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss Qatar, Egypt said, while Kuwaiti state media reported that Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani had submitted to Kuwait Doha's formal response to the Arab states' demands. The four states cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism, meddling in their internal affairs and advancing the agenda of regional foe Iran, all of which Qatar denies. Mediation efforts, including by the United States, have been fruitless.

But it has not hit energy exports from Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Trump spoke separately on Sunday to the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in the UAE to discuss his  concerns about the ongoing dispute , the White House said.  He reiterated the importance of stopping terrorist financing and discrediting extremist ideology. The president also underscored that unity in the region is critical to accomplishing the Riyadh Summit's goals of defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability,  it said.  President Trump, nevertheless, believes that the overriding objective of his initiative is the cessation of funding for terrorism,  the White House added.

Urging Restraint A State Department official said on Sunday that the United States encouraged  all parties to exercise restraint to allow for productive diplomatic discussions . Qatari officials say the demands are so strict that the four countries never seriously intended them as a negotiating position and see them as being aimed at hobbling Doha's sovereignty.  Slideshow (2 Images)Qatar says it is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to  any legitimate issues  of concern to fellow member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE. Qatar's Gulf critics accuse Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs. The network has rejected the accusations and said it will maintain its editorial independence. Gulf countries have insisted that their demands are non- negotiable.  The UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, has played down the chances of an escalation, saying  the alternative is not escalation but parting ways , suggesting Qatar may be forced out of the GCC. The Western-backed GCC was formed in 1981 in the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. Qataris are waiting anxiously for a resolution of the conflict but have remained largely supportive of the government. Shopping for groceries in a Doha mall, Qatari Abdul Aziz al-Horr, who works in business education, said he hoped no new sanctions were coming.  Any escalation will be something that is not for the good of anybody. Destabilizing Qatar will have a major impact on the whole region, and even globally,  he said.

Credit Suisse Asset Management (CSAM) is in the market with the largest Bids Wanted In Competition (BWIC), totalling €108m from 24 names, across 40 tranches with bids due at 3pm on Wednesday. The other two BWICs from Neuberger Berman and Barings are due Thursday and total €30m across nine names and €5.8m across three names, respectively, the sources said. “The secondary market is quiet as everyone’s attention is on the BWICs. They’ve launched pre-summer before people disappear,” a trader said. CSAM declined to comment. Neuberger Berman and Barings were not immediately available to comment. Despite being slightly quieter as people get ready to go on holiday, launching pre-summer can be attractive to sellers not wanting to hold off until September, when it is unclear what market conditions will be like. The secondary market has regained around 25bp this week after a slight softening of around 25bp-50bp a couple of weeks ago, when leveraged loan investors turned their attention to the primary market, which has been flooded with deals since June. “There has been a tad of weakness in the secondary market but not too much and it is regaining ground, so it is not a bad time to offload paper. There is plenty of liquidity,” the trader said. Despite the large number of deals in the primary market, the technical imbalance of more demand than  supply still remains, especially after a €3.175bn financing for German drugmaker Stada failed to materialise following a failed buyout bid. “The market feels hot so it is a good time to sell. A lot of dealers are disappointed there is not more primary and allocations have been harsh as have scalebacks, so technicals are not likely to change,” an investor said. Lifeline Neuberger Berman’s BWIC is the result of a called CLO 1.0 and it is expected that similar BWICs will come to the market in the next year, as many CLO 1.0s come to the end of their life. “No CLO 1.0s are expected to be outstanding by end of next year, so a whole bunch of BWICs are likely to come,” the investor said. While some managers would favour recycling the assets of CLO 1.0s into new warehouses, many have no option but to put the paper up for sale via a BWIC auction, in a bid to show best execution, the sources said. There is expected to be plenty of demand for the paper against a backdrop of increased managed accounts and CLO formation. “Secondary is dead because of the BWICs this week. Everyone is focused on those as it is the only way to get meaningful paper,” the investor said. (Editing by Christopher Mangham)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bwic-loans-idUSL8N1JW3FO"},

Qatar, facing regional isolation in a diplomatic dispute with its Gulf neighbors, took energy markets by surprise on Tuesday when it said it would raise its LNG production to 100 million tonnes per year - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - within the next five to seven years.  It suggests the wealthy kingdom is preparing for a lengthy battle with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, who were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar over accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Qatar's move will add gas to an already oversupplied market in a thinly disguised challenge to other exporters who are also raising their output. With low production costs and infrastructure already in place, Qatar is well placed to come out on top, analysts say. Flooding the market with more LNG will help defend its place as the world's top exporter, a position challenged by Australia.  Qatar is losing market share, so it could be about becoming number one again in LNG,  said Neil Beveridge, senior oil and gas analyst at research and brokerage firm Sanford C. Bernstein. Focus on Asia LNG is super-cooled natural gas that is transported on tankers around the world. Long a niche product, it has become an industry darling as natural gas is a cleaner fossil fuel than oil or coal and is also versatile, with potential uses ranging from power generation to heating and as a transport fuel. For an interactive graphic on Qatar, click tmsnrt.rs/2sinDGg U.S. and European oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have invested huge sums over the last decade - often more than they have spent on oil - in an attempt to dominate the LNG market, especially through mega-projects in Australia such as Chevron's Gorgon or Shell's Prelude. The main battleground for LNG market share is Asia, which consumes 70 percent of the fuel and where it is seen as a key fuel to meet soaring energy demand without the rampant pollution that comes with coal. The world's biggest LNG buyers are utilities, especially from Japan and South Korea. Sources at these utilities said they were surprised by Qatar's move.  We would have to figure out why Qatar is planning to boost its output.. We don't have plans yet to import new LNG cargoes from Qatar,  said Kim Young-ki, a spokesman at Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS), one of the world's biggest single LNG buyers. Ramping Up Production FILE PHOTO: A man walks on the corniche in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.Naseem Zeitoon/File Photo/Qatar's announcement came just a day after Iran signed its first deal with France's Total and China's state-owned oil company CNPC to produce gas from a field it shares with Qatar. Beveridge, at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Qatar's move to raise output  could be a response to Total restarting development work  on Iran's side of the gas reserves. Trying to cement its own market share, Russia's Gazprom the world's biggest single producer of natural gas, said late on Tuesday that it would start pumping gas to China through a new pipeline by late 2019, earlier than many expected. China is already the top consumer of most commodities, including oil and coal, and as part of a huge investment program to expand its LNG and pipeline infrastructure it is also on its way to become a top natural gas user. Australia has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in a bid to overtake Qatar as the world's top LNG exporter by 2019, a challenge Qatar is now rising to.   Qatar, whose state-owned Qatar Petroleum has partnered with U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil to produce its LNG, has a strong interest in defending its position. LNG, as well as exports of condensate, a super-light form of crude oil that's a byproduct of gas extraction, have made Qatar rich despite a 70 percent fall in LNG prices and a more than 50 percent drop in oil prices since 2014. Ramping up LNG exports to 100 million tonnes a year would, at current prices, reap revenues of around $30 billion, with another $6 billion coming from condensate. That equates to $120,000 per person, helping Qatar to become the world's richest nation, according to the World Bank. Stiff Competition The main producers challenged by Qatar's move are those who have yet to attract a final investment decision, especially in the United States.  So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are proposals with a total capacity of 150 million tonnes per year. Chong Zhi Xin, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said Qatar's low cost LNG expansion  is pushing a lot of new projects out of the market . Flooding the market with more LNG at a time of oversupply and when buyers are reluctant to sign on new long-term contracts – which have so far dominated supplies – is expected to boost trading in Asia's spot LNG market, which currently makes up just 15 percent of overall supplies, as more uncontracted supply gets exchanged according to short-term demand. The winners in this aggressive fight for market share are consumers.  Expansion of LNG capacity translates to lower for longer LNG prices,  said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie.  That's good news for gas buyers.

War for the Planet of the Apes  sees motion-capture performance specialist Andy Serkis return in his role as Caesar, leader of a super-intelligent band of apes who take on an army led by Woody Harrelson's ruthless colonel in a post-apocalyptic setting. Serkis said the conflict between apes and humans at the film's core was a warning against supremacist ideologies.   If you think your species is better, if you think your type of people or your type of religion or anything that your set of beliefs is better than someone else's, then that is the road to ruin,  he said.

It was a privilege to be asked to do it. I don't think it's that I'm drawn to that (dark sci-fi films), I'm just drawn - some things make sense. Some things you can't say no to.

Increased mechanisation is taking away some manual labour, while a lack of training of farmers and farm workers for alternate jobs is leaving them with few livelihood options. The Indian government's rural employment programme and construction work to build ever-growing cities are inadequate to bridge the income gap, analysts say.  These are people who have known only this one job all their lives,  said Bina Agarwal, a professor of development economics in the University of Manchester.  These resource-poor, little educated people have few options outside agriculture except casual work, which would leave them poorer. Moving to the cities to work does not reduce poverty — it may even increase it,  she said. Employment in Indian agriculture shrank by 26 million jobs in the period 2011 to 2015, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. Jobs in skilled sectors such as education, health and hospitality rose by 33 million in the same period. Meanwhile, conflicts over land have risen as demand for industrial use increases, affecting millions of people and jeopardising billions of dollars of investment.. A 2013 land acquisition law aimed at protecting the rights of Indian farmers requires support for those displaced from their land - with jobs or homes - and compensation of up to four times the market value of their plot. But while it was customary in the past for large industries to offer jobs to displaced farmers, it is less common now. Of the jobs being generated, most are contract with fewer benefits and greater insecurity.  Earlier, especially with state-owned enterprises, hundreds and even thousands of jobs were created, which somewhat made up for the loss of land,  said Sudha Bharadwaj, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh state who represents villagers fighting land acquisitions.  But now, there are very few permanent jobs created, so those giving up their land have fewer means of supporting themselves,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Deadly Protests More than 60 percent of India's population of 1.3 billion depends on agriculture for its livelihood. But more than three quarters of farmers own less than 2 hectares (5 acres) of land each, with falling incomes leading to rising debt and growing discontent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years, but recent deadly protests show farmers are frustrated with the slow pace of reform. Protesters included even the wealthy land-owning Jats of Haryana state and the Marathas of Maharashtra, who are demanding job quotas in addition to better prices for farm output. Agarwal cites a recent survey that showed about 40 percent of farmers, when asked if they liked farming, said they did not; they included both poor and wealthy farmers.  Most farmers themselves want their children to leave farming — but a desire to quit does not match the ability to quit,  Agarwal said. At the same time, a broader  jobless growth  trend means not enough jobs are being created even as the Indian economy expands at a fast clip. Only about 200,000 jobs were created in eight of India's most labour-intensive sectors in the last two years, compared with nearly 1 million jobs a year created in the previous two-year period, official data showed. New Skills The government last month diluted its goal of training 500 million people in new skills by 2022, a setback to the goal of boosting employment. The ambitious 'Make in India' plan to boost manufacturing - and thus create jobs - and the 'Skill India' mission to improve workers' skills are also falling short, analysts say. The rush to convert agricultural land into industrial land and industrial land into service land is partly responsible for the employment crisis, a trade union said in June. While larger land owners may receive enough compensation for their land with which to buy land elsewhere or set up a business, smaller farmers can do little with the money they get and lose their ability to grow their own food. Farm workers and tenant farmers who do not own the land they till are worse off, as they receive no compensation.  We are trying to work out a way in which farmers do not lose out, and can improve their lives,  T. Haque, chairman of the land policy department at government think tank Niti Aayog, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  But it will take time. It is a big challenge.  For farmers like Ramdev Singh, who fears losing his small plot of land to India's first private gold mine in Chhattisgarh, the future looks bleak.  Even if they give us money, that will get spent. What will we do then, what will our children do? How will we eat?   We do not see any benefit to giving up our land: we only see losses,  he said.

The Fed, which lifted interest rates and unveiled details of its plan to cut its mammoth crisis-era bond portfolio at its mid-June meeting, will release minutes at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). A recent set of tepid economic data and an inflation rate below the central bank's 2 percent target may have a bearing on its rate hike plans.  Markets will also be paying very close attention to see if the minutes suggest that the recent fall in inflation is 'transitory', with suggestions of higher rates still on the cards, unless the U.S. economy decelerates,  said Lukman Otunuga, analyst with FXTN Research. Adding to investor concerns are weak oil prices. Crude oil was down more than 1 percent on Wednesday as rising OPEC exports turned sentiment more bearish. U.S. factory goods orders are likely to drop 0.5 percent in May, compared with a 0.2 percent decline in April. The data is expected at 10 a.m. ET. Investors will also be keeping an eye on the monthly employment report due Friday for signs on the health of the labor market.

Rome reacted furiously on Tuesday to Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil's comment that he expected controls at the border with Italy to be introduced  very soon .  His remarks were part of a report in Austria's top-selling tabloid, confirmed by an official in his ministry, that 750 troops were ready to be deployed and four armored vehicles had been sent to the province that includes the Brenner Pass, a gateway for Italy to important trading partners such as Germany. Italy summoned Austria's ambassador to Rome over Doskozil's comments. But Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern struck a conciliatory note on Wednesday, praising cooperation with Italy, which is dealing with a surge in the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Africa.  One must clear up misunderstandings like the ones that have evidently arisen with Italy,  Kern told a joint news conference with Doskozil. Austria is preparing to introduce controls at Brenner if there is a surge in migrant arrivals there, but there is no need to at present, he said.  We are not deploying tanks at Brenner and I can emphasize again that cooperation with Italy is really good,  Kern said, adding that there was no indication Italy had lost control of the situation on its southern flank. Italy has appealed to other European countries for help in dealing with the influx of people making the perilous sea crossing from North Africa, many of them fleeing war and poverty in their home countries. More than 85,000 refugees and other migrants have arrived in Italy by that route so far this year, making it the main point of entry into Europe. Austria has said for more than a year that it will introduce border controls at Brenner if needed to prevent a wave of arrivals like that seen in 2015, during which it took in more than 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers, who came mainly through Turkey, Greece and the Balkans.  Europe's migration crisis in 2015 lifted support in Austria for the far-right Freedom Party. With a parliamentary election due in October and immigration likely to remain a central issue, all three leading parties, including Kern and Doskozil's Social Democrats, are underlining the importance of border security.  We must prepare for a possible worsening of the situation (in Italy),  Kern and Doskozil said in a statement.  One thing is clear: there cannot be a repeat of a situation like the one in 2015.

A survey published on Wednesday suggested Britain's economy probably expanded at a quarterly pace of 0.4 percent in April-June. But its business expectations component tumbled to levels not seen since just after the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.  The euro zone's economy, meanwhile, probably grew nearly twice as fast, by 0.7 percent, during the second quarter. Business expectations dipped, but remained strong.  This shouldn't come as a surprise,  said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank of the British findings.  The UK is suffering the fallout from the Brexit (vote) of last year ... and has clearly moved onto a slower growth path.  Disappointingly for some Bank of England officials who want to raise interest rates, IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index showed business expectations not far off the lows last reached in late 2011, with growth in new orders, which tend to signal future activity, at a nine-month low.   Following on from weaker manufacturing and construction surveys, the softer services PMI points to an already-fragile economy faltering in June as heightened political and Brexit uncertainties fuel business and consumer caution,  said Howard Archer at EY ITEM Club. British Prime Minister Theresa May gambled away her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June and so far there has been little clarity as to how the Brexit negotiations will proceed. In contrast, across the euro zone backlogs of work increased as new business during June came in at the second-fastest rate in over six years.  Suggesting businesses in the bloc's dominant services industry remained confident, they sped up hiring last month, taking on staff at the second fastest rate since early 2008. In other upbeat news for policymakers at the European Central Bank, retail sales increased by more than expected in May, European statistics office Eurostat said on Wednesday. Two Paths Britain's economy barely grew in the first three months of the year as consumers faced both accelerating inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, and slowing wage growth. Some BoE officials say the consumer drag on the economy is likely to be offset by higher exports and investment. Last month, three of the Bank's eight monetary policymakers voted for a rate increase, although one of them has since left the BoE.     But the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI edged down to a four-month low of 53.4 in June from 53.8 in May, just shy of a forecast for 53.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.  This weaker reading pours a degree of a cold water on the latest hawkish messages emanating from the Bank of England,  said James Smith at ING. The final composite PMI for the euro zone, seen as a good growth indicator, was 56.3 in June, down from May's 56.8 but comfortably beating a flash estimate of 55.7 and well into growth levels above 50. Earlier PMIs from the bloc's big four economies of Germany, France, Spain and Italy showed faster growth in the second quarter as a whole. Britain's potential for being out of step can also be seen in monetary policy. While the BoE is -- largely -- not expected to tinker with monetary policy anytime soon, the U.S. Federal Reserve is forecast to raise interest rates once more this year and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi last week raised the prospect of policy-tightening.

VTB, whose emerging markets-focused investment banking arm VTB Capital is active in Africa, said in a statement that it had given no commitment to lend to Congo and that it did not currently plan to. The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo talked about issuing a roughly $1 billion Eurobond early last year, but it later abandoned the idea as the country's economy deteriorated. Africa's top copper producer has been hit hard by low commodity prices in recent years. It has only enough foreign currency reserves to cover about three weeks of imports and its franc currency has lost half its value in the past year. A spokesman at Congo's prime minister's office said on Wednesday he was not aware of recent discussions about a Eurobond. VTB, Russia's second-largest bank, played a role in $2 billion of loans taken out in secret by Mozambique, which has since defaulted on repayment. VTB has denied any wrongdoing relating to the Mozambique transactions.

GSK pared losses to 0.8 percent by 1220 GMT but remained among the top losers in London's FTSE-100 index after Citigroup downgraded the stock to neutral from buy and cut earnings forecasts by up to 9 percent. HIV medicines, which GSK sells through its ViiV Healthcare unit, have been star performers in recent years and new CEO Emma Walmsley said in April that the  HIV portfolio continues to go from strength to strength . GSK, which plans to defend its patch with a new two-drug treatment regimen for controlling the virus behind AIDS, declined to comment further on Wednesday. Arch-rival Gilead Sciences is developing a three-in-one daily pill and Merck & Co also has a novel medicine that could challenge both companies. FILE PHOTO: The GlaxoSmithKline building is pictured in Hounslow, west London June 18, 2013.Luke MacGregor/File PhotoCiti analyst Andrew Baum said Merck could, in fact, end up beating both GSK and Gilead with its new drug EFdA, which may reach the market as early as 2021 and has the potential to be developed as both a daily pill and a twice-yearly injection. Given the early nature of Merck's experimental product, Citi currently forecasts heavily risk-adjusted peak annual sales of $150 million for EFdA but it believes commercial success could add more than $5 billion to forecasts. Nearer term, Citi said the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, could shrink the U.S. HIV market by increasing the number of uninsured patients as well as introducing greater cost-sensitivity among healthcare providers. GSK's HIV drug dolutegravir, which is used in the medicines Tivicay and Triumeq, has been the mainstay of the British group's HIV operation and investors are concerned about any threat to what is a highly profitable business.

Nordea has threatened to move its headquarters from Sweden after the Swedish government unveiled plans to increase fees banks pay into a fund designed to protect taxpayers if there is another financial crisis. The center-left government has since softened its proposal, saying the so-called resolution fees will rise next year but then taper off and be eliminated in 2025, when the bailout fund is expected to have reached its target level.   This is a big issue and it is not about resolution fees. It is a much bigger issue. What is best for the bank in the long term,  Nordea Casper Koskull said during a panel debate on the Baltic island of Gotland.  What we want are regulations that are stable, predictable and fair, that is the discussion . Sweden has already imposed some of the toughest capital requirements in Europe on the country's banks. Banks in Sweden currently pay around 7 billion Swedish crowns ($824 million) a year into the resolution fund. If Nordea decides to move its headquarters, Copenhagen and Helsinki are widely seen as the two main options.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent, regaining half the losses it saw on Tuesday when North Korea fired a missile into Japanese waters. The organisation's global shares index, however, reflected a relatively ambivalent global mood, rising less than 0.05 percent despite a handful of solid purchasing manager surveys in Europe. New York's main indices were also set to open a touch higher after the July 54 break.  It has been a relatively light week in terms of economic data so far and investors are desperately looking for drivers,  said Arnaud Masset, an analyst with Swissquote.  Given the recent weakness in inflation and lacklustre households’ consumption data, it is more likely that the minutes highlight the concerns of FOMC members (about growth).  A shift towards more hawkish language by several major central banks has dominated the past week. It has, for example, left markets unsure of how much longer emergency stimulus in Europe will continue to support asset prices. For now investors seem to be giving policymakers the benefit of the doubt that the global economy can take any tightening of monetary policy, although the latest data on Wednesday was mixed -- strong in Europe and weaker in China.  North Korea has rattled markets but central bankers are more important,  said Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index in London.  While North Korea’s military ambitions are a background threat for markets, we don’t think that this particular geopolitical event is at the stage yet where it will cause a spike in volatility.  South Korea's main index rebounded by 0.36 percent and Japan's Nikkei ended up 0.25 percent. Shanghai stocks rose more than 1 percent, despite a drop in the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) to 51.6 in June, from 52.8 in May. IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 56.3 in June, down from May but comfortably beating a flash estimate, chalking up the best performance last quarter in over six years. Currency markets were in limbo, the euro trading around a cent below last week's 14-month highs against the dollar, less than 0.2 percent lower on the day. The dollar and yen were the main victims of the shift in language last week, but many analysts wonder whether the European Central Bank will be able to rein in money-printing later this year if the euro keeps gaining.  I meet a lot of people while I talk to clients who think the ECB simply won't be able to escape its current policy setting because a stronger currency is too damaging,  said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes.  The thought the ECB will resist pressure...is still leading many ... to look for cheaper levels to buy euro.  The dollar rose 0.2 percent higher against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength and slightly more against the yen to an almost two-month high of 113.69 yen.

The Scottish economy expanded by a quarterly 0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2017, faster than Britain's overall growth of 0.2 percent and a sharp reversal from a contraction of 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter which had raised fears of recession. The economy was powered by a 3.1 percent jump in industrial production, helped by the recovery of output at the Dalzell steel plate mill in Motherwell. The mill was bought by Liberty Steel from Tata Steel last year in a deal backed by financing from the Scottish government. The news gives some relief for Scotland's pro-independence devolved government, which lost voter support in Britain's election last month and is under pressure to defend its record after a decade in power north of the English border. Graeme Roy of the Fraser of Allander Institute economic research unit urged caution on the numbers.  On balance, these data do not change the fact that the Scottish economy still faces a fragile outlook - particularly when you factor in likely effects of possible higher inflation and any Brexit uncertainty in the months to come.  In annual terms, Scotland's economy grew by 0.7 percent, slower than growth of 1.8 percent in Britain's economy, and has underperformed the rest of the UK for the past two years. The Scottish government recently shelved plans to push for a new referendum on independence from the UK. Support for secession among voters stands at around 45 percent, according to opinion polls, and how well or badly the economy fares is one the main drivers of separatist sentiment. Wednesday's figures showed a rebound in output in industries linked to the North Sea oil and gas industry which the government said showed growing confidence in a sector that has slowed in recent years. Scotland's economy has generally underperformed the British economy because of its dependence on oil and gas, and economists and business leaders have been calling for measures to broaden and deepen Scotland's economic scope.  You have to ask whether it is desirable for the fortunes of a single industry to have such a large bearing on whether our economy grows,  Andy Willox, the Scottish policy convener of the Federation of Small Businesses, said in a statement.  We need to develop diverse local economies, so that a single local closure or industry challenge doesn't hit a community, or the entire country, for six.

At a rowdy session in parliament, May was questioned repeatedly about restrictions on pay increases for jobs including police, nurses and doctors as the opposition Labour Party pressed an argument that her governing Conservatives do not look after working people. Finance minister Philip Hammond has defended the country's strict cap on public sector pay after some senior Conservatives also questioned whether it should be loosened. May said the government would consider outstanding public sector pay review recommendations, which include teachers and prison officers,  very carefully  and respond to them.  We will always recognise the need to ensure that we take those decisions against the need to live within our means,  she told parliament. Hammond and May are under pressure to loosen the seven year-old cap which limits public sector pay increases to 1 percent a year at a time when inflation is about to hit 3 percent, but junior finance minister Liz Truss said the policy was unchanged.  Our policy on public sector pay has always been designed to strike the right balance between being fair to our public sector workers and fair to those who pay for them. That approach has not changed and the government will continually assess that balance,  she told parliament.

Paulo newspaper reported on Wednesday. Under the new rules for the so-called Fies program, lower-income students must agree to have up to 30 percent of their monthly wages automatically deducted to pay back the loans, Folha said, without naming its sources. The government will also demand that borrowers begin to pay off the loans earlier, it reported. Currently, students can wait a year and a half after graduation before doing so. The new rules, which would apply to loans granted from 2018 onward, may be announced as soon as Thursday, according to the paper. A representative for the Education Ministry declined to comment immediately on when and how the Fies program would be restructured. Fies, which was created to help low-income students pay for tuition at nongovernment universities, has seen its costs skyrocket in recent years as Brazil slipped into a deep recession, stoking delinquencies.

While stricter legal scrutiny related to the corruption scandal helped slow second-quarter M&A;, bankers said funds and multinational firms were still seeking Brazilian assets. Despite economic and political headwinds, merger activity could be reignited by falling borrowing costs and an increasingly stable currency.  Pressure from creditors could also speed up asset sales by companies restructuring almost 180 billion reais ($56 billion) of debt, bankers said.   M&A; is relatively resilient to the macroeconomic and  political environment as strategic players seek opportunities with long-term potential,  said Patricia Moraes, head of Brazil banking for JPMorgan Chase & Co, which topped Thomson Reuters local advisory rankings last quarter. Uncertainty surrounding the timeframe for an economic recovery from Brazil's worst recession on record, as well as concerns about the stability of President Michel Temer's administration, have deterred some buyers and sellers from committing to deals. Companies announced $7.052 billion worth of Brazil-related mergers last quarter, down 76 percent from the prior quarter, the rankings showed. A year earlier, when tougher due diligence procedures were implemented, announced M&A; deals totaled $6.861 billion. Last quarter, the number of announced deals fell to 132 from 141 in the prior three months and 135 a year earlier. Brazilian markets tanked in mid-May after members of the billionaire Batista family accused Temer of seeking to obstruct the massive corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash. The market turmoil compounded the impact of Brazil's recession, keeping buyers and sellers at odds over valuations. Temer has called a corruption charge filed against him by Brazil's top prosecutor a  fiction  as he faces possible removal from office.     Fallout from Operation Car Wash has led to increased due diligence concerning companies ensnared in the scandal, such as building group Odebrecht SA. Usual timeframes for such proceedings have doubled over the past year, to up to six months.  Deals are going though an adjustment,  said Alessandro Farkuh, head of M&A; for Banco Bradesco BBI SA.  There's a lot of work but, because of the country's situation, M&A; negotiations are taking place in an unusual way.   Consolidation More assets are on the block as companies seek to cut debt or improve their capital and tax structures, said Eduardo Miras, co-head of Brazil investment banking at Morgan Stanley & Co, Brazil's No. 1 M&A; bank this year.   Some companies are being forced to sell,  Miras said.  Opportunistic buyers and strategic players with a long-term view find themselves with a flurry of good Brazilian assets.  Car Wash-related M&A; deals include J&F; Investimentos SA's planned sale of a dairy producer and the maker of the popular Havaianas flip flops, Alpargatas. Members of the Batista family, which controls J&F;, admitted to bribing 1,893 politicians.  Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Itaú BBA SA, said he expected deals to pick up in the third and fourth quarters amid growing interest from multinational firms and buyout funds, which are more likely to meet buyers' prices for attractive companies.  Some premium assets are being sold because of the current situation, which in general keeps us excited about the dealflow ahead,  Greenlees said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley topped value rankings for the second quarter and the first half, respectively. JPMorgan worked on Itaú's $2 billion purchase of a minority stake in brokerage XP Investimentos SA. Itaú BBA led the rankings for the number of deals after working on seven transactions last quarter and 18 this year. In the first six months, the total of 273 Brazilian M&A-related; transactions was worth $36.177 billion, more than three times the amount recorded in the same period of last year, the data showed.   For years, investment banks have derived nearly half of their annual Brazil revenues from M&A; advisory. As dealmaking suffers, banks have turned to structured lending, transactional banking or, in some cases, securities trading. Following is a table with Brazil M&A; ranking for the second quarter and the first six months. Numbers are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless specified.

Chairman Henk Nijboer said he hoped the findings would spur parliament into action to reform the industry, given they showed  serious  problems. Trust offices help manage financial assets on behalf of their owners, and the Netherlands is home to many due to its favorable treatment of dividends and royalties, wide network of tax treaties, and long-standing tradition of pre-negotiating tax deals with companies. Holland Quaestor, the industry group that represents trust offices, was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. Dutch Finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem introduced stricter rules for trust offices in 2015, but critics say oversight is still too lax. The inquiry's findings come after the largest Dutch trust office, Intertrust, listed on the stock market in 2015 and as rival TMF is considering an initial public offering.  At Intertrust, we adhere not only to the letter but also the spirit of laws and treaties, including those which govern our client’s dealings,  Intertrust said in its submission to the inquiry. The inquiry panel, which did not name any individuals or companies accused of breaking laws, compiled information from representatives of trust offices, tax advisers, regulators and other experts from eight days of hearings under oath last month. Among those interviewed was Jan Favie, manager of the Dutch companies that pop groups The Rolling Stones and U2 use to oversee their intellectual property rights. He argued it was a widespread misunderstanding that the musicians use Dutch trust offices to lower their taxes, but said, rather, they were attracted to the Netherlands because of the country's managerial  expertise, good infrastructure and stable legal environment.  The parliamentary panel concluded that oversight of trust offices was limited, due to insufficient staffing at the country's central bank (DNB) and national tax office. An area of particular concern was that trust offices often fail to identify the people behind capital flows, as they are required to do by law. That enables tax-dodging and other criminal behaviour, the committee said. In a statement included as part of Wednesday's report, the DNB called for the abolition of all trust office processes that help mask the identity of clients.

Lufthansa has been discussing costs at Frankfurt airport since the airport operator last year signed a deal with Ryanair (RYA.I) that gives the Irish low cost carrier discounts on fees for new routes started in 2017, which Lufthansa said disadvantaged it.  Lufthansa, which has a market share of around 60 percent at Frankfurt airport, and Fraport said on Wednesday they would lower costs and bring in new revenue by better using current infrastructure at the airport and working more closely together on customer services.   Related CoverageLufthansa savings from Fraport deal in low 2-digit million euro range: sourcesOn fees, Fraport said it would not be making any changes to its current application for airport charges for 2018. However, a spokesman said that the incentive program that started in 2017 would be valid in 2018 for new routes. That would mean that Lufthansa's budget carrier Eurowings or other carriers could benefit from the same level of discounts as Ryanair had this year if they start new routes next year.    A Lufthansa spokesman said it has still not made a decision on whether to bring Eurowings to Frankfurt.  He declined to provide further details of the cost savings measures, but said the financial benefits achieved would be comparable to the discounts awarded to Ryanair.   The partners are thus creating the right conditions for the further growth of Lufthansa at Frankfurt Airport,  the two said in the statement.   Lufthansa had previously said it would grow more from its other hub in Munich, and last month announced plans to station A380 jets there.

Under an agreement announced on Wednesday that followed Tencent's capital injection into a TCL unit, Tencent will pre-load its entertainment content onto TCL's internet-connected, or smart TVs, which feature voice control and customized search recommendations. On Monday, Tencent agreed to invest 450 million yuan ($66.18 million) in TCL subsidiary Shenzhen Thunderbird Network Technology, making Tencent the second-largest shareholder with a 16.67 percent stake in the subsidiary behind TCL's FFALCON brand internet TVs. This is Tencent's second investment in smart TVs in a month. On June 6, it invested 300 million yuan for a 7.71 per cent stake in Coocaa, a smart TV subsidiary of TCL competitor Skyworth Digital Holdings.  TCL shipped 20 million LCD TV sets in 2016, half of them smart TVs. That makes it the world's third-largest liquid crystal display TV maker behind Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, according to IHS Technology. Tencent would work with TCL on extending its advantage in delivering online content to delivering so-called over-the-top services, said Zhao Gang, general manager of the living room products department at Tencent Video.  Zhao was referring to content services, such as movies and video, provided by internet companies beyond the media transmitted by traditional telecommunications companies like cable operators. Streaming content provided by Netflix Inc and through Apple Inc's Apple TV devices are examples of over-the-top services. Zhao was also emphatic that the TCL investment did not mean Tencent was moving into manufacturing hardware.   We would never touch hardware production. We want to be a supporter and enabler of our partner,  said Zhao.  Tencent's Tencent Video unit is China's largest online video streaming website, according to the company. It has a library of entertainment and live sports content with copyright, and also makes its own productions. Tencent Video and TCL hope the tie up will increase their membership bases and raise their revenue from user spending on content, said Tony Guo, chief executive of FFALCON Technology.

The agreement, signed during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Germany, is for 100 A320 family aircraft and 40 A350 planes, Airbus said.  It's one of the biggest deals that we've signed in a long time,  Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders told journalists after signing the deal in Berlin. The planes will be purchased by state-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, which will then allocate them to Chinese airlines. The A320 planes will be a mixture of the older CEO and the new NEO version with revamped engines, while the majority of the A350 orders are for the -900 model. The deal is flexible pending negotiations with the airlines. Enders said he expected up to 50 percent of the A320 family planes would come from the Airbus final assembly line in China.  The logo of Airbus Group is seen on the company's headquarters building in Toulouse, Southwestern France, April 18, 2017.Regis DuvignauEnders was making his first public appearance since Airbus rolled out a new structure, completing a recent merger between its parent company and its dominant planemaking arm, changes which included a shift in the reporting line for its commercial sales team to Enders. Enders said the shift in reporting lines for the sales team reflected the fact that commercial aircraft head Fabrice Bregier had been given more tasks in his new role as group-wide chief operating officer.      With orders slowing and the focus shifting to the backlog, Enders said the shake-up allows Bregier to concentrate on deliveries.  This is merely a burden sharing mechanism because the focus should be on execution and this is what it's all about,  Enders said.     We have plenty of challenges on the execution side, be it the transition to the NEO, the ramp-up of the A320 family, the 350 family, not to mention the A400M, which is not entirely solved,  he said.  Enders also said the group was in talks with the Chinese over the A380 superjumbo, which has suffered slow sales.  It won't happen overnight. It has to be intensively discussed,  he said.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Graphic of OPEC oil exports: reut.rs/2tLZsFt By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 5 (Reuters) - OPEC's attempt to bolster crude oil prices by cutting output are now largely an exercise in self-deception, with recent production and export numbers laying bare the group's shortcomings. While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may be able to claim relatively high compliance with its plan to lower output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), this is ultimately just a smokescreen. Of far more importance is evidence that the group actually exported more crude in the first six months of this year than it did in the first half of 2016. OPEC exports jumped to 25.92 million bpd in June this year, up 450,000 bpd from May's 25.47 million bpd, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research. Over the first six months of this year OPEC exports averaged 25.02 million bpd, up 290,000 bpd from the same period in 2016, according to the data. OPEC may be able to claim a small win insofar as the group's exports have dropped from the second half of 2016, when they averaged 25.14 million bpd. But this is a tiny reduction from what was a period of near record output for the group, and in some ways actually only underscores the lack of success OPEC has had so far this year in restricting exports. The rise in OPEC exports in the first half does look at odds with the cuts the group has made to production, with the 11 members that committed to lowering output achieving 92 percent compliance with their targets in June, according to a Reuters survey. But the vessel-tracking data show the crude market is getting as much oil from OPEC as it had been prior to the November deal. The problem for OPEC is that while some members have indeed cut both output and exports, others haven't. The group's biggest producer Saudi Arabia exported an average 7.28 million bpd in the first six months of 2017, according to the shipping and port data. This was down 350,000 bpd on the same period last year, meaning the kingdom has actually reduced exports by a figure relatively close to its pledge to lower output by 486,000 bpd as part of the producer agreement. Uneven Burden However, exports from the United Arab Emirates have risen to an average 2.8 million bpd in the first half of this year from 2.52 million bpd in the same period in 2016. Those from Iran have gained 450,000 bpd to 2.13 million bpd in the first half of this year, as the Islamic Republic boosts exports after the lifting of Western sanctions in the wake of an agreement on its nuclear programme. While Libya isn't party to the output-cutting deal, its exports have risen from an average 243,000 bpd in the first half of 2016 to 553,000 bpd this year as the North African producer slowly recovers from its debilitating civil conflict. With the first six months of the deal to cut output now having passed, a few things are clearer. The first is that even if there has been good compliance with restricting output, this hasn't translated to lower exports from OPEC. Secondly, the heavy lifting is being done mainly by Saudi Arabia, which begs the question as to how long it will be willing to shoulder the burden of being the driver of efforts to balance the oil market. Thirdly, if there is to be a supply-led rebalancing of the oil market, OPEC and its allies will likely have to do more, or at least reduce actual exports by the joint 1.8 million bpd, rather than the harder-to-quantify measure of production. The price of global benchmark Brent crude has recovered from its recent low of $44.35 a barrel on June 21, closing at $49.61 on Tuesday. But it is more or less at the same level that prevailed before the Nov. 30 output cut was announced, meaning OPEC and its allies only achieved a relatively short boost to prices. In retrospect this isn't surprising in the light of data showing the group's exports rising in year-on-year terms in the first half, but it should give OPEC's leaders much pause for thought.  Lying to ourselves is more deeply ingrained than lying to others,  wrote 19th century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Perhaps OPEC needs to stop trying to convince itself and others that its output cuts are working, and either abandon the tactic or amend it to make it genuinely effective.

While stricter legal scrutiny related to the corruption scandal helped slow second-quarter M&A;, bankers said funds and multinational firms were still seeking Brazilian assets. Despite economic and political headwinds, merger activity could be reignited by falling borrowing costs and an increasingly stable currency.  Pressure from creditors could also speed up asset sales by companies restructuring almost 180 billion reais ($56 billion) of debt, bankers said.   M&A; is relatively resilient to the macroeconomic and  political environment as strategic players seek opportunities with long-term potential,  said Patricia Moraes, head of Brazil banking for JPMorgan Chase & Co, which topped Thomson Reuters local advisory rankings last quarter. Uncertainty surrounding the timeframe for an economic recovery from Brazil's worst recession on record, as well as concerns about the stability of President Michel Temer's administration, have deterred some buyers and sellers from committing to deals. Companies announced $7.052 billion worth of Brazil-related mergers last quarter, down 76 percent from the prior quarter, the rankings showed. A year earlier, when tougher due diligence procedures were implemented, announced M&A; deals totaled $6.861 billion. Last quarter, the number of announced deals fell to 132 from 141 in the prior three months and 135 a year earlier. Brazilian markets tanked in mid-May after members of the billionaire Batista family accused Temer of seeking to obstruct the massive corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash. The market turmoil compounded the impact of Brazil's recession, keeping buyers and sellers at odds over valuations. Temer has called a corruption charge filed against him by Brazil's top prosecutor a  fiction  as he faces possible removal from office.     Fallout from Operation Car Wash has led to increased due diligence concerning companies ensnared in the scandal, such as building group Odebrecht SA. Usual timeframes for such proceedings have doubled over the past year, to up to six months.  Deals are going though an adjustment,  said Alessandro Farkuh, head of M&A; for Banco Bradesco BBI SA.  There's a lot of work but, because of the country's situation, M&A; negotiations are taking place in an unusual way.   Consolidation More assets are on the block as companies seek to cut debt or improve their capital and tax structures, said Eduardo Miras, co-head of Brazil investment banking at Morgan Stanley & Co, Brazil's No. 1 M&A; bank this year.   Some companies are being forced to sell,  Miras said.  Opportunistic buyers and strategic players with a long-term view find themselves with a flurry of good Brazilian assets.  Car Wash-related M&A; deals include J&F; Investimentos SA's planned sale of a dairy producer and the maker of the popular Havaianas flip flops, Alpargatas. Members of the Batista family, which controls J&F;, admitted to bribing 1,893 politicians.  Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Itaú BBA SA, said he expected deals to pick up in the third and fourth quarters amid growing interest from multinational firms and buyout funds, which are more likely to meet buyers' prices for attractive companies.  Some premium assets are being sold because of the current situation, which in general keeps us excited about the dealflow ahead,  Greenlees said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley topped value rankings for the second quarter and the first half, respectively. JPMorgan worked on Itaú's $2 billion purchase of a minority stake in brokerage XP Investimentos SA. Itaú BBA led the rankings for the number of deals after working on seven transactions last quarter and 18 this year. In the first six months, the total of 273 Brazilian M&A-related; transactions was worth $36.177 billion, more than three times the amount recorded in the same period of last year, the data showed.   For years, investment banks have derived nearly half of their annual Brazil revenues from M&A; advisory. As dealmaking suffers, banks have turned to structured lending, transactional banking or, in some cases, securities trading.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a market analyst for Reuters.) * Funds, Chicago wheat: reut.rs/2sZTGhz * Funds, K.C. wheat: reut.rs/2u7RyTH * Funds, Minneapolis wheat: reut.rs/2sZTBuA * Funds, corn: reut.rs/2svj2kf * Funds, soybeans: reut.rs/2t01Jv9 * Funds, soybean meal: reut.rs/2svCWeR * Funds, soybean oil: reut.rs/2u7FF09 By Karen Braun CHICAGO, July 3 (Reuters) - Funds have nearly washed away their bearish Chicago wheat bets and are likely entering July as bulls. If true, this would mark specs’ first net long in the soft red wheat market in nearly two years. In the week ended June 27, hedge funds and other money managers cut their net short in CBOT wheat futures and options to 10,158 contracts from 20,971 in the week prior, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (reut.rs/2sZTGhz). Profit-taking following the previous week’s massive round of short covering prevented speculators from further trimming the Chicago wheat position early in the week, but explosiveness in Minneapolis spring wheat futures on June 27 pulled other wheat contracts up with it, and they have been on their way up ever since. In K.C. wheat futures and options, money managers are ending June on the most bullish note ever. They extended their net long in the week ended June 27 to 44,240 contracts from 37,701 in the previous week, and the new stance is funds’ most bullish on the hard red wheat since April 1, 2014 (reut.rs/2u7RyTH). Funds also upped bullish bets in Minneapolis spring wheat futures and options, increasing their net long to 15,347 contracts from 12,720 in the week before. (reut.rs/2sZTBuA) Speculators went the other way on CBOT corn, expanding their net short to 106,119 futures and options contracts from 53,825 in the week prior. They had nearly wiped clean their bearish bets around mid-month over threatening U.S. weather forecasts, but largely benign outlooks ever since have led traders to once again hit the  sell  button. (reut.rs/2svj2kf) Wheat futures have been through the roof in the days since, though, especially Minneapolis, and funds may soon be bulls across all three wheat contracts. Drought continues to plague spring wheat in the Northern U.S. Plains, and lower-than-expected wheat acres in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s acreage report on Friday confirmed wheat’s upward march. Spring wheat acres in particular came in below expectations at a 45-year low and Minneapolis wheat futures have put on nearly $1 (or 13 percent) since June 27. Trade sources suggest that June 30 was the funds’ most active wheat buying day of the year thus far, as most-active CBOT September futures settled up the daily 30-cent limit, and spot CBOT wheat traded above $5 a bushel for the first time in a year. CBOT corn also followed wheat up on Friday, though gains were more modest under generally bearish stocks and acres from USDA. But uncertainties over conditions and weather still exist, and the weather outlook going into Monday will largely dictate the near-term direction of the corn market. Record Shorts in Soy, Meal Speculators reached new levels of bearishness in CBOT soybeans and soybean meal in the week ended June 27, completely dwarfing their extension of bullishness in soybean oil. But new records are extremely unlikely next week. Money managers expanded their net short in soybean futures and options to 118,683 contracts from 87,140 in the week prior. This surpasses the week ended May 26, 2015, for the most bearish by specs on the oilseed, and it marks only the second time on record in which the fund short surpassed 100,000 contracts (reut.rs/2t01Jv9). Funds also logged a new all-time net short in soybean meal at 54,430 futures and options contracts, replacing the old record of 50,941 contracts set back on June 6. Soybean meal futures have struggled in recent months amid a general abundance of feed ingredients, and funds have maintained a record bearish stance for the date since mid-May (reut.rs/2svCWeR). Soybean oil retained speculators’ overall optimism last week, as funds increased their modest net long to 10,511 futures and options contracts from 4,769 in the previous week (reut.rs/2u7FF09). The bean oil position prevented the soy complex from overtaking the week ended June 6 as the most bearish combined fund stance of all time. Futures market activity in the days since suggests the record will be safe again for the week ended July 4, and perhaps in the longer term pending U.S. weather forecasts. The bullish soybean stocks figures and lower-than-expected U.S. acres from USDA on Friday sent most-active November futures up 30 cents, and oil and meal followed along. Similar to wheat, June 30 may have been the funds’ most active soybean buying day of 2017. Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/cbot-grains-braun-idUSL1N1JR1ZD"},

Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped among the shattered buildings and infrastructure in Islamic State's redoubt in the Old City by the western bank of the Tigris river, the aid organization said. Civilians who have managed to get medical treatment are suffering from burns, and shrapnel and blast injuries, while many women and children are in need of critical care and are under-nourished, a MSF officials said. But there was concern that only a small proportion of the civilian population were managing to get the medical attention they required.  Really, (there is) a huge level of human suffering,  Jonathan Henry, MSF emergency coordinator in West Mosul, told a news briefing in Geneva after spending six weeks in Iraq.  This is a massive population that has been traumatised from a very brutal and horrific conflict,  he said. Iraqi commanders have predicted final victory in Mosul this week after a grinding eight-month assault on the once two-million-strong city which has pushed Islamic State into a rectangle no more than 300 by 500 metres beside the Tigris. The militants' brutality and the U.S.-backed war to end their three-year rule has created an  extremely traumatic environment for people to flee from and to return to,  affecting their mental health on a large scale, Henry said.  The west (of the city) has been heavily destroyed. It's really mass destruction ... similar to the blitz of the Second World War, hospitals have been destroyed, neighbourhoods are in ruins.  The battles in the Old City's maze of narrow alleyways is fought house-by-house in streets packed with civilians and planted with multiple explosive devices by the militants, who are also using drones and suicide bombings. Schrapnel and blast injuries, broken bones from collapsed buildings and burns are the main type of wounds seen by the MSF team of surgeons in west Mosul, said Henry.  One of our major concerns is we feel only a small percentage of the patients are reaching medical facilities,  he said. Half of the 100 war-wounded over the past two weeks at the MSF 25-bed hospital were women and children in need of critical care and many were malnourished, he said.  But the most urgent patients we feel are not able to leave the conflict area.  About 900,000 people, nearly half the pre-war population of Mosul, have been displaced by the fighting, taking shelter in camps or with relatives and friends, according the aid group.

The Corte dei Conti, which rules on abuses of public funds, is bringing the case against Morgan Stanley on behalf of Italy's taxpayers. Its prosecutors made their decision after an investigation into derivatives contracts they say were drawn up by Morgan Stanley and Italian officials, which caused losses to the state. In going to trial, the prosecutors believe there is a case to answer. The hearings are expected to begin next April, the source said. If the allegations are proven, a judge may order Morgan Stanley to pay compensation to the Italian government.  The investigation phase has ended and the court will hear the damages claims,  the source said, seeking anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly on the decision. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Last August, Morgan Stanley said in a securities filing it had received a proposal from an Italian prosecutor about a payment to settle derivative transactions. Morgan Stanley said the proposed claim was groundless. The derivative transactions were originally entered into between 1995 and 2005 and were terminated in December 2011 and January 2012, Morgan Stanley said in the filing. The Corte dei Conti case centres on interest rate derivatives agreed between the Treasury and Morgan Stanley. They were meant as a form of insurance for the government, one of the most heavily indebted in Europe, in the event that market interest rates were to rise. After the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, interest rates plunged, enabling Italy to borrow more cheaply in the bond markets but incurring large losses on its derivative positions. Offsetting such gains and losses are a normal part of hedging, but the Corte dei Conti prosecutors argue that some contracts negotiated with Morgan Stanley were speculative in nature and contained termination clauses that were overly advantageous to the bank. The Italian court will also hear claims worth a total of 1.18 billion euros against two senior government officials - public debt chief Maria Cannata and Treasury boss Vincenzo La Via - and former finance ministers Domenico Siniscalco and Vittorio Grilli. The offices of Cannata and La Via referred media enquiries on the case to the Treasury press office. A Treasury spokesman said it had full faith in the work undertaken by its managers and trusted that the court could clear up these matters. Grilli and Siniscalco declined to comment. The prosecutors have also alleged that Morgan Stanley had a conflict of interest, saying it not only sold derivatives to the Treasury but was also engaged in helping Italy to manage its financing operations, including buying and distributing government bonds. Between late 2011 and early 2012, the government paid Morgan Stanley around 3 billion euros to settle the termination of derivative contracts, the source said. Compensation orders by the special audit court, which will hear the case, can be appealed. Once confirmed, they are legally enforceable through asset seizures if necessary. $1 = 0.8807 euros Additional reporting by Giuseppe Fonte in Rome","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/italy-derivatives-idUSL1N1JW0AP"},

Higher prices have averted the stock crunch many analysts feared in 2017 as a result of rising exports and the start up of a large number of new gas-fired combined cycle power plants. During the first six months of 2017, prices for next-month delivery at Henry Hub were almost $1 per million British thermal units or 46 percent higher than in the first half of 2016. Gas prices paid by electricity producers were up $1 per million British thermal units or 39 percent in the first four months of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Power producers generated 349 Terawatt-hours of electricity from natural gas between January and April and used 2,611 billion cubic feet of gas in the process (“Electric Power Monthly”, EIA, June 2017). But gas-fired generation was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2016 while the volume of gas consumed fell by 14 percent (tmsnrt.rs/2tgvKac). By contrast, total electricity generation from all sources was down by less than 2 percent compared with the prior year. Coal-fired power plants were the main beneficiaries from higher gas prices, increasing their electricity generation by almost 7 percent. Coal-fired plants operated at an average of 49 percent of their maximum output between January and April compared with 44 percent in the same period in 2016. By contrast, gas-fired combined-cycle units operated at 48 percent of their maximum output, down from 53 percent in 2016. Adequate Stocks Higher gas prices seem to have arrested the slide in gas production, with output down by 4 percent compared with the previous year but showing signs of stabilizing. The ramp up in oil drilling since May 2016 in response to higher oil prices has also boosted associated gas output. Stabilizing gas output and reduced consumption by electricity generators has freed up gas for export while leaving inventories at comfortable levels. U.S. gas exports increased nearly 50 percent to 1,045 billion cubic feet in the first four months, while gas imports were up just 6 percent to 1,063 billion cubic feet. As a result, net imports shrank from 303 billion cubic feet in January-April 2016 to just 18 billion cubic feet in January-April 2017. Working gas stocks in underground storage stood at 2,816 billion cubic feet on June 23, which was 313 billion below 2016 but 183 billion above the five-year seasonal average. Storage injections have been broadly tracking the normal seasonal trajectory, especially once adjusted for the slightly warmer-than-average start to the cooling season. Weekly builds have been running a little below the five-year average but are higher than in 2016 once adjusted for airconditioning demand. For the time being, the market appears fairly balanced, with stocks neither excessive nor tight, and with front-month futures prices around $3 per million British thermal units.

Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has claimed that its partner has breached joint venture contracts as it pursues an $18 billion sale of the unit and is seeking an injunction to prevent any deal without its consent. In its filing with the Superior Court of California, Toshiba argued that their joint venture interests only cover a small portion of its flash memory semiconductor business and that the court has no jurisdiction as its primary place of business was Japan. Toshiba is scrambling to get a deal done as fast as possible as it needs funds to cover billions in cost overruns at now-bankrupt unit Westinghouse. It is currently negotiating with a preferred bidder consortium that includes Japan government investors and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital.  Even if an agreement is reached with a bidder...if Toshiba is prevented from moving forward on implementing that transaction, the harm to an overall deal would be severe - and may well make the implementation of a transaction impossible,  said in its filing, which was made on Friday. Western Digital has tabled its own bid for the chip unit - the world's No. 2 producer of NAND chips - but the offer has gained little traction with Toshiba, which says it raises anti-trust concerns. The Japanese firm is also reluctant to engage with Western Digital as its U.S. partner has said in the past it wants to take control of the unit. Western Digital argues that an injunction will ensure that an international arbitration court will be given an appropriate opportunity to resolve their dispute. The court hearing on the issue is scheduled for July 14 and Western Digital has said it believes a decision could come on the same day. Western Digital is expected to file a response to Toshiba's opposition before the hearing.

The policy was passed in last week's cabinet session but only made public on Wednesday. Nigeria has for decades relied on its ample supplies of oil to power its economy. But despite having a wealth of crude, the vast majority was sent overseas for refining, and the country instead has had to import refined fuels at great expense. Nigeria has the world's ninth largest proven gas reserves, at 187 trillion cubic feet. A move to using gas could reduce the drain on foreign exchange that importing refined oil products requires. If coupled with infrastructure investment, Nigeria could also improve its creaking power grid, which forces many with no power or those plagued by frequent blackouts to operate costly generators. The 100-page National Gas Policy seeks to set up a single independent petroleum regulator. It also aims to separate upstream from midstream operations and to separate gas infrastructure ownership and operations from gas trading, the oil ministry said.  The policy will also divide the Nigeria Gas Company into separate transport and gas marketing companies and introduce  market-led wholesale gas pricing  after a transitional period.

The U.S. Supreme Court in a ruling last Monday revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order that banned people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, which had been blocked by lower courts. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks. But opponents, including states and refugee advocacy groups, sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminates against Muslims. After the Supreme Court ruling, the government said that a  bona fide relationship  means close family members only: parents, spouses, siblings and children. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from the six countries would still be banned. The government's definition,  hews closely to the categorical determinations articulated by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act,  Department of Justice lawyers argued in court papers on Monday. The government's filing came after the State of Hawaii last week went to U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who originally ruled to block the ban, to seek clarification of the Supreme Court's ruling, arguing the government's definition of  bona fide relationship  was too narrow. The government said Hawaii, and refugee organizations that filed a  friend of the court  brief in support of the state, were seeking to apply  broader, free-hand rules.  The refugee organizations had argued that their work to resettle refugees, a process that can take years of work in coordination with the U.S. government, qualifies as a  bona fide  relationship with a U.S. entity. Any refugees with such a relationship should be exempt from the three-month ban on refugees included in the executive order, according to the Supreme Court ruling. But the government said workers with offers of employment with a U.S. company and international students are fundamentally different than refugees receiving help from U.S. resettlement agencies.  A refugee's relationship with the agency flows from the government, not from an independent relationship between the refugee and the resettlement agency,  the government said in its brief.  Indeed, resettlement agencies typically do not have any direct contact with the refugees they assure before their arrival in the United States.  Using the organization's interpretation would make the refugee provisions in the executive order  largely meaningless,  the government said. U.S. refugee resettlement is continuing as normal until July 6, the State Department has said, around when the 50,000 cap for the fiscal year set by Trump's executive order is likely to be reached. Late on Thursday, before the ban went into effect, the government reversed its position on fiancés, saying they could also qualify for exceptions. The court filing described a 72-hour scramble to  coordinate among multiple government agencies, and issue detailed guidance  on how to implement the Supreme Court's ruling. The roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued on Friday compared to in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order, sparking protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-travelban-idUSL1N1JW0AI"},

Under an agreement announced on Wednesday that followed Tencent's capital injection into a TCL unit, Tencent will pre-load its entertainment content onto TCL's internet-connected, or smart TVs, which feature voice control and customized search recommendations. On Monday, Tencent agreed to invest 450 million yuan ($66.18 million) in TCL subsidiary Shenzhen Thunderbird Network Technology, making Tencent the second-largest shareholder with a 16.67 percent stake in the subsidiary behind TCL's FFALCON brand internet TVs. This is Tencent's second investment in smart TVs in a month. On June 6, it invested 300 million yuan for a 7.71 per cent stake in Coocaa, a smart TV subsidiary of TCL competitor Skyworth Digital Holdings.  TCL shipped 20 million LCD TV sets in 2016, half of them smart TVs. That makes it the world's third-largest liquid crystal display TV maker behind Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, according to IHS Technology. Tencent would work with TCL on extending its advantage in delivering online content to delivering so-called over-the-top services, said Zhao Gang, general manager of the living room products department at Tencent Video.  Zhao was referring to content services, such as movies and video, provided by internet companies beyond the media transmitted by traditional telecommunications companies like cable operators. Streaming content provided by Netflix Inc and through Apple Inc's Apple TV devices are examples of over-the-top services. Zhao was also emphatic that the TCL investment did not mean Tencent was moving into manufacturing hardware.   We would never touch hardware production. We want to be a supporter and enabler of our partner,  said Zhao.  Tencent's Tencent Video unit is China's largest online video streaming website, according to the company. It has a library of entertainment and live sports content with copyright, and also makes its own productions. Tencent Video and TCL hope the tie up will increase their membership bases and raise their revenue from user spending on content, said Tony Guo, chief executive of FFALCON Technology. TCL says it currently has 20 million users for its smart TVs. Reporting by Sijia Jiang; Editing by Christian Schmollinger","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/tencent-tcl-tv-idUSL3N1JW1MX"},

IATA, however, believes the best of the cyclical upturn may have passed.

Higher prices have averted the stock crunch many analysts feared in 2017 as a result of rising exports and the start up of a large number of new gas-fired combined cycle power plants. During the first six months of 2017, prices for next-month delivery at Henry Hub were almost $1 per million British thermal units or 46 percent higher than in the first half of 2016. Gas prices paid by electricity producers were up $1 per million British thermal units or 39 percent in the first four months of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Power producers generated 349 Terawatt-hours of electricity from natural gas between January and April and used 2,611 billion cubic feet of gas in the process (“Electric Power Monthly”, EIA, June 2017). But gas-fired generation was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2016 while the volume of gas consumed fell by 14 percent (tmsnrt.rs/2tgvKac). By contrast, total electricity generation from all sources was down by less than 2 percent compared with the prior year. Coal-fired power plants were the main beneficiaries from higher gas prices, increasing their electricity generation by almost 7 percent. Coal-fired plants operated at an average of 49 percent of their maximum output between January and April compared with 44 percent in the same period in 2016. By contrast, gas-fired combined-cycle units operated at 48 percent of their maximum output, down from 53 percent in 2016. Adequate Stocks Higher gas prices seem to have arrested the slide in gas production, with output down by 4 percent compared with the previous year but showing signs of stabilizing. The ramp up in oil drilling since May 2016 in response to higher oil prices has also boosted associated gas output. Stabilizing gas output and reduced consumption by electricity generators has freed up gas for export while leaving inventories at comfortable levels. U.S. gas exports increased nearly 50 percent to 1,045 billion cubic feet in the first four months, while gas imports were up just 6 percent to 1,063 billion cubic feet. As a result, net imports shrank from 303 billion cubic feet in January-April 2016 to just 18 billion cubic feet in January-April 2017. Working gas stocks in underground storage stood at 2,816 billion cubic feet on June 23, which was 313 billion below 2016 but 183 billion above the five-year seasonal average. Storage injections have been broadly tracking the normal seasonal trajectory, especially once adjusted for the slightly warmer-than-average start to the cooling season. Weekly builds have been running a little below the five-year average but are higher than in 2016 once adjusted for airconditioning demand. For the time being, the market appears fairly balanced, with stocks neither excessive nor tight, and with front-month futures prices around $3 per million British thermal units.

The policy was passed in last week's cabinet session but only made public on Wednesday. Nigeria has for decades relied on its ample supplies of oil to power its economy. But despite having a wealth of crude, the vast majority was sent overseas for refining, and the country instead has had to import refined fuels at great expense. Nigeria has the world's ninth largest proven gas reserves, at 187 trillion cubic feet. A move to using gas could reduce the drain on foreign exchange that importing refined oil products requires. If coupled with infrastructure investment, Nigeria could also improve its creaking power grid, which forces many with no power or those plagued by frequent blackouts to operate costly generators. The 100-page National Gas Policy seeks to set up a single independent petroleum regulator. It also aims to separate upstream from midstream operations and to separate gas infrastructure ownership and operations from gas trading, the oil ministry said.  The policy will also divide the Nigeria Gas Company into separate transport and gas marketing companies and introduce  market-led wholesale gas pricing  after a transitional period.

BNPPF's Viability Rating (VR) has been affirmed at 'a'. In addition, Fitch has assigned 'A+(dcr)' Derivative Counterparty Ratings (DCRs) to BNPPF and BGL BNPP as part of its roll-out of DCRs to significant derivative counterparties in western Europe and the US. DCRs are issuer ratings and express Fitch's view of banks' relative vulnerability to default under derivative contracts with third-party, non-government counterparties. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, DCRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATINGS BNPPF's and BGL BNPP's ratings are equalised with the ratings of the banks' majority or ultimate shareholder BNP Paribas S.A. (BNPP, A+/Stable/F1). BNPPF is almost wholly-owned by BNPP while BGL BNPP's capital is 50%-owned by BNPPF and 16% by BNPP with the remainder owned by the State of Luxembourg, a consequence of the Fortis Bank bail-out in 2008. The Support Ratings of '1' reflect an extremely high probability of support from BNPP, if needed. Fitch views BNPPF and BGL BNPP as core to BNPP's strategy and franchise. The two banks are highly integrated within the parent bank, both in terms of operations and management, and we believe that BNPP's reputation would suffer were one of these subsidiaries to default. We also believe BNPP would have sufficient resources to recapitalise them to a level acceptable to regulators on a timely basis as and when required. Retail banking is BNPP's largest business in revenue and allocated equity, and the strong retail franchises of BNPPF and BGL BNPP in Belgium and Luxembourg underpin their status as core BNPP subsidiaries. Both banks benefit from large customer deposit bases, which strengthen the parent's funding base. Belgium and Luxembourg are defined by BNPP as part of its 'domestic' markets, along with France and Italy. Operations and management are highly integrated and key management positions are shared among BNPP, BNPPF and BGL BNPP. To optimise capital and liquidity allocation within the group, BNPPF and BGL BNPP consolidate part of BNPP's specialised lending (asset finance) and its leasing operations, respectively, further supporting Fitch's opinion that both entities are integral parts of the group. DCRs have been assigned to BNPPF and BGL BNPP due to their significant derivative activities.  The DCRs are at the same level as the Long-Term IDRs because under Belgian and Luxembourg legislations, derivative counterparties have no preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. VR - BNPPF BNPPF's VR reflects the bank's retail and corporate banking-focused business model, which generates adequate profitability and contributes to an overall moderate risk profile. The rating is also underpinned by sound capitalisation and healthy funding and liquidity. The consolidation of BNPP's leasing operations and fast-growing Turkish operation are of higher risk than the fairly low-risk Belgian and Luxembourg retail and corporate businesses. However, we believe this is manageable. The quality of the loan book remains resilient and loan impairment charges should continue to represent a low-to-moderate percentage of average loans. Fitch expects the bank to maintain sound capitalisation. BNPPF's fully loaded Basel III common equity ratio was 12.5% at end-2016. Following the acquisition of Arval from its parent in late 2016, BNPPF did not pay a dividend for 2016; however, we expect dividend payment to resume. BNPPF's capital ratios should be converging to the parent's levels, which target a ratio of 12% by 2020. Funding and liquidity remains robust, due to a strong retail deposit base, especially in Belgium where the bank has a market share of around 25%. Customer deposits represent the largest source of funding. Reliance on wholesale funding is limited, and the bank has strong market access from being part of BNPP. It runs a large liquidity buffer in the form of cash and repo-able securities, with a significant amount of high-quality sovereign bonds. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The rating of subordinated debt is notched down from BNPPF's Long-Term IDR, as opposed to the bank's VR, as Fitch believes parental support will neutralise BNPPF's non-performance risk in line with Fitch's rating criteria for such securities. The ratings of legacy upper Tier 2 debt issued by BNP Paribas Fortis Funding are rated at the same level as equivalent securities issued by BNPP. They are rated three notches below BNPP's VR, comprising one notch for loss severity and two for non-performance risk. Fitch has affirmed the rating of the CASHES hybrid capital (BE0933899800) at 'BBB-'. Fitch rates the CASHES hybrids under relevant insurance criteria (Insurance Rating Methodology (26 April 2017)) given that the cash coupon of the CASHES is linked to the declaration of a dividend by Ageas SA/NV (A/Stable), the ultimate holding company of the Ageas group, and in case a dividend is not declared the coupons will be settled non-cash via the issuance of new Ageas SA/NV shares using the alternative coupon satisfaction method (ACSM). Ageas SA/NV and BNPPF act as contractual co-obligors for these notes; however at the current rating level of the CASHES, there is no influence from BNPPF's ratings on these. The hybrids are rated four notches below Ageas SA/NV's IDR to reflect higher-than-average loss severity risk of these securities (two notches) as well as a higher risk of non-performance (an additional two notches). The rating of this instrument is the same as that of a hybrid instrument issued by Ageasfinlux, with similar terms and an ACSM dividend trigger (ISIN XS0147484074 and XS0147484314), and whose co-obligor is also Ageas SA/NV. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY BNP Paribas Fortis Funding is a wholly owned financing subsidiary of BNPPF and its debt ratings are aligned with those of BNPPF. This is based on Fitch's expectation that BNPPF will honour the unconditional and irrevocable guaranteed provided to holders of the notes issued by BNP Paribas Fortis Funding under its common euro medium term note programme with BNPPF. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, DCRS, SENIOR DEBT AND SUPPORT RATINGS The IDRs, DCRs and senior debt ratings of BNPPF and BGL BNPP are sensitive to a change in BNPP's IDRs. As such, the Stable Outlook on BNPPF's and BGL BNPP's Long-Term IDRs mirrors that on BNPP's. While not expected, the ratings would also be sensitive to a downgrade of the Support Rating arising from changes in Fitch's assessment of BNPP's propensity to provide timely support to BNPPF and BGL BNPP. VR - BNPPF BNPPF's VR would be sensitive to a material weakening in capitalisation, which could stem from a change in capital allocation within the BNPP group by up-streaming large amounts to the parent, or transferring a significant amount of assets to BNPPF. Worsening asset quality could also put pressure on the rating, particularly if capital would be materially affected. Upward pressure on BNPPF's VR is limited, but the VR could benefit from improved efficiency and higher capital ratios with liquidity maintained at high levels. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES BNPPF's subordinated debt ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect BNPPF's Long-Term IDR.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Renault and Brilliance, whose JinBei unit is already an established Chinese bus brand, have signed a framework deal to create a manufacturing and sales joint venture, the French carmaker said in a statement. The company, to be 51 percent-owned by Brilliance and 49 percent by Renault, will develop new Renault and JinBei vehicles, building on the Chinese brand's existing lineup and sales network, Renault said. The move will harness growth opportunities created by China's surge in e-commerce and tightening emissions standards, Renault commercial vehicles chief Ashwani Gupta told Reuters.

L1 Retail announced at the end of June it would buy Holland & Barrett from The Nature’s Bounty Co and The Caryle Group for £1.77bn. Citigroup, HSBC and UBS are arranging the debt financing, which is expected to launch for syndication to investors before the summer. The £800m term loan will be denominated in sterling and euros, the sources said. The overall debt size will be higher and could be closer to £1bn-equivalent, as it will also include undrawn loans such as a revolving credit facility, the sources said. L1 Retail was not immediately available to comment. Summer Sale Arranging banks generally try to avoid launching loans in the summer period as investors head to the beach, but with Holland & Barrett there is a belief that there are strong advantages to launching now rather than waiting until September. First, the European leveraged loan market is very receptive as investors are eager for new paper after a large number of repricings and refinancings. There is less risk launching the deal now rather than holding the syndication risk on balance sheets and launching into unknown market conditions in September. Also, as a new credit to the market, Holland & Barrett will require more research by investors, which means it is expected to take more time than a known name. They will also have to carry out due diligence on the owner, as it is not owned by a well-known private equity house, the sources said. Banks will be keen to launch any new deal that requires more work before a number of potential large deals in the works gain investor attention such as a €3.175bn financing for German drugmaker Stada and a €2.5-€3bn financing for a possible sale of German metering and energy management group Ista. “It doesn’t surprise me Holland & Barrett will come to the market before the summer. Given the ownership and the fact it is a new deal, it will want to tail off a hot market, rather than restart the market in September,” an investor said. Private equity firm Carlyle acquired Nature's Bounty, including Holland & Barrett, in 2010 for US$3.8bn. Reuters reported in January that Carlyle had hired Goldman Sachs to help it sell Nature's Bounty, but that it may opt to sell Holland & Barrett separately. Originally founded in 1870, Holland & Barrett has grown to become Europe’s largest health and wellness retail chain with 1,300 shops in 16 countries.

Cheaper Chinese rivals have ousted Ericsson as the biggest player in the mobile equipment market while its attempt to boost revenues by broadening its client base to include utilities, transport firms and media companies has been an expensive failure. Ericsson has drafted in a new CEO, but corporate activist investor Cevian Capital, led by Christer Gardell, recently bought a more than 5 percent stake and has been pushing for further change.  It is not unreasonable to believe he (Gardell) has pushed Johansson out,  said a fund manager with an investment in Ericsson but who declined to be named.   The company needs change and Johansson is not the man for change.  Shares in Ericsson were up 1.1 percent at 0854 GMT, easily outperforming Stockholm's blue-chip index. Johansson, who is 65, gave few clues as to why he had chosen to step down, saying only the company had a new strategy and a new shareholder structure.   It is natural to let the owners jointly propose a chairman and well ahead of this I want to announce that I will not be available for a next term,  he said in a statement. FILE PHOTO: A general view of an office of Swedish telecom giant Ericsson is seen in Lund, Sweden, September 18, 2014.Stig-Ake Jonsson/TT News Agency/File PhotoGardell could not immediately be reached for comment.  Ericsson has been struggling for years, hit by a drop in spending by telecoms firms, growing competition from China's Huawei and a resurgent Nokia. The global downturn and weak emerging markets have added to its difficulties.  Swingeing cost cuts failed to turn things around and the firm fired its long-time CEO Hans Vestberg last summer as the patience of top shareholders such as Investor and Industrivarden ran out. Ericsson's shares have lost almost half their value in the last two years and the company reported an operating loss of 12.3 billion Swedish crowns ($1.45 billion) in the first quarter as a result of writedowns and restructuring costs, its second quarterly loss in a row.  New CEO Borje Ekholm has promised to refocus the group on core network equipment sales. But some shareholders have questioned the appointment as CEO of an insider who had sat on the board for years while Ericsson's star waned.  Johansson, a former CEO of tuck-maker Volvo has been chairman since 2011 and has also been seen by some as part of Ericsson's past, not its future. Cevian, which has previously pushed for value-creating structural changes at blue-chips such as truck maker Volvo and lender Swedbank, has said it supports Ekholm's strategy but has questioned his ability to carry it out.

A gradual rise in short-dated U.S. government bond yields since early June hasn't been matched by a rise in the currency with a trade-weighted basket of the dollar against its peers moving sideways since then. Market strategists believe this week may mark a breakout in the dollar's trend if the data surprises on the upside.  This should be the dollar's moment,  said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale in London.  If the data is good, we should see the dollar catch up with the rise in bond yields.  The dollar hopped 0.3 percent higher to trade at 113.59 yen , its highest level in nearly two months. Against the euro , the greenback was broadly flat at $1.13530.  It may not be only the Fed providing the USD with a lift. June labour market data starting with the release of the ADP report tomorrow, completed by Friday’s NFP (non-farm payrolls), could start turning the U.S. surprise indicator around,  Morgan Stanley strategists said in a note. Unwinding of short dollar positions was also evident against the euro with the single currency slipping 0.2 percent to a one-week low of 1.13230. An early boost to the Japanese yen from safe-haven bids after Pyongyang said on Wednesday it had conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can carry a large and heavy nuclear warhead quickly faded. In other currencies, sterling languished at one-week lows on Wednesday as a tepid reading of Britain's services sector added to further evidence of growing headwinds to the economy. Sterling extended a dip below $1.29 after the data was released, falling as much as 0.3 percent lower to $1.2894. . The Canadian dollar edged lower, trading at C$1.2955 per dollar after having hit a 10-month high of C$1.2912 to the dollar on Tuesday.

Sweden's centre-left government is trying to come good on a promise to limit the profits that private companies can make for providing welfare services paid for by taxpayers. Public Administration Minister Ardalan Shekarabi denied media reports that negotiations with the Left Party had collapsed and said the government is still trying to ensure that taxpayers' money was used in the way  they are intended .  That requires a limit to the profits in the welfare sector, but we are pragmatic about the way to achieve this,  he told Reuters.  We are open to talks with the centre-right opposition  on the subject, he added. Among other solutions discussed previously are stricter quality controls of the companies services, owner requirements in order to ensure long-time ownership, and better transparency. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven had said earlier this year his government would push ahead with a profit cap proposed by a state commission. It would limit operating profit of tax-funded welfare firms to seven percent plus risk-free rate of their working capital. The commission proposal was widely criticised and the centre-right opposition has vowed to vote against any such proposal in parliament. Sweden has deregulated much of its health and education sector since the 1990s, but many Swedes are now worried that public services have deteriorated and that taxpayers are directly funding shareholder payouts by businesses. The private welfare companies have said that the focus should be on the quality of the service they provide, not the size of their profits.

The company said on Sunday  Honour of Kings  players below 12 years of age would be limited to one hour of play time each day, while those aged 12 to 18 years would be limited to two hours a day, responding to concerns from teachers and parents that some children were addicted to the game.   Shares of Tencent, China's biggest gaming and social media firm by revenue, fell nearly 4 percent this week up to the close of trade on Tuesday, wiping some $12 billion off its market value. The stock was up more than 1 percent on Wednesday, reversing earlier losses, and compared with a flat broader market. It is up more than 40 percent this year.  China's communist party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, has also criticized Tencent twice this week, describing the  Honour of Kings  game as poison and calling for tighter regulatory controls of online games, which further weighed on its shares.  (Those) under 12 years old constitute a small proportion of our total user base and a smaller percentage of our paying user base. We do not expect these measures will have a material impact on our overall financial results,  Tencent said in an email response to a Reuters request for comment.  Tencent also said it would step up the requirement of real-name registration for all users and upgrade a parental-control platform rolled out earlier this year that makes it easier for parents to monitor their children's gaming account activities. It was not immediately clear if Tencent, which has a portfolio of over 200 games, can effectively impose the play-time restrictions or how easy it will be for players to skirt the measures.  Chinese gaming industry database CNG estimates  Honour of Kings  raked in revenue of more than 5.5 billion yuan ($810.47 million) in the first quarter, accounting for nearly half of Tencent's smartphone games revenue of 12.9 billion yuan in the period. A child plays the game  Honour of Kings  by Tencent at home in Dezhou, Shandong province, China July 2, 2017.StringerTencent, one of Asia's most valuable firms with a market value of HK$2.6 trillion ($333 billion), has spread its tentacles into nearly every facet of Chinese life, making it vulnerable to any regulatory measures imposed by Beijing at a  time of growing political risk in China.  Chinese regulators have launched a sweeping crackdown on what it deems inappropriate content on the internet, including closing celebrity gossip websites and restricting what people can post, forcing individuals and companies to walk a fine line to address government concerns.  The popularity of  Honour of Kings  has prompted scores of complaints from teachers and parents worried that children are becoming addicted to the game, for which half of users are below 24 years of age, according to Chinese mobile data firm Jiguang. A wider or more heavy-handed crackdown by authorities on the online gaming sector could pose significant challenges for China's tech champions.  The question now is whether public criticism will be followed up with state regulation of the thriving online gaming market in China,  said Paul Haswell, a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, who specializes in technology.  Seeing that market so effectively shut down, either by public criticism or state intervention, is a big shock to China's gaming industry.  In its commentaries, the People's Daily cited examples of addiction where teenagers had stolen money to spend on game features and also a case of alleged suicide.  Honour of Kings, a fantasy multiplayer role-playing battle game, is the most popular mobile game in China with around 55 million daily active users, more than Pokemon Go at its peak.

The world's oldest bank said on Wednesday it expected a net profit of more than 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2021, from a loss of 3.2 billion euros last year, as part of a restructuring plan approved by European authorities.   It's a conservative plan. We're not shooting at unrealistic targets,  Chief Executive Marco Morelli told analysts on a conference call to present the new plan.  Morelli said no mergers were planned at the moment.  There is no Plan B on the table,  he said. Burdened by bad loans and a mismanagement scandal, Monte dei Paschi has for years been at the forefront of Italy's slow-brewing banking crisis. Italy's fourth-largest lender was forced to request state aid in December after its attempt to raise capital from private investors failed.  On Tuesday the European Union approved a 5.4 billion euro state bailout after it agreed to a drastic overhaul in a move that will leave Rome holding around 70 percent of the bank. EU officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Italy would have to exit the bank at the latest by the end of the 5-year plan.  What we experienced in the last nine months is pretty much unheard of: It's like an ER department with an emergency every five minutes,  Morelli said. Italy has pledged more than 20 billion euros of taxpayer money in the space of a week to rescue three of its banks, but the country's wider financial sector is still weighed down by around 300 billion euros of non-performing loans (NPLs). At the end of last month, Rome committed up to 17 billion euros to rescue regional banks Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca though it said the final bill would be much lower, adding the state might even turn a profit from the bailouts.  FILE PHOTO: The entrance of Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank's headquarters is seen in Siena, Italy, July 1, 2016.Stefano Rellandini/File Photo The Monte Paschi plan looks good but we need to see execution. Still, coming after the Veneto rescues it settles nerves about Italy's banking system,  said Zenit fund manager Stefano Fabiani. Path to Profit In its 2017-2021 plan, Monte dei Paschi sees a headcount reduction of around 5,500 to just over 20,000 and a fall in the number of branches to around 1,400 from some 2,000 in 2016 as it seeks to ensure the lender is profitable in the long term. It expects to reach a return on equity of more than 10 percent in 2021 while its CET1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, is seen at 14.7 percent from 8.2 percent in 2016.  Crucially, the bank will sell 28.6 billion euros of gross bad loans, of which 26.1 billion will be securitized through a transfer to a privately funded vehicle on market terms, with the operation partially funded by bank rescue fund Atlante II. The bank said it would sell securitized notes to Atlante II at 21 cents on the euro.  We are in line if not slightly above recent market transactions,  Morelli said. The CEO, who expects the bank's shares to relist in the second half of September, said 5.5 billion euros in deposits were recovered in the first quarter, adding liquidity was no longer an issue.  The bank managed to stay alive,  he said, referring to the close shadowing of the lender by European authorities.  We negotiated the plan with the EU Commission line by line.   Rome is under the spotlight for taking advantage of exceptions in EU rules designed to stop the use of taxpayer money to deal with bank crises. Policymakers now want Italy to come up with a solution for tackling NPLs without requiring any more government money to prop up its beleaguered banking sector. European Central Bank vice president Vitor Constancio said on Wednesday there needed to be swift action to establish a stronger secondary market in Europe for non-performing loans and policy changes to incentivise banks, investors and the authorities to tackle the issue more effectively.  Partial solutions and further delays are not options if we want to tackle the problem of NPLs  he wrote in Italy's main business newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.

The military government, which has ruled since a 2014 coup, has invoked Article 44, a security order that gives it power to push through policy, to delay the law that imposes heavy fines on employers and employees who do not have work permits, a senior official said. The original decree was issued in part to tackle human trafficking concerns raised by the international community, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam told reporters.  The government had to issue this law because we are being watched by the foreign community in terms of ... human trafficking. If we don't issue this law they will not buy our goods. So we have to do it,  Wissanu said. The U.S. State Department last month left Thailand on a Tier 2 Watchlist, just above the lowest ranking of Tier 3, in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report because it did not  do enough to tackle human smuggling and trafficking. Wissanu said the government would delay implementation of four sections of the law for six months. He did not elaborate but the labor ministry said it would suspend parts of the law until January in order to give both workers and their employers more time to get their work permits. Thailand is a destination for many migrant workers from poorer neighboring countries, including Myanmar and Cambodia. Official estimates put the number of foreign workers at 3 million but rights groups say the real figure is far higher. Many work in Thailand without legal documents, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by brokers and sometimes traffickers. 'Work No Thai Wants' A Myanmar migrant worker rest outside his house near a wholesale market for shrim and other seafood in Mahachai, in Samut Sakhon province, Thailand, July 4, 2017.Chaiwat SubprasomMyanmar said that on Monday, it received more than 5,000 workers returning from Thailand across their border.  Most of the workers went directly back to their home towns. We help them with the transport,  said Aung Htay Win, a Myanmar labor ministry official. Migrants are predominately employed in low-skilled jobs in Thailand's multi-billion dollar fishing sector, in agriculture, construction, manufacturing and as domestic workers. Businesses have complained that the new regulations have caused a shortage of workers in the construction and fishing sectors. Slideshow (3 Images)Property development and construction, which have had a stellar performance in an otherwise sluggish Thai economy, have felt the brunt of the departures.  We lost 75 percent of our workers overnight,  an executive at a Bangkok construction firm, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. In the fishing port of Mahachai, south of Bangkok and home to a many migrants from Myanmar, workers and business people said they were worried. A Myanmar worker who identified himself as Kway, 36, said he had a work permit but his wife and young child did not have proper papers.  I sent my wife and child back to Myanmar because I am not sure what will happen to them , he said. Other residents said they feared the economic impact.  The fishing businesses needs a large labor force and it is work that no Thai wants to do so I don't know why the government has introduced this new legislation,  said Ton, 46, a shrimp vendor.  Many people are afraid to come out of their homes,  said the manager of a grocery shop.

Unadjusted prices fell by 1.6 percent in June from May. On a year-on-year basis prices rose by 6.3 percent in June, below the 8.3 percent seen in May and down from 13 percent seen as late as February, Real Estate Norway (REN) said. Tighter mortgage regulations, lower population growth and a boom in construction, flooding the market with new homes, have all contributed to the recent market turnaround. The association now believes the average price of a Norwegian home will grow by 5-6 percent in 2017, below a forecast made last December of a 9-11 percent increase, it added.  We expect a nearly flat market throughout the (rest of the) year, with a small decline in nationwide prices,  REN Chief Executive Christian Dreyer told reporters. There were big regional differences, with the capital Oslo recording the most abrupt decline of 3.1 percent in June alone. Dreyer said prices in Oslo will likely continue to fall, albeit at a slower pace. He blamed the abrupt change in sentiment on a tightening of mortgage regulations by authorities, which took effect at the start of 2017 and are stricter for Oslo than the rest of the country.  There's no drama in this, following a rise of 40 percent in the previous two years (combined) in Oslo. Uncertainty is big due to more housing starts ... but the Norwegian economy is doing well,  Dreyer added. A decline in housing prices will likely contribute to keeping the central bank's key policy interest rate at record lows, most economists say.  We must however see a lasting and widespread downturn before (the central bank) starts to fear the negative effects from the housing market on growth and consequently before it affects rates significantly , Nordea economist Erik Bruce wrote in a note to clients.

A survey published on Wednesday suggested Britain's economy probably expanded at a quarterly pace of 0.4 percent in April-June. But its business expectations component tumbled to levels not seen since just after the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.  The euro zone's economy, meanwhile, probably grew nearly twice as fast, by 0.7 percent, during the second quarter. Business expectations dipped, but remained strong.  This shouldn't come as a surprise,  said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank of the British findings.  The UK is suffering the fallout from the Brexit (vote) of last year ... and has clearly moved onto a slower growth path.  Disappointingly for some Bank of England officials who want to raise interest rates, IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index showed business expectations not far off the lows last reached in late 2011, with growth in new orders, which tend to signal future activity, at a nine-month low.   Following on from weaker manufacturing and construction surveys, the softer services PMI points to an already-fragile economy faltering in June as heightened political and Brexit uncertainties fuel business and consumer caution,  said Howard Archer at EY ITEM Club. British Prime Minister Theresa May gambled away her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June and so far there has been little clarity as to how the Brexit negotiations will proceed. In contrast, across the euro zone backlogs of work increased as new business during June came in at the second-fastest rate in over six years.  Suggesting businesses in the bloc's dominant services industry remained confident, they sped up hiring last month, taking on staff at the second fastest rate since early 2008. In other upbeat news for policymakers at the European Central Bank, retail sales increased by more than expected in May, European statistics office Eurostat said on Wednesday. Two Paths Britain's economy barely grew in the first three months of the year as consumers faced both accelerating inflation, caused in large part by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, and slowing wage growth. Some BoE officials say the consumer drag on the economy is likely to be offset by higher exports and investment. Last month, three of the Bank's eight monetary policymakers voted for a rate increase, although one of them has since left the BoE.     But the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI edged down to a four-month low of 53.4 in June from 53.8 in May, just shy of a forecast for 53.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.  This weaker reading pours a degree of a cold water on the latest hawkish messages emanating from the Bank of England,  said James Smith at ING. The final composite PMI for the euro zone, seen as a good growth indicator, was 56.3 in June, down from May's 56.8 but comfortably beating a flash estimate of 55.7 and well into growth levels above 50. Earlier PMIs from the bloc's big four economies of Germany, France, Spain and Italy showed faster growth in the second quarter as a whole. Britain's potential for being out of step can also be seen in monetary policy. While the BoE is -- largely -- not expected to tinker with monetary policy anytime soon, the U.S. Federal Reserve is forecast to raise interest rates once more this year and European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi last week raised the prospect of policy-tightening.

Sterling dipped after Wednesday's Markit/CIPS survey showed growth across British services companies fell to a four-month low in June. Although the survey suggested the economy recovered some speed in the second quarter and probably expanded at a quarterly pace of around 0.4 percent, double the pace of the weak first quarter, there were some ominous signals in the PMI's forward-looking gauges. Business expectations sank to their weakest level since last July's dip after the vote to leave the European Union, and it was not far off lows last reached in late 2011. Growth in new orders hit a nine-month low. The headline index edged down to a four-month low of 53.4 in June from 53.8 in May, just shy of a forecast for 53.5 in a Reuters poll of economists. On Tuesday BoE rate-setter Michael Saunders said he was  reasonably confident  that lower consumer spending will be offset by higher exports and investment, justifying his vote to raise interest rates from a record low 0.25 percent.  But the latest PMI survey pours some cold water on that hypothesis,  said JPMorgan economist Allan Monks.  Indeed, it is worth highlighting that the weakness in the UK PMI comes at a time when the broader European PMIs have strengthened considerably.  The mood among services firms was probably hit by uncertainty after June's election, in which Prime Minister Theresa May gambled away her parliamentary majority, and by  Brexit talks, as well as the economic outlook, IHS Markit said. A third monthly drop in car sales in June -- albeit from recent record highs -- underlined the slowdown among consumers. Separate official data showed productivity, arguably Britain's biggest economic problem over the last decade, fell in the first three months of the year -- the first decline since late 2015. The latest productivity data further complicates the outlook for BoE policymakers. Although weak productivity reduces the scope for future wage growth, it goes hand-in-hand with higher inflation.  Unless more is done to tackle the nation's low productivity, people's wages and living standards will continue to fall and the UK will be ill-equipped to compete once we do leave the EU,  said Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.

Martua Sitorus and Peter Sondakh, two of Indonesia's richest men, were in advanced discussions with FGV and its controlling shareholder, Malaysian state-owned palm planter Federal Land Development Authority (Felda), to buy the equity stakes, the sources said.  But the talks have ground to a halt following a boardroom tussle and corruption claims at FGV that led to the CEO's suspension and the resignation of its chairman last month, the sources said on Wednesday.  It's clear when you have the two top executives of a public listed company suspended, surely you wouldn't move beyond its daily operations,  said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. It was not immediately clear if or when talks on the stake sale will resume and if or when the CEO's suspension would end.    A deal could have boosted FGV's finances and given it a chance to reverse at least some of the 70 percent declines seen in its share price since its IPO in 2012. The stalling of the potential deal is a setback for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak who is racing against time to appease FGV's shareholders - a key vote base - before general elections that could be called as early as this year.  FGV's shareholders - a chunk of whom are small landholders called settlers - have been hit hard by the share drop, worsening financial performance of Felda and FGV and delayed payments. An FGV spokesman said the company cannot comment on the matter. Sitorus' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Satrio Tjai, managing director of Sondakh's Rajawali Group, said he had not heard about these discussions. The sources did not want to be named as they were not authorized to talk to the media. Details of Plan Sitorus is the co-founder of Singapore-listed Wilmar International (WLIL.SI), the world's largest palm oil processor, while Sondakh controls plantation-to-mining conglomerate Rajawali. Under the planned deal, FGV would first take over Indonesian palm plantation assets of Sitorus and Sondakh and pay for it through significant stakes in the enlarged FGV, the sources said.  Felda and Sitorus would hold about 25-30 percent each while Sondakh would own 16 percent. Felda would also take back the Malaysian land it had leased to FGV before the latter's IPO in 2012, paying about 4 billion ringgit ($931.53 million) in cash, one of the sources said. Eventually Sitorus will helm FGV, which at the completion of the deal would be a company with mostly Indonesian assets.  FGV would essentially be upstream Indonesian assets,  said a banking source familiar with the discussions. According to the first source, the company is also open to others who may be interested in an FGV stake.  Sondakh, who has long-standing ties to Prime Minister Najib, had tried to sell to FGV a stake in his palm oil firm PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk (BWPT.JK) in June 2015, but the plan was scrapped after FGV shareholders blasted the deal as too expensive. The Eagle High stake was eventually bought by another unit of Felda last year at a 95 percent premium. Najib is keen to fix FGV, whose problems are hurting his image among key Malay voters. The settlers' communities account for nearly a quarter of all parliamentary seats.  By conservative estimates, UMNO could lose at least 5 seats in Felda constituencies... A bigger UMNO loss - up to 10 seats - is entirely probable,  said Gavin Browning, a Singapore-based analyst with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, referring to Najib's United Malays National Organisation party.

Analysts say the case could have ramifications across the Islamic finance industry, with any decision against the creditors potentially undermining confidence in Islamic bonds. Dana Gas argues that because of changes in Islamic financial instruments and how they are interpreted, its sukuk are no longer sharia-compliant, and have become unlawful and unenforceable in the United Arab Emirates. The company says it is therefore halting payments on the mudaraba-style sukuk and proposing its creditors exchange them for new Islamic bonds with lower profit distributions. In mid-June, Dana Gas said it had obtained an interim injunction from London's High Court blocking holders of the sukuk, which are due to mature in October, from enforcing claims against the company related to the bonds. Deutsche Bank, representing the sukuk holders, told the High Court on Tuesday the injunction should be set aside, according to legal documents presented to the court and seen by Reuters. Deutsche Bank told the court Dana's case was  hopeless as a matter of law,  arguing that asserting the sukuk were illegal was an  event of default  allowing the sukuk holders to demand repayment, the documents show. Dana's actions  have sent shockwaves around the market for Islamic bonds  because they could erode trust in other sukuk issues, Deutsche Bank said. The judge did not reach a conclusion on Tuesday, and has asked Dana and the other parties to return to the court on Wednesday, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Martinez hopes his new-found hot streak continues as the Detroit Tigers vie for an interleague series victory on Wednesday when they face the Giants at Comerica Park. Martinez belted a solo homer in the second inning and added an RBI single in the fourth of Tuesday's 5-3 victory, improving upon a 2-for-20 stretch following his return from a bout with an irregular heartbeat.

The 26-year-old didn't help his cause with a pair of throwing errors, however, setting the stage for a pair of unearned runs.  This game's about picking each other up,  Blach said of his last outing.  That's what we did in this series. Everybody contributed.  Norris yielded five earned runs for the second straight outing last Wednesday and surrendered two homers in 3 2/3 innings of an 8-2 loss to Kansas City. The 24-year-old admitted to thinking too much while he was on the mound, with Tigers manager Brad Ausmus electing to give him an extra day's rest as a result.  Trust your stuff, that's been preached to him for two years,  Ausmus said.  He wants to be so good so fast. We've always kind of told him, 'Hey, get out of your own way, You can be really good.

Sterling dipped after Wednesday's Markit/CIPS survey showed growth across British services companies fell to a four-month low in June. Although the survey suggested the economy recovered some speed in the second quarter and probably expanded at a quarterly pace of around 0.4 percent, double the pace of the weak first quarter, there were some ominous signals in the PMI's forward-looking gauges. Business expectations sank to their weakest level since last July's dip after the vote to leave the European Union, and it was not far off lows last reached in late 2011. Growth in new orders hit a nine-month low. The headline index edged down to a four-month low of 53.4 in June from 53.8 in May, just shy of a forecast for 53.5 in a Reuters poll of economists. On Tuesday BoE rate-setter Michael Saunders said he was  reasonably confident  that lower consumer spending will be offset by higher exports and investment, justifying his vote to raise interest rates from a record low 0.25 percent.  But the latest PMI survey pours some cold water on that hypothesis,  said JPMorgan economist Allan Monks.  Indeed, it is worth highlighting that the weakness in the UK PMI comes at a time when the broader European PMIs have strengthened considerably.  The mood among services firms was probably hit by uncertainty after June's election, in which Prime Minister Theresa May gambled away her parliamentary majority, and by  Brexit talks, as well as the economic outlook, IHS Markit said. A third monthly drop in car sales in June -- albeit from recent record highs -- underlined the slowdown among consumers. Separate official data showed productivity, arguably Britain's biggest economic problem over the last decade, fell in the first three months of the year -- the first decline since late 2015. The latest productivity data further complicates the outlook for BoE policymakers. Although weak productivity reduces the scope for future wage growth, it goes hand-in-hand with higher inflation.  Unless more is done to tackle the nation's low productivity, people's wages and living standards will continue to fall and the UK will be ill-equipped to compete once we do leave the EU,  said Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.

As of Jan. 1, the number of Japanese people fell by a record 308,084 from a year earlier to 125,583,658, marking the eighth consecutive year of declines, government data showed Wednesday. The number of births fell 2.9 percent from the previous year ago to 981,202, the lowest since comparable data became available in 1974. People aged 65 or older accounted for 27.2 percent of the total population, the highest ratio on record, while the ratio of those aged 14 or younger fell to a record low of 12.7 percent, the data showed. The number of registered foreign residents increased to 2,323,428, up 6.9 percent from a year earlier, according to the data. Japan has long been reluctant to open up to immigration. Many Japanese pride themselves on what they see as their cultural and ethnic homogeneity, even as the population ages and its workforce shrinks. But recently, the government has been increasing its efforts to attract students and high-skilled workers from overseas. The overall population, which combines both Japanese and resident foreigners, fell 0.1 percent from a year ago to 127,907,086, the data showed.

Martua Sitorus and Peter Sondakh, two of Indonesia's richest men, were in advanced discussions with FGV and its controlling shareholder, Malaysian state-owned palm planter Federal Land Development Authority (Felda), to buy the equity stakes, the sources said.  But the talks have ground to a halt following a boardroom tussle and corruption claims at FGV that led to the CEO's suspension and the resignation of its chairman last month, the sources said on Wednesday.  It's clear when you have the two top executives of a public listed company suspended, surely you wouldn't move beyond its daily operations,  said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. It was not immediately clear if or when talks on the stake sale will resume and if or when the CEO's suspension would end.    A deal could have boosted FGV's finances and given it a chance to reverse at least some of the 70 percent declines seen in its share price since its IPO in 2012. The stalling of the potential deal is a setback for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak who is racing against time to appease FGV's shareholders - a key vote base - before general elections that could be called as early as this year.  FGV's shareholders - a chunk of whom are small landholders called settlers - have been hit hard by the share drop, worsening financial performance of Felda and FGV and delayed payments. An FGV spokesman said the company cannot comment on the matter. Sitorus' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Satrio Tjai, managing director of Sondakh's Rajawali Group, said he had not heard about these discussions. The sources did not want to be named as they were not authorized to talk to the media. Details of Plan Sitorus is the co-founder of Singapore-listed Wilmar International (WLIL.SI), the world's largest palm oil processor, while Sondakh controls plantation-to-mining conglomerate Rajawali. Under the planned deal, FGV would first take over Indonesian palm plantation assets of Sitorus and Sondakh and pay for it through significant stakes in the enlarged FGV, the sources said.  Felda and Sitorus would hold about 25-30 percent each while Sondakh would own 16 percent. Felda would also take back the Malaysian land it had leased to FGV before the latter's IPO in 2012, paying about 4 billion ringgit ($931.53 million) in cash, one of the sources said. Eventually Sitorus will helm FGV, which at the completion of the deal would be a company with mostly Indonesian assets.  FGV would essentially be upstream Indonesian assets,  said a banking source familiar with the discussions. According to the first source, the company is also open to others who may be interested in an FGV stake.  Sondakh, who has long-standing ties to Prime Minister Najib, had tried to sell to FGV a stake in his palm oil firm PT Eagle High Plantations Tbk (BWPT.JK) in June 2015, but the plan was scrapped after FGV shareholders blasted the deal as too expensive. The Eagle High stake was eventually bought by another unit of Felda last year at a 95 percent premium. Najib is keen to fix FGV, whose problems are hurting his image among key Malay voters. The settlers' communities account for nearly a quarter of all parliamentary seats.  By conservative estimates, UMNO could lose at least 5 seats in Felda constituencies... A bigger UMNO loss - up to 10 seats - is entirely probable,  said Gavin Browning, a Singapore-based analyst with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, referring to Najib's United Malays National Organisation party.

A billionaire with links to China's Communist Party elite, Xiao vanished earlier this year. He was last seen in the early hours of Jan. 27, leaving the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong in a wheelchair with his head covered, accompanied by several people described in media reports as mainland Chinese agents. Xiao's whereabouts are not known but his dramatic disappearance sparked widespread speculation he had been caught up in Chinese President Xi Jinping's crackdown on corruption. Chinese authorities have not commented on Xiao's disappearance, and his family could not be reached for comment. Two of the sources with knowledge of the process said that now Chinese authorities are  pressing Tomorrow Holdings, Xiao's conglomerate, to pare back its sprawling asset portfolio, which includes stakes in more than 30 domestic financial institutions.  The sale is part of Beijing's broader efforts to rein in risky practices by financial services firms, the sources said. None of the three sources could be named as the sale plans are not public. The same two sources said Tomorrow had set up an internal team to handle the sale, which will include stakes in Huaxia Life Insurance, New China Trust Co, Bank of Weifang and Baoshang Bank. The stakes are substantial, though the specific percentage levels have not been disclosed and it is unclear if Tomorrow controls all of the companies directly. No external advisers have been mandated, the sources said, and they also did not give any indication of expected prices for individual assets.  The process is at an early stage and informal feelers are being sent to some large insurers as well as private equity companies,  said a fourth person with knowledge of the plans. According to one source with direct knowledge of the situation, Xiao's wife Zhou Hongwen, who co-founded Tomorrow with him in 1999, is running the business in his absence, but it was unclear how much she was involved in the decision to put the assets up for sale and whether she is closely involved in the process. Tomorrow and the four subsidiaries did not return phone calls, emails and messages seeking comment. China's insurance and banking regulators did not respond to requests for comment. The State Council's information office also did not respond to a request for comment. Insurance Play FILE PHOTO: People pass by the entrance to Four Seasons Hotel, where Chinese billionaire Xiao Jianhua was last seen on January 27, in Hong Kong, China February 1, 2017.Bobby Yip/File PhotoBeijing has cracked down on other groups that, like Tomorrow, have used cash from insurance products to invest aggressively in riskier deals in areas such as property and soccer. Last month, authorities detained Wu Xiaohui, chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, one of China's flashiest overseas dealmakers and owner of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. Anbang has said its chairman is temporarily unable to fulfill his duties and has not commented further. Even a partial dismantling of Tomorrow's business empire, though, would take the aggressive government behavior a step further than previous warnings or punishments, and raise concerns for other tycoons and their companies. Xiao, who is in his mid-40s and has close ties with some of China's senior leaders and their families, was ranked 32nd on the 2016 Hurun China rich list, China's equivalent of the Forbes list, with a net worth of $6 billion. His assets range from financial services to sugar and cement. Xiao, who began his career selling imported computers, had lived for years in serviced apartments in Hong Kong. Tomorrow's Huaxia Life grabbed headlines last year as China's financial regulators cracked down on high-yield, short-term investment products like universal life insurance products, that are part insurance, part investment. Huaxia's universal life insurance division recorded 138 billion yuan ($20.3 billion) in premium income last year - 75 percent of its total business, official data shows. In December, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission suspended the firm's online insurance business and barred it from seeking approval for new products for three months. The regulator said the insurer had failed to fix problems concerning fake client information.  The fourth source said the insurance watchdog had demanded better oversight, but did not feel Huaxia had made progress and wanted to see it owned by someone other than Tomorrow. Barclays (BARC.L) bought a near-20 percent stake in another Tomorrow firm, New China Trust a decade ago, making it the first foreign bank to invest in a Chinese trust firm. Trusts are non-bank lenders that raise funds with high-yielding investments. Barclays' stake has since been diluted to below 6 percent. One of the sources said Barclays would sell part or all of its remaining shares. Barclays declined to comment on its stake. Tomorrow will keep hold of affiliates including Harbin Bank (6138.HK), which lends to small businesses, brokerage Hengtai Securities (1476.HK) and Tianan Life Insurance, maintaining licenses in the main financial sectors, the people said.  The affiliates did not respond to requests for comment.

The meeting, due to be held on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg on Friday, will be closely watched at a time when ties between the two countries remain strained by U.S. allegations of Russian election hacking, Syria, Ukraine and a U.S. row over Trump associates' links to Moscow.  This is the first meeting, the first time the two presidents will get acquainted - this is the main thing about it,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  The expectation is that a working dialogue will be established, which is vitally important for the entire world when it comes to increasing the efficiency of resolving a critical mass of conflicts.  The meeting would explore whether there was a chance and a  readiness for the two countries to fight international terrorism together in Syria, Peskov said, saying Putin would explain Moscow's stance on the conflicts in both Syria and Ukraine.    But Peskov said the meeting's brief format meant the Russian leader might not have enough time to give a full analysis of what Moscow regarded as the causes of the Ukraine crisis. Three years after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and a  pro-Russian separatist uprising broke out in eastern Ukraine, there is little sign of a peaceful solution in the east despite a ceasefire agreement signed in February 2015 in Minsk, Belarus. Those accords were signed by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine. Kiev accuses Moscow of actively supporting the pro-Russian separatists. Russia denies the charge.  The meeting with Trump would  be a good chance to reiterate Russia's stance that the Minsk accords have no alternative, that the Minsk accords must be implemented, and that measures must be taken to stop provocations which unfortunately Ukraine's armed forces are still carrying out,  Peskov said.

Wealth breeds cybercrime, but it does not automatically generate cybersecurity, so governments need to make sure they are prepared, the survey by the U.N. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) said.   There is still an evident gap between countries in terms of awareness, understanding, knowledge and finally capacity to deploy the proper strategies, capabilities and programmes,  the survey said.  The United States came second in the ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index, but many of the other highly rated countries were small or developing economies. The rest of the top 10 were Malaysia, Oman, Estonia, Mauritius, Australia, Georgia, France and Canada. Russia ranked 11th. India was 25th, one place ahead of Germany, and China was 34th. The ranking was based on countries' legal, technical and organizational institutions, their educational and research capabilities, and their cooperation in information-sharing networks.  Cybersecurity is an ecosystem where laws, organizations, skills, cooperation and technical implementation need to be in harmony to be most effective,  the survey said.   The degree of interconnectivity of networks implies that anything and everything can be exposed, and everything from national critical infrastructure to our basic human rights can be compromised.   The crucial first step was to adopt a national security strategy, but 50 percent of countries have none, the survey said.  Among the countries that ranked higher than their economic development was 57th-placed North Korea, which was let down by its  cooperation  score but still ranked three spots ahead of much-richer Spain. The smallest rich countries also scored badly - Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino were all well down the second half of the table. The Vatican ranked 186th out of 195 countries in the survey. But no country did worse than Equatorial Guinea, which scored zero.

The proportion of stocks on the main U.S. benchmark equity index now managed passively has nearly doubled since the 2008 crisis to 37 percent while ETF trading accounts for about a quarter of the daily volume across U.S. exchanges, BofA-ML, said. ETFs and index-tracking funds offer investors a cheaper way to access financial markets than their  active  fund management peers which aim to beat the benchmark and charge higher fees for doing so. Steadily rising U.S. equity markets, currently in the ninth year of a bull market, and the proliferation of ETFs that mimic complex quantitative strategies and investment trends and themes at a lower cost, have sparked a rush of inflows into such products as more investors shift to passive investments. BofA-ML clients have bought a net $160 billion worth of ETFs since 2009 while selling $200 billion worth of single stocks since, the broker said. The growing influence of ETFs is likely to alter some long-standing fundamentals across financial markets, analysts and investors have said, with the main issues for stock investors revolving around positioning, liquidity and valuation.  The actual shares available for investors to trade, or the true float,  may be grossly overestimated,  if the shares held by passive funds, which do not trade in and out of stocks based on fundamentals or events, are excluded. Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers and which manages a roughly $70 billion S&P; 500 ETF (VOO.P), now owns 6.8 percent of the top U.S. equity benchmark. The firm owns stakes of more than 10 percent in over 80 stocks in the S&P; 500, BofA-ML estimated.  Large cap US equity managers have had the luxury — and curse — of a liquid, efficient market,  said analysts at BofA-ML.  That liquidity is slowly being called into question by the 'ETF-ization' of the S&P; 500.  The broker cited Japan, where nearly 70 percent of assets under management at Japan-focused stock funds are now passive, partly due to the Bank of Japan's ETF-buying as part of its quantitative easing programme.  The victim in Japan has been active equity managers,  the broker said. For investors looking to sidestep any potential pitfalls, BofA-ML, recommends avoiding stocks with very high passive ownership which tend to be more volatile than broader markets and can also see valuations get detached from fundamentals.

Last week, Knorr-Bremse offered to sell assets, among other remedies, to try to secure European Commission approval for the 4.86-billion Swedish crown ($571 million) offer for brakes systems maker Haldex. The EU competition authority has not asked rivals and customers to comment on the plans, a person familiar with the matter said, indicating that it is set to open a full-scale investigation lasting about four months when a preliminary review ends on July 24. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Knorr-Bremse said it was aware of regulatory concerns.  There are indications that the EU Commission might initiate a Phase II investigation, and Knorr-Bremse takes a confident view on a potential Phase II investigation,  the company said. The Knorr-Bremse bid faces strong headwinds after Haldex's management pulled its support. Haldex Chairman Jorgen Durban told Reuters that the company received signals from the regulator that the deal stood only a slim chance of getting clearance.

Retailers have been rolling out measures such as price cuts to attract buyers as domestic consumption remains weak, with Japan mired in deflation for much of the past two decades and households sitting on cash amid uncertainty over the outlook. For the three months ended May, the supermarket operator  posted an operating profit of 36.6 billion yen ($323 million), up 11.4 percent from a year ago and above an average estimate of 35.2 billion yen from three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Results  would have been worse if we hadn't cut prices , said Soichi Okazaki, president of Aeon Retail, pledging to make further reductions in August. The earnings of major Japanese retailers such as Aeon are closely watched for signs of changes in consumer behavior.  Over the last few months Aeon has cut prices on hundreds of items at its stores to offset rising fuel and electricity costs and to attract thrifty shoppers, who risk being lured away by cheap offers from Japan's ubiquitous convenience stores. Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, remained unchanged in June from a year earlier..   Finding inventive ways to boost demand has become a major preoccupation for Japanese retailers. For example, Aeon saw a jump in sales at its renovated Aeon Style stores, where purchased items can be consumed at eat-in areas. An increasingly common sight in convenience stores are eat-in areas that offer a place to enjoy pre-prepared food at cheaper prices than at restaurants.  Aeon is trying to boost sales of its higher-margin own-brand food, clothing and furniture lines, as well as restructuring its Daiei and Aeon Retail units as it works towards its 290 billion yen operating profit target for the year ending February 2020. For the current financial year, the company reiterated its operating profit forecast at 195 billion yen, versus an average estimate of 198.9 billion yen from nine analysts. Aeon shares ended Wednesday down 0.5 percent, versus a 0.3 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei share price index .N225.

It is the first major display of anger in the European Union's poorest state against the two-month old centrist coalition government led by the center-right GERB party which won a snap parliamentary election in March. The Balkan country is still struggling to root out endemic corruption and organized crime, and observers say local police, prosecutors and judicial system are in urgent need of reform.  The cabinet of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has said it will honor Sofia's commitments to the EU to work to boost incomes in line with productivity. Interior Minister Valentin Radev, however, said wages of the ministry's employees would remain unchanged this year.  I hope that we will be able to increase the wages of the policemen in 2018, I do not know why they want it now and immediately,  Radev said. Police trade unions demanded an immediate pay rise of 15 to 20 percent and said they plan more protests in the coming months. They also asked for increased funding to replace outdated equipment and buy new uniforms.  The prestige and attractiveness of the profession have declined very seriously because of the low wages,  said Valentin Popov, chairman of the police officers' trade unions.  The starting (monthly) salary of a policeman and a fire-fighter is only 662 levs ($383) before taxes. The minimum and the average wage in the country rose by more than 50 percent in the last eight or nine years while the salaries in the interior ministry rose by only 15 percent in the same period,  he said. Banners carried by firefighters read:  Helmet - 1990, outfit - 2002 - second hand.  Bulgaria's average monthly salary was just above 1,000 levs in the first quarter of the year, the statistics office data showed.  The government's attitude toward us is inhuman and humiliating,  a demonstrator told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  If things remain like this, I'll quit.  Police officers in the Balkan country are not permitted to strike, take a second job or join a political party, but they are exempted from paying social security contributions. Voter frustration, especially with rampant corruption and organized crime, erupted in months of protests in 2013 and 2014 and the country has had seven governments in the past four years.

Former president Francois Hollande had backed the Syrian opposition, demanding the six-year conflict be resolved through a political transition that would eventually see Assad replaced. Macron, a centrist elected in May, said last month he no longer considered Assad's departure a pre-condition for a negotiated settlement to the conflict, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. While he described Assad as an enemy of the Syrian people, Macron said Paris' priority was fighting terrorist groups and ensuring Syria did not become a failed state. He also questioned the opposition's credibility.  Hailed by some in France as a pragmatic stance to advance negotiations, the comments also caused unease among the Syrian opposition, former officials and humanitarian groups.  Macron on Wednesday appeared to try to refine his comments after speaking to Riad Hijab, head of the Riyadh-based High Negotiations Committee, which represents a group of military and political opponents at U.N.-mediated talks between Syria's warring parties in Geneva.       In a statement the presidency said Macron had confirmed to Hijab that France supported the HNC in the Syrian peace talks being held under UN auspices.  The president assured Mr Hijab of his will to engage fully and personally to achieve an inclusive political solution in the Geneva framework,  the French presidency said. Macron's comments on June 21 echoed Russia's stance that there is no viable alternative to Assad. The French leader has sought closer co-operation with Russia and French diplomats say he wants to develop a  spirit of trust , notably on Syria. Hijab's office said that he had, in their conversation on Tuesday, reminded Macron that Assad had  lost legitimacy after being repeatedly responsible for using chemical weapons against his own people.   Assad’s presence in office helps spread chaos, strengthens the role of terrorist organizations, creates more sectarian militias, and fuels sectarian discrimination and hatred,  Hijab's office said in a statement. Macron's election victory has offered Paris an opportunity to re-examine its policy on Syria after opponents of Hollande's foreign policy considered that his stance was too intransigent and left the French government isolated. Russia's foreign minister will be in Paris on Thursday to discuss the conflict.

Survivors found guilty could face punishments ranging from life imprisonment to the death penalty, authorities said. Preliminary investigations showed the license for the boiler had expired on June 24, district administrator Dewan Muhammad Humayun Kabir told Reuters. The company said it had applied to renew the license before the deadline, however.  We applied to the authorities for renewal on June 15,  company chairman Mahiuddin Faruqui told Reuters.  There was no negligence on our side.  The accident took place as the plant was being readied to resume operations on Tuesday, following a 10-day closure for the Eid al-Fitr holidays at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. A boiler warning light was flashing before the explosion, but the maintenance team ignored it, said one survivor, Harunur Rashid, a worker in the garment dyeing process.  We heard strange sounds two or three times, but we were told it was nothing,  Rashid, hurt in the head and legs by the blast, said from his hospital bed.  Shortly after, it exploded.  The blast happened when workers sought to restart the boiler after servicing, Faruqui said.  We don't know whether it gave any warnings or not,  he added.    Bangladesh's roughly $28-billion garment industry, the world's biggest after China, employs 4 million people and generates about 80 percent of export earnings. It came under scrutiny after the 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex that killed more than 1,100 people, and a 2012 fire at a garment factory that killed 112 workers. The Rana Plaza disaster sparked demands for greater safety and put the responsibility to act on foreign companies sourcing clothing from Bangladesh.

The Snapdeal board rejected the bid as it was below a valuation of $1 billion indicated earlier by Flipkart, two sources familiar with the negotiations said. One of the sources said the bid came in at between $850 million and $900 million, while a second source said that the bid came in closer to $850 million. Flipkart had estimated Snapdeal, which is operated by Jasper Infotech, to be worth $1 billion in a non-binding term sheet which was to be followed by due diligence, one source said. Snapdeal opened its books to Flipkart in May for the company to run the due diligence process on it. Japan's SoftBank, Snapdeal's biggest investor, is keen to fold the e-commerce firm into Flipkart and take a large stake in India's biggest e-commerce player through an all equity deal. A merger will help Flipkart, which is already backed by Microsoft Corp, China's Tencent and online auction site eBay, bulk up and stay ahead of Amazon, which is expanding rapidly in the world's fastest-growing internet services market. Flipkart, Snapdeal and their key investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      The due diligence, run by auditor Ernst & Young and law firm Khaitan & Co, came up clean, but Flipkart knocked down the price without a reason, said the first source, adding that Flipkart's top investor Tiger Global indicated that it would revert with a new offer. The exclusivity period around talks with Flipkart ended on July 2, however, and Snapdeal could engage in talks with other interested parties, said the source.  The second source said Flipkart's lowball offer was just a negotiation tactic. Both sources said sale talks between the e-commerce firms will continue, while a third source said a deal was likely to be finalized by mid-July. Flipkart has not currently bid for Snapdeal's logistics arm Vulcan Express and its digital payments venture FreeCharge, one of sources said, adding that these assets may be sold separately. SoftBank is expected to invest about $1 billion in Flipkart through a fresh cash infusion and by buying equity stakes from its investors Tiger Global and Naspers, sources have previously told Reuters.

The ministry would buy 74.3 million roubles (960,272.59 pounds) worth of foreign currency between July 7 and August 4 after spending 45 billion roubles on such purchases in the preceding month. On daily basis, the forex buying will amount to around 3.5 million roubles ($58,000), the finance ministry said in a statement, down from 2.1 billion roubles between June 7 and July 6.   A relatively low volume of extra oil and gas revenues was mainly caused by a decline in oil prices in June on the back of the comparatively stable rouble rate,  the ministry said in a statement. Prices for Russia's Urals crude oil blend dropped to $42.93 in June, their lowest since November, denting the country's revenues from commodity exports. The announced amount of interventions came far below market expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected the finance ministry to reduce its average daily foreign-currency purchases to about 1.31 billion roubles in July. The finance ministry started buying foreign currency on the domestic market in February to replenish the country's fiscal buffers. The ministry said the purchases are designed to shield the oil-dependent economy from swings in oil prices but some analysts interpreted them as an attempt to stop the rouble from strengthening too much.

Their expectation was that Donald Trump, due to be inaugurated as U.S. president days later, would quickly temper his protectionist campaign rhetoric and patch up ties with Western allies, leaving little space for Beijing. Six months later, as Xi arrives in Berlin for a highly symbolic visit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel before a Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, what seemed laughable in the thin mountain air of the Swiss Alps is not so absurd any more. Despite concerns about human rights in China, frustrations over market access and worries about a wave of corporate takeovers in Europe by state-run Chinese firms, Germany is being pushed into an awkward embrace with Beijing as Trump doubles down on his promise to put  America First . For Merkel, the G20 host, Xi is an ally and Trump a troublesome rival on some of the most important issues on the agenda in Hamburg - from trade and climate change to economic development in Africa. And so, Merkel will dine with Xi on Tuesday and plot G20 strategy with him over lunch on Wednesday. After that, the two leaders will indulge in classic  panda diplomacy , opening a $10 million Chinese compound in Berlin Zoo for Meng Meng and Jiao Qing - two giant pandas that China is lending to Germany as a token of friendship.  For Beijing, the goal is to present itself as a generous, cooperative and friendly power, at home and abroad,  said Sebastian Heilmann, director of the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies (MERICS) in Berlin.  It also serves to distract from politically controversial topics.  Big Power Tensions The visit, a month after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang traveled to Berlin to meet Merkel, comes at an extremely sensitive time for big-power relations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping are seen after the news conference at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, July 5, 2017.Axel SchmidtTrump is ratcheting up pressure on Beijing to restrain North Korea, which on Tuesday announced that it had successfully test-launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that showed it could strike anywhere in the world. His administration is threatening punitive trade measures against China on steel, a step that could also hit German exporters. Meanwhile a U.S. warship sailed near a disputed island in the South China Sea on Sunday, prompting Beijing to complain of a  serious political and military provocation . Against that backdrop, Xi needs allies, and Germany is top of the list. Slideshow (8 Images)In a guest commentary in the German daily Die Welt on Tuesday, he called for an intensification of ties, saying the two countries should assume responsibility for peace, stability and prosperity. While welcoming closer dialogue, the German government may have less lofty aims. Eberhard Sandschneider, a China expert at Berlin's Free University, said Merkel's main goal was to gather as many allies as possible on climate, trade and Africa before the G20 summit, describing the encounter as a pure  coordination meeting . German officials have not shied away from criticizing China on a range of issues in recent weeks, including cyber espionage and Beijing's treatment of cancer-stricken pro-democracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. In an interview with the German magazine Wirtschaftwoche last week, Merkel expressed concern about the treatment of German firms in China and attempts by Beijing to play European countries off against each other.  Beijing views Europe as an Asian peninsula. We see it differently,  she said.  Nevertheless, it is a fact that parts of German industry are dependent on China. So we need to deal with China's demands in a way that brings harmony and advantages for both sides.

The Snapdeal board rejected the bid as it was below a valuation of $1 billion indicated earlier by Flipkart, two sources familiar with the negotiations said. One of the sources said the bid came in at between $850 million and $900 million, while a second source said that the bid came in closer to $850 million. Flipkart had estimated Snapdeal, which is operated by Jasper Infotech, to be worth $1 billion in a non-binding term sheet which was to be followed by due diligence, one source said. Snapdeal opened its books to Flipkart in May for the company to run the due diligence process on it. Japan's SoftBank, Snapdeal's biggest investor, is keen to fold the e-commerce firm into Flipkart and take a large stake in India's biggest e-commerce player through an all equity deal. A merger will help Flipkart, which is already backed by Microsoft Corp, China's Tencent and online auction site eBay, bulk up and stay ahead of Amazon, which is expanding rapidly in the world's fastest-growing internet services market. Flipkart, Snapdeal and their key investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.      The due diligence, run by auditor Ernst & Young and law firm Khaitan & Co, came up clean, but Flipkart knocked down the price without a reason, said the first source, adding that Flipkart's top investor Tiger Global indicated that it would revert with a new offer. The exclusivity period around talks with Flipkart ended on July 2, however, and Snapdeal could engage in talks with other interested parties, said the source.  The second source said Flipkart's lowball offer was just a negotiation tactic. Both sources said sale talks between the e-commerce firms will continue, while a third source said a deal was likely to be finalized by mid-July. Flipkart has not currently bid for Snapdeal's logistics arm Vulcan Express and its digital payments venture FreeCharge, one of sources said, adding that these assets may be sold separately. SoftBank is expected to invest about $1 billion in Flipkart through a fresh cash infusion and by buying equity stakes from its investors Tiger Global and Naspers, sources have previously told Reuters.

The ministry would buy 74.3 million roubles (960,272.59 pounds) worth of foreign currency between July 7 and August 4 after spending 45 billion roubles on such purchases in the preceding month. On daily basis, the forex buying will amount to around 3.5 million roubles ($58,000), the finance ministry said in a statement, down from 2.1 billion roubles between June 7 and July 6.   A relatively low volume of extra oil and gas revenues was mainly caused by a decline in oil prices in June on the back of the comparatively stable rouble rate,  the ministry said in a statement. Prices for Russia's Urals crude oil blend dropped to $42.93 in June, their lowest since November, denting the country's revenues from commodity exports. The announced amount of interventions came far below market expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected the finance ministry to reduce its average daily foreign-currency purchases to about 1.31 billion roubles in July. The finance ministry started buying foreign currency on the domestic market in February to replenish the country's fiscal buffers. The ministry said the purchases are designed to shield the oil-dependent economy from swings in oil prices but some analysts interpreted them as an attempt to stop the rouble from strengthening too much.

The changes include naming Juan Colombas to the new role of chief operating officer, giving Chief Financial Officer George Culmer oversight of the legal and strategy teams, and naming Zaka Mian as group director for transformation. Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said the changes will help the bank pursue a strategy of being a simplified, low-risk lender focused on the UK.  The changes we are announcing today are fundamental to prepare the Group for the next phase of its transformation under our upcoming strategic plan for the period 2018 – 2020,  Horta-Osorio said in the announcement. Lloyds, which nine years ago was bailed out in a 20 billion pound ($25.83 billion) rescue during the financial crisis, returned to full private ownership in May with the sale of the last of the government's shares in the bank. Horta-Osorio has faced repeated questions from analysts and investors in recent months over the timing of his departure after the lender reached that key milestone on the path to rehabilitation following its near-demise in 2008.  There's always more to do, and I am happy here,  Horta-Osorio told analysts on a conference call in April in response to questions about his future at the bank. Along with the many changes to individuals' responsibilities announced on Wednesday, the bank said it is creating a new, broader group executive committee. The bank also announced some departures. Andrew Bester, who ran Lloyds' commercial division, and Simon Davies who was responsible for legal and strategy matters, are both leaving Lloyds.

The move to choose the Netherlands was agreed to by the five countries which have been conducting a preliminary criminal investigation. Victims of the disaster, which occurred over territory held by pro-Russia separatists fighting Ukrainian government forces, came from 17 countries, and included 196 Dutch citizens. The Dutch Safety Board, which investigated the cause of the crash, concluded in October 2015 that the plane was shot down by a Russian-made ground-to-air rocket. Moscow, which denies any involvement in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, also denies one of its rockets could have been used against MH17. The decision follows attempts, blocked by Russia in 2015, to set up an international court over the incident. The extent to which Russia will cooperate with a Dutch court if prosecutors name Russian suspects or request information is not clear. Wim de Bruin, spokesman for the Netherlands' national prosecutor's office, said countries did cooperate on criminal investigations and had had communication over MH17. The Dutch-led team of international investigators, which also included Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, and Ukraine, concluded in September that the rocket was fired from territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists. No suspects have been named, though Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said last year his office has identified 100  persons of interest  in the investigation, including those who organized the arrival of the rocket and oversaw its transport from Russia to Ukraine and back. De Bruin said that list has since been further refined but prosecutors were not close to any indictment. Dutch foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Wednesday cooperation among the five investigating countries would continue during the  prosecution phase.    This cooperation is vital, given the complexity of this case,  Koenders said in a statement.   Flight MH17 was downed in a conflict zone which was the scene of heavy fighting and which is still difficult to access.   Disinformation  Seen Koenders added:  We’re still seeing a great deal of disinformation and attempts to discredit the investigation.  Russia has suggested alternative theories to explain the plane's downing, including that Ukraine is responsible.  The Dutch-led investigative team said in February it was impossible to establish the authenticity of radar images released by Russia in 2016 in a nonstandard format, two years after they had been requested. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a statement his government had  full confidence  in the Dutch legal system, and urged  other states  to cooperate, as required by U.N. Security Council resolution 2166. In all, 38 Australians died in the crash.  While we cannot take away the grief of those who lost their loved ones because of this atrocious act, we are committed to holding the perpetrators to account and achieving justice for all the victims.  It remains unclear what charges suspects would face if it were found that the plane was shot down in the mistaken belief it was a Ukrainian military plane. On Wednesday De Volkskrant newspaper quoted Tjibbe Joustra, who led the Dutch Safety Board investigation, as saying  I don't see anybody going to jail quickly, but I think the truth will come out.  He told the paper he believed trials may have to be held in absentia.

Orders of over €2.75bn by the 11NC6's second update implied that investors are willing to overlook the punitive treatment of Tier 2 debt at Popular, even for second tier lenders.  It is a good credit and I'd expect it to go well, and the price looked fair,  said a banker off the deal. Initial talk at mid-swaps plus 260bp area was slashed by 20bp to guidance of swaps plus 240bp area (+/-5bp wpir). A final reoffer spread of 235bp would be roughly flat to where a lead saw fair value, a sign CaixaBank is not being penalised by external events. Deutsche Pfandbriefbank has sold a 10NC5 Tier 2 (BB+/BB) in the days since Popular was resolved, but that was only €300m. Before that Tier 2 had been relatively untested in Europe, with second quarter supply in the format amounting to just €1.75bn, according to IFR figures. Nonetheless, market reaction to Popular, and the collapse of two regional Italian lenders, has suggested investors are willing to look beyond those troubled spots.  Popular was an isolated case and rather well flagged,  said Gildas Surry, partner at Axiom Alternative Investments.  Caixabank is a very different position with a strong commercial franchise in Spain. The risk we see in such a transaction is more the headlines and potential risk around the potential referendum in Catalonia in the autumn.  Tier 2 paper from small Spanish lenders Liberbank and Cajamar has failed to recoup losses suffered in the days after Popular - the former's €300m 6.875% 10NC5 is still languishing at a 91.3 cash price, for example. By contrast, CaixaBank's €1bn 2027NC2022s initially widened around 13bp to swaps plus 240bp but have steadily tightened to swaps plus 223bp, according to Thomson Reuters data. Bankers on and off Bankia's AT1 mandate are confident that deal will also go well, particularly after the strong reception to reopening trades from HSBC and RBI last week.  Every entity is different,  said a third banker.  Bankia is clean, well-capitalised and still owned by the government, so there is no reason to see why that institution should be in a situation like Popular.  The deal, managed by Barclays, BNP Paribas, CaixaBank, Credit Agricole and JP Morgan, is expected to be rated Ba2/BB+/BBB-/BBB.

The Scottish economy expanded by a quarterly 0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2017, faster than growth of 0.2 percent in Britain as a whole and a sharp reversal from a contraction of 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter. The figures were pushed up by a 3.1 percent jump in industrial production, helped by the recovery of output at the Dalzell steel plate mill in Motherwell, which was bought by Liberty Steel from Tata Steel last year. Wednesday's figures also showed a rise in output in industries linked to the North Sea oil and gas industry which Scotland's government said showed growing confidence in a sector that has slowed in recent years. Scotland's economy has generally underperformed the British economy because of its dependence on oil and gas. In annual terms, Scotland's economy grew by 0.7 percent, slower than growth of 1.8 percent in Britain's economy. Scotland's devolved government recently shelved plans to push for a new referendum on independence from the UK. Support for secession among voters stands at around 45 percent, according to opinion polls, and how well or badly the economy fares is one the key drivers of separatist sentiment.

June data taken from seven Asian exchanges including India, Indonesia and Thailand showed foreign investment for the month totaled $2.9 billion, the lowest in five months, and down 40 percent compared to flows in May. Click reut.rs/2sLfWIL for graphic on Asia foreign flows into equities in June The slowing foreign investment raises questions about the sustainability of the strong gains in Asian stock markets in the first half of the year, analysts said. The MSCI Asia Pacific index .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 18.3 percent in the first half - the biggest rise in any first half since 2009  The story of higher yields in developed economies led by the U.S is beginning to bear down on investors,  said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.  Now, they have to make very conscious decisions about where their marginal investments are headed through.   Comments last week by European Central bank President Mario Draghi fueled market expectations that the ECB will announce a reduction of stimulus in September, while rising U.S. inflation data strengthened the case for the Fed to keep raising rates. Strong upward earnings revisions bolstered Asian stocks in the first half of the year, but recently the optimism has started to fade. According to StarMine data, analysts have slashed their earnings estimates for 2017 by 0.5 percent in the last two months. Click reut.rs/2tPQTJJ for graphic on Asia: changes in mean earnings estimates  Cyclical sectors that have benefited from previously strong commodity prices and strong fiscal/monetary easing in China are likely to see slower earnings momentum as the positive impulse fades,  a Goldman Sachs report said. Energy sector companies' earnings for the current year have been slashed by 6.9 percent in the last two months, and those for consumer cyclicals have been cut by 2 percent, according to StarMine data. Analysts also said inflation in the region has bottomed out and foreign investors would be cautious about their real returns.  The trend of inflation bottoming and hitting higher in most Asian economies further breaks the question of how investors are assessing their real returns from the region,  Varathan said. Click tmsnrt.rs/2sLkNtn for graphic on Asia Pacific valuations Goldman, which expects the MSCI Asia-ex-Japan stock index to decline 1 percent during the third quarter, said global mutual fund positioning on Asian equities has also become light.

The move to choose the Netherlands was agreed to by the five countries which have been conducting a preliminary criminal investigation. Victims of the disaster, which occurred over territory held by pro-Russia separatists fighting Ukrainian government forces, came from 17 countries, and included 196 Dutch citizens. The Dutch Safety Board, which investigated the cause of the crash, concluded in October 2015 that the plane was shot down by a Russian-made ground-to-air rocket. Moscow, which denies any involvement in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, also denies one of its rockets could have been used against MH17. The decision follows attempts, blocked by Russia in 2015, to set up an international court over the incident. The extent to which Russia will cooperate with a Dutch court if prosecutors name Russian suspects or request information is not clear. Wim de Bruin, spokesman for the Netherlands' national prosecutor's office, said countries did cooperate on criminal investigations and had had communication over MH17. The Dutch-led team of international investigators, which also included Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, and Ukraine, concluded in September that the rocket was fired from territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists. No suspects have been named, though Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said last year his office has identified 100  persons of interest  in the investigation, including those who organized the arrival of the rocket and oversaw its transport from Russia to Ukraine and back. De Bruin said that list has since been further refined but prosecutors were not close to any indictment. Dutch foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Wednesday cooperation among the five investigating countries would continue during the  prosecution phase.    This cooperation is vital, given the complexity of this case,  Koenders said in a statement.   Flight MH17 was downed in a conflict zone which was the scene of heavy fighting and which is still difficult to access.   Disinformation  Seen Koenders added:  We’re still seeing a great deal of disinformation and attempts to discredit the investigation.  Russia has suggested alternative theories to explain the plane's downing, including that Ukraine is responsible.  The Dutch-led investigative team said in February it was impossible to establish the authenticity of radar images released by Russia in 2016 in a nonstandard format, two years after they had been requested. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a statement his government had  full confidence  in the Dutch legal system, and urged  other states  to cooperate, as required by U.N. Security Council resolution 2166. In all, 38 Australians died in the crash.  While we cannot take away the grief of those who lost their loved ones because of this atrocious act, we are committed to holding the perpetrators to account and achieving justice for all the victims.  It remains unclear what charges suspects would face if it were found that the plane was shot down in the mistaken belief it was a Ukrainian military plane. On Wednesday De Volkskrant newspaper quoted Tjibbe Joustra, who led the Dutch Safety Board investigation, as saying  I don't see anybody going to jail quickly, but I think the truth will come out.  He told the paper he believed trials may have to be held in absentia.

Parker is considered by many within the industry as the world's most powerful wine critic, and Michelin said in a statement that the acquisition would enrich the restaurant guide part of its business.  The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Parker, who has had an unprecedented impact on the world of wine through his 100-point scoring system that can make or break wineries, founded the Robert Parker Wine Advocate in 1978. His publication produces nearly 40,000 reviews annually. The Robert Parker Wine Advocate and Michelin have already been working together since 2016 in Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau on upmarket wine and dining events. Alexandre Taisne, chief executive officer of Michelin's Food and Travel Business, told Reuters by phone:  These services, which are aimed at creating memorable experiences, will be rolled out in Asia, the United States and Europe by 2019.  The majority of the capital of Robert Parker Wine Advocate is currently in the hands of Asian investors.

The Outlook is Stable. The downgrade reflects weaker prospects for margin due to the company's aggressive pricing strategy as well as declining fleet rental revenue from UCAR, CAR Inc.'s largest shareholder and biggest customer. Fitch believes Car Inc's ongoing and substantial related-party transactions with UCAR are a credit weakness. While the agency expects UCAR's revenue contribution in the rental business to decline, related-party transactions are likely to remain high, as UCAR's Shenzhou Maimaiche business has become CAR Inc's main channel for used-car sales. KEY RATING DRIVERS Significant Related-Party Transactions: UCAR, a leading Chinese business-to-consumer ride sharing company, is both the largest shareholder and largest customer of CAR Inc. UCAR accounts for around 30%-40% of CAR Inc.'s rental revenue and 60% of its used-car sales. Fitch expects UCAR's fleet rentals from CAR Inc. to decrease in 2017 due to regulatory changes, but UCAR's used-car purchases from CAR Inc. have increased significantly following its 2016 acquisition of Shenzhou Maimaiche, a used-car sales platform. Fitch believes CAR Inc's ongoing related-party transactions with UCAR are a credit weakness. UCAR operates in China's rapidly evolving and hyper-competitive ride-sharing industry and has yet to break even on an EBITDA level. UCAR's losses narrowed in 2016 and the company has ample liquidity following several rounds of fundraising over the past year, but its credit profile remains substantially weaker than that of CAR Inc. Short-Term Margin Pressure: Fitch expects CAR Inc.'s operating margins to weaken slightly in 2017 from the previous year and the agency's previous expectations. Revenue from the fleet rental business to UCAR is likely to shrink in 2017 and this segment has historically incurred lower operating expenses. In addition, CAR Inc. cut its car rentals business pricing by more than 20% in 1Q17 to raise utilisation rates and squeeze competitors. So far the company has successfully raised utilisation rates to offset the revenue impact of lower prices, but we think this strategy may eat into margins over time. Finally, CAR Inc. plans to speed up the fleet renewal process to improve user experience, which may translate into higher capex and depreciation expenses. Strong Market Position, Healthy Financials: CAR Inc.'s ratings are supported by its top market position in China's fast-expanding car rental market, with roughly double the fleet size and revenue of its next-largest competitor, eHi Car Services Limited (BB-/Negative). Fitch expects CAR Inc.'s leverage and coverage ratios to remain strong, with FFO-adjusted net leverage staying at around 2.0x-2.5x; a comfortable level for its 'BB-' rating. DERIVATION SUMMARY CAR Inc.'s ratings are supported by its leading market position and healthy credit metrics, but constrained by its large exposure to UCAR, which is both its largest customer and shareholder, and has a weaker credit profile. Compared with Localiza Rent a Car S.A. (BB+/Negative), Brazil's leading car rental operator, CAR Inc. has similar operating scale and margins, but higher financial leverage. Compared with eHi, CAR Inc. has a better market position and stronger credit metrics, but has higher revenue concentration risk from its exposure to one large customer, UCAR. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - 42,500 cars added and 27,500 vehicles disposed in the car rentals segment in 2017 - Stable average daily rental revenue per car rental vehicle from 1Q17 of CNY165 - Fleet rental fleet to shrink to 18,000 by end-2017, from 21,761 at end-1Q17 and 24,330 at end-2016 - 58%-59% EBITDA margin for the rental business, excluding used-car disposals, for 2017. (2015-2016 average: 57%-60%) - No further gain or loss on disposal (aside from actual reported in 1Q17) - No further share buybacks (aside from actual buybacks as of June 2017) RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - UCAR generates sustained positive EBITDA, or contributes less than 20% of CAR's revenues - Sustained positive free cash flow Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - FFO adjusted net leverage sustained above 3.0x - FFO fixed charge coverage sustained below 3.0x - Rentals EBITDA margin (excluding used car sales) sustained below 40% LIQUIDITY Comfortable Liquidity: CAR Inc. had CNY5.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at end-2016 and CNY2.7 billion in available undrawn facilities. This is more than sufficient to cover its short-term debt of CNY2.4 billion. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS CAR Inc. - Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR downgraded to 'BB-' from 'BB'; Outlook Stable - Senior unsecured rating downgraded to 'BB-' from 'BB' - USD500 million 6.125% senior notes due 2020 downgraded to 'BB-' from 'BB' - USD300 million 6.000% senior notes due 2021 downgraded to 'BB-' from 'BB' Contact: Primary Analyst Yee Man Chin Director +852 2263 9696 Fitch (Hong Kong) Limited 19/F Man Yee Building 68 Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong Secondary Analyst Li Chen Analyst +86 21 5097 3009 Committee Chairperson Kalai Pillay Senior Director +65 6796 7221 Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments: Share-based compensation excluded from EBITDA.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Hansen is seeing strong demand for probiotics for animals as farmers and restaurant chains come under growing pressure to use fewer antibiotics in the food chain, its chief executive said.  Scientists warn the routine use of antibiotics in animals is contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant  superbugs,  posing a major threat to human health.  There is a strong underlying driver from consumers and investors that wants the (meat) industry to reduce antibiotics so there is a long-term underlying very positive trend,  Chr. Hansen CEO Cees de Jong told Reuters on Wednesday, as the Danish company posted forecast-beating third-quarter results.   Chr. Hansen, whose main business produces enzymes and bacteria for the dairy, wine and meat industries, is also one of the world's top three producers of probiotics for animals, alongside Dupont and Lallemand. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that can help improve health.  One investor initiative is the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative (FAIRR) which is campaigning to convince KFC parent Yum Brands Inc and other food companies to reduce the use of antibiotics in the meat they serve. De Jong said Chr. Hansen would soon launch a new product in the U.S. poultry market aimed at replacing antibiotics  and still get a very healthy population of birds that grow very well or even better from the same amount of feed.    Animal health products, including probiotics for animals, were the key driver of a 14 percent rise in revenue growth excluding acquisitions in the company's Health and Nutrition division in the third quarter, de Jong said.   We are in the lucky situation that our technology basis is very much aligned with today's mega-trends where consumers become more and more informed and they want natural solutions . Last year, Chr. Hansen bought U.S. firm Nutrition Physiology Company (NPC) to expand into probiotics that can be used as  alternatives to antibiotics in meat.   Shares in Chr. Hansen rose as much as 4 percent on Wednesday after the company beat third-quarter operating profit forecasts and narrowed its 2016/17 revenue growth guidance to 9-10 percent from 8-10 percent. Chr. Hansen currently has  nothing on the list  with regards to potential acquisitions, which is why it announced a special dividend of 100 million euros ($114 million), de Jong said.

Hansen is seeing strong demand for probiotics for animals as farmers and restaurant chains come under growing pressure to use fewer antibiotics in the food chain, its chief executive said.  Scientists warn the routine use of antibiotics in animals is contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant  superbugs,  posing a major threat to human health.  There is a strong underlying driver from consumers and investors that wants the (meat) industry to reduce antibiotics so there is a long-term underlying very positive trend,  Chr. Hansen CEO Cees de Jong told Reuters on Wednesday, as the Danish company posted forecast-beating third-quarter results.   Chr. Hansen, whose main business produces enzymes and bacteria for the dairy, wine and meat industries, is also one of the world's top three producers of probiotics for animals, alongside Dupont and Lallemand. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that can help improve health.  One investor initiative is the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative (FAIRR) which is campaigning to convince KFC parent Yum Brands Inc and other food companies to reduce the use of antibiotics in the meat they serve. De Jong said Chr. Hansen would soon launch a new product in the U.S. poultry market aimed at replacing antibiotics  and still get a very healthy population of birds that grow very well or even better from the same amount of feed.    Animal health products, including probiotics for animals, were the key driver of a 14 percent rise in revenue growth excluding acquisitions in the company's Health and Nutrition division in the third quarter, de Jong said.   We are in the lucky situation that our technology basis is very much aligned with today's mega-trends where consumers become more and more informed and they want natural solutions . Last year, Chr. Hansen bought U.S. firm Nutrition Physiology Company (NPC) to expand into probiotics that can be used as  alternatives to antibiotics in meat.   Shares in Chr. Hansen rose as much as 4 percent on Wednesday after the company beat third-quarter operating profit forecasts and narrowed its 2016/17 revenue growth guidance to 9-10 percent from 8-10 percent. Chr. Hansen currently has  nothing on the list  with regards to potential acquisitions, which is why it announced a special dividend of 100 million euros ($114 million), de Jong said.

Starting Tuesday, Curve will offer customers the chance to  go back in time  and switch the card used for any given transaction for up to two weeks after the purchase, in what it said would be a world first.  The startup also said on Monday that it was planning to announce backing from two large international banks soon, but declined to provide more detailed information.     Curve, which has a patent pending for the new tool, provides customers one card that can aggregate all of their existing Mastercard and Visa Inc (V.N)  payment cards. Users can carry only the Curve card and switch between the cards they want to use for a purchase through a mobile phone app.  Founded in 2015, the startup is among a growing group of young companies that seek to make better use of digital technologies to make payments and banking products more user-friendly. The startup's chief executive, Shachar Bialick, said the new  time travel  functionality will give customers more time to chose the most convenient form of payment for a given transaction.  For example, users might have funds available in their current account days after a purchase paid for with a credit card - and would therefore prefer to switch the transaction to a debit card to avoid interest fees.   The user can manage their cash flow much better,  Bialick said.  It's very hard to make the decision at the point of sale.  The functionality would also enable users to take better advantage of card rewards, he said. While users would be able to switch cards, the change would happen within Curve's platform, so merchants would only see the original transaction and would not be charged card processing fees twice.  Rewards gained through the first purchase will be reversed if that card is changed, Curve said.    Curve, which is still in  beta  testing mode, has already had more than 50,000 sign-ups, with the cards having been used for over 50 million pounds ($64.7 million) in transactions so far. It plans to fully launch this year.  (1 pound = $1.29) Reporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Jonathan Oatis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-payments-curve-idUSKBN19O2HO"},

The head of Ukraine's Cyber Police, Serhiy Demedyuk, told Reuters the servers of M.E.Doc - Ukraine's most popular accounting software - had been seized as part of an investigation into the attack.  Though they are still trying to establish who was behind last week's attack, Ukrainian intelligence officials and security firms have said some of the initial infections were spread via a malicious update issued by M.E.Doc, charges the company's owners deny. The owners were not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. Premium Service, which says it is an official dealer of M.E.Doc's software, wrote a post on M.E.Doc's Facebook page saying masked men were searching M.E.Doc's offices and that the software firm's servers and services were down.  Premium Service could not be reached for further comment. Cyber Police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko said investigative actions were continuing at M.E.Doc's offices, adding that further comment would be made on Wednesday. The police move came after cyber security investigators unearthed further evidence on Tuesday that the attack had been planned months in advance by highly-skilled hackers, who they said had inserted a vulnerability into the M.E.Doc progamme. Ukraine also took steps on Tuesday to extend its state tax deadline by one month to help businesses hit by the malware assault. Researchers at Slovakian security software firm ESET said they had found a  backdoor  written into some of M.E.Doc's software updates, likely with access to the company's source code, which allowed hackers to enter companies' systems undetected.  Very Stealthy and Cunning   We identified a very stealthy and cunning backdoor that was injected by attackers into one of M.E.Doc's legitimate modules,  ESET senior malware researcher Anton Cherepanov said in a technical note.  It seems very unlikely that attackers could do this without access to M.E.Doc's source code.   This was a thoroughly well-planned and well-executed operation,  he said.      Ukrainian Cyber Police Chief Serhiy Demedyuk speaks during an interview with Reuters in Kiev, Ukraine June 23, 2017. Picture taken June 23, 2017.Valentyn OgirenkoESET said at least three M.E.Doc updates had been issued with the  backdoor vulnerability , and the first one was sent to clients on April 14, more than two months before the attack. ESET said the hackers likely had access to M.E.Doc's source code since the beginning of the year, and the detailed preparation before the attack was testament to the advanced nature of their operation. Oleg Derevianko, board chairman at Ukrainian cyber security firm ISSP, said an update issued by M.E.Doc in April delivered a virus to the company's clients which instructed computers to download 350 megabytes of data from an unknown source on the internet. The virus then exported 35 megabytes of company data to the hackers, he told Reuters in an interview at his office in Kiev. Slideshow (2 Images) With this 35 megabytes you can exfiltrate anything - emails from all of the banks, user accounts, passwords, anything.   Little known outside Ukrainian accounting circles, M.E.Doc is used by around 80 percent of companies in Ukraine. The software allows its 400,000 clients to send and collaborate on financial documents between internal departments, as well as file them with the Ukrainian state tax service. Ukraine's government said on Tuesday it would submit a draft law to parliament for the country's tax deadline to be extended to July 15, and waive fines for companies who missed the previous June 13 cutoff because of the attack.  We had program failures in connection to the cyber attack, which meant that businesses were unable to submit account reports on time,  Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman told a cabinet meeting.  Separately, Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said it had discussed cyber defense with NATO officials and had received equipment from the alliance to better combat future cyber attacks. Ukraine is not in NATO but is seeking closer ties. On Saturday Ukrainian intelligence officials accused Russian security services of being behind the attack, and cyber security researchers linked it to a suspected Russian group who attacked the Ukrainian power grid in December 2016. A Kremlin spokesman dismissed charges of Russian involvement as  unfounded blanket accusations .      Derevianko said the hacker's activity in April and reported access to M.E.Doc's source code showed Ukraine's computer networks had already been compromised and that the intruders were still operating inside them.  It definitely tells us about the advanced capabilities of the adversaries,  he said.  I don't think any additional evidence is needed to attribute this to a nation-state attack.

The United States last August offered up to $3 million for information about Colonel Gulmurod Khalimov, whom it trained in counter-terrorism before he joined Islamic State. Washington has described Khalimov as  a key leader  of Islamic State, which has seized parts of Syria and Iraq and staged or inspired deadly militant attacks around the world. According to the security sources, police suspected that some of Khalimov's relatives were also linked to the militant group and were about to cross the border into Afghanistan. When police raided a house in the Ibrat village in southern Tajikistan late on Tuesday, the suspects resisted and wounded at least one policeman, the sources said. Police killed two of Khalimov's brothers and two of his nephews, and detained several people. Tajikistan's interior ministry confirmed that one of its officers had received a knife wound, but had no further comments. In April, Tajik security forces detained Khalimov's eldest son, Bekhruz, 18, who they said had planned to join his father. Thousands of people from the predominantly Muslim ex-Soviet region of Central Asia have joined Islamic State and several men have been detained this year over a bombing of the metro in Russia's St Petersburg as well as a truck attack in Stockholm.

The editor of the Abu Dhabi government linked al-Ittihad newspaper wrote in an editorial that Qatar was  walking alone in its dreams and illusions, far away from its Gulf Arab brothers . Foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain will consider whether to escalate, or less likely abandon, the boycott imposed on Qatar last month that has rattled a key oil-producing region and unnerved strategic Western allies. Qatar faces further isolation and possible expulsion from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) if its response to a list of demands made nearly two weeks ago is not deemed satisfactory. The Arab countries have demanded Qatar curtail its support for the Muslim Brotherhood, shut down the pan-Arab al Jazeera TV channel, close down a Turkish base and downgrade its ties with regional arch-rival Iran. They view Qatar's independent diplomatic stances and support for 2011  Arab Spring  uprisings as support for terrorism and a dangerous breaking of ranks - charges Doha vigorously denies. Qatar has countered that the Arab countries want to curb free speech and take over its foreign policy, saying their 13 demands are so harsh they were made to be rejected. The gas-rich state had raised its international profile dramatically in recent years, drawing on huge gas revenues, and developed its economy with ambitious infrastructure projects. It is due to host the soccer world cup in 2022. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said at a joint news conference with his German counterpart on Tuesday that its response was  given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution , but insisted that Doha would not compromise on its sovereignty. Gulf officials have said the demands are not negotiable, signalling more sanctions are possible, including  parting ways  with Doha - a suggestion it may be ejected from the GCC, a regional economic and security cooperation body founded in 1981.  A Gulf national may be obliged to prepare psychologically for his Gulf to be without Qatar,  the editor of the Abu Dhabi al-Ittihad newspaper said. Some newspapers said remarks by Sheikh Mohammed in which he stressed his country would not compromise on its sovereignty suggeststhat Doha would not change its policies. Qatari officials have repeatedly said the demands are so draconian that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead seeing to hobble Doha's sovereignty. At the same time, they have said Qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to issues they view as a legitimate concern to fellow GCC member states.

The move follows similar postponements by banking regulators in Hong Kong and Australia as concerns grow over the complexity of the rules and as it is also uncertain how they will fit with other capital reforms yet to be finalised. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) notified local banks of the delay to the so-called 'fundamental review of the trading book' (FRTB) in a letter last month that also flagged a number of other regulatory issues, two people briefed on the matter said. The people declined to be identified as the letter was not made public. The rules were finalised last year by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as part of a decade-long international effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.  The FRTB rules, which require banks to hold more capital against their trading books, were scheduled to become effective in January 2019. A MAS spokeswoman said the regulator remains committed to a full implementation of Basel III reforms but was not rigidly adhering to a timeline.  In determining the implementation timeline, MAS will consider factors such as the state of global implementation guidance, the industry's readiness and implementation progress in other jurisdictions,  she said in a statement. Basel has no powers of enforcement and relies on member countries to commit to the implementation of reforms agreed by the committee. A person familiar with the committee's workings said there was no sign of the FRTB being ditched outright. In addition, capital for trading books is a small proportion of a bank's total buffer and therefore a delay in the FRTB does not materially affect the bigger capital picture for the banking sector, this person said. Group of 20 (G20) countries meet in Germany this week to take stock of the implementation of global banking reforms. Mark Carney, chairman of the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial rules for the G20, warned on Monday that global growth would suffer if regulators give in to  reform fatigue  and fail to complete the agreed changes. But after an intensive decade of rule-making, some policymakers now want to prioritize growth over yet more complex banking regulation. U.S. President Donald Trump has said regulation is holding back lending and the U.S. Treasury has recommended delaying the FRTB, as well as another measure that strengthens bank funding. Regulators in Asia are worried their banks may be at a disadvantage if they push ahead with the rules while other countries hold back, the sources said. The European Union’s executive European Commission has proposed delaying its full application of FRTB, and officials are now waiting to see whether U.S. regulators follow the U.S. Treasury recommendation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said last month the FRTB rules would be implemented no earlier than January 2020, while the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) announced a delay in March that would likely see the rules come into force in 2021.

National elections can often dampen demand as buyers put off major purchases, with housebuilder Crest Nicholson cautioning about the impact of election uncertainty. McCarthy, whose business is slightly different as retirees often sell their houses to move into a McCarthy property, said the current uncertainty in the market could have a modest impact on the timing of conversion of existing reservations into completed sales. However, the impact has not been as severe as that seen in the aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, Chief Executive Clive Fenton told Reuters.  After the Brexit vote in June last year, we took the decision to pause and reevaluate some of our investments until the impact of the result became clearer. The effect of this was to push back our workflow by about three months,  he said.  We've made no such moves post the general election and are in fact increasing our workflow, almost doubling the amount of sales releases we have next year.  McCarthy shares were up 1.1 percent at 165.3 pence at 0915 GMT. They have fallen a third since the Brexit vote, which weakened the UK housebuilding market and weighed on McCarthy's first-half results. The builder also previously warned of some Brexit impact on current-year growth due to a weak forward order book and a more measured approach to land negotiation. However, it said on Wednesday it had been making  good progress  in rebuilding its forward order book after the shortfall it experienced following the referendum last year. The company said its forward order book had grown by 241 million pounds ($311.3 million) since March 1 to July 4, adding that overall reservations were in line with last year and sales indicators were well ahead. Average selling prices was over 280,000 pounds per unit during the period, up from 265,000 pounds a year earlier, with total forward sales, including legal completions, to date were in line with last year at 659 million pounds.  The market for high-quality retirement housing remains strong notwithstanding any potential uncertainty as a result of the UK general election outcome,  Fenton said.

At least three 90,000 tonne diesel cargoes were booked in recent days out of northwest Europe options to go to Singapore and the Middle East, shipping data showed. BP chartered the long-range Nan Lin Wan and Front Antares tankers for loading out of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage and refining hub in mid-July, the data showed. Vitol booked the 90,000 tonne Navig8 Goal tanker loading out of the Baltics with destination option for the Middle East also in mid-July, Singapore and northwest Europe.  It's very unusual for diesel cargoes to flow from Europe to the Far East. I don't remember this happening in the past few years,  a Singapore-based shipbroker said. Asia's diesel refining margins have received a reprieve recently, climbing to a 2-1/2-month high this week as a buying spree from India that began in April and higher than usual regional refinery maintenance lowering supply.  Europe, where around half of Europe's car fleet runs on diesel, imports diesel as local refineries can not meet regional demand. Imports from the Middle East and Asia, where a large number of state-of-the-art refineries have been constructed in recent years, have steadily increased to become a regular source of supply for Europe. But still, the strong Asian market in recent weeks has opened the rare arbitrage. The Netherlands shipped nearly 100,000 tonnes of diesel to Singapore in late June, data from trade agency International Enterprise showed. The trade may be workable for some traders though not for many, a Singapore-based trader said.  BP is likely shipping the cargo east as they are massively short in Asia,  a London-based trader said.  But there are not that many 10ppm shorts in Asia-Pacific except for Australia, so it will only work for a few players who have shorts there,  he added.     Europe imported around 1.4 million barrels per day of gasoil, which includes mostly diesel but also heating oil, in 2016, more than one fifth of the region's 6.2 million bpd demand, International Energy Agency data showed.

Cheaper Chinese rivals have ousted Ericsson as the biggest player in the mobile equipment market while its attempt to boost revenues by broadening its client base to include utilities, transport firms and media companies has been an expensive failure. Ericsson has drafted in a new CEO, but corporate activist investor Cevian Capital, led by Christer Gardell, recently bought a more than 5 percent stake and has been pushing for further change.  It is not unreasonable to believe he (Gardell) has pushed Johansson out,  said a fund manager with an investment in Ericsson but who declined to be named.   The company needs change and Johansson is not the man for change.  Shares in Ericsson were up 1.1 percent at 0854 GMT, easily outperforming Stockholm's blue-chip index. Johansson, who is 65, gave few clues as to why he had chosen to step down, saying only the company had a new strategy and a new shareholder structure.   It is natural to let the owners jointly propose a chairman and well ahead of this I want to announce that I will not be available for a next term,  he said in a statement.

The global downturn and weak emerging markets have added to its difficulties.  Swingeing cost cuts failed to turn things around and the firm fired its long-time CEO Hans Vestberg last summer as the patience of top shareholders such as Investor and Industrivarden ran out. Ericsson's shares have lost almost half their value in the last two years and the company reported an operating loss of 12.3 billion Swedish crowns ($1.45 billion) in the first quarter as a result of writedowns and restructuring costs, its second quarterly loss in a row.  New CEO Borje Ekholm has promised to refocus the group on core network equipment sales. But some shareholders have questioned the appointment as CEO of an insider who had sat on the board for years while Ericsson's star waned.  Johansson, a former CEO of tuck-maker Volvo has been chairman since 2011 and has also been seen by some as part of Ericsson's past, not its future. Cevian, which has previously pushed for value-creating structural changes at blue-chips such as truck maker Volvo and lender Swedbank, has said it supports Ekholm's strategy but has questioned his ability to carry it out.

At least three 90,000 tonne diesel cargoes were booked in recent days out of northwest Europe options to go to Singapore and the Middle East, shipping data showed. BP chartered the long-range Nan Lin Wan and Front Antares tankers for loading out of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp storage and refining hub in mid-July, the data showed. Vitol booked the 90,000 tonne Navig8 Goal tanker loading out of the Baltics with destination option for the Middle East also in mid-July, Singapore and northwest Europe.  It's very unusual for diesel cargoes to flow from Europe to the Far East. I don't remember this happening in the past few years,  a Singapore-based shipbroker said. Asia's diesel refining margins have received a reprieve recently, climbing to a 2-1/2-month high this week as a buying spree from India that began in April and higher than usual regional refinery maintenance lowering supply.  Europe, where around half of Europe's car fleet runs on diesel, imports diesel as local refineries can not meet regional demand. Imports from the Middle East and Asia, where a large number of state-of-the-art refineries have been constructed in recent years, have steadily increased to become a regular source of supply for Europe. But still, the strong Asian market in recent weeks has opened the rare arbitrage. The Netherlands shipped nearly 100,000 tonnes of diesel to Singapore in late June, data from trade agency International Enterprise showed. The trade may be workable for some traders though not for many, a Singapore-based trader said.  BP is likely shipping the cargo east as they are massively short in Asia,  a London-based trader said.  But there are not that many 10ppm shorts in Asia-Pacific except for Australia, so it will only work for a few players who have shorts there,  he added.     Europe imported around 1.4 million barrels per day of gasoil, which includes mostly diesel but also heating oil, in 2016, more than one fifth of the region's 6.2 million bpd demand, International Energy Agency data showed.

China has been the dominant force in badminton for decades but after sweeping all five titles at the 2012 London Olympics, last year's Rio Games proved far less productive for the Asian super power as other nations sought to take advantage. They bagged the men's singles and doubles titles but only added a solitary bronze to that tally as India's Pusarla Sindhu took silver in the women's singles, losing out to Spain's Carolina Marin in one of three finals without Chinese players. Sindhu's silver followed Saina Nehwal's bronze in London for success-starved India, but Kidambi Srikanth's three consecutive Super Series finals appearances has given badminton a shot in the arm in the world's second-most populous country.  For the number of people who have taken up playing the sport, I will say yes,  Gopichand said when asked if India was on the verge of a badminton revolution.  And hopefully these performances are more consistent.  It's not only my academy, all academies across the country are running full. There are many, many parents who want their kids to give up everything and concentrate on badminton.  Srikanth lost to compatriot B. Sai Praneeth in the final in Singapore before going on to win in Indonesia and Australia, where he beat Chinese Olympic and world champion Chen Long. In Indonesia, HS Prannoy also shone as he defeated three-times Olympic silver medallist Lee Chong Wei and China's Chen in consecutive rounds before losing in the semi-finals.  China as a dominant force has been challenged, both in the men's and women's. We have been responsible for it,  beamed Gopichand when asked if China's hegemony was over.  But I think the world championships, the Olympics are the big championships and medals which are critical. When we can beat them at those big events then I feel we can say that.  Fitness Focus All three men's players, Nehwal and Sindhu are products of the Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad, where the former All England champion credits a focus on fitness for the success and said many years of hard work was finally bearing fruit.  If we look at the performances in the last few years it has been good,  the 43-year-old said.  We have been able to work better as a unit and all players have been peaking at the right time.  The fitness levels are higher... we were not fit enough to play at the highest level. Technically, we have been good for a long time but in fitness levels, we were lacking.  At grassroots level, badminton was going in a certain direction but to beat them (China) we needed to play in a different style. The kind of badminton we were playing was not in tune with what was needed at the highest level.  India now boasts a larger pool of players poised to succeed at the highest level but Gopichand is not resting on his laurels, yearning for a more robust system and better coaching. Indonesian Mulyo Handoyo, best known for guiding countryman Taufik Hidayat to Olympic gold in 2004, has been added to India's coaching staff, which Gopichand says has given him more time to focus on the needs of players individually.  Although I am very happy and very satisfied with the performances, I think for us to be sustainable, for us to call ourselves a superpower in badminton there is still a lot of work which needs to be done structurally,  he said.  I think for the next generation to come up, we need to put a system in place which actually identifies and nurtures talent. We have grown exponentially but there is lot more which needs to be done.  It's quite hard to push a rock up the mountain but if you slip then it slips back very fast.  The stellar results have earned Gopichand the moniker of 'Super Coach', hardly surprising considering the amount of work he continues to put in at his academy.  I think it's a huge responsibility... a coach's job is tough and in India it is even tougher,  Gopichand added.  It's been 13 years, regular, disciplined work ethic and very little time off to do anything else. And to work 12-14 hours on most days, stressful days. If I were to call that sacrifice, it is.  But honestly I have loved each part of the journey and never felt it was a sacrifice.  (Editing by John O'Brien)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/badminton-india-gopichand-idUSL3N1JV23U"},

The editor of the Abu Dhabi government linked al-Ittihad newspaper wrote in an editorial that Qatar was  walking alone in its dreams and illusions, far away from its Gulf Arab brothers . Foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain will consider whether to escalate, or less likely abandon, the boycott imposed on Qatar last month that has rattled a key oil-producing region and unnerved strategic Western allies. Qatar faces further isolation and possible expulsion from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) if its response to a list of demands made nearly two weeks ago is not deemed satisfactory. The Arab countries have demanded Qatar curtail its support for the Muslim Brotherhood, shut down the pan-Arab al Jazeera TV channel, close down a Turkish base and downgrade its ties with regional arch-rival Iran. They view Qatar's independent diplomatic stances and support for 2011  Arab Spring  uprisings as support for terrorism and a dangerous breaking of ranks - charges Doha vigorously denies. Qatar has countered that the Arab countries want to curb free speech and take over its foreign policy, saying their 13 demands are so harsh they were made to be rejected. The gas-rich state had raised its international profile dramatically in recent years, drawing on huge gas revenues, and developed its economy with ambitious infrastructure projects. It is due to host the soccer world cup in 2022. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said at a joint news conference with his German counterpart on Tuesday that its response was  given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution , but insisted that Doha would not compromise on its sovereignty. Gulf officials have said the demands are not negotiable, signalling more sanctions are possible, including  parting ways  with Doha - a suggestion it may be ejected from the GCC, a regional economic and security cooperation body founded in 1981.  A Gulf national may be obliged to prepare psychologically for his Gulf to be without Qatar,  the editor of the Abu Dhabi al-Ittihad newspaper said. Some newspapers said remarks by Sheikh Mohammed in which he stressed his country would not compromise on its sovereignty suggeststhat Doha would not change its policies. Qatari officials have repeatedly said the demands are so draconian that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead seeing to hobble Doha's sovereignty. At the same time, they have said Qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to issues they view as a legitimate concern to fellow GCC member states.

The currency shed 0.2 percent by 0816 GMT.     Some other Central European currencies like the leu also eased, but less than the zloty, while the forint was steady after Hungary published May retail sales data showing a robust 5.4 percent annual growth.     Growth in the region's economies has been picking up this year due to a surge in wages, healthy demand from Western European export markets and faster inflows of funding from the European Union.     But inflation has been relatively subdued after a pick-up since last year, and in the region only the Czech central bank has shifted to a hawkish rhetoric.     Analysts' forecasts for the Polish central bank's first rate hike shifted in the past two months to the last quarter of 2018 from the second quarter, according to Reuters polls.      The shift, caused by signals from the bank that tightening is in the distant future, was accompanied by a retreat of the zloty from its strongest levels since the summer of 2015, but it has still gained almost 4 percent since December.     Dovish signals from the bank and continuing monetary policy tightening elsewhere in the world may weigh on the zloty in the near future, Pekao bank analysts said in a note.        The bank's new economic forecasts and its news conference, due at 1400 GMT, will be closely watched, but any significant change in its stance is unlikely, analysts said.      The MPC (Monetary Policy Council) will get an update of the projection, most likely with higher path of GDP, but with CPI still staying below the 2.5 percent target by the end of 2019,  BZ WBK analysts said in a note.      We think the revised CPI path will not include lower (than expected) June reading (at 1.5 percent year-on-year) so the central bank's forecasts could be too high,  they added.     Polish government bond prices were treading water, with mild weakening bias, after gains in the past week, with the yield on the 10-year benchmark paper trading at 3.2895 percent.     The zloty could get support from strong economic fundamentals and recurring speculation for central bank rate hikes if upcoming inflation figures are higher, Raiffeisen analsts said in a note.     That, and low primary supply could also support Polish government bonds, they added.

The City of London's prominence as Europe's financial hub has been put into question by Britain's decision to leave the EU, which threatens to make it harder for London firms to access the bloc's single market. But an ECB study found that any withdrawal from London would likely be gradual as firms would be loath to give up on Britain's fiber-optic cables, crucial for ultra-fast electronic trading.  The UK’s advantage as a hub for trading using fiber-optic cables, combined with institutional inertia, suggest that any relocation of trading after Brexit, if at all, would likely be gradual,  the ECB said in its study. Around 84 percent of transactions in euro are initiated outside the euro area, with Britain taking the lion's share at 43 percent, according to a survey by the Bank for International Settlement cited in the ECB study.  Technology has economically important implications for the distribution of foreign exchange transactions across financial centers, as a result,  the ECB said.  Undersea fiber-optic cables provide a competitive advantage to financial centers located near oceans, like Singapore, because they are directly connected to the internet backbone, at the expense of landlocked cities like Zurich,  it added.

On a year-on-year basis prices rose by 6.3 percent in June, below the 8.3 percent seen in May and down from 13 percent seen as late as February, Real Estate Norway said. Tighter mortgage regulations, lower population growth and a boom in construction, flooding the market with new homes, have all contributed to the recent market turnaround. The association now believes the average price of a Norwegian home will grow by 5-6 percent in 2017, below a forecast made last December of a 9-11 percent increase, it added. Unadjusted prices fell by 1.6 percent in June from May. A decline in housing prices will likely contribute to keeping the central bank's key policy interest rate at record lows, most economists say.

The biggest drop was recorded in the use of the euro as a funding currency, mostly due to the high cost of hedging against a fall in its value using swaps.   The very simple message is that the euro has continued to lose ground as an international currency,  ECB board member Benoit Coeure said on Wednesday.  But the euro is unchallenged as the second most important currency in the international monetary system.  However, central banks still increased their reserves in euros, partially reflecting views that the bloc is slowly moving past its protracted debt crisis. Reflecting the growing importance of the Chinese currency, the ECB placed around 500 million euros worth of its foreign currency reserves into renminbi earlier this year and Coeure said this may be followed up by further purchases.  We believe that he renminbi has a role in a diversified portfolio,  Coeure told a news conference, calling the ECB's purchase a first step.  We want our reserves to be liquid and readily available. If that step is successful, we’ll do more, at a later stage,  he added.  Almost 20 percent of foreign reserves were held in euros globally at the end of last year and Coeure said data suggested this may continue to rise.  The U.S. dollar remained by far the world's most important currency, holding just below two thirds of the global market for international debt, international loans and foreign reserves, the ECB's data showed.  The international role of the euro is primarily determined by market forces and the Eurosystem neither hinders nor promotes the international use of the euro,  ECB President Mario Draghi said in the report.  At the same time, the ECB will continue to monitor developments and publish information on the international role of the euro on a regular basis.

GSK was the biggest loser in London's FTSE-100 index after Citigroup downgraded the stock to neutral from buy and cut earnings forecasts by up to 9 percent. HIV medicines, which GSK sells through its ViiV Healthcare unit, have been star performers in its pharma business in recent years and GSK plans to defend its patch with a new two-drug treatment regimen for controlling the virus behind AIDS. But arch-rival Gilead Sciences is developing a rival three-in-one daily pill and Merck & Co also has a novel medicine that could challenge both. Citi analyst Andrew Baum said Merck could in fact end up beating both GSK and Gilead with its new drug EFdA, which may reach the market as early as 2021 and has the potential to be developed as both a daily pill and a twice-yearly injection. Given the early nature of Merck's experimental product, Citi currently forecasts heavily risk-adjusted peak annual sales of $150 million for EFdA but it believes commercial success could add more than $5 billion to forecasts. GSK's HIV drug dolutegravir, which is used in the medicines Tivicay and Triumeq, has been the mainstay of the British group's HIV operation and investors are nervous about any threat to what is a highly profitable business. Antiretroviral therapy has turned HIV from a death sentence into a manageable condition but patients need to stay on treatment for life, so there is a growing focus on making medication as convenient and well-tolerated as possible.

The soft market tone sidelined a few issuers, leaving only Hindustan Petroleum and SPDB Hong Kong to test the primary market with US dollar deals today. The new issuers will however be encouraged by the strong gains in newly priced bonds from Qinghai Provincial Investment Group, which sold US$300m of 6.4% bonds that priced at par yesterday. The bonds rallied a point this morning, and gained further to slightly over 101.00 in the afternoon. Other new issues were steady. Bank of China's floating-rate notes due 2019 and 2022, priced at par, were seen at 100.00/100.06 and 99.9/100.05. Rural Electrification's 2027s were under water at 99.5/99.7. Asian credit spreads were fla    t to a touch wider with the iTraxx Asia IG indicated at 87bp/89bp. Despite the missile test from its neighbour, South Korea's five-year CDS widened just 1.8bp although South Korean corporate credits saw larger widening in a 2bp-5bp range.

Ocado Chief Executive Tim Steiner said Amazon's purchase of the upmarket grocer had made existing bricks and mortar supermarket players in the United States think harder about the competition they will be facing in the coming years.  Therefore we’ve seen increased interest in our (technology) solution from players in the U.S.,  he said after Ocado reported a 2.7 percent rise in first half core earnings. Ocado pioneered the use of software and automation to pick online grocery orders in huge warehouses, rather than by hand in stores.  Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods has brought renewed focus on online grocery shopping in Britain, where it accounts for 7.6 percent of total grocery sales and is growing by over 10 percent a year, according to researchers Kantar Worldpanel. Ocado has a UK grocery market share of 1.3 percent. Some analysts believe the Amazon/Whole Foods deal increases the chances of an Amazon takeover of Ocado or of a partnership deal, or of other U.S. grocers seeking Ocado's technology. But others argue Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, a traditional retailer, makes Ocado its least likely UK target.  We’ve never been trying to sell ourselves ... It’s not a focus of ours to try and sell the business,  said Steiner. He dismissed the suggestion that Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods was an admission by the world's biggest online retailer that stores are required for food retailing.  I think they (Amazon) just bought a player in the U.S. that has a very high quality recognized brand name and recognized sourcing,  he said.  I don’t think they know yet what their model’s going to be ... I imagine they bought it as a stepping stone towards their future ambition.  Ocado, founded by three former Goldman Sachs bankers in 2000, has divided analysts like few other stocks, with some viewing its home deliveries from giant distribution centers as the future of grocery shopping and others seeing it as a costly and complicated venture that will never make sustained profits. Partnerships with retailers overseas are seen by analysts as the key influence on Ocado's stock market valuation. Last month, Ocado clinched a long awaited first overseas deal with an as yet unnamed European retailer. It said on Wednesday that deal would be  the first of many.   Grocery retailing is changing and we are ideally positioned to enable other retailers to achieve their online aspirations,  said Steiner. Ocado, which sells products supplied by upmarket grocer Waitrose and also has its own distribution agreement with Morrisons, made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 45.2 million pounds ($58.3 million) in the 26 weeks to May 28. That was ahead of analysts' average forecast of 44.8 million pounds. Retail revenue rose 12.5 percent to 659.6 million pounds. Ocado published results for the first 22 weeks of the period last month.

The City of London's prominence as Europe's financial hub has been put into question by Britain's decision to leave the EU, which threatens to make it harder for London firms to access the bloc's single market. But an ECB study found that any withdrawal from London would likely be gradual as firms would be loath to give up on Britain's fiber-optic cables, crucial for ultra-fast electronic trading.  The UK’s advantage as a hub for trading using fiber-optic cables, combined with institutional inertia, suggest that any relocation of trading after Brexit, if at all, would likely be gradual,  the ECB said in its study. Around 84 percent of transactions in euro are initiated outside the euro area, with Britain taking the lion's share at 43 percent, according to a survey by the Bank for International Settlement cited in the ECB study.  Technology has economically important implications for the distribution of foreign exchange transactions across financial centers, as a result,  the ECB said.  Undersea fiber-optic cables provide a competitive advantage to financial centers located near oceans, like Singapore, because they are directly connected to the internet backbone, at the expense of landlocked cities like Zurich,  it added.

The biggest drop was recorded in the use of the euro as a funding currency, mostly due to the high cost of hedging against a fall in its value using swaps.   The very simple message is that the euro has continued to lose ground as an international currency,  ECB board member Benoit Coeure said on Wednesday.  But the euro is unchallenged as the second most important currency in the international monetary system.  However, central banks still increased their reserves in euros, partially reflecting views that the bloc is slowly moving past its protracted debt crisis. Reflecting the growing importance of the Chinese currency, the ECB placed around 500 million euros worth of its foreign currency reserves into renminbi earlier this year and Coeure said this may be followed up by further purchases.  We believe that he renminbi has a role in a diversified portfolio,  Coeure told a news conference, calling the ECB's purchase a first step.  We want our reserves to be liquid and readily available. If that step is successful, we’ll do more, at a later stage,  he added.  Almost 20 percent of foreign reserves were held in euros globally at the end of last year and Coeure said data suggested this may continue to rise.  The U.S. dollar remained by far the world's most important currency, holding just below two thirds of the global market for international debt, international loans and foreign reserves, the ECB's data showed.  The international role of the euro is primarily determined by market forces and the Eurosystem neither hinders nor promotes the international use of the euro,  ECB President Mario Draghi said in the report.  At the same time, the ECB will continue to monitor developments and publish information on the international role of the euro on a regular basis.

The  Tmall Genie , named after the company's e-commerce platform Tmall, costs 499 yuan ($73.42), significantly less than western counterparts by Amazon and Alphabet Inc's Google, which range from $120 to $180. These devices are activated by voice commands to perform tasks, such as checking calendars, searching for weather reports, changing music or control smart-home devices, using internet connectivity and artificial intelligence. China's top tech firms have ambitions to become world leaders in artificial intelligence as companies, including Alibaba and Amazon, increasingly compete for the same markets. Baidu, China's top search engine, which has invested in an artificial intelligence lab with the Chinese government, recently launched a device based on its own siri-like  Duer OS  system.

It is activated when a recognised user says  Tmall Genie  in Chinese. In a streamed demonstration on Wednesday, engineers ordered the device to buy and deliver some Coca Cola, play music, add credit to a phone and activate a smart humidifier and TV. The device, which comes in black and white, can also be tasked with purchasing goods from the company's Tmall platform, a function similar to Amazon's Echo device. Alibaba has invested heavily in offline stores and big data capabilities in an effort to capitalise on the entire supply chain as part of its retail strategy, increasingly drawing comparisons with similar strategies adopted by Amazon. It recently began rolling out unstaffed brick-and-motor grocery and coffee shops, using QR codes that users can scan to complete payment on its Alipay app, which has over 450 million users. Amazon launched a similar concept of stores in December. ($1=6.7962 yuan) Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Neil Fullick","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/alibaba-ai-idUSL3N1JW2TI"},

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent by 0831 GMT in choppy trade, while the blue chip index also fell 0.1 percent. Miners rose 0.9 percent, hitting a two-month high after Credit Suisse upgraded the sector to  overweight  in its latest global equity strategy update, saying the sector was a more rewarding play on higher oil prices, interest rates and inflation. Glencore, which rose 2.2 percent, also supported Britain's commodity-heavy FTSE 100, with BHP Billiton in tow as Chinese steel rebar futures rallied. Among individual movers, British housebuilder Persimmon jumped around 3 percent after it reported a 7 percent rise in first-half sales, with the market unaffected by the UK's June general election.  (There's been) a fair bit of concern regarding the housing sector, what the outlook might be like with the uncertainty caused by the general election and the Brexit negotiations ongoing,  Dafydd Davies, partner at Charles Hanover Investments, said.  However, we do see further upside (to) the housebuilders due to the current shortage of housing stock there is still in the UK.  Shares in Adidas were the biggest individual gainers, rising 4.3 percent to the top of the STOXX after HSBC said that the sporting goods firm was likely to increase its outlook, upgrading it to  buy .  We believe the sales growth story and associated margin expansion plan make this stock a very visible compounder,  HSBC analysts said in a note. Interest rate-sensitive utilities and health care stocks were a weak spot, with pharmaceuticals dragged down by GlaxoSmithKline, which fell after a downgrade from Citigroup to  neutral  from  buy , citing a slowdown in market for HIV drugs if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is repealed. A rise in interest rates has been a focus for markets ever since central banks hinted at a possible tightening in monetary policy, with a rise in bond yields making high dividend-paying stocks less attractive.

The dollar rose 0.3 percent to trade at 113.59 yen, its highest level in nearly two months. Against the euro, the greenback was broadly flat at $1.13530.  Latest Fed communication suggests US monetary authorities are willing to look through currently weak inflation data,  Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note recommending selling the yen and Australian and New Zealand dollars against their U.S. counterpart.  It may not be only the Fed providing the USD with a lift. June labour market data starting with the release of the ADP report tomorrow, completed by Friday’s NFP, could start turning the U.S. surprise indicator around.  The yen tends to be bought back at times of heightened global uncertainty because of expectations Japanese investors may repatriate their foreign investment, despite the country's proximity to North Korea. Pyongyang said on Wednesday it had conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can carry a large and heavy nuclear warhead. That triggered a call by Washington for global action to hold the isolated nation accountable for its pursuit of nuclear weapons. With very little in the way of big U.S. economic data in the coming days, the release of the June 14 Fed minutes will dominate the next 24 hours. Investors will look for clues on the likely outlook of the balance sheet reduction. In other currencies, sterling languished at one-week lows on Wednesday as investors reduced positions amid growing evidence the economy was facing headwinds.  The pressure will remain on the sterling in the short term as the downside risks have intensified and in that backdrop the recent hawkishness by central bank officials may not be justified,  said Bank of New York Mellon strategist Neil Mellor. Data earlier this week offered more evidence of softness in the UK economy with a purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey showing activity falling to 54.8 in June. That was still above the 50 level that denotes growth but down from May's 18-month high of 56.0 and slightly below the median forecast of a Reuters poll. On Tuesday, a Bank of England policymaker who last month voted to raise interest rates was quoted as saying on Tuesday that he was  reasonably confident  that investment and exports would compensate for a consumer slowdown. Last week, Governor Mark Carney said a rise in rates was likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity and the BoE would debate when to do so  in the coming months . That prompted the sterling to post its best weekly performance in eight months last week. The Canadian dollar also held firm, trading at C$1.2944 per dollar after having hit a 10-month high of C$1.2912 to the dollar on Tuesday.

The FTSE 100 had risen 0.1 percent by 0830 GMT, outperforming the broader European market, while mid-caps gained 0.5 percent. Persimmon gained 3.4 percent, on track for its best day in four months, after a robust trading statement which set the housebuilders up for gains as they absorbed a sign of resilience to pressures on the British consumer. Persimmon said the British general election hadn't impacted consumers' demand for new houses, and sales rose 7 percent for the first half.  All we've had at the moment from the housebuilders is signs that things are going better than expected,  said Barry Gibb, research analyst at Beaufort Securities, adding that there is scope for a modest upgrade of estimates by the market in a sector under considerable scrutiny.  If any of the mainstream housebuilders were to suggest that they are seeing a greater pressure on pricing or reduced level of viewings, it could be taken quite badly by the market,  he added. Housebuilders Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey also rose on the more optimistic tone struck by Persimmon over the state of demand for houses. Also a top gainer was supermarket chain Tesco, up 3 percent after forecast-beating sales figures from wholesaler Booker, which has been under scrutiny from investors since Tesco announced its plan to acquire it. Miners Glencore and BHP Billiton climbed as basic resource stocks across Europe made robust gains. Drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline suffered the worst of the handful of fallers, down 1.4 percent after Citigroup cut its rating on the stock to 'neutral' from 'buy, citing slowing HIV market growth. The broker said risk of the repeal of the U.S. Affordable Care Act could negatively affect volumes and/or price in the HIV treatment market. Among mid-caps, construction materials supplier SIG jumped 5.8 percent after it said revenue rose 8.1 percent in the first half, helped by strength in mainland Europe.  Underlying trading has improved relative to the second half of 2016, with European growth outpacing that of the UK, and good progress has been made on reducing leverage,  said Jefferies analyts. Online grocer Ocado made more modest gains, up 0.3 percent as investors seemed to shrug off its first half results, in which it said it expected a recently clinched international deal would be  the first of many . Ocado shares rose sharply in the aftermath of the Amazon-Whole Foods merger deal amid speculation the company could be the object of a future partnership with the U.S. retail giant as it pushes into food distribution. The company said it had seen a pick-up in interest from U.S. players since the deal.

Police said the items found also included batons, bottles and cans presumed to be filled with flammable liquid, containers with unknown powder or chemicals, and gas masks. De Maiziere said during a visit to Hamburg that peaceful protests were welcome and permissible in a democracy but violent demonstrators could not invoke the right to the freedom of assembly and would be suppressed.  No demonstrator can determine whether and when and where leaders of states and governments meet in Germany upon the chancellor's invitation,  he said, stressing that the summit would not be disrupted by protests.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent, regaining half the losses it saw on Tuesday when North Korea fired a missile into Japanese waters. The organisation's global shares index gained 0.1 percent, helped by early gains for most of Europe's major markets. A shift towards more hawkish language by several major central banks has dominated the past week and left markets unsure of how much longer emergency stimulus in Europe will continue to support global asset prices. For now investors seem to be giving policymakers the benefit of the doubt that the global economy can take any tightening of monetary policy, although the latest data on Wednesday was mixed - strong in Europe and weaker in China. The Fed minutes will be searched by investors for signs of more concern among policymakers about a downturn in inflation and activity in the United States.  North Korea has rattled markets but central bankers are more important,  said Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index in London.  While North Korea’s military ambitions are a background threat for markets, we don’t think that this particular geopolitical event is at the stage yet where it will cause a spike in volatility.  South Korea's main index rebounded by 0.36 percent and Japan's Nikkei ended up 0.25 percent. Shanghai stocks rose more than 1 percent, despite a drop in the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) to 51.6 in June, from 52.8 in May. IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 56.3 in June, down from May but comfortably beating a flash estimate, chalking up the best performance last quarter in over six years. Currency markets were in limbo, the euro trading just over half a cent below last week's 14-month highs against the dollar. The dollar and yen were the main victims of the shift in language last week, but many analysts wonder whether the European Central Bank will be able to rein in money-printing later this year if the euro keeps gaining.  I meet a lot of people while I talk to clients who think the ECB simply won't be able to escape its current policy setting because a stronger currency is too damaging,  said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes.  The thought the ECB will resist pressure...is still leading many ... to look for cheaper levels to buy euro.  The dollar was less than 0.1 percent higher against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength and 0.1 percent lower at $1.1353 per euro.

Fishing channels widen as barrier islands disappear, and unremarkable rainstorms leave roads flooded. Withered, blackened cypress and oak trees, succumbing to an invasion of salt water, turn once lush land into eerie ghost forests. Some 120,000 people live on the most vulnerable shrinking lowlands south of New Orleans, fishing for shrimp and crawfish, harvesting oysters or working in the shipyards, oil refineries and petrochemical plants along the river banks and Gulf shores. They face difficult decisions over whether to stay and fight, or flee their diminishing land - yet even getting their attention to the looming threats is no easy task. Warnings that Louisiana is losing more than 10,000 acres - equal to 10,000 American football fields - of wetlands each year are often met with skepticism, distrust and resignation.  Most people, they're trying to live their life,  said Richie Blink, who lives in Empire, a town on a skinny stretch of river delta laced with canals to the Gulf.  They're worried about putting food on the table within the next two weeks and not what's going to happen 50 years from now.  Many work in the energy or commercial fishing industries, where depressed prices are costing jobs, he said. Blink, 30, volunteers with LA SAFE (Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments), a $40 million project funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It is asking coastal residents how they would like to adapt to changes predicted in the next 10, 25 and 50 years. The delta that fans into the Gulf of Mexico, formed from silt carried by the Mississippi River, is subsiding and is no longer replenished by the powerful waterway. Instead, the river is lined by levees, or raised banks, that rush its water past the delta into the depths of the Gulf. Losing Land Maps of southern Louisiana a few decades ago show a boot of land, not unlike southern Italy, that is all but gone now.  Deprived of silt and fresh water, and sliced by hundreds of miles of deeply dredged shipping channels, the shrinking wetlands are growing less effective as natural barriers to storm surges from hurricanes, putting the area at higher risk of devastation.  It looks pretty out here, but a storm comes along and half the land leaves,  said Nicky Alfonso, 52, a commercial fisherman docked at Pointe à la Hache between the Gulf and a river levee.  We're not the scientists, but we see what's happening,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We're losing land.  Many low-lying coastal regions in the United States face erosion and rising sea level, linked to climate change, but the Mississippi delta is particularly vulnerable because it is sinking as well.  It is subsiding an average of 9 millimeters (0.35 inches) a year, 50 percent faster than had been thought two years ago, according to Tulane University geologists, who described the coast of Louisiana as one of the  most vulnerable  in the world.  We are in a race against time in Louisiana,  Governor John Bel Edwards said in March, announcing LA SAFE - which he said could become a national model for threatened communities. Related Coverage'Our culture is dying': Rising waters menace more than land in LouisianaFactbox: A $50 billion wish list to keep Louisiana coast above water A few of our most vulnerable coastal communities will need to contemplate resettlement over the next 50 years, while others are likely to experience population and economic contraction as a result of ongoing land loss and sea level rise,  he said. One such community is an Indian tribe on Louisiana's Isle de Jean Charles, in the process of relocating with $48 million in government funds after losing most of its land to the sea. At recent LA SAFE meetings, held in schools and church meeting rooms in parishes along the coast, residents tossed around ideas to adapt to the shifting landscape, from elevating houses to promoting local seafood or building public transport. LA SAFE works alongside the state's Coastal Master Plan, a blueprint of more than 120 projects to fight coastal loss in the next 50 years. Fully funded, the plan would cost $50 billion. An initial LA SAFE meeting in Plaquemines Parish, home to some 23,000 people, drew a crowd of 139 inhabitants. But a follow-up meeting centered on the parish's east bank drew fewer than two dozen, and a meeting at its southern tip just nine. Clipboards and Surveys Locals are tired of being the subjects of a seemingly endless string of studies since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said Darilyn Turner, 43, who runs Zion Travelers Cooperative Center, a coastal restoration group in Plaquemines. Katrina devastated low-lying Plaquemines and neighboring Lafourche Parish, followed five years later by the BP  oil spill that poured millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and fouled 100 miles (160 km) of coastline. BP agreed to pay about $18.7 billion in damages caused by the spill, settling with the U.S. and state governments. Louise St. Pierre, right, attends a meeting of LA SAFE (Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments) in Thibodaux, Louisiana, United States on June 5, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation / Ellen Wulfhorst. LA SAFE is a $40 million federally funded project asking residents of the vulnerable coast how they would like to adapt to environmental changes predicted in coming decades. St. Pierre said she is concerned that the area’s historic Cajun culture will be lost as the swamps and wetlands disappear under rising sea level, salt water intrusion and erosion. You come in here with your clipboards and your surveys,  said Turner.  Then you never hear from them again.  People want results,  she said. But make no mistake, they are concerned.  Just standing outside on their lawns, people are having conversations about the coast and why we need to be protected,  she said. Living next to a levee on the Mississippi River's east bank, Gerard Griffin, 70, sees melting polar ice caps and subsiding land as real threats, but is suspicious of efforts to help. He figures industry and the government want the mineral and natural gas-rich land of Plaquemines for themselves.  Down in the country, I think they been trying to discourage us,  he said.  If they can get us to leave and sell out, then that's what they want.  Charter fishing boat captain Cody Bulot said unrepaired roads and levees are proof the government wants residents to go.  There's a lot of money to be made down here. This is the gateway to the Gulf,  said Bulot, 30.  But it won't work, he added. Houses in Plaquemines Parish, located on the Mississippi River delta, are often raised in an effort to withstand flooding and hurricane storm surges, Braithwaite, Lousiana on June 7, 2017. This house, which is for sale, has been elevated more than 19 feet (6 meters). Thomson Reuters Foundation / Ellen Wulhorst.Bulot rebuilt after losing his house to Katrina, the way his grandparents did after Hurricanes Betsy in 1965 and Camille four years later.  I've been below sea level my whole life. I'll be below sea level my whole life,  he said. Besides, while he sees the delta sinking and the coast eroding, he is skeptical about the water rising.  Somebody prove to me, scientifically fact, that the water keeps rising,  he challenged.  It's not.  Shrimp Shift  Science in fact does show the water getting higher. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration reports that global mean sea level is rising at a rate of 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year. Studies say the rate is accelerating, fed by thawing ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of ocean water as the planet warms. LA SAFE volunteer Blink said narrowing such broad issues to very specific local impacts can underline their urgency.  You talk about international climate and global weather patterns and things like that, it's very hard for people to understand,  he said.  But when you're talking with a commercial fisherman and they tell you that the shrimp are showing up a full two months earlier than they were in the 1960s and the 1970s, then they acknowledge that there are changes,  he said. Fishermen also report seeing certain species of insects and birds for the first time, indicating changing climate patterns, Blink said. While plenty of people in southern Louisiana may experience disappearing land and rising water, they may not believe the government has their best interests at heart, said John Doucet, a geneticist at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana, and a faculty member at its Center for Bayou Studies. One reason, he said, is that they have not been protected from the sky-rocketing costs of buying flood insurance - something banks require before making home loans.  There's a large anxiety about trusting government to make good choices for the people,  he said. Neither do they take well to outsiders telling them what to do, a wariness that goes back in time, he said. The Cajuns descend from people brutally expelled in the 18th century from what is now Canada. They made their way to Louisiana, where they landed along its southern bayous, the slow-moving waterways that course through the swampland.  Many died of disease and starvation along the way.  Now these folks are being pushed again,  said Doucet.  There's probably inter-generational distrust that's pretty strong.

Our culture is dying,  said St. Pierre, who lives in Lafourche Parish, where cypress trees are hung with lacy strands of Spanish moss and alligators lurk in bayous, the region's slow-moving swamp waterways.  It's not like it was.  People are moving away from the parish, or county, some 60 miles (97 km) southwest of New Orleans, faced with growing flood risks and unable to pay for insurance, which can reach thousands of dollars and is required by mortgage banks in high-risk areas. Since Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, nearly 10 percent of Lafourche's population has left its southernmost end that is flood-prone and vulnerable to storm surges. Attrition due to soaring insurance premiums is visible from the proliferation of  For Sale  signs on houses and boats, said Gary LaFleur, a biologist and faculty member at the Center for Bayou Studies at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux.  No government is coming in and kicking people out, but all of a sudden the insurance rates are going up so high that it's like a slow economic way of leading to a ghost town,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Within 50 years the town is gone.  Lafourche has been home for centuries to Cajuns who are descended from French-speaking settlers expelled in the 18th century from what is now Canada. Cajun culture is renowned for its spicy cuisine and lively traditional music.  It's a lifestyle, people, language - just the way you were brought up by your parents and grandparents,  said St. Pierre. Traditions such as the blessing of the fleets in the bayous - once an annual ceremony for shrimpers and others - are dimming as the ranks of family-owned fishing boats dwindle, he said.  When you see one shrimp boat and it's followed by five party boats, you think, aww, this isn't as cool as it used to be,  he said. St. Pierre, known as Ms. Louise, sells her miniature Cajun paintings to customers at craft shows.  They can send them to their nephew in New York and say, 'Hey, that is a part of our culture. Don't forget',  she said. Oil Money St. Pierre, 65, learned French from her grandparents and meets each Tuesday night with fellow francophones, whose numbers are falling. Fewer than 14,000 people in Lafourche are native French speakers, according to the latest census figures, down from some 16,000 a decade earlier. And St. Pierre cooks a mean Cajun meal.  I can make you gumbo and jambalaya, and do your etouffees and of course boiled shrimp and crawfish, fried oysters,  she said.  And I love alligator tails.  But oyster beds were hit hard by the massive BP oil spill in 2010, crabs are under pressure from wetland loss, and cheap foreign imports have depressed local seafood prices. Added to that, saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico is killing vegetation where rabbit, deer and other Cajun delicacies used to thrive, she said. Towns such as Leeville, once a vibrant fishing center, are under threat. The main artery was elevated to a causeway to avoid rising water, so the road that went through downtown now goes overhead, LaFleur said.  Leeville didn't get washed away, but because they had to raise the road, now people just don't go to Leeville anymore,  he said.  That's kind of killing that community right there.  Locals worry too about a loss of federal funding to protect the coast, advocated by the Trump administration. Under the 2006 Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA), four states, including Louisiana, get nearly 40 percent of federal oil revenue from drilling off their coasts.  Louisiana officials have said the state could see as much as $140 million of GOMESA money for coastal restoration in a year. But Trump's proposed budget would divert that cash to the federal treasury. The Obama administration also sought to divert GOMESA funding but was blocked by Congress.  If we don't get that money this year, you can just kiss everything goodbye,  St. Pierre said.

Horn improved his unbeaten record to 17-0-1 after the judges scored the bout 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 in the 29-year-old's favor but many observers questioned the outcome, saying the officials had made a  hometown decision . While Horn dismissed criticism of his win, the regulatory body of professional sport in the Philippines, the Games and Amusement Board (GAB), requested a  thorough review  of the fight on Monday and Pacquiao has backed their demand.  WBO should take appropriate action on the letter sent by the Games and Amusement Board (GAB) so as not to erode the people's interest in boxing,  eight-division world champion Pacquiao said in a statement on Wednesday.  On my part, I had already accepted the decision but as a leader and, at the same time, fighter, I have the moral obligation to uphold sportsmanship, truth and fairness in the eyes of the public.   I love boxing and I don't wanna see it dying because of (an) unfair decision and officiating.  On Tuesday, the WBO said that the decision could not be reversed and highlighted the rematch clause in both fighters' contracts.  The discretion of a referee or judge cannot be reversed, except in a case of fraud or violation of laws which is not the case in Pac vs Horn,  the organization said on their Twitter account.  The contract for Pac vs Horn provides a rematch clause, which the WBO is in accordance if the promoters decide to move forward.

I ask my friends everywhere in the country to organize rallies for July 12,  said Melenchon, the head of the France Unbowed party who gathered one in five votes in the first round of the presidential election in April. Speaking on BFM TV, Melenchon was fiercely critical of  Macron's first two months in power. Macron this week called a special meeting of the both houses of parliament at which he told lawmakers he would use a referendum to get parliamentary reforms through if necessary.

He thinks he can fix all the problems by force. He is wrong.   Melenchon mobilized the militant leftist vote in the presidential contest and has emerged a forceful voice in a fragmented left. His party, though, won only 17 seats in the parliamentary election which gave Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) party a large majority in the 577-seat lower house. In addition, France's powerful trade unions have so far been muted in their reaction to the program outlined by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Tuesday.

That should push Chinese steelmakers to use more of the material in coming years, potentially sapping demand for steel ingredient iron ore from the world's biggest metals consumer. Faltering appetite for iron ore could hit a critical lifeline for international mining giants which have banked on China continuing to suck up hundreds of millions of tons of the most widely traded bulk commodity.   In the medium to long term, scrap is the real threat to iron ore, for sure,  said Daniel Meng, an analyst at brokerage CLSA in Hong Kong.   We believe by 2020, replacement would become faster and the risk on iron ore from scrap would become more serious.  China currently only produces around 11 percent of its steel from scrap, compared to over 70 percent in the United States, suggesting it may have plenty of room to grow in recycling the material. The recent abundance of scrap in China followed Beijing's decision to shut mills churning out low-quality steel from induction furnaces - typically big users of scrap - as part of its drive against pollution and a glut in steel supply. The closure of these mills, with a combined production capacity of 120 million tons, helped push the nation's scrap exports to an all-time high in May. China last year generated a record 143 million tons of steel scrap, up nearly fourfold from 2002, data from the World Steel Association and CLSA showed.  That could potentially replace around 200 million tons of iron ore, equivalent to about a fifth of China's imports of the commodity last year. China's steel scrap generation should rise to 200 million tons by 2020, the China Association of Metal Scrap Utilization said. Electrifying Steel rods are piled up at a scrap metal recycling yard at the edge of Beijing, China, September 21, 2016.Thomas PeterThe bulk of China's steel is produced via blast furnaces where iron ore is melted and later mixed with steel scrap.  As domestic scrap prices ST-SCCNDHV-MB tumbled 20 percent in May from this year's peak, mills increased scrap use in these furnaces to 20 percent from 8 percent, Chinese traders and mills said. But as demand picked up in June, some scrap traders say profits have doubled. And renewed interest in electric arc furnaces (EAFs), or mini-mills that use only scrap, could fire up demand for recycled steel. EAFs emit far less carbon than blast furnaces, which use coal as fuel, suiting China's anti-pollution campaign.  In the long term, I believe the authorities do support EAFs in China,  said Wang Guangrui, vice-general manager at Xuzhou Jinhong Steel Group in Jiangsu province, which restarted a 1-million-ton EAF. The company first launched its EAF in 2011, but was forced to shut it to switch to a much cheaper induction furnace. It moved back to the EAF after the closure of all the nation's induction furnaces. Up to 20 million tons in EAF capacity may be installed this year, said CLSA's Meng. China's current EAF capacity is around 100 million tons and could grow by 10-20 million tons a year over the next three years, he said. Over 60 EAFs will be running in August-October and 20 more next year, said Guo Xianzhen, vice general manager at Anyang Steel Group which plans to launch a 1-million-ton capacity EAF in September and another 1 million-ton plant in 2018. But Australia's Fortescue Metals Group (FMG.AX), the world's No. 4 iron ore miner, believes China's iron ore appetite won't wane any time soon, as its scrap supply - usually tied to growth in car ownership - remains low compared to the size of its population.  Currently, there are more than 700 vehicles per 1,000 people in the U.S. and Australia, with this figure at around 140 in China,  Fortescue CEO Nev Power said by email.  Given the high marginal cost of electricity, the level of scrap contribution will likely be lower overall in China than has been the case in the developed economies,  he said.  Top iron ore miners Vale (VALE5.SA), Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) (RIO.L) and BHP (BHP.AX) (BLT.L) declined to comment.

The ECB bought more than two billion euros of Italian and French bonds than it was supposed to in June, moving further away from a rule aimed at ensuring that its stimulus is evenly spread across the euro zone. The conflict for investors is that Italy, seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB's bond buying scheme, is expected to be amongst the losers as the central bank unwinds extraordinary stimulus. However, if the ECB is going to buy more Italian bonds than expected in the months to come, this could soften the blow.  It is very hard as an investor to know whether to buy or sell on this news,  said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  At the end of the day, if the ECB is approaching its limit of Bunds (it can buy), we may see a stronger deviation towards BTPs. But it is still a relatively small amount of deviation so far and the overall picture is of tightening.  Italy's 10-year government bond yield edged higher by a basis point to 2.12 percent on Wednesday. However, the spread over German equivalents is only slightly off the tightest level all year at 164 bps, and more than 40 bps tighter than the April peaks. It also emerged Tuesday that the European Union had approved a 5.4 billion euro state bailout of Italy's fourth-largest lender, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, taking the total amount of Italian taxpayer funds deployed to rescue banks over the past week to more than 20 billion euros. Euro zone government bond yields have been rising across the board in recent weeks on comments from policymakers that suggest the ECB is moving towards normalising its ultra-loose monetary policy stance. Though some policymakers have since sought to play down this, German government bond yields are close to their highest levels all year at 0.48 percent. Minutes of ECB's June meeting are due on Thursday, which should provide further clues on how far the tapering debate has gone in Europe. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also due to publish minutes of its June 14 meeting later on Wednesday, with analysts waiting to see if the central bank drops any clues on whether it will push its next planned rate hike to later in the year.

A number of Bank policymakers including BoE governor Mark Carney have spoken in favour of soon reversing last year's interest rate cut, which came just after Britain's vote to leave the European Union. The remarks have helped the pound to reverse its 2 percent drop in response to a snap election on June 8 leaving no party with a clear majority. Inflation has soared past the Bank's 2 percent target, and policymakers will be watching new economic data closely for indications of price pressures. An interest rate hike would be Britain's first in 10 years. But surveys of purchasing managers in both the manufacturing and construction sectors for June came in under market estimates, adding to a raft of recent signals that overall economic activity is slowing. A Reuters poll of economists expects the Markit/CIPS Services Purchasing Managers' Index to come in at 53.5. The data is due at 0830 GMT. Sterling traded 0.1 percent lower at $1.2904 at 0740 GMT. It was 0.2 percent lower at 87.99 pence per euro.  Unless today's data confirms slowing price developments, there is limited scope of investors' central bank rate expectations to fall,  Credit Agricole strategists wrote in a note.  This is especially true as several BoE members, including the central bank's President Carney, indicated that there is little appetite for higher inflation, regardless of intact downside risks to growth.

IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 56.3 in June, down from May's 56.8 but comfortably beating a flash estimate of 55.7. It has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.  The final headline PMI came in above the earlier flash estimate and consequently signalled only a very slight loss of growth momentum at the end of the second quarter,  said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. Williamson said the latest readings were indicative of the euro zone economy having grown 0.7 percent in the second quarter, faster than the 0.5 percent rate predicted in a Reuters poll last month. Suggesting the momentum might be regained this month, backlogs of work increased as new business during June came in at the second-fastest rate in over six years. The sub-index nudged up to 56.0 from May's 55.9.  The dip in the PMI in June certainly doesn't look like the start of a slowdown. The added encouragement to the healthy picture is the broad-based nature of the upturn signalled for economic growth, employment and prices,  Williamson said. Earlier PMIs from the bloc's big four economies of Germany, France, Spain and Italy showed faster growth in the second quarter as a whole. A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry fell to 55.4 from the previous month's 56.3 but was ahead of the 54.7 flash reading. Suggesting businesses remained confident, they sped up hiring last month.

After the 'road rage' of Azerbaijan two weeks ago, the Formula One title rivals head to the bucolic surroundings of the scenic Red Bull Ring, and its backdrop of hills and forests, with controversy still simmering. Vettel, Ferrari's championship leader, had risked a heavy penalty for his moment of madness in driving into Hamilton's Mercedes behind the safety car in Baku but instead the German arrives in Austria with no further sanction and the matter officially closed. Vettel has had to accept full responsibility, and apologize to Hamilton, and will have to stay on best behavior with a race ban looming if he collects any more penalty points on his license this weekend. But the incident, the sport's major talking point post-Baku, is unlikely to die down immediately even if Mercedes say they have moved on. Hamilton, for one, has said nothing. But he has kept social media buzzing with news he had 'liked' a fan's supportive post on Instagram that said the Paris decision had sent the message that  you can do whatever you want on track, smash into each other but if you suck up and just apologize and you get away with it . Hamilton is now 14 points behind Vettel after eight of 20 races, with a loose headrest costing the Briton victory in Azerbaijan. Vettel, despite a stop-and-go penalty, finished fourth and one place ahead of his rival. Austria, the birthplace of Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, offers Hamilton the chance to take some of those lost points back. Mercedes have won every year since the race returned to the calendar in 2014 and Hamilton is the only driver on this season's grid to have won in Austria -- doing so last year after a last lap collision with his now-retired team mate Nico Rosberg.  Every great Formula One season is marked by a great rivalry. Last year it was our internal battle between Lewis and Nico and this year it seems that the fight is on between Ferrari and Mercedes and Lewis and Sebastian,  said Wolff.  As calm as it started, it was only a matter of time until the rivalry would eventually become more fierce and controversial. That moment happened in Baku and we saw the results of that tension on track.  We have moved passed that moment now and it is a closed chapter.  Aside from the Mercedes-Ferrari battle, Red Bull will also fancy their chances in front of a home crowd after Australian Daniel Ricciardo won in Baku for his fourth successive podium finish. This time, Dutch teenager Max Verstappen will be hoping it is his turn.  Luck evens itself out. Daniel has had four podiums and a race win but I'm sure a big race is around the corner for Max,  team principal Christian Horner said after Baku.

It's going very well this year,  Peter Gerber, CEO of the German aviation group's air freight arm, said at an event in Frankfurt late on Tuesday, adding that other companies in the sector were benefiting. The International Air Transport Association last month upgraded its forecasts for air freight, saying it now expected demand to rise by 7.5 percent in 2017, compared with a previous forecast for an increase of 3.5 percent and against growth of 3.6 percent in 2016. IATA attributed the growth to the start of a global economic upturn, with companies seeking to restock inventories quickly to meet demand, plus said e-commerce and shipping of time-sensitive pharmaceuticals products were supporting growth. Lufthansa Cargo last year swung to an adjusted operating loss of 50 million euros ($56.80 million) as the market suffered from excess capacity. This year, it has predicted losses should shrink slightly. Gerber did not give further details of expected profit on Tuesday.

The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab emirates, Egypt and Bahrain are due to meet in Cairo to discuss Qatar's reply to 13 demands they sent to Qatar in return for the lifting sanctions imposed last month. The dispute revolves around allegations that Qatar supports Islamist militants, including the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated a terrorist organization by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt. Qatar denies it supports terrorism and says Arab countries want to control its foreign policy. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheik Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said at a joint news conference with his German counterpart on Tuesday that its response was  given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution , but insisted that Doha would not compromise on its sovereignty.     Gulf officials have said the demands are not negotiable, signaling more sanctions are possible, including  parting ways  with Doha - a suggestion it may be ejected from the GCC, a regional economic and security cooperation body founded in 1981.   Qatar is walking alone in its dreams and illusions, far away from its Gulf Arab brothers, after it sold every brother and friend and bought the treacherous and the one far away at the highest price,  the editor of the Abu Dhabi government linked al-Ittihad newspaper wrote in an editorial.  A Gulf national may be obliged to prepare psychologically for his Gulf to be without Qatar,  he added. Some newspapers said remarks by Sheikh Mohammed in which he stressed his country would not compromise on its sovereignty suggests that Doha would not change its policies.   We do not understand the Qatari intransigence which is built on the principle of sovereignty that had been repeated in every reaction issued by Doha,  the Arabic-language al-Riyadh newspaper, which reflects Saudi government thinking, wrote in an editorial.   The Gulf requirements did not impact on the Qatari sovereignty at all, but only asked that Qatar stop interference in their internal affairs,  it added. Demands on Qatar include ending financial support to terrorist groups, closing Qatar-based al Jazeera TV, downgrading ties with Iran and shutting down a Turkish military base.  The Dubai-based al-Bayan said in an editorial that all indications suggested that Qatar had  decided to chose the enmity of its surroundings, belittled joint Gulf action and the Arab block .  Doha chose to enter into a dark tunnel and the four Arab countries that had extended the deadline acted positively, despite its prior knowledge that it faces a country that harbors evil to its neighbors .  We are today at a new situation after the Qatari rejection, and it is a rejection that will not pass without a price, and Qatar alone bears responsibility for this reaction.  Qatari officials have repeatedly said the demands are so draconian that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead seeing to hobble Doha's sovereignty.  At the same time, they have said Qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to ‘any legitimate issues’ of concern to fellow GCC member states.

A deadline for Doha to comply with the four states' demands officially expired overnight; Qatar has submitted replies to the demands to mediator Kuwait, but nobody has disclosed what those replies are. Doha has shown no sign of acquiescing to major demands, which raises the possibility of the four states imposing more sanctions, but it is not clear that any fresh steps - such as the withdrawal of deposits from Qatar's banking system - would be crippling, given Doha's large financial resources.

Qatar is walking alone in its dreams and illusions, far away from its Gulf Arab brothers, after it sold every brother and friend and bought the treacherous and the one far away at the highest price,  the editor of the Abu Dhabi government linked al-Ittihad newspaper wrote in an editorial.  A Gulf national may be obliged to prepare psychologically for his Gulf to be without Qatar,  he added. Some newspapers said remarks by Sheikh Mohammed in which he stressed his country would not compromise on its sovereignty suggests that Doha would not change its policies.   We do not understand the Qatari intransigence which is built on the principle of sovereignty that had been repeated in every reaction issued by Doha,  the Arabic-language al-Riyadh newspaper, which reflects Saudi government thinking, wrote in an editorial.   The Gulf requirements did not impact on the Qatari sovereignty at all, but only asked that Qatar stop interference in their internal affairs,  it added. Demands on Qatar include ending financial support to terrorist groups, closing Qatar-based al Jazeera TV, downgrading ties with Iran and shutting down a Turkish military base.  The Dubai-based al-Bayan said in an editorial that all indications suggested that Qatar had  decided to chose the enmity of its surroundings, belittled joint Gulf action and the Arab block .  Doha chose to enter into a dark tunnel and the four Arab countries that had extended the deadline acted positively, despite its prior knowledge that it faces a country that harbors evil to its neighbors .  We are today at a new situation after the Qatari rejection, and it is a rejection that will not pass without a price, and Qatar alone bears responsibility for this reaction.  Qatari officials have repeatedly said the demands are so draconian that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead seeing to hobble Doha's sovereignty.  At the same time, they have said Qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to ‘any legitimate issues’ of concern to fellow GCC member states.

The Sweden-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but its move signals the eventual end of nearly a century of Volvos powered solely that way.      While electric and hybrid vehicles are still only a small fraction of new cars sales, they are gaining ground at the premium end of the market, where Volvo operates and where Elon Musk's Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one. As technology improves and prices fall, many in the industry expect mass-market adoption to follow.   This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,  Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson said.     The company, owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, said five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - would all be fully electric.  These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,  Volvo said.  This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor.      The electric models will be produced at Volvo plants world-wide - it has factories in Europe and China and is building one in the United States - while development costs will be met from within its existing budget, Samuelsson told Reuters.  This also means we won't be doing other things. We of course will not be developing completely new generations of combustion engines,  he said about future investment needs. A Volvo hybrid car is seen connected to a charging point in this picture illustration taken July 6, 2017.Phil Noble/IllustrationVolvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Geely from Ford in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies that allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars. Slideshow (3 Images)Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division. Volvo has also said it will build its first fully electric car in China based on its architecture for smaller cars which will be available for sale in 2019 and exported globally. Still, Volvo is not alone among traditional carmakers in pushing strongly into electrics and plug-ins – or among premium brands in resorting to 48V mild hybrid systems to lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from their combustion-engine cars. Among them, BMW plans to introduce an electric version of its popular 3 series in September to meet the challenge from Tesla, Handelsblatt reported last month. Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made.  It is still an option and a question for our owner,  Samuelsson said.

The $1.8 billion (£1.4 billion) hedge fund firm will move European trading operations to New York, said one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter, becoming the second U.S. fund firm to do so this year after Goldman Sachs Investment Partners. The reason for Saba Capital's move was not clear although it comes at a time of uncertainty for fund firms based in Britain as talks begin on the country's exit from the European Union. It is also not clear whether the three individuals at the London office currently registered with the British regulator  will relocate to the U.S. office or find new jobs. Saba founder Boaz Weinstein made his name from the bet against JPMorgan, linked to corporate default rates. That helped assets at the firm - housed in New York's art deco Chrysler Building - peak in 2012 at $6 billion. A subsequent period of underperformance saw a number of investors pull their money, only for Saba to bounce back and attract fresh capital with a market-beating 3 percent gain in 2015 and returns of 22 percent in 2016, one of the sources said. The source also said the firm's performance was flat in the in the first four months of this year. It has had an office in London since early 2012, according to the filings from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority. Weinstein, a former Deutsche Bank trader, started Saba in 2009.

The military government had initially promised a vote within 18 months of a May 2014 coup, but the timetable has slipped - intensifying suspicion among government critics about the army's real willingness to relinquish power.     The vice-chairman of the National Reform Steering Assembly, which shapes government policies, said 25 of its 200 members had resigned ahead of a July 4 constitutional deadline they needed to meet if they were to stand.  Most of them want to retain their right to run as members of parliament in the next election,  Alongkorn Ponlaboot told Reuters on Wednesday. Not all those who had resigned were planning to take part in politics, he said. Among those who quit were former military men, veteran politicians and an economist. One said he hoped to build a coalition in support of military ruler Prayuth Chan-ocha.  The resignations signal that we are now in general election mode,  Associate Professor Yuttaporn Issarachai, dean of political science at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, told Reuters.  People typically need about a year to campaign. This is the start of that,  he said. Political gatherings of more than five people have been banned since the coup, when the army said it was seizing power to end violent turmoil between the political forces that have dominated Thailand for decades. Old Parties On one side is the Democrat Party, Thailand's oldest, which is popular with middle-class voters and has strong support in Bangkok and parts of the south. On the other is the Puea Thai Party of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose parties have won every election since 2001 by appealing to poorer voters in the populous northeast. Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, has been the unofficial face of the party since the government she led as prime minister was ousted in the coup. But she has been banned from office for five years and is on trial on corruption charges she rejects. Although junta leader Prayuth has said he does not plan to form a political party, he has frequently criticized what he calls the  bad politicians  of the past and some politicians have voiced support for keeping him in office. One of the lawmakers who resigned, Suchart Chanthornchotikon, said he wanted to form a coalition of small parties to challenge larger parties, and which could support Prayuth as a candidate for prime minister.  We don't want to set up a military party but we want to be able to challenge the big parties,  he said.  Our expectation is that if we come together we can support Prayuth as prime minister.  Prayuth would have needed to resign by July 4 if he wanted to stand for parliament, but he could still become premier according to a new constitution that allows an  outsider  to become prime minister. Critics say the constitution, written by an army-appointed committee, is designed to prolong the military's influence over politics for years to come through unelected bodies and other mechanisms. Puea Thai acting deputy-secretary Chavalit Wichayasut said he doubted that smaller parties would lend their support to an appointed prime minister.   I don't think the smaller parties will support anyone who comes to power unelected,  Chavalit told Reuters. The military has postponed the election twice since taking power. The death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in October last year led to pause in most political activity during an official mourning period of a year. No date for the next election has been set.

The inflation downgrade would be a fresh blow to Kuroda less than a year before his tenure ends next April, and underscores the challenges the central bank faces in using monetary stimulus to both lift prices and convince the public that its policies are working. The Bank of Japan's nine-member board will seek to explain why the strength in the economy has yet to translate into inflation, a dilemma they are struggling with as wages and prices remain stubbornly weak, say sources familiar with its thinking.  Given the economy is in such a good shape, it's hard to explain why inflation remains so weak. This will be among key topics of debate at this month's BOJ meeting,  said one of the sources, a view echoed by two other sources. At a rate review on July 19-20, the BOJ is set to keep monetary policy steady and offer a more upbeat assessment of the economy than it did in June to say it is expanding moderately, reflecting robust business sentiment and consumption, the sources said. But the BOJ is likely to cut its inflation forecast for the current year ending in March 2018, and possibly that for the following year, in a quarterly review of its long-term projections to be released on July 20, they said. At its April policy meeting, the BOJ said it expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.4 percent in the current fiscal year and 1.7 percent in fiscal 2018.

The inflation downgrade would be a fresh blow to Kuroda less than a year before his tenure ends next April, and underscores the challenges the central bank faces in using monetary stimulus to both lift prices and convince the public that its policies are working. The Bank of Japan's nine-member board will seek to explain why the strength in the economy has yet to translate into inflation, a dilemma they are struggling with as wages and prices remain stubbornly weak, say sources familiar with its thinking.  Given the economy is in such a good shape, it's hard to explain why inflation remains so weak. This will be among key topics of debate at this month's BOJ meeting,  said one of the sources, a view echoed by two other sources. At a rate review on July 19-20, the BOJ is set to keep monetary policy steady and offer a more upbeat assessment of the economy than it did in June to say it is expanding moderately, reflecting robust business sentiment and consumption, the sources said. But the BOJ is likely to cut its inflation forecast for the current year ending in March 2018, and possibly that for the following year, in a quarterly review of its long-term projections to be released on July 20, they said. At its April policy meeting, the BOJ said it expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.4 percent in the current fiscal year and 1.7 percent in fiscal 2018. That exceeds a Reuters poll projecting inflation of 0.7 percent in the current year and 0.8 percent the following year.

The state-owned company is seeking 10 cargoes of 65,000 tonnes each of 180-cst high sulphur fuel oil for September loading on a free-on-board (FOB) basis. It is also looking for 55,000 tonnes of low sulphur fuel oil for September delivery into Kaemari or Port Qasim in Karachi on a cost and freight (C&F;) basis. For gasoline, PSO is seeking four cargoes of 50,000 tonnes each of 92-octane gasoline on a C&F; Keamari basis. The tenders close on July 24, remaining valid until Aug. 7 PSO typically uses fuel oil for power generation and gasoline in road transport. Its gasoline imports are slightly higher than usual this month due to increased demand during the school holidays, a source close to the matter said. But this may fall once monsoon season kicks in and curbs transportation, the source added. Monsoon rains are also curbing demand for gasoil in the agriculture sector, the source said. PSO has a high inventory of gasoil and jet fuel and does not need to import the fuels for September as of now, the source added. The company has resumed jet fuel shipments to Afghanistan, after they were halted in June amid a border dispute, the source said.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.1 percent, to 3,659.68 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.8 percent to 3,207.13 points. An index tracking the 50 most representative blue-chips in Shanghai, dubbed China's  nifty 50 , rebounded 1.5 percent. Commercial pension funds are encouraged to invest in stocks, bonds and funds, in order to provide long-term stable support for the healthy development of capital markets, a policy paper dated July 4 from China's cabinet showed. The policy is expected to bring more long-term funds into the stocks market, benefiting the blue-chips, favoured by institutional investors looking for solid fundamentals. The mainland stock market also drew support from China's move to hike the quota under the Renminbi Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) scheme for Hong Kong to 500 billion yuan ($73.58 billion) to further meet their demand for yuan asset allocations. As a pioneer to promote yuan internationalisation, Hong Kong was given a 270 billion yuan quota under the RQFII scheme in 2011.  The robust run-up in big-caps is not over yet, and the RQFII hike could have a positive impact on the (mainland) stock market,  said Zhang Qi, a Haitong Securities analyst. Sectors rallied across the board, with financials leading the advance.

The Markit Stanbic Bank Uganda Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52.8 last month from 51.0 in May. Anything above 50 indicates expansion; anything below, contraction. A Markit statement said  output, new orders, employment and stocks of purchases  had all contributed to the higher index.  The private sector continues to recover, supported by the easing of the monetary policy,  Jibran Qureishi, East Africa economist at Stanbic Bank, said in a commentary accompanying the survey. Last month, the central Bank of Uganda cut its key lending rate to 10 percent from 11 percent, continuing a round of easing that has been running for about a year. The central bank wants to encourage a greater flow of credit to the private sector to lift slowing economic growth. Uganda's economy expanded 3.9 percent in the fiscal year to the end of June, below an initial forecast of 5.5 percent. Drought and a diminished flow of private-sector credit curbed growth. Wednesday's survey showed private-sector payrolls increased, with construction and services adding the most jobs. But companies faced higher costs, mostly from utilities, staff and raw materials, the survey said.  As economic activity improves in the second half of the year, imports may rise and put pressure on the exchange rate, which could subsequently raise costs for firms,  Qureishi said. - Detailed PMI data are only available under licence from Markit and customers need to apply to Markit for a licence.

In May the company lowered its full-year operating margin outlook to 10-12 percent from 11-12 percent and confirmed revenue guidance of 15-20 percent growth.

The company said that around half of its ongoing proton therapy projects were experiencing delays, while cost cutting measures had taken longer than anticipated to bear fruit. IBA has also faced a number of one-off costs in emerging markets.  These systems are so big that they actually have to build buildings for them. This is done by third party contractors and here is the delay,  Triest said.

Azmi spoke to Reuters about her role in the movie, how filmmaking in Bollywood is changing for the better, and why she is in a “happy place” at this stage in her life. Q: Rani Jindan seems like quite a woman… A: She’s wonderful. She is feisty despite the fact that she has been reduced to penury, and her kingdom has been taken away, her son has been taken away from her and she is in dire straits. Q: Did you know her story before the film? A: I’ll be honest. I knew very little of her. When I was given the script, I was really amazed by it. “Is this really true,” I asked. And they said “yes.” Obviously, some of it has been dramatised, but I found the character very compelling. She comes from a place where she wants to undo the injustice that has been done to her family. She has scant respect for the British. I did feel it was a story that needed to be told. The producer of the film is also a historian and felt so strongly about the subject, and I always judge by that. More than just a film, it was a passage in history that hasn’t been remembered.  Q: Is there a particular way you approach playing a historical character? A: I read up a lot on her, whatever was available. Basically, it is not about imitating but imbibing the spirit.  Q: Did you have any reservations about the dramatisation of the character? Handout photo from “The Black Prince”A: I am sure they have fictionalised it, but because Jasjeet-ji (producer Jasjeet Singh) is a historian, there has been so much research. I don’t think they took great liberties in that sense. I am just not sure if she (Rani Jindan) spoke those exact lines.  Q: What drew you to the role? A: Well, the fact that I felt this story needed to be told. We don’t know anything about Duleep Singh. It was a huge thing – he was raised as an Englishman, he used to drink, he’d cut his hair and was completely oblivious to his past until his mother came and told him that the whole Sikh empire was started by your father and you are the heir. Q: Is there a difference between how the West handles biopics and real-life stories and how Bollywood handles them? A: I think the gap is becoming less and less. Bollywood, till very recently, worked in an alternative reality. Not much was needed even from the actors. In this alternative reality that was Bollywood, representative acting was enough - if you raise your eyebrows, you are surprised; and if you cry, you are sad. It is like dance – you represent the emotion. All that is happily changing. After it was declared as an industry and legit money started coming in, actors were then given the choice of making one film at a time. We were (earlier) doing 12 films at a time. The fact that we could remember our lines was more than enough. The other thing that has happened is the advent of the casting director. Earlier, there would be stock characters – a Jeevan or a Kanhiayalal (Chaturvedi). Now the casting director has gone out and found people from theatre, from smaller towns, and that has caused the ecosystem around the actor to change. We can’t do our old-fashioned acting because these people are so good.  Ten years ago, you could be rockstar (in a film) and not play a guitar. In “Karz”, Rishi Kapoor was not playing any chords on his guitar and we were perfectly okay with it. Today, it would be unthinkable, even to him, that he could get away with that. There was a film which I did many, many, many years ago which took 14 years to make. Fourteen years. It was a film called “Oonch Neech Beech” and in one shot, Shashi Kapoor goes out for a jog and when he reaches, he is 40 kilos heavier! (Laughs uproariously) How is it possible? At least change the first shot or change this shot! All sorts of nonsense were happening. Q: Does that mean you are now more satisfied with the roles you are getting?A: I am in a very happy place at the moment. There are parts available for much older people that you didn’t have earlier. Earlier at 30, a girl’s career was over. Now, all of our top actresses are above 30 and doing well. This year alone, I have five very different releases. There is “The Black Prince”; then there is “Eidgah”, which is based on Munshi Premchand’s story of the relationship between a child and his grandmother. I had a release called “Sonata” which was directed by Aparna Sen, and then a lovely American film called “Signature Move”, which is doing the festival rounds.  I cannot remember a time in my life when I had such varied parts. I had a lot of substantial, very dramatic parts, but never varied. It is a happy time.

The company, which returned to the London stock market in November 2015 after just under eight years in private hands, said its forward order book had grown by 241 million pounds ($311.3 million) since March 1.  The market for high-quality retirement housing remains strong notwithstanding any potential uncertainty as a result of the UK General Election outcome and the underlying housing market continues to be supported by low interest rates, good mortgage availability and low levels of unemployment,  CEO Clive Fenton said. McCarthy & Stone has been making  good progress  in rebuilding its forward order book after the shortfall it experienced following Britain's vote to exit the European Union, it said. UK's housebuilding market was weakened by the Brexit vote, which weighed on McCarthy's half-year results. The company also warned of some impact on current-year growth due to a weak forward order book and a more measured approach to land negotiation. The firm said, however, that current uncertainty in the market could have a modest impact on the timing of conversion of existing reservations into completions. National elections can often dampen demand as buyers put off major purchases.

Our culture is dying,  said St. Pierre, who lives in Lafourche Parish, where cypress trees are hung with lacy strands of Spanish moss and alligators lurk in bayous, the region's slow-moving swamp waterways.  It's not like it was.  People are moving away from the parish, or county, some 60 miles (97 km) southwest of New Orleans, faced with growing flood risks and unable to pay for insurance, which can reach thousands of dollars and is required by mortgage banks in high-risk areas. Since Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, nearly 10 percent of Lafourche's population has left its southernmost end that is flood-prone and vulnerable to storm surges. Attrition due to soaring insurance premiums is visible from the proliferation of  For Sale  signs on houses and boats, said Gary LaFleur, a biologist and faculty member at the Center for Bayou Studies at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux.  No government is coming in and kicking people out, but all of a sudden the insurance rates are going up so high that it's like a slow economic way of leading to a ghost town,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Within 50 years the town is gone.  Lafourche has been home for centuries to Cajuns who are descended from French-speaking settlers expelled in the 18th century from what is now Canada. Cajun culture is renowned for its spicy cuisine and lively traditional music.  It's a lifestyle, people, language - just the way you were brought up by your parents and grandparents,  said St. Pierre. Traditions such as the blessing of the fleets in the bayous - once an annual ceremony for shrimpers and others - are dimming as the ranks of family-owned fishing boats dwindle, he said.  When you see one shrimp boat and it's followed by five party boats, you think, aww, this isn't as cool as it used to be,  he said. St. Pierre, known as Ms. Louise, sells her miniature Cajun paintings to customers at craft shows.  They can send them to their nephew in New York and say, 'Hey, that is a part of our culture. Don't forget',  she said. Oil Money St. Pierre, 65, learned French from her grandparents and meets each Tuesday night with fellow francophones, whose numbers are falling. Fewer than 14,000 people in Lafourche are native French speakers, according to the latest census figures, down from some 16,000 a decade earlier. And St. Pierre cooks a mean Cajun meal.  I can make you gumbo and jambalaya, and do your etouffees and of course boiled shrimp and crawfish, fried oysters,  she said.  And I love alligator tails.  But oyster beds were hit hard by the massive BP oil spill in 2010, crabs are under pressure from wetland loss, and cheap foreign imports have depressed local seafood prices. Added to that, saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico is killing vegetation where rabbit, deer and other Cajun delicacies used to thrive, she said. Towns such as Leeville, once a vibrant fishing center, are under threat. The main artery was elevated to a causeway to avoid rising water, so the road that went through downtown now goes overhead, LaFleur said.  Leeville didn't get washed away, but because they had to raise the road, now people just don't go to Leeville anymore,  he said.  That's kind of killing that community right there.  Locals worry too about a loss of federal funding to protect the coast, advocated by the Trump administration. Under the 2006 Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA), four states, including Louisiana, get nearly 40 percent of federal oil revenue from drilling off their coasts. Louisiana officials have said the state could see as much as $140 million of GOMESA money for coastal restoration in a year. But Trump's proposed budget would divert that cash to the federal treasury. The Obama administration also sought to divert GOMESA funding but was blocked by Congress.  If we don't get that money this year, you can just kiss everything goodbye,  St. Pierre said.

While corporate tax revenue was down 0.5 trillion yen from the previous year, the other key revenue components - sales tax and income tax - also fell, resulting in the first decline in overall tax receipt in seven years, it said. Analysts say the declines in tax revenue meant that Abe's strategy to boost tax income to fund fiscal stimulus under his  Abenomics  reflationary policy has been stymied. Overall tax revenue came to about 55.5 trillion yen in the fiscal 2016 that ended in March, 0.8 trillion yen short of the previous year's receipt and undershooting the prior year's amount for the first time since 2009, the MOF said. Despite the decline in tax revenue, Japan's government bond issuance in the last fiscal year was 1 trillion yen less than the government had previously planned, as lower interest rates reduced debt-servicing costs. Unused cash reserves like those set aside for emergency have also left the government with a surplus to deliver extra stimulus spending. The fiscal 2016 year produced excess cash of 378.2 billion yen, the MOF said. That was higher than the 252.4 billion yen figure of a year earlier, but far below annual amounts of over 1 trillion yen in the first years after the premier swept to power in late 2012. Half of the excess cash must be spent to pay off debt under Japan's budget rules. The remainder would be available for allocation to an extra stimulus budget that may be compiled later this year.

Xiaomi is one of the world's leading smartphone manufacturers and we are delighted to have reached an agreement with them,  Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said in a statement.

The tech giant's publishing arm may raise up to $800 million in a Hong Kong listing, according to IFR. Catering to bookworms isn't very lucrative, even if more and more readers are paying for electronic literature. The real payoff will lie in turning stories into blockbuster films, video games and merchandise. The $327 billion social media and gaming group is listing China Literature. The business resembles Amazon’s Kindle Store, doubling up as a publishing house with an in-house editorial team. The subsidiary could be worth as much as $5.3 billion, assuming 15 percent of the firm's enlarged share capital is sold in the initial public offering. That looks pricey, even for the country's largest online publishing and e-book platform. Net profit last year was just 30.4 million yuan ($4.5 million). To be sure, it boasts 8.4 million literary works from 5.3 million writers, both amateur and professional. And growth is promising: sales rose 59 percent to 2.6 billion yuan last year. But charging as little as 0.05 yuan per 1,000 Chinese characters is not much of a money-spinner, especially after splitting fees with authors. Piracy remains rampant, too. China Literature estimates it cost the industry 11.4 billion yuan in sales last year - more than double the size of the legitimate market. So the sales pitch will focus more on Chinese cinema, which increasingly looks to novels and comics for inspiration. Last year, more than a third of the top 50 local films were adapted from literary works, bringing in $1.1 billion in ticket sales, China Literature says. Tencent recently partnered with Wanda Cinema, the country's largest cinema chain, to develop movies, television shows, games, virtual-reality content and even theme parks. The sums involved should be bigger, and the margins higher, than selling novels. So rather than a traditional book publisher, this could optimistically look more like Disney, which owns intellectual property ranging from Star Wars to Iron Man. However, these franchises have been developed over decades. China Literature will need to find some truly outstanding characters lurking in its huge library.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Fishing channels widen as barrier islands disappear, and unremarkable rainstorms leave roads flooded. Withered, blackened cypress and oak trees, succumbing to an invasion of salt water, turn once lush land into eerie ghost forests. Some 120,000 people live on the most vulnerable shrinking lowlands south of New Orleans, fishing for shrimp and crawfish, harvesting oysters or working in the shipyards, oil refineries and petrochemical plants along the river banks and Gulf shores. They face difficult decisions over whether to stay and fight, or flee their diminishing land - yet even getting their attention to the looming threats is no easy task. Warnings that Louisiana is losing more than 10,000 acres - equal to 10,000 American football fields - of wetlands each year are often met with skepticism, distrust and resignation.  Most people, they're trying to live their life,  said Richie Blink, who lives in Empire, a town on a skinny stretch of river delta laced with canals to the Gulf.  They're worried about putting food on the table within the next two weeks and not what's going to happen 50 years from now.  Many work in the energy or commercial fishing industries, where depressed prices are costing jobs, he said. Blink, 30, volunteers with LA SAFE (Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments), a $40 million project funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It is asking coastal residents how they would like to adapt to changes predicted in the next 10, 25 and 50 years. The delta that fans into the Gulf of Mexico, formed from silt carried by the Mississippi River, is subsiding and is no longer replenished by the powerful waterway. Instead, the river is lined by levees, or raised banks, that rush its water past the delta into the depths of the Gulf. Losing Land Maps of southern Louisiana a few decades ago show a boot of land, not unlike southern Italy, that is all but gone now.  Deprived of silt and fresh water, and sliced by hundreds of miles of deeply dredged shipping channels, the shrinking wetlands are growing less effective as natural barriers to storm surges from hurricanes, putting the area at higher risk of devastation.  It looks pretty out here, but a storm comes along and half the land leaves,  said Nicky Alfonso, 52, a commercial fisherman docked at Pointe à la Hache between the Gulf and a river levee.  We're not the scientists, but we see what's happening,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We're losing land.  Many low-lying coastal regions in the United States face erosion and rising sea level, linked to climate change, but the Mississippi delta is particularly vulnerable because it is sinking as well.  It is subsiding an average of 9 millimeters (0.35 inches) a year, 50 percent faster than had been thought two years ago, according to Tulane University geologists, who described the coast of Louisiana as one of the  most vulnerable  in the world.  We are in a race against time in Louisiana,  Governor John Bel Edwards said in March, announcing LA SAFE - which he said could become a national model for threatened communities. Related Coverage'Our culture is dying': Rising waters menace more than land in LouisianaFactbox: A $50 billion wish list to keep Louisiana coast above water A few of our most vulnerable coastal communities will need to contemplate resettlement over the next 50 years, while others are likely to experience population and economic contraction as a result of ongoing land loss and sea level rise,  he said. One such community is an Indian tribe on Louisiana's Isle de Jean Charles, in the process of relocating with $48 million in government funds after losing most of its land to the sea. At recent LA SAFE meetings, held in schools and church meeting rooms in parishes along the coast, residents tossed around ideas to adapt to the shifting landscape, from elevating houses to promoting local seafood or building public transport. LA SAFE works alongside the state's Coastal Master Plan, a blueprint of more than 120 projects to fight coastal loss in the next 50 years. Fully funded, the plan would cost $50 billion. An initial LA SAFE meeting in Plaquemines Parish, home to some 23,000 people, drew a crowd of 139 inhabitants. But a follow-up meeting centered on the parish's east bank drew fewer than two dozen, and a meeting at its southern tip just nine. Clipboards and Surveys Locals are tired of being the subjects of a seemingly endless string of studies since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said Darilyn Turner, 43, who runs Zion Travelers Cooperative Center, a coastal restoration group in Plaquemines. Katrina devastated low-lying Plaquemines and neighboring Lafourche Parish, followed five years later by the BP  oil spill that poured millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and fouled 100 miles (160 km) of coastline. BP agreed to pay about $18.7 billion in damages caused by the spill, settling with the U.S. and state governments. Louise St. Pierre, right, attends a meeting of LA SAFE (Louisiana's Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments) in Thibodaux, Louisiana, United States on June 5, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation / Ellen Wulfhorst. LA SAFE is a $40 million federally funded project asking residents of the vulnerable coast how they would like to adapt to environmental changes predicted in coming decades. St. Pierre said she is concerned that the area’s historic Cajun culture will be lost as the swamps and wetlands disappear under rising sea level, salt water intrusion and erosion. You come in here with your clipboards and your surveys,  said Turner.  Then you never hear from them again.  People want results,  she said. But make no mistake, they are concerned.  Just standing outside on their lawns, people are having conversations about the coast and why we need to be protected,  she said. Living next to a levee on the Mississippi River's east bank, Gerard Griffin, 70, sees melting polar ice caps and subsiding land as real threats, but is suspicious of efforts to help. He figures industry and the government want the mineral and natural gas-rich land of Plaquemines for themselves.  Down in the country, I think they been trying to discourage us,  he said.  If they can get us to leave and sell out, then that's what they want.  Charter fishing boat captain Cody Bulot said unrepaired roads and levees are proof the government wants residents to go.  There's a lot of money to be made down here. This is the gateway to the Gulf,  said Bulot, 30.  But it won't work, he added. Houses in Plaquemines Parish, located on the Mississippi River delta, are often raised in an effort to withstand flooding and hurricane storm surges, Braithwaite, Lousiana on June 7, 2017. This house, which is for sale, has been elevated more than 19 feet (6 meters). Thomson Reuters Foundation / Ellen Wulhorst.Bulot rebuilt after losing his house to Katrina, the way his grandparents did after Hurricanes Betsy in 1965 and Camille four years later.  I've been below sea level my whole life. I'll be below sea level my whole life,  he said. Besides, while he sees the delta sinking and the coast eroding, he is skeptical about the water rising.  Somebody prove to me, scientifically fact, that the water keeps rising,  he challenged.  It's not.  Shrimp Shift  Science in fact does show the water getting higher. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration reports that global mean sea level is rising at a rate of 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year. Studies say the rate is accelerating, fed by thawing ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of ocean water as the planet warms. LA SAFE volunteer Blink said narrowing such broad issues to very specific local impacts can underline their urgency.  You talk about international climate and global weather patterns and things like that, it's very hard for people to understand,  he said.  But when you're talking with a commercial fisherman and they tell you that the shrimp are showing up a full two months earlier than they were in the 1960s and the 1970s, then they acknowledge that there are changes,  he said. Fishermen also report seeing certain species of insects and birds for the first time, indicating changing climate patterns, Blink said. While plenty of people in southern Louisiana may experience disappearing land and rising water, they may not believe the government has their best interests at heart, said John Doucet, a geneticist at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana, and a faculty member at its Center for Bayou Studies. One reason, he said, is that they have not been protected from the sky-rocketing costs of buying flood insurance - something banks require before making home loans.  There's a large anxiety about trusting government to make good choices for the people,  he said. Neither do they take well to outsiders telling them what to do, a wariness that goes back in time, he said. The Cajuns descend from people brutally expelled in the 18th century from what is now Canada. They made their way to Louisiana, where they landed along its southern bayous, the slow-moving waterways that course through the swampland.  Many died of disease and starvation along the way.  Now these folks are being pushed again,  said Doucet.  There's probably inter-generational distrust that's pretty strong.

Automakers, tech shares and banking stocks were among Wednesday's winners as the dollar was back above the 113.00 yen level in the afternoon, lifting overall sentiment. Toyota Motor Corp rose 1.6 percent, Nissan Motor Co gained 1.7 percent and Hitachi Ltd advanced 1.3 percent. Mizuho Financial Group rose 1.3 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group added 1.2 percent.  Investors were picking up cyclical stocks, particularly automakers as they have laggard behind the rises of the overall market,  said Yoshihiro Okumura, general manager at Chibagin Asset Management. The Nikkei share average ended 0.3 percent higher to 20,081.63 after plumbing to 19,888.90 in the morning, its lowest since June 16. But gains were limited, with U.S. market closed for the Independence Day holiday on July 4 while investors remaining cautious over geopolitical tension in the Korean Peninsula.  U.S. Secretary of State (Rex) Tillerson mentioning North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) early this morning has caused the market to remain cautious,  said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist t Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.  At the same time, the domestic market is retaining a fair degree of calm regarding the situation, while waiting to see how the United States responds to North Korea's actions.  Tillerson called for global action after North Korea tested a newly developed ICBM, calling it a new escalation of Pyongyang's nuclear threat. However, on Wednesday, investors wasted no time in taking profits from defence industry-related firms, which surged the previous day in response to Pyongyang's ICBM launch. Ishikawa Seisakusho Ltd, a maker of defence equipment including landmines, fell 3.9 percent after rallying roughly 20 percent the previous day. Defence system equipment maker Nippon Avionics Co shed 2.5 percent following the previous day's rise of 5.6 percent. The broader Topix rose 0.6 percent to 1,618.63.

Sugita, who reached a career-high No. 44 in the world after beating Adrian Mannarino in the Antalya Open final, beat  Britain's Brydan Klein 7-6(5) 6-3 6-0 in the first round at the year's third grand slam. Sugita will feel confident of advancing further at SW19 as he is due to meet Mannarino in the next round on Thursday.  I'm happy to have won on the sacred turf,  Sugita told reporters.  It has now become a memorable event for me, so I hope to enjoy it till the end and show off everything I've got. Surprisingly I've been able to stay calm. I wanted to show through my play that I'm not done yet.  Sugita earned a spot in the main draw without battling through qualifiers for the first time, allowing him to compete in warm-up tournaments and prepare adequately.  If you don't have to participate in the qualifiers you can take part in other tournaments, which is ideal,  Sugita said.   But then again, I've been knocked out in the qualifying rounds so many times I'm all the more grateful for this automatic entry and tune-up period.  Sugita became the third Japanese player to win an ATP Tour title after Kei Nishikori and Shuzo Matsuoka.

A group of Rakhine Buddhists threw bricks at Rohingya men in the state capital of Sittwe on Tuesday, killing one - identified as Maung Nu, also known as Monir Ahmad, 55 - the office of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi said in a statement. Two police officers told Reuters an unarmed junior policeman was with the Muslim men at the time of the attack but was unable to protect them from the mob.  We questioned the young policeman. He said he tried to stop them but he wasn't able to and ran away back to the police station,  said Colonel Myo Thu Soe, spokesman for the home affairs ministry in the capital, Naypyitaw. No one had been arrested for the attack, but an investigation was going on, he said. Rakhine State has seen the most serious religious violence in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar since the military began to end its decades of strict rule, with hundreds of Rohingya Muslims killed and more than 140,000 people displaced there in communal unrest in 2012. Suu Kyi, who came to power last year as part of the transition from military rule, has emphasized the importance of the rule of law in solving conflict between Buddhists and minority Muslims. Tension has been running high in the state since an army crackdown in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks in October, but Sittwe has not seen a repeat of the communal clashes of 2012. On Tuesday, seven Muslim men had traveled into Sittwe from a camp on its  outskirts housing people displaced in 2012. They got into an argument with a Buddhist ethnic Rakhine man over the purchase of a boat, attracting the attention of residents who began to attack them.  The people didn’t attack the police because he's the same race,  said Lieutenant Colonel Win Naung of Sittwe district police. Myanmar does not recognize the more than 1 million Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine as citizens. Many in Myanmar consider the them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Myo Thu Soe said the policeman on the scene was unarmed and inexperienced and unable to protect the Rohingya men. Despite the fact they had a police escort, Myo Thu Soe said the Muslim men were not authorized to travel to the area. Since the 2012 violence the city's Muslims have been confined to camps or a single city ward, unable to travel freely without a police escort.

The benchmark 10-year JGB futures price slipped 0.17 point to 149.98, closing at the lowest level since mid-March. Trading volume hit 30,835 lots, about 50 percent above the average so far this year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB rose 1.0 basis point to 0.085 percent , matching a 3 1/2-month high touched last week. The BOJ's purchase of 280 billion yen ($2.47 billion) JGBs with one- to three-years left to maturity attracted selling of 1.162 trillion yen, the biggest amount for the buying in those maturities since May 24. The accepted rates were also higher than market expectations.  There appear to be some people who couldn't sell the bonds to the BOJ and are saddled with long positions,  said a trader at a Japanese brokerage. As a result, the two-year yield rose 1.0 basis point to minus 0.120 percent. The five-year yield rose 1.0 basis point to minus 0.060 percent. Both yields are not far from what traders see as the BOJ's defence line, or the levels at which the BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount in November, namely minus 0.09 percent in the two-year yield and minus 0.04 percent in the five-year yield. Few market players are eager to test the BOJ's resolve at present, but further increases in U.S. and European bond yields could prompt the Japanese market to test those levels again, some market players said. Yields on U.S. and European bonds have risen sharply over the past week after policymakers at the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada all signalled they could tighten their policies. The 20-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.600 percent , while the 30-year yield ticked up 1.0 basis point to 0.865 percent ahead of Thursday's 30-year JGB auction.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan regained 0.3 percent, half the losses suffered Tuesday when North Korea fired a missile into Japanese waters.  North Korea's success in ICBM test can have some pressure since it means improvements in missile technology, but the test alone will only have limited impact like any other missiles launched before,  said Kim Doo-un, a foreign exchange analyst at Hana Financial Investment. South Korea's main index rebounded by 0.36 percent and Japan's Nikkei ended up 0.25 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P; 500 were barely changed, while yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes dipped 2 basis points to 2.33 percent. In Europe, Eurostoxx futures fell 0.3 percent, with the DAX off 0.2 percent and the FTSE 0.1 percent. A holiday in the United States and a dearth of major data kept activity muted, though minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting due later in the day could provide some impetus. Among the few releases in Asia was the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China which dropped to 51.6 in June, from 52.8 in May. North Korea said it had conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile that can carry a large and heavy nuclear warhead. South Korean and U.S. troops fired missiles into the waters off South Korea to show their deep strike precision capability. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for global action against Pyongyang's nuclear threat, though it was not entirely clear what new steps could be taken. All the sabre rattling gave the safe-haven yen an early lift, but the dollar soon steadied at 113.20 yen. Gold was a slim 0.1 percent firmer at $1,226.10 an ounce. Moves were minor with the euro steady at $1.1356 and the dollar index down a fraction at 96.182. Not All Together Investors awaited minutes of the Fed's June meeting to gauge how committed it was to hiking rates gain this year and any detail on plans to wind back its massive balance sheet.  In the May minutes, 'a couple' of participants worried that tight labour-market conditions could pose an inflationary risk, while 'several others' saw a downside risk for inflation,  said Kevin Harris, a director at Roubini Global Economics.  We will look for any shift between those two concerns.  Markets imply around a 60 percent chance of another rate rise in December and a much shallower path of future increases than most Fed members. Indeed, while some other central banks had recently sounded more hawkish, signs were any unwinding of stimulus globally would not be a synchronized affair. The chief economist at the European Central Bank noted healthier inflation was  crucially contingent  on policy staying easy, while Sweden's central bank sounded reassuringly cautious even as it acknowledged further rate cuts were now unlikely. Australian policy makers showed no inclination to go down the hawkish route given subdued inflation and a desire to restrain the local currency. In commodity markets, oil was trying to stabilise around $50 a barrel on tentative signs that U.S. crude production might be slowing. Brent edged down 5 cents to $49.56, having opened the week with its biggest one-day rally since December, while U.S. crude lost 9 cents to $46.98.

The company said on Sunday  Honour of Kings  players below 12 years of age would be limited to one hour of play time each day, while those aged 12 to 18 years would be limited to two hours a day, responding to concerns from teachers and parents that some children were addicted to the game.   Shares of Tencent, China's biggest gaming and social media firm by revenue, fell nearly 4 percent this week up to the close of trade on Tuesday, wiping some $12 billion off its market value. The stock was up more than 1 percent on Wednesday, reversing earlier losses, and compared with a flat broader market. It is up more than 40 percent this year.  China's communist party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, has also criticized Tencent twice this week, describing the  Honour of Kings  game as poison and calling for tighter regulatory controls of online games, which further weighed on its shares.  (Those) under 12 years old constitute a small proportion of our total user base and a smaller percentage of our paying user base. We do not expect these measures will have a material impact on our overall financial results,  Tencent said in an email response to a Reuters request for comment.  Tencent also said it would step up the requirement of real-name registration for all users and upgrade a parental-control platform rolled out earlier this year that makes it easier for parents to monitor their children's gaming account activities. It was not immediately clear if Tencent, which has a portfolio of over 200 games, can effectively impose the play-time restrictions or how easy it will be for players to skirt the measures.  Chinese gaming industry database CNG estimates  Honour of Kings  raked in revenue of more than 5.5 billion yuan ($810.47 million) in the first quarter, accounting for nearly half of Tencent's smartphone games revenue of 12.9 billion yuan in the period. A child plays the game  Honour of Kings  by Tencent at home in Dezhou, Shandong province, China July 2, 2017.StringerTencent, one of Asia's most valuable firms with a market value of HK$2.6 trillion ($333 billion), has spread its tentacles into nearly every facet of Chinese life, making it vulnerable to any regulatory measures imposed by Beijing at a  time of growing political risk in China.  Chinese regulators have launched a sweeping crackdown on what it deems inappropriate content on the internet, including closing celebrity gossip websites and restricting what people can post, forcing individuals and companies to walk a fine line to address government concerns.  The popularity of  Honour of Kings  has prompted scores of complaints from teachers and parents worried that children are becoming addicted to the game, for which half of users are below 24 years of age, according to Chinese mobile data firm Jiguang. A wider or more heavy-handed crackdown by authorities on the online gaming sector could pose significant challenges for China's tech champions.  The question now is whether public criticism will be followed up with state regulation of the thriving online gaming market in China,  said Paul Haswell, a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, who specializes in technology.  Seeing that market so effectively shut down, either by public criticism or state intervention, is a big shock to China's gaming industry.  In its commentaries, the People's Daily cited examples of addiction where teenagers had stolen money to spend on game features and also a case of alleged suicide.  Honour of Kings, a fantasy multiplayer role-playing battle game, is the most popular mobile game in China with around 55 million daily active users, more than Pokemon Go at its peak.

The notes are backed by residential mortgages in China originated by Postal Savings Bank of China Co Ltd. (PSB). The rating actions are as follows: CNY151.0 million Class A1 notes due September 2046 affirmed at 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable CNY900.0 million Class A2 notes due September 2046 affirmed at 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable CNY1,364.4 million Class A3 notes due September 2046 affirmed at 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable CNY156.0 million Class B notes due September 2046 upgraded to 'Asf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of the class B notes was based on higher credit enhancement (CE) of 12.1% as at March 2017, up from 9.2% at closing, strong asset performance, and stable sector outlook. Reported CE for the class A notes also increased to 17.4%, from 13.3% at closing. The class A1 and A2 notes are paid on a predetermined schedule, which stipulates the target balance of each note after each monthly payment date. Both class A1 and A2 notes have been paid according to the schedule to date. The outstanding balance of the class A3 notes has substantially decreased to CNY1,364 million, from CNY1,908 million at closing, due to extra collection build-up between the pool cut-off date of 23 October 2015 and first payment date of 26 August 2016. The cumulative gross default rate stood at 0.06% as at end-March 2017; well within our base-case assumption of 0.20% cumulative defaults by March 2017 (month 18) based on our base-case default timing curve. The performance compares favourably to China's two most seasoned RMBS transactions - China Construction Bank 2005-1 and 2007-1, where the cumulative gross default rates stood at 0.17% and 0.48%, respectively, at month 18. Fitch forecasts China's GDP growth at 6.4% in 2017 and 5.7% in 2018, and we see the asset and sector outlook of Jiamei 2016-1 as stable. An 'A+' cap on Jiamei 2016-1 reflects the shortcomings of the data set available to Fitch for analysis. Data is only available during positive economic periods and is not at a granular level, as such, Fitch is unable to derive the factors that cause defaults. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and/or the loss severity on defaulted loans could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and are likely to result in a decline in CE and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain note ratings susceptible to negative rating action, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage. Hence, Fitch has evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Jiamei 2016-1 by stressing the transaction's initial base-case assumptions. The analysis found the class A and B notes' ratings remained stable under Fitch's standard sensitivity scenarios of a 15% increase in defaults or 30% decrease in recoveries. In the combined scenarios, ratings remained stable for the class A and B notes under both the 15% increase in defaults and 15% decrease in recoveries. For both 30% increase in defaults and 30% decrease in recoveries, ratings remained stable for the class A1, A2 and A3 notes, but the class B notes would be downgraded to 'A-sf'. USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 {Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has received about the performance of the asset pools and the transactions. There were no findings that were material to this analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio or reviewed the origination files as part of its ongoing monitoring. Prior to the transactions closing, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of PSB's origination files and found the information contained in the files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable.

GSR could buy a stake of around 20 percent - worth just under $1.9 billion at current market values, one of the sources said, but added there was no firm agreement. SQM is one of just a handful of established lithium miners globally and a Chinese investment would go hand in glove with an electric car boom in the world's biggest auto market.  Beijing is aggressively promoting the vehicles to combat air pollution and as a means for the domestic car industry to compete with foreign rivals that have decades more experience in internal combustion engines. The sources said GSR, which has invested in clean technology and electric cars, met the Chilean government in April to discuss the potential purchase and was now moving towards a deal.  A Chilean government transparency web site reported two GSR representatives met Eduardo Bitran, the head of the government development agency Corfo that manages the nation's lithium leases, on April 24. An SQM representative declined to comment. GSR did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources did not specify who would sell the shares to GSR, but Julio Ponce, former chairman and one-time son-in-law of Chilean ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet, has previously tried to sell part of his interest in SQM. That process ended in late 2016 after offers fell short. Suitors then included Ningbo Shanshan Co Ltd, a Chinese manufacturer of lithium battery materials. Canada's Potash Corp was also seen as a potential buyer. According to a presentation on SQM's website, Ponce's holding firm Pampa Calichera and Japanese trading and chemicals firm Kowa Co Ltd, who have a joint voting pact, together owned a 32 percent stake in SQM as of the end of March 2017. Potash also owns 32 percent. Potash declined to comment. Reuters was not able to reach Ponce for comment, but a source with knowledge of Pampa Calichera said he was not aware of the potential stake purchase. Kowa did not have immediate comment. SQM, which has access to vast mineral reserves in the so-called 'lithium triangle' in Chile and Argentina, said in May it was planning to expand production as lithium demand continues to rocket on the back of its increased use in electric vehicles and mobile phones. GSR, currently managing a $5 billion M&A; fund, mainly targets foreign industrial and emerging technology companies, including electric car batteries and pharmaceuticals firms. It is in talks to buy control of a Nissan Motor Co rechargeable battery unit for about $1 billion, media have reported. GSR was also involved in a Chinese consortium to take over Italian football club AC Milan last year, but dropped out before the deal was signed, sources said at the time. It grabbed headlines in 2015 when it teamed up with other investors to buy Philips's lighting component unit for $2.8 billion, a deal later blocked by a U.S. foreign investment panel on security grounds.

The Gothenburg-based company will continue to produce pure combustion-engine Volvos from models launched before that date, but said it would introduce cars across its model line-up that ranged from fully electric cars to plug-in hybrids. Volvo's plans make it the first major traditional automaker to set a date for the complete phase-out of combustion-engine-only models though electrification has long been a buzzword across the industry and Elon Musk's Tesla Motors has been a pure-play battery carmaker from day one.  This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car,  Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. Five new models set to be launched in 2019 through 2021 - three of them Volvos and two Polestar-branded - will all be fully electric.  These five cars will be supplemented by a range of petrol and diesel plug in hybrid and mild hybrid 48-volt options on all models,  Volvo said.  This means that there will in future be no Volvo cars without an electric motor.  Volvo has invested heavily in new models and plants since being bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, establishing a niche in a premium auto market dominated by larger rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Part of its strategy has also been to embrace emerging technologies which allow higher performance electric vehicles as well as, eventually, self-driving cars. Only last month, Volvo said it would reshape its Polestar business into a standalone brand, focused on high-performance electric cars aimed at competing with Tesla and the Mercedes AMG division. Volvo has also taken steps towards an eventual listing, raising 5 billion crowns from Swedish institutional investors through the sale of newly issued preference shares last year, though the company has said no decision on an IPO has been made.

On Tuesday the European Union approved a 5.4 billion euro state bailout of Italy's fourth-largest lender after the bank agreed to a drastic overhaul. In a statement, Monte dei Paschi said its 2017-2021 plan, which sees a return on equity of more than 10 percent in 2021, envisaged a headcount reduction of around 5,500 with the number of branches falling to around 1,400 from some 2,000 in 2016. The bank will sell 28.6 billion euros of gross bad loans, of which 26.1 billion euros will be securitised. It said it expected its CET1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, to be at 14.7 percent in 2021.

The Los Angeles left-hander did not allow an earned run for a third consecutive start, throwing seven shutout innings, and the Dodgers won the opener of the three-game series against the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw (13-2) allowed two hits and two walks while striking out 11 on 117 pitches. The three-time NL Cy Young Award winner and four-time NL ERA champion lowered his ERA from 2.32 to 2.19 and became the first 13-game winner in the majors this season. On June 19, Kershaw yielded a career-high four home runs in a 10-6 win against the New York Mets, giving him a career-high 17 allowed on the season. However, he hasn't been tagged for a homer or an earned run in 20 innings since, racking up three more wins in that span.  You guys kept telling me I was giving up so many homers, so I was ready to stop doing it,  he said. Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at DodgersArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchJustin Turner and Yasmani Grandal drove in two runs apiece as the first-place Dodgers (56-29) extended their lead over the second-place Diamondbacks (52-32) to 3 1/2 games in the National League West. Los Angeles has won 21 of its past 25 games. Daniel Descalso hit a three-run homer off Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen with two outs in the ninth to prevent the shutout. Jansen walked the next batter before striking out pinch hitter Chris Herrmann to seal his 19th save.  Right up until the final moment of the game, we thought we had a chance,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. Kershaw didn't surrender a hit until there was one out in the seventh inning. Arizona shortstop Chris Owings was jammed and sent a slow roller to second baseman Logan Forsythe. First baseman Cody Bellinger went for the ball instead of the bag, and Kershaw was late covering. Diamondbacks catcher Chris Iannetta, who drew Kershaw's only two walks, followed with a single to left to put runners on first and third with two outs, but Descalso grounded to second to end the only threat against Kershaw. Turner came into the day leading five players for the NL Final Vote into the All-Star Game next week in Miami, and he knocked in the game's first two runs. He singled off the top of the wall in the first inning to drive in Forsythe, then hit a solo homer to center field to lead off the third, his eighth of the season. Forsythe came in 8-for-10 in his past three games, and he went 3-for-3 off Arizona starter Patrick Corbin on April 15 at Dodger Stadium. He finished 1-for-3 Tuesday, recording a leadoff double down the right field line in the first. Los Angeles' Chris Taylor doubled with one out in the third before scoring on Grandal's two-out single to right for a 3-0 lead. Corbin (6-8) struck out five through the first two innings, but four of the first five hits he surrendered were for extra bases. He was lifted after 4 2/3 innings of three-run ball. He allowed seven hits and two walks while striking out eight.  I thought he had good and bad moments,  Lovullo said of Corbin.  I thought he could have really fallen apart and come off the mound, given up seven or eight runs, but he only gave up three runs through four innings, and we sent him back out there and he almost wiggled through that fifth inning.  NOTES: The Dodgers placed LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu on the 10-day disabled list prior to the game with left foot soreness. It is the seventh time Ryu has been on the disabled list since he was acquired by the Dodgers in December 2012. The Dodgers recalled RHP Ross Stripling from Triple-A Oklahoma City. ... Diamondbacks CF A.J. Pollock was reinstated from the disabled list prior to the game and went 1-for-4 with a ground-rule double in the leadoff spot. Pollock missed the past seven weeks with a groin strain sustained May 14. To make room on the roster, Arizona optioned INF Ildemaro Vargas to Triple-A Reno. ... Arizona LF Yasmany Tomas was diagnosed with a mild groin strain, manager Torey Lovullo said before the game. Tomas exited a rehab game at the rookie level on Saturday. The setback is unrelated to the groin tendinitis that caused Tomas to go on the 10-day DL on June 6, Lovullo said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-dodgers-writethru-idUSMTZED75LQEJ8L"},

Job-hopping goes against the grain of Japan's work culture, where many companies hire graduates and employ them until they retire. But the country's jobs-for-life system is slowly giving way as firms curb labor costs and society shifts.   Switching jobs for better conditions is no longer taboo amid a tightening labor market, and the trend is being led by mid-career workers.  There's always a risk of failure. But you can't get what you want if you don't try,  said Hiromichi Itakura, 44, head of a medical job placement department at Saint Media Inc in Tokyo, who changed jobs in January.  I took up this job because it gives me a more responsible post. As a salary man, I also wanted a higher salary,  he said, adding that his pay is now 20 percent higher than previously. The number of job-hoppers rose for the seventh straight year to 3.06 million in 2016, the highest since 2009, though it still accounts for just 4.8 percent of the labor market. Older workers have more opportunities because of demographics: a fast-ageing society, low birth rate and falling working-age population. The jobless rate has stood at a near two-decade low while the jobs-to-applicants ratio is at a 43-year high. Big firms say the labor market is at its tightest since 1992, according to the Bank of Japan's latest  tankan  survey published this week. Though job turnover is still low relative to other major economies - the change should be welcome news to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has been championing labor flexibility and merit-based pay - with little success so far. Enhancing labor mobility is expected to help raise low productivity and boost wages, getting Japan convincingly out of a deflationary rut. Competition for Workers Companies facing labor shortages are willing to pay for battle-tested workers who don't need as much training. Electric motor maker Nidec Corp is actively hiring mid-career engineers and remunerating them for their experience.  Competition is tough for tried-and-true personnel,  a company spokesman said on condition of anonymity.  We are doing our best to persuade talented people to join our company.  Hiroaki Okutani, 57, a contract worker of Ueda Co., Ltd., wears an Atoun Inc. Power Assist Suit (AWN-03B) at a distribution center in Kawasaki, Japan June 22, 2017.Toru HanaiJob-hoppers aged between mid-40s and 65 or older are on the rise, hitting their highest, according to comparable data going back to 2002.  The mid-career job market is booming,  said Hirofumi Amano of en-japan inc, a job placement agency. People older than 35 used to be considered past their prime in the mid-career market but these workers are now sought after. Companies are seeking experienced managers and engineers and offering higher pay, Amano said. Workers who secured higher salaries from changing jobs outnumbered those whose paychecks shrank, labor ministry data from 2015 showed. A quarter of job-hoppers saw their salaries rise by 10 percent or more. In comparison, average base wages in April rose just 0.4 percent from a year earlier.  Slideshow (7 Images)The International Monetary Fund has urged Japan to enhance worker mobility to strengthen productivity and wage pressures.  Low labor mobility, a strong preference for job security, and wage setting based on past inflation constitute the main bottlenecks for triggering needed wage-price dynamics.  New Attitude  The rising mid-career job market reflects Japan's changing business climate and evolving attitudes about lifetime employment and seniority-based promotion, analysts say.          Look what happens to even big firms like Toshiba, there's no guarantee for job security. Lifetime employment is something of the good old past,  said Masae Miyachi, 41, of an IT venture company kaonavi, inc. Miyachi changed jobs a year and half ago and her annual salary has now increased by 1 million yen ($8,857), helping her finance a home loan.  You need to carve out a career for yourself to earn stable income, and I'm doing just that by changing jobs.  Japanese firms have curbed labor costs by replacing full-time jobs with part-time positions since the asset-inflated bubble burst in the early 1990s. Now a rising rank of non-regular workers - including part-timers and contract workers - account for nearly 40 percent of the workforce.  Hiroaki Okutani, a 57-year-old contract worker at a logistics company Ueda Co Ltd, who left his job at a food processing firm two years ago, said his decision was partly due to anxiety about life after retirement.  There's no compulsory retirement with this job,  Okutani said.  I'm happy working here as long as my body holds up because I don't think I can live on my pension alone.

Heavy rainfall, mudslides and hail caused by the annual rainy season has killed 56 people and 22 people were missing across 11 provinces and regions as of Tuesday morning, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. More than 750,000 hectares (1.85 million acres) of crops have been damaged and direct economic losses totaled more than 25.3 billion yuan ($3.72 billion), it said.  The government said it had disbursed 700 million yuan ($103 million) in emergency aid to four flood-hit provinces -  Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and Guizhou. Rain in the southern provinces is expected to ease in the coming days, but weather forecasters predict downpours will move to the southwestern province of Sichuan. In what analysts said was a move unprecedented in its scale, the Three Gorges and Gezhouba, two of China's top hydropower plants, closed as much as two-thirds of their capacity to avert flooding further downstream on the Yangtze River.     The move stoked concerns about electricity supplies from China's second-largest power source as a heatwave continued to scorch northern parts of the country, raising the export prices of coal, the fuel the country uses to produce most of its power. Coal from Australia's Newcastle terminal rose to its highest since April, with mining outages tightening supply amid strong northern hemisphere summer demand. The annual rainy season, which arrived in the second half of June, has hit southern Hunan province, one of the nation's largest hog and freshwater fish producers, the most.  High water levels on the Yangtze, Asia's largest river, also slowed barges carrying grain from northern ports to the south, spurring a rise in freight rates and physical corn prices in some regions, analysts and corn buyers said. A man sits in the attic of his flooded house after a flood in Zhaoqing, Guangdong province, China July 4, 2017.StringerZhang Yi, a purchase manager at a feed producer in Hunan, said he had three ships carrying about 5,000 tonnes of corn stuck on waterways near the port of Changsha, the capital of Hunan, since Friday. Corn Prices Rise on Barge Delays Spot corn prices at major ports along the Yangtze and its tributaries, including Changsha, Nanchang in Jiangxi province, and Wuhan in Hubei province, have risen by 30 yuan to 1,800 yuan a ton since last week, according to data provided by China National Grain and Oils Information Center, a government think tank. Slideshow (9 Images)China usually transports corn from northern growing regions to the ports in the south. Then the grain is shipped along the Yangtze and its branches, to central and western provinces including Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. The Yangtze river's large watershed also accounts for 60 percent of the nation's freshwater fish output. Cao Delian, manager of the Dabeinong Changlin fish farm, estimated that he has lost about one-third of his carp due to the deluge.  It's the biggest loss we've seen in at least 5 years,  he told Reuters. On Monday, a natural gas pipeline in Guizhou owned by China National Petroleum Corp collapsed due to a mudslide, causing an explosion that killed at least eight people and injured another 35. In his office in Liuyang, a city near Changsha, Zhang was hoping water levels would continue to subside on Wednesday.   I have stocks of corn that can last for four to five days. As long as it does not rain tomorrow, Changsha port can resume operation and I will get my corn offloaded,  Zhang said.

At a rate review on July 19-20, the Bank of Japan is set to keep monetary policy steady and offer a more upbeat assessment of the economy than it did in June to say it is expanding moderately, said sources familiar with the central bank's thinking.  The economy is in good shape, so it's time to wait for the positive effects to push up prices,  one of the sources said. But the BOJ is likely to cut its inflation forecast for the current year ending March 2018, and possibly that for the following year, in a quarterly review of its long-term projections to be released on July 20, they said. The downgrades will likely be minor and reflect the effect of recent oil price falls, companies' reluctance to raise prices and weak inflation expectations, the sources said. At its April policy meeting, the BOJ said it expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.4 percent in the current fiscal year and 1.7 percent in fiscal 2018. That exceeds a Reuters poll projecting inflation of 0.7 percent in the current year and 0.8 percent the following year.

U.S. and British officials carried out inspections of security measures at Ataturk Airport on Tuesday, Dogan reported. The ban was imposed at the 10 airports in eight countries - Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Turkey - to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices.

Saudi Arabia's index tumbled 2.6 percent on Tuesday.  Retail investors have booked profits ahead of second-quarter results, and there will be weak volumes until those start coming in,  said a Jeddah-based fund manager. Second-quarter earnings announcements are due to start around mid-July. Alrajhi Capital said in a note that it expected consumer-related sectors to do well because of the reinstatement of civil servants' allowances and the month of Ramadan, which traditionally sees a pick-up in consumer spending. Bank earnings may be flat to mildly higher, but Alrajhi expects a poorer performance from the heavyweight petrochemical sector because of weaker oil prices. In Doha, the stock index may stay near January 2016 lows ahead of a meeting by the four Arab states which are boycotting it later in the day in Cairo. A deadline for Doha to comply with the four states' demands officially expired overnight; Qatar has submitted replies to the demands to mediator Kuwait but nobody has disclosed what those replies are. It has shown no sign of acquiescing to major demands, which raises the possibility of the four states imposing more sanctions, but it is not clear that any fresh steps - such as the withdrawal of deposits from Qatar's banking system - would be crippling, given Doha's large financial resources. Overnight, debt rating agency Moody's changed Qatar's rating outlook to negative but affirmed the rating Aa3, suggesting it does not expect major damage to the economy in the short term at least. ​ In Dubai, DAMAC Properties may attract some interest after saying its international arm had hired a former HSBC executive to speed up its expansion in the United Kingdom and Europe. The global environment offers little direction with Brent crude oil about 45 cents shy of $50 a barrel and Asian shares moving little.

On Tuesday night, Andrew Benintendi wanted the spotlight all for himself. The left fielder went 5-for-5 with two homers and a career-high six RBIs as the Red Sox pounded the Texas Rangers 11-4. Benintendi led a Boston offense that pounded out 19 hits, giving it double figures in hits in all six wins in the streak. The offense also backed the best pitching performance of the season by left-hander David Price (4-2), who threw six scoreless innings and struck out nine. The Rangers (40-44) have lost six of their past seven games and are four games under .500 for the first time since June 9. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RangersBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchBoston (49-35) jumped on Texas starter Yu Darvish (6-7) for a pair of runs in the second inning to get things going. Benintendi began his big night with an RBI single. Tzu-Wei Lin's single made it 2-0 with his first career RBI. The Red Sox added two more runs in the fourth on back-to-back RBI singles from Christian Vazquez and Lin. Boston knocked out Darvish in the fifth as Benintendi lined a three-run homer to right for his third hit, putting the Red Sox up 7-0.  I just try to go up there with a good approach and just hit the ball hard, and after the first one kind of squibbed through, baseball kind of works like that sometimes and kind of gets you going,  Benintendi said.  It felt like guys were on in front of me every at-bat.  Darvish had his shortest outing of the season, pitching 4 1/3 innings and allowing seven runs (all earned) on 11 hits. The earned runs and hits allowed matched his career highs.  All the bloopers and then all the ground balls that I thought I'd get an out found a hole and that became a hit,  Darvish said.  I think momentum went their way when that happened. If you look at the hitters, I didn't see many big differences from their lineup. It's just those hits I gave up weren't hard hits. They just found a hole. I feel like I didn't get any luck today.  Texas manager Jeff Banister said of the All-Star pitcher,  There are times when guys go out there and they're not as sharp as they want to be. Tonight was one of those nights for Yu. I feel confident he'll be able to bounce back and be ready to go.  Price had no such problems. He allowed two hits in the first inning but got out of trouble by striking out Carlos Gomez with runners on second and third. He allowed just four singles over the next four innings and now has quality starts in three consecutive outings.  The offense swung the bats extremely well again,  Price said.  Some really good defensive plays, and whenever you get that type of lead early on in a game, you want to hold it right there, and that's what I was able to do,  Price said.  (The Gomez at-bat) was big. At least my last two starts, I've given up a run in the first inning, and that's not what you want to do, especially against a guy like Yu Darvish, and to be able to make pitches right there, that was big.  Benintendi added an RBI single in the sixth inning and then led off the eighth with his second homer of the game. Jackie Bradley Jr. followed with a solo homer to make it 11-0. Benintendi, who has two five-hit games this season, led the way for a Boston team that had six players with multiple hits. Vazquez, Bradley and Lin each had three hits, while Mitch Moreland and Hanley Ramirez had two apiece. Benintendi scored four times while Moreland, Bradley and Ramirez each scored twice. Adrian Beltre went 3-for-5 for Texas. The Rangers avoided a shutout with Mike Napoli's three-run homer in the eighth inning. He has homered in each of the last four games. Delino DeShields also homered for Texas in the ninth. NOTES: The Rangers activated RHP Jeremy Jeffress from the 10-day disabled list. Jeffress had been out with a lower back muscle strain. To make room for Jeffress, Texas designated RHP Ernesto Frieri for assignment. ... Boston LHP Eduardo Rodriguez allowed four runs in four innings in a rehab start for Triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday. He has been out due to a right knee subluxation. ... Texas 3B Adrian Beltre doubled in the first inning, the 600th two-base hit of his career.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-rangers-writethru-idUSMTZED75LO847F"},

That was especially true after the Astros came up with 19 hits, 10 of them for extra bases, against his team on Tuesday.  They're pretty good,  Snitker said.  They're athletic. They really hit. They did that the last time we played them. Look at box scores, and that's the reason they're the best team in baseball.  Center fielder George Springer had his second four-hit game of the season, leading five Houston players with at least three hits as the Astros thrashed the Braves 16-4 before 41,456, the largest crowd in the brief history of SunTrust Park. The Astros matched their season high for hits and scored in double digits for the 11th time. They won the opener of a two-game interleague series. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at BravesAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatch There's a lot that happened tonight positively for us,  Houston manager A.J. Hinch said.  We did a little bit of everything right. When we get going and the whole lineup contributes, we just continue to go at them.  Springer was 4-for-5 with a double, his 25th home run and three runs. Yuli Gurriel was 3-for-5 with two doubles, four RBIs and a run. Jose Altuve went 3-for-5 with a double, his 12th home run, a walk and four RBIs. Alex Bregman was 3-for-4 with two doubles, an RBI and three runs. Josh Reddick was 3-for-6, including his ninth homer, a grand slam in the ninth, and three runs.  I think we were all pretty excited to get in there once we realized that we were going to be moving around the bases pretty much a lot tonight,  Reddick said.  I don't think we were rushing to the bat rack. I think we were just going in there with a lot of confidence and knew we were going to get at least one or two jobs done in the at-bat.  We weren't trying to do too much, it seemed like. We just kept putting up runs. That's one thing this team's been so consistent about.  Houston is 6-0 in interleague play, 3-0 against Atlanta and 19-3 in its past 22 road games. The offensive outburst was in support of Brad Peacock (6-1). The right-hander worked six innings and allowed three runs on seven hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. Atlanta starter Sean Newcomb (1-3) endured his worst outing since being promoted from the minors. He pitched 3 1/3 innings and allowed seven runs on 10 hits and two walks. He saw his rise from 1.48 to 3.58.  I fell behind some hitters, made some good pitches that they hit sometime,  Newcomb said.  One of those nights where it's a good lineup and I made pitches that weren't perfect.  The loss ruined the return of Atlanta's Freddie Freeman, who came back after spending 44 games on the disabled list with a fractured left wrist. Freeman, who moved from first base to third base, singled in his first at-bat and went 1-for-4. He handled his only chance in the field with ease.  I felt like I was in position on every single one,  Freeman said.  I was always looking at Wash (bench coach Ron Washington) and always seemed to say I was in the right spot. Felt like in good position, had good first step and felt pretty good over there.  The Atlanta offense was led by catcher Tyler Flowers (RBI double, sacrifice fly) and pinch hitter Danny Santana, who had a two-run double. The Astros began their barrage in the second inning when Gurriel doubled home Marwin Gonzalez, who led off the inning with a double. Houston added four runs in the third inning. George Springer led off with his 25th home run, but the big blow was Gurriel's three-run double. The Astros tacked on two more runs in the fourth, and three in the fifth on Bregman's RBI double and Altuve's two-run double. NOTES: Houston SS Carlos Correa left the game with left thumb discomfort after sliding into home in the fourth inning and ramming his left hand into the shin guard of C Tyler Flowers. Correa was listed as day-to-day. ... To clear a roster spot for the return of INF Freddie Freeman (fractured left wrist) from the disabled list, Atlanta optioned INF Jace Peterson to Triple-A Gwinnett. ... Houston will recall RHP Joe Musgrove from Triple-A Fresno on Wednesday and start him against Atlanta. RHP Charlie Morton (right lat sprain) will come off the disabled list on Friday to start against Toronto. ... The game started 18 minutes late because of a late-afternoon shower. ... Tony DeFrancesco, Houston's Triple-A manager, is joining the Astros for their six-game road trip to Atlanta and Toronto and will coach third base. DeFrancesco is filling in for Gary Pettis, who is having right knee surgery.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-astros-braves-writethru-idUSMTZED75LNCH70"},

The CSI300 index rose 0.3 percent to 3,632.13 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai sComposite Index gained 0.2 percent, to 3,190.34 points. Commercial pension funds are encouraged to invest in stocks, bonds and funds, in order to provide long-term stable support for the healthy development of China's capital markets, a policy paper dated July 4 from China's cabinet shows. The policy is expected to bring more long-term funds into the stocks market, benefiting the blue-chips, favoured by institutional investors looking for solid fundamentals. The mainland stock market also drew support from China's move to hike the quota under the Renminbi Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) scheme for Hong Kong to 500 billion yuan ($73.59 billion) to further meet demand for yuan asset allocation by Hong Kong investors. As a pioneer to promote the yuan's internationalisation, Hong Kong was granted a 270 billion yuan quota under the RQFII scheme in 2011 to facilitate cross-border foreign investment.  The increase could have a positive impact on the (mainland) stock market,  said Zhang Qi, a Haitong Securities analyst. Financials led the advance in the morning. Insurance industry bellwether New China Life Insurance hit an 18-month high before ending up 6.7 percent. Hong Kong stocks steadied, as shares in index heavyweight Tencent Holdings, China's biggest gaming and social media firm by revenue, recouped earlier losses to rise 0.9 percent in the morning session. The stock slumped more than 4 percent on Wednesday, posting its worst day in 17 months, after it said it will limit play time for some young users of  Honour of Kings . The Hang Seng index added 0.4 percent, to 25,478.85 points. The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained 0.3 percent, to 10,340.85 points.

The erstwhile Cincinnati Reds ace held the Colorado Rockies to one run in six innings and earned his first win since Aug. 12, 2016, as the Reds routed the Rockies 8-1. Cincinnati's Scott Schebler went 3-for-4 with a homer, and Jose Peraza and Scooter Gennett also went deep for the Reds. Three surgeries have limited Bailey to just 11 starts dating from Sept. 5, 2014. Two of those outings came late last month at Washington and against Milwaukee after Bailey was reinstated from the 60-day disabled list. The games left Bailey with a 27.00 ERA as he worked a combined 4 2/3 innings and was strafed for 12 hits, three of them homers, and 14 runs. Bailey (1-2) was very efficient Tuesday, though, throwing 65 of 99 pitches for strikes. He gave up eight hits, all singles, with no walks and three strikeouts. Reds manager Bryan Price cited Bailey's fastball command. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at RockiesCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch I thought as the game went on, he was able to do what he needed to do with the slider, so he didn't concede,  Price said.  (The slider let Bailey) get away from having to pump fastball in fastball counts. And that's kind of at times what hurt him in his first two starts was predictability when he was behind in the count.  Bailey got Mark Reynolds to ground into an inning-ending double play in the first when the Rockies scored their lone run on three consecutive one-out singles. He stranded runners at second and third in the fifth with the Reds leading 4-1 by striking out Trevor Story and getting Alexi Amarista to ground out.  I didn't give any free passes,  Bailey said.  Everything was a little bit sharper (than the two previous starts). We had good command of everything tonight.  Rockies rookie left-hander Kyle Freeland (8-7) yielded five runs on eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. He allowed four runs in the first three innings, all with two outs, and fell to 0-3 with a 7.27 ERA in his past three starts. The teams traded runs in the first, the Reds scoring on Adam Duvall's RBI double. The hit scored Billy Hamilton, who opened the game with a single. Hamilton's two-run single in the second gave the Reds a 3-1 lead. Schebler led off the inning with a double, and Freeland walked No. 8 hitter Tucker Barnhart with one out. Bailey sacrificed, putting runners at second and third, and Hamilton followed with a single to short left. Peraza's RBI single in the third gave Cincinnati a 4-1 lead. The ball dropped in front of left fielder Raimel Tapia, who has shown hesitancy coming in on balls. Peraza's hit was the third straight two-out single off Freeland.  From my vantage point, it was a pretty rough outing,  Freeland said.  They had some bleeders fall in that turned into runs. And they had some hard-hit balls on mistake pitches. My command is not where it needs to be.  Peraza gave the Reds a 5-1 lead when he belted his fourth homer with one out in the sixth. He connected on the 92 mph fastball Freeland threw on a full count. Barnhart then drew the second of his three walks, ending Freeland's outing. The Reds broke the game open against struggling Adam Ottavino in the eighth when Schebler hit his 21st homer and pinch hitter Gennett belted a two-run homer to make it 8-1. Gennett's third career pinch-hit homer gave him 14 long balls for the season, tying the career high he set last year. Ottavino has been scored upon in five of his past six games and has a 23.14 ERA in that 4 2/3-inning stretch, raising his overall ERA to 6.00. Colorado lost for the 11th time in 13 games. During that span, the Rockies have hit just eight home runs, they are batting .206 (21-for-102) with runners in scoring position and have gone without an extra-base hit in five games, including Tuesday.  We need five or six guys swinging the bat well,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  We don't have that now.  NOTES: Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (testicular cancer) threw 25 pitches to hitters in his first live batting practice session. He will face hitters again Friday. ... Colorado 1B Mark Reynolds' single in the sixth broke a string of 18 consecutive hitless at-bats. ... Rockies OF Gerardo Parra (right quad strain) began what is expected to be a three-game rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque, playing five innings in left field and going 0-for-2. ... Rockies 2B DJ LeMahieu, who left the Monday game in the ninth with right groin soreness, did not play Tuesday on a planned rest day. ... Reds CF Billy Hamilton was back in the lineup after not playing Monday due to lower back stiffness. He went 2-for-4 with two RBIs. ... Cincinnati SS Zack Cozart returned to the lineup after a scheduled day off Monday as he eases his way back from a right quad strain that sidelined him for four weeks. He finished 0-for-5.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-rockies-writethru-idUSMTZED75LM055S"},

While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may be able to claim relatively high compliance with its plan to lower output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), this is ultimately just a smokescreen. Of far more importance is evidence that the group actually exported more crude in the first six months of this year than it did in the first half of 2016. OPEC exports jumped to 25.92 million bpd in June this year, up 450,000 bpd from May's 25.47 million bpd, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research. Over the first six months of this year OPEC exports averaged 25.02 million bpd, up 290,000 bpd from the same period in 2016, according to the data. OPEC may be able to claim a small win insofar as the group's exports have dropped from the second half of 2016, when they averaged 25.14 million bpd. But this is a tiny reduction from what was a period of near record output for the group, and in some ways actually only underscores the lack of success OPEC has had so far this year in restricting exports. The rise in OPEC exports in the first half does look at odds with the cuts the group has made to production, with the 11 members that committed to lowering output achieving 92 percent compliance with their targets in June, according to a Reuters survey. But the vessel-tracking data show the crude market is getting as much oil from OPEC as it had been prior to the November deal. The problem for OPEC is that while some members have indeed cut both output and exports, others haven't. The group's biggest producer Saudi Arabia exported an average 7.28 million bpd in the first six months of 2017, according to the shipping and port data. This was down 350,000 bpd on the same period last year, meaning the kingdom has actually reduced exports by a figure relatively close to its pledge to lower output by 486,000 bpd as part of the producer agreement. Uneven Burden However, exports from the United Arab Emirates have risen to an average 2.8 million bpd in the first half of this year from 2.52 million bpd in the same period in 2016. Those from Iran have gained 450,000 bpd to 2.13 million bpd in the first half of this year, as the Islamic Republic boosts exports after the lifting of Western sanctions in the wake of an agreement on its nuclear programme. While Libya isn't party to the output-cutting deal, its exports have risen from an average 243,000 bpd in the first half of 2016 to 553,000 bpd this year as the North African producer slowly recovers from its debilitating civil conflict. With the first six months of the deal to cut output now having passed, a few things are clearer. The first is that even if there has been good compliance with restricting output, this hasn't translated to lower exports from OPEC. Secondly, the heavy lifting is being done mainly by Saudi Arabia, which begs the question as to how long it will be willing to shoulder the burden of being the driver of efforts to balance the oil market. Thirdly, if there is to be a supply-led rebalancing of the oil market, OPEC and its allies will likely have to do more, or at least reduce actual exports by the joint 1.8 million bpd, rather than the harder-to-quantify measure of production. The price of global benchmark Brent crude has recovered from its recent low of $44.35 a barrel on June 21, closing at $49.61 on Tuesday. But it is more or less at the same level that prevailed before the Nov. 30 output cut was announced, meaning OPEC and its allies only achieved a relatively short boost to prices. In retrospect this isn't surprising in the light of data showing the group's exports rising in year-on-year terms in the first half, but it should give OPEC's leaders much pause for thought.  Lying to ourselves is more deeply ingrained than lying to others,  wrote 19th century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Perhaps OPEC needs to stop trying to convince itself and others that its output cuts are working, and either abandon the tactic or amend it to make it genuinely effective.

A holiday in the United States and a lack of market catalysts muted Asian trading, although minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting due later in the day could signal how committed it was to raising rates again this year and any detail on plans to wind back its massive balance sheet.     Risk sentiment took a hit as North Korea said it had conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can carry a large and heavy nuclear warhead.        Southeast Asian markets are quite mixed due to geopolitical tensions created by the launching of ICBM from North Korea,  said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Manila-based Asiasec Equities Inc.      I think the cautiousness is due to the perception that it might precede some harsh action from major countries like U.S. and Japan.           Meanwhile, a private business survey showed China's services sector grew at a slower pace in June as new orders slumped, pointing to a softening outlook for the economy.     Singapore shares gained as much as 0.7 percent, aided by financial stocks, with Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp climbing as much as 0.7 percent.      Philippine shares were flat, with industrials such as Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc weighing down the index.     The Philippines' annual inflation eased for a second straight month in June due to slower price increases in food and transport, data from the statistics agency showed on Wednesday.     Indonesian shares edged lower, dragged by telecom stocks such as Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Persero) Tbk PT , which fell as much as 1.1 percent.

The dollar shed 0.3 percent in early trade to fetch 113.00 yen, slipping further from Monday's 1-1/2-month high of 113.48. The yen tends to be bought back at times of heightened global uncertainty because of expectations Japanese investors may repatriate their foreign investment, despite the country's proximity to North Korea. Pyongyang said on Wednesday it had conducted a test of a newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can carry a large and heavy nuclear warhead, triggering a call by Washington for global action to hold the isolated nation accountable for its pursuit of nuclear weapons. The Pentagon condemned the missile test and said it was prepared to defend the United States and its allies, while South Korea's defence minister said he sees a high possibility of a nuclear test by North Korea.  U.S. hi-tech shares have been getting a bit unstable of late and we had an ICBM during U.S. market holiday (on Tuesday). So the markets are becoming a bit risk averse,  said Minori Uchida, chief forex analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. The Canadian dollar also held firm, trading at C$1.2934 per dollar after having hit a 10-month high of C$1.2912 to the dollar on Tuesday. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told a German newspaper that Canada's inflation should be well into an uptrend by the first half of 2018, adding that policy normalization must begin before price growth hits its target. His comments prompted markets to price in a more than 50 percent chance of a rate hike at the central bank's next meeting on July 12, a dramatic turn from less than two weeks ago when barely anyone had bet on a tightening. The Bank of Canada is in tune with policy makers at the European Central Bank and the Bank of England who last week also signalled future tightening, supporting the euro and the pound against the dollar. Although the common currency slipped early this week after rallying 2.1 percent last week, it has stabilised around $1.1359 .  If we have more comments from ECB officials clearly implying tapering of its stimulus, we could see further upside in the euro,  said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street. Last week's top of $1.1445, its highest level in over a year, is seen as its immediate target. A clear break of the $1.15-16 area would signal a major departure from its trading range since early 2015. The euro may struggle, however, to break above that range if upcoming U.S. data support the case for the Federal Reserve to keep winding back its stimulus, some market players said. The minutes of its last policy meeting due at 1800 GMT on Wednesday are expected to shed more light on the Fed's thinking on its future policy path. Many market players expect the Fed to announce a plan to start reducing its balance sheet in September and raise interest rates in December. The Australian dollar licked wounds at $0.7617 after the nation's central bank stuck to a neutral stance on the economy and interest rates on Tuesday, disappointing many traders who had expected a more hawkish tone. The Aussie showed limited reaction to a private survey by Caixin/Markit for June showing a cooling in the services sector in China - Australia's major trading partner.

Corey Kluber allowed one run on five hits in eight innings while setting an Indians strikeout record, but he still took the loss as San Diego beat Cleveland 1-0 at Progressive Field. Kluber (7-3) walked one and struck out 10, becoming the first pitcher in Indians history with 10 or more strikeouts in five consecutive games. However, six San Diego pitchers combined on a five-hit shutout. A misplayed fifth-inning grounder hit by Cory Spangenberg scored the game's only run. It was the third time in the past eight games the Indians were shut out at Progressive Field, where they have one of the worst home records (18-22) in the American League. Cleveland hitters were 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at Indians Some nights, we press or we swing at the wrong pitches and don't get it done,  Cleveland second baseman Jason Kipnis said.  Tonight was one of those games. It was unfortunate, because Corey pitched great.  Kluber downplayed the strikeouts.  I don't think that strikeouts are necessarily the only way to reflect a good game,  he said.  I think I made some good pitches today where the at-bat didn't end in strikeouts.  San Diego manager Andy Green said the Padres' pitchers rose to the occasion, particularly by holding Cleveland hitless with runners in scoring position.  (That) was huge, especially going against an ace like Corey Kluber,  Green said. Padres starter Trevor Cahill said,  It was a great team win for us, against a guy who is throwing as well as anyone in the league right now.  San Diego reliever Jose Torres (5-2) got two outs in the fifth inning in relief of Cahill, but it was enough to earn the win. Kirby Yates, Ryan Buchter and Brad Hand each pitched an inning, and Brandon Maurer handled the ninth to pick up his 17th save.  They had a lot of guys on base, but we were able to eke out a win,  Green said. Cahill, who was activated off the disabled list prior to the start of the game, pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings. He allowed four hits and two walks while striking out four, exiting after 85 pitches. It was Cahill's first start in a major league game since May 13, as he was out due to right shoulder inflammation.  He's right back to where he was before he got hurt,  Green said.  His breaking ball was off the charts.  Cahill said,  I felt great. I had a couple stressful innings but was able to get out of them. Against that guy (Kluber), you can't give in because one run might be the difference in the game.  The Padres scored the only run of the game in the fifth inning, thanks to some shaky defense by Cleveland. Hector Sanchez singled and went to second on a walk drawn by Carlos Asuaje. Erick Aybar hit a sharp grounder to shortstop. Francisco Lindor fielded it, but instead of flipping the ball to Kipnis to initiate an attempt at a double play, Lindor ran to the base himself. But after tagging the base, the opportunity for a double play was lost. Sanchez moved to third on the play. Cory Spangenberg, the next batter, hit what appeared to be a double play-grounder to Kipnis, but Kipnis bobbled the ball, and the Indians were only able to get the force on Aybar at second. Sanchez scored on the play.  It caught me in the bad part of the glove, and popped out right in front of me,  Kipnis said.  At that point, I just had to rush and get one. That one needs to be turned though. It's frustrating, especially to be the one who (messed) it up, and have it be a one-run game.  NOTES: To make room on the roster for the return of RHP Trevor Cahill from the disabled list, the Padres designated INF Chase d'Arnaud for assignment. ... San Diego OF Hunter Renfroe's 17 doubles are tops among all National League rookies, and he is second among major league rookies behind Houston's Yuli Gurriel, who has 19. In his past six games, Renfroe is hitting .435 (10-for-23), with three doubles, one triple, one home run and four RBIs. ... Indians RHP Danny Salazar will make his second rehab start Thursday for Triple-A Columbus. Salazar has been on the disabled list since June 6 due to right shoulder soreness.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-padres-indians-writethru-idUSMTZED75LJ1I46"},

The government expects to recruit fewer than 500 soldiers, whose duties will include rebuilding after natural disasters and monitoring borders for smuggled contraband, Defense Minister Herve Denis told Reuters in an interview.  I was planning to recruit 500 in the first recruitment but now, because of budget problems, we have to reduce the numbers,  he said.  We are waiting on the vote on the budget to determine how many we will eventually recruit.  The vote is expected in the next few months. Former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded Haiti's army in 1995 following a military coup.  Previous president Michel Martelly drafted a plan for a small military force in 2011. Calls from politicians for an expanded army have grown with the looming departure in October of a 13-year United Nations mission in Haiti intended to restore stability after a second coup against Aristide in 2004. However, Haiti's budget is tight and critics say the government should focus its resources on the two decade-old national police force, which has roughly 15,000 officers.  Haiti does not need an army,  said Mario Joseph, a human rights attorney and one of Aristide's lawyers.  We must use what little money Haiti has rationally. ... Haiti cannot even take care of the police with the national budget.
