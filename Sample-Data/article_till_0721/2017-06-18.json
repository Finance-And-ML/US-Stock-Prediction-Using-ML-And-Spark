[{"content": "An American warplane shot down a Syrian government jet on Sunday, the Pentagon said, marking the first time in Syria\u2019s civil war that a U.S. pilot has struck a regime plane and signaling an increased willingness by the Trump administration to directly challenge President       Bashar al-Assad       and his allies.On Sunday, the U.S. military said it had shot down the Syrian SU-22 after regime forces twice attacked members of American-backed Syrian fighters leading the assault on Raqqa, the self-declared capital of the Islamic State terror group.With the strike, the U.S. military made it clear it is now willing to target Syrian regime jets to protect the coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters working with U.S. special-operation forces to push Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from Raqqa.The U.S. military said the confrontation began Sunday afternoon when Syrian forces attacked the Syrian Democratic Forces near Raqqa, forcing the U.S.-backed fighters to retreat as they evacuated their injured. Coalition aircraft flew low over the regime forces in a \u201cshow of force\u201d that stopped them from advancing, the military said.The U.S., which has no direct contact with the Syrian regime, then said it used an established deconfliction line with the Russians, who fly their own airstrikes in Syria in support of Mr. Assad, to try to bring the fight to a halt. About two hours after the initial Syrian attack, a regime SU-22 jet dropped bombs on U.S.-backed forces in the same area.Citing \u201ccollective self-defense of coalition partnered forces,\u201d the U.S. military said an American F/A-18E Super Hornet shot down the regime jet. Col. John Thomas, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said there were no U.S. forces in the \u201cimmediate vicinity\u201d of the Syrian regime attack.Syrian state media called the U.S. attack a \u201cflagrant aggression\u201d and said the jet was carrying out a mission against Islamic State militants when it was downed. The pilot is missing, according to state media. The Syrian army said the U.S. \u201cattack stresses coordination between the U.S. and ISIS,\u201d according to Syrian state media.Col. Thomas dismissed that characterization and said that the coalition saw the Syrian forces attack the U.S.-backed fighters.Sunday\u2019s strike signaled an expansion of the U.S. military\u2019s willingness to directly confront Mr. Assad\u2019s forces. And it poses a new question for the American military: Would it be willing to shoot down a Russian or Turkish jet that carries out any similar attacks?Col. Thomas said the message was purely for the Syrian regime forces, not the Russians.\u201cThe whole goal here is, when these situations have been occurring, to de-escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not putting on any ultimatums. It\u2019s case-by-case. You try to dial it down rather than ramp it up.\u201dAaron Stein, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said the strike was an outgrowth of an ill-defined strategy that is being driven more by battlefield tactics than an overarching administration policy.\u201cNobody has thought this through,\u201d he said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any policy guidance.\u201dOver the past month, the U.S. military has launched a series of airstrikes on pro-Assad regime forces in southern Syria, where an Iranian-made drone carried out an attack on U.S.-led coalition forces before being shot down by an American pilot. Now, U.S. forces are challenging Syrian regime forces in the north.In its statement, the U.S. military tried to defuse tensions.\u201cThe coalition\u2019s mission is to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria,\u201d the military said. \u201cThe coalition does not seek to fight Syrian regime, Russian, or pro-regime forces partnered with them, but will not hesitate to defend coalition or partner forces from any threat.\u201dSunday\u2019s incident is believed to be the first time a manned American jet has shot down another once since 1999, when an American pilot shot down a Serbian jet over Bosnia.For most of the six-year war in Syria, the U.S. has sought to avoid direct confrontations with Mr. Assad\u2019s forces in the country and focus its firepower on defeating Islamic State. That calculus began to change in April, when Mr. Trump approved airstrikes on a Syrian regime airfield, a punitive strike meant to deter Mr. Assad from using chemical weapons.Things worsened last month in southern Syria where U.S. forces are beefing up their presence at a training base near the border with Iraq and Jordan. The U.S. carried out airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias seen as a threat and later shot down an Iranian-made drone circling U.S.-led coalition forces in the area. The fighting in southern Syria has raised concerns about increasing escalation that could draw the U.S. military more deeply into the conflict.Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards force said Sunday that it had launched multiple missile strikes targeting Islamic State in one of its last Syrian strongholds, Deir Ezzour province. The strike was in retaliation for a June 7 attack on Iran\u2019s parliament and a shrine in Tehran claimed by the terror group.The hard-line paramilitary force said it had fired medium-range surface-to-surface missiles from bases in western Iran. It claimed that the strike hit a command center and logistics centers used for assembling suicide car bombs and had killed many fighters.The Guards said the missile strikes were a warning to deter any further action by terrorists after the attack this month that killed 17 people.Tehran has played a major role in backing Mr. Assad in the six-year-old civil war, sending advisers and militia fighters to aid the regime. But this is the first time it has launched direct attacks from its territory. Iran has allowed Russia to use its territory to stage airstrikes on rebels in Syria.Iran\u2019s unusual show of force comes as archrival Saudi Arabia is increasingly asserting itself in a regional power struggle with Tehran, emboldened by a friendlier administration in Washington. At the same time, the U.S. is confronting Syrian forces and their allies more frequently to protect American-backed Syrian rebels who are fighting both the regime and Islamic State.\u2014Aresu Eqbali in Tehran contributed to this article.Write to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com and Raja Abdulrahim at raja.abdulrahim@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Pilot Shoots Down Syrian Jet.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 23:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-led-coalition-says-it-shot-down-syrian-aircraft-1497820157", "news_title": "U.S. Says It Shot Down Syrian Aircraft ", "keywords": "aircraft,coalition aircraft,dropped bombs,first time,shot down,syrian civil war,syrian conflict,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "Macron was set to win a commanding majority in France\u2019s parliamentary elections, empowering him to carry out contentious economic overhauls.Israel has been aiding Syrian rebels near its border, in a secret effort to carve out a buffer zone populated by friendly forces.A lawyer for Trump said the president wasn\u2019t under investigation, following reports that he was the target of an obstruction probe.May faced mounting accusations that she fumbled the response to a deadly London fire, as the U.K. leader prepared for Brexit talks.EU leaders are set to extend sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, but some economic and political ties are broadening again.Iraqi forces pushed into Mosul\u2019s Old City, in what is expected to be the final phase of a fight to retake the city from Islamic State.U.S. diplomats have held secret talks with North Korea\u2019s top nuclear negotiator in Pyongyang and Europe for more than a year.Forest fires raging in central Portugal have killed at least 61 people, with the death toll likely to rise.Senate and House panels plan open hearings Wednesday\u00a0to examine Russian election-hacking efforts.Died: Helmut Kohl, 87, ex-German leader who presided over reunification.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-world-wide-1497839933", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: World-Wide", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,news digests"}, {"content": "Amazon\u2019s deal to buy Whole Foods would unite two maverick CEOs with sharply different strategies and missions.Investors are turning away from Britain, as disappointing economic data and an inconclusive election stoke concerns.U.S. companies with ties to Europe are benefiting from the Continent\u2019s brightening outlook.China\u2019s central bank loosened monetary policy after the Fed tightened it, injecting $36.73 billion into the financial system Friday.Trump meets Monday with tech industry CEOs in talks expected to focus on modernizing government.Aerospace startups for the first time will have a prominent role at this week\u2019s Paris Air Show.Airlines are bracing for added security checks as the U.S. weighs expanding its carry-on laptop ban.Robo-advisory services are focusing on socially responsible investing, driven by millennials\u2019 interest.Google faces an EU fine for rigging search results to favor its own comparison-shopping service.Big oil firms are piling into the Permian Basin, hoping to turn a profit where smaller drillers failed.GM\u2019s Cruise unit is entering the mapping business as the auto maker competes to make self-driving cars.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-business-finance-1497838893", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: Business & Finance", "keywords": "China's central bank,corporate,industrial news,news digests"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014The resounding victory of President       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       fledgling political force in parliamentary elections crushed the traditional parties that have governed France since the end of World War II.The French president\u2019s party La R\u00e9publique en Marche, founded barely a year ago, bulldozed into the National Assembly with its centrist ally, taking 350 of the 577 seats.In its wake was the rubble of France\u2019s former left-right divide\u2014the Socialist Party and the center-right Les R\u00e9publicains\u2014that had taken turns governing the country for decades.The Socialists of former President       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande       and allies, who formed the majority in the assembly for the past five years, secured a mere 45 seats. The head of the party,       Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis,        resigned within minutes of the results coming in.\u201cThe left must change everything, its form and its fundamentals, its ideas and organization,\u201d Mr. Cambad\u00e9lis said.Les R\u00e9publicains and an ally hung on to 137 seats in an alliance with another centrist group, slightly more than polls had shown last week. Previously, that center-right alliance had 225 seats.\u201cWe have a group that is large enough to make our commitments and beliefs heard,\u201d said       Fran\u00e7ois Baroin,        who led the Les R\u00e9publicains.The scale of the French establishment\u2019s defeat is a measure of its collective failure to reinvigorate a country whose economy has languished for decades, straining to address tensions with its Muslim minority and clocking mediocre economic growth. Unemployment hovers near 10%, and more than twice that among young voters.Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the father of postwar France, laid the foundations for French conservatism as well as for three decades of galloping economic growth known as Les Trente Glorieuses. Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took the reins in the 1980s and \u201990s and hammered out the framework of the European Union, including its single currency, with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who died last week.As power continued to alternate between the two sides, however, France ran out of economic momentum, and the European project stalled. The timeworn themes of taxation and welfare hardened the left-right divide while a larger clash loomed between the forces of globalization and economic nationalism.The latter was seized by the National Front, a far-right party with xenophobic roots that started to notch victories in local, regional and European Parliament elections. The banner of globalism and European integration, meanwhile, was taken up this year by Mr. Macron, who founded his own political party in April last year, saying he would transcend the left-right divide and directly take on Ms. Le Pen.In beating Ms. Le Pen in the May presidential election, Mr. Macron also put the establishment parties on notice heading into the parliamentary races: Join me or risk oblivion. Many Socialist lawmakers ditched their party and sought Mr. Macron\u2019s blessing to run on a R\u00e9publique en Marche ticket.\u201cWe have a party which has a relationship with Mr. Macron that\u2019s ambiguous,\u201d said       Guillaume Balas,        a Socialist Party MEP and a close aide to the party\u2019s defeated presidential candidate,       Beno\u00eet Hamon.       \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we should be in the majority or in the opposition.\u201dMr. Macron also drove a wedge through Les R\u00e9publicains by appointing centrists from the party to senior positions in his government. In around 50 constituencies, Mr. Macron struck deals with some lawmakers from Les R\u00e9publicains, agreeing not to field a candidate for his party if they agreed to back him in Parliament.The young leader also tapped voters\u2019 desire for political renewal by making a point of choosing candidates who had no political experience. La R\u00e9publique en Marche candidates included a mathematician, a hairdresser, a theologian, police officers, lawyers, sports stars and even a retired bullfighter.France\u2019s new National Assembly will stand in contrast to its peers in Europe, where traditional parties still have a firm grip on power. In the U.K., the Conservatives and Labour Party got a combined 82% in the general election this month. In Germany, the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats are each forecast to get more than 25% of the vote in September general elections.If France\u2019s traditional parties are to survive, they will have to rebuild from the regional and local levels where they still have a presence, analysts say.\u201cDespite being extremely weakened they remain the parties that have by far the greatest number of elected officials if you look at all echelons. That doesn\u2019t vanish overnight,\u201d said       Philippe Marli\u00e8re,        a professor of French politics at University College London.Write to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com and William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Traditional Parties Lick Their Wounds After Vote Setback.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/macron-deals-a-crippling-blow-to-frances-establishment-1497810941", "news_title": "Macron Deals a Crippling Blow to France\u2019s Establishment", "keywords": " election,france, french election, french president, macron, national assembly,Emmanuel Macron,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "The White House announced President Donald Trump\u2019s intent to nominate a longtime Republican congressional staffer to chair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., lining up another pick for a key regulatory post.James Clinger,        who has been serving as chief counsel for the House Financial Services Committee, could start serving on the FDIC board as soon as he is confirmed by the Senate and would take over as chairman in late November, when current FDIC Chairman       Martin Gruenberg\u2019s       term ends.Mr. Clinger has been a staffer on the House panel since 1995, with a break from 2005 to 2007 when he served as deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department, according to the White House.At the FDIC, he would be in charge of regulating many small, locally-focused community banks as well as evaluating whether large banks have credible \u201cliving will\u201d plans for failing without a taxpayer bailout.

Marine Le Pen\u2019s       far-right National Front hoped to mount a robust opposition force after reaching the presidential runoff in May, but on Sunday her party only landed eight seats, not enough to guarantee space on parliamentary committees.The vote also left the country\u2019s traditional parties on life support. The Socialists of former President       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande       went from being a majority party to the edge of oblivion, notching 45 seats with their allies. The center-right Les R\u00e9publicains and an ally finished a distant second to Mr. Macron\u2019s party, with 137 seats, according to the almost-complete count. That center-right alliance previously held 225 seats.Instead Mr. Macron, a 39-year-old political newcomer, has reshaped Parliament in his own image, handpicking academics, athletes, business owners and deserters from traditional parties to fill the National Assembly and pass legislation of his choosing.\u201cBy a wide majority, the French chose hope instead of anger,\u201d said Prime Minister       \u00c9douard Philippe.The only weakness in Mr. Macron\u2019s majority on Sunday was the historically low turnout that produced it. More than 56% of voters abstained, according to the count.\u201cThe French people wanted to give us a clear majority, but\u2026they didn\u2019t want to give us a blank check,\u201d said       Christophe Castaner,        Mr. Macron\u2019s secretary of parliamentary relations, who also won a seat on Sunday.\u201cEven if the Macron government has a very strong majority, his ideas are in the minority,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said after winning a seat, her first ever, in northern France.Lackluster support from the broader public could weigh on Mr. Macron\u2019s ability to make unpopular changes to the domestic labor market and keep France\u2019s end of what he considers a \u201cNew Deal\u201d for Europe.That involves loosening rigid protections for workers to bring France in line with other European countries and stir growth and job creation. Such changes have sunk past presidencies as the ultimate arbiter of national politics, the French street, unleashed crippling strikes and protest.If Mr. Macron succeeds at home, it will go a long way in rebalancing the Franco-German axis that led the construction of the EU, European officials say. France\u2019s economically weakened neighbors in the south are particularly eager to see France resume its traditional role as advocate for their economies, which rely on looser monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate growth.\u201cThe quicker Mr. Macron will be in transforming France, the more rapidly he will become strong in Europe,\u201d said       Sandro Gozi,        Italy\u2019s undersecretary on European affairs.Mr. Macron wants Germany and other strong eurozone countries in the north to make longstanding commitments to backstop the whole currency union rather than responding ad hoc to crises. The French president has campaigned for the eurozone to have its own budget and Parliament with a shared finance minister.German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        who once dreaded the prospect of a National Front victory, has promised to work with Mr. Macron, praising him for \u201ca magnificent campaign against populism.\u201dMs. Merkel followed up on Sunday, as a Twitter post by her spokesman said, \u201cHere\u2019s to continued good cooperation for\u201d Germany, France, and Europe.Still, Mr. Macron\u2019s plans face deep-seated skepticism in Germany, where leading politicians have long been suspicious that Paris\u2019s calls for EU integration amount to demands that Berlin foot the bill for profligacy in Greece and beyond.Ms. Merkel and her key allies have largely shied away from backing Mr. Macron\u2019s specific demands of a eurozone finance minister and a common eurozone budget.Gunther Krichbaum,        chairman of the German parliament\u2019s EU affairs committee, said Europe should focus instead on using its established instruments to help struggling countries rather than creating new structures.\u201cWe must first make full use of the existing possibilities before we start thinking about new ones,\u201d Mr. Krichbaum said in an interview.Behind the scenes, French officials say they are skirting demands for new European bodies in order to first establish common ground with Germany on how much sovereignty each side is willing to give up.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a fundamental construction site that will take some time,\u201d one French official said.Mr. Macron plans to waste no time at home. He has said he would seek a mandate from his parliamentary majority in July to legislate by decree, fast-tracking his labor overhauls, so they will go into effect as early as September. That month, Ms. Merkel faces a re-election campaign in Germany.The changes aim to give companies greater leeway in reaching agreements with employees that sidestep restrictions in France\u2019s labor code, such as the 35-hour workweek and rules that make it costly to hire and fire people. Mr. Macron\u2019s government will seek parliamentary approval in July so the changes can be effective as early as September.Some German officials say that if Mr. Macron shows he is serious about what Germans say are long overdue overhauls, there will be an expectation that Germany after its own elections make some political concessions.Beyond that, some in Berlin are skeptical of Mr. Macron\u2019s chances for success, especially given the entrenched opposition to overhauls in parts of the French public that didn\u2019t vote for him or his party. La R\u00e9publique en Marche\u2019s victory in the first round of the parliamentary election last week was based on the support of only 13.4% of registered voters.\u201cThe money will not fall on fertile ground, so to speak, if these necessary structural reforms aren\u2019t made,\u201d Mr. Krichbaum said.\u201cHe won\u2019t force Madame Merkel\u2019s hand. He doesn\u2019t have the weight,\u201d said       Dominique Freulon,        a retired executive assistant who typically votes right but cast her vote for a Socialist on Sunday to oppose Mr. Macron\u2019s party.\u2014Giovanni Legorano  in Rome and Anton Troianovski in Berlin  contributed to this article.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com and Stacy Meichtry at stacy.meichtry@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   In second-round voting on Sunday, La R\u00e9publique en Marche and partners won 350 seats in the National Assembly, Les R\u00e9publicains and affiliates won 137 seats, and the Socialist alliances won 45 seats.

He sat down with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s financial editor, Dennis K. Berman, to discuss how the Trump administration views trade relations with China and the rest of the world. Edited excerpts follow.MR. BERMAN: At his inauguration, President Trump said: \u201cThe rule of the future should be to hire American and buy American.\u201d What is the moral duty of the CFOs here to abide by that rule?MR. ROSS: Just about every other country in the world has more protectionist rules than we do. Take China. China has the most beautiful free-trade rhetoric. And those of you who do business either within the country or try to export to it know they are the most highly protectionist of the big countries. So this is nothing new. We\u2019ve been in a trade war for decades. The only difference is now the American troops are coming to the ramparts for maybe the first time.MR. BERMAN: But for goods that have been brought into the U.S. and are legitimately cheaper, do CFOs have a duty to buy American?MR. ROSS: Well, the \u201cBuy American\u201d policy relates to federal contracting. It relates to pipelines. It relates to some pretty specific activities.But I think people ought to think about short term versus long term. If I were an importer, I would beware of what happened already in the rare-earths [metals industry]. China is a very big supplier of rare earths, which are quite essential to many electronic products. They drove everybody in this country out of business by dumping, dumping, dumping, dumping. And guess what happened once they did? Prices suddenly went way up. And when they get angry with a country, they cut off the supplies.So long term, it seems to me, the interests of American businesses and of the president\u2019s policy are totally consistent because there are no free lunches.MR. BERMAN: How bad is it with China in terms of our ability to access the Chinese markets and the way they behave in the U.S.?MR. ROSS: Well, we\u2019re making a lot of progress with China. The Mar-a-Lago summit, which I was privileged to be part of, accomplished a lot, and mostly all to the good. I\u2019ll give you some examples.For 14 years, American beef producers have been trying to get their product into China on an unfettered basis. In less than 100 days, we got it in. And that first beef will literally be leaving in about 10 days. The same is true for some other things.Those were the easier deliverables. We\u2019re now working on another list. We generally have two conference calls a day, one early in the morning our time and one late at night with the Chinese. That\u2019s five, six, seven days a week.The whole fabric of these discussions is different from prior ones. We aren\u2019t interested in great long-winded debates and big ceremonial meetings and big proclamations that have no teeth. We\u2019re interested in very specific, very tangible achievements. And we\u2019re finding a very, very sensible give-and-take with the Chinese right now.MR. BERMAN: President Trump said on the campaign trail, he wanted to get out of the WTO. Is that going to happen?MR. ROSS: That\u2019s a very radical step for one to take. I do think there are things that need to be fixed in the WTO, but I think our first effort should be internal reform, not blow up the whole system.MR. BERMAN: Let\u2019s talk about Nafta. If there is one most important thing about changing the dynamic in Nafta, what is it?MR. ROSS: Well, it\u2019s an obsolete agreement. It didn\u2019t envision the digital economy at all. Barely talked about natural resources. Barely talked about service, particularly financial services. It didn\u2019t really address our economy or theirs the way they are today.And some of its manufacturing provisions are totally obsolete. In automotive, they put in a procedure which in concept is a good one, called rules of origin. Namely, what percentage of the content of a finished product can come from outside Nafta and yet get the favorable tariff treatment as though it were all 100% from within Nafta?The problem is, automotive technology has moved on. Half those parts aren\u2019t even used in cars anymore.MR. BERMAN: But how do you [change Nafta] without pissing everyone off?MR. ROSS: We solved the sugar thing without pissing everyone off. We\u2019re trying to solve some of the little disputes with Canada. Disputes are resolvable if people are of reasonable will and are willing to make reasonable compromises. We made some big changes with China. I don\u2019t see them suddenly screaming and yelling.MR. BERMAN: President Trump famously mentioned American \u201ccarnage\u201d in his inauguration speech. What did he mean by that and what is going on in America that you need to pursue this policy?MR. ROSS: We\u2019re pursuing the policy because we think it\u2019s the correct policy. Does anyone think that China would have been able to transform itself from a very, very poor, basically rural society to the second-biggest power in the world without a favorable trade balance? The question I would pose to those who say deficits don\u2019t matter is: \u201cIf trade surpluses do matter, is it really possible that trade deficits don\u2019t matter?\u201d And especially when there are ways to cure them.To the countries with whom we have the big deficits, like China, we are going to say: \u201cLook, there are a bunch of products that you buy, some from us and some from other people. We\u2019re your largest customer. You really ought to give us a little better market share. It isn\u2019t going to hurt you to buy cattle from us instead of from X country or soybeans from us or industrial goods from us.\u201d So substitution of, or changing market share, would be one easy way to redistribute a bit of the deficit.Because it isn\u2019t inherent in free trade, in my view, that one country, namely the U.S., has to absorb the entire cumulative trade surplus of the rest of the world, and therefore eat $500 billion a year of deficit.MR. BERMAN: What\u2019s your confidence level right now that the tax reform that has been discussed will get done?MR. ROSS: Oh, I think we\u2019ll get it. As you know, the precursor to it is health-care reform. And the reason we put that first isn\u2019t that we thought it would be easy. It\u2019s actually much harder than tax reform. But we need savings from it to help offset the immediate effect of some of the reductions in rate that we\u2019re putting into the tax bill.MR. BERMAN: So 70% chance, would you say?MR. ROSS: I think we\u2019re going to get tax reform, and I think we\u2019ll get it this year. And as I understand it, this kind of tax reform could also be made retroactive. Whether they will or won\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. But it could very well be\u2014if there\u2019s enough enthusiasm for it.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Wilbur Ross Talks Trade.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-talks-trade-1497838380", "news_title": "Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Talks Trade", "keywords": " cfo, cfo conference, cfo network, chief financial officers, commerce secretary, free trade, international trade, journal reports,nafta, secretary of commerce, trade, wall street journal conference,wilbur ross, wsj conference, wto,Donald Trump,Wilbur Ross,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,trade,external payments,economic news,fair trade,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "What are the main concerns of chief financial officers today? Where do they see risks and opportunities? For 21 years, Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business has been conducting quarterly global surveys of senior finance executives to find out just that.John Graham,        the finance professor at Fuqua who leads the research, sat down with Kimberly S. Johnson, the editor of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CFO Journal, to discuss the latest survey\u2019s findings. Edited excerpts follow.MS. JOHNSON: Why is it important to get the perspective of CFOs?DR. GRAHAM: There are two primary reasons that the university does this. First, it is important to understand the perspective of the business community from sort of an objective third-party perspective rather than from a lobbying group. Second, it turns out that the CFO forecasts are very accurate.It\u2019s an anonymous survey in which we ask CFOs questions about capital spending, hiring plans and wage increases. These are numbers that are in all of their business plans, and they all know them well. We aggregate them. And as long as the business plans come relatively true, it\u2019s a great prediction of the future. In fact, it has been historically more accurate than economists\u2019 forecasts of the future.MS. JOHNSON: Let\u2019s compare the current outlook around capital expenditures to where things were a year ago. CFOs expect only 2.2% growth in capex spending over the next 12 months. That\u2019s rather weak. What does that signal to you?DR. GRAHAM: Obviously capital spending kind of pulled us out of the recession, and then we went through a period where capex plans were starting to decline. Then, over the past year, we actually saw capex plans start to pick up, and I think that was on the basis of a new administration and the pro-business policies many thought would come into play.This past quarter, as you just mentioned, capex fell back down to 2%.So, yes, I agree it\u2019s weak. Right now there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about what exactly these pro-business policies are, when will they go into place, and what the details will be.I think we\u2019re back into a more of a hold pattern at a low level for capex.MS. JOHNSON: What were some of the other surprises you found in the survey this quarter?DR. GRAHAM: There were two really big surprises. One was about employment. We just talked about weak capex. GDP growth was relatively weak in the first quarter, too, yet the employment plan keeps getting stronger and stronger. Companies want to hire. This moderately strong employment growth is something that we\u2019re hearing companies hope to continue into the next year. That\u2019s notable given other signs of weakness.But secondly, each quarter we ask CFOs to rank what their top concerns are. The No. 1 concern this quarter is hiring and retaining qualified employees. We\u2019ve been doing the surveys 21 years, 85 quarters now. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s been the No. 1 concern.MS. JOHNSON: Why do you think that is?DR. GRAHAM: There are two issues. One, the labor market is getting tighter. The unemployment rate\u2019s getting lower. And two, the skills mismatch hasn\u2019t been solved and may be even getting a little bit worse. There are some people looking for jobs, but the types of jobs companies are looking to fill simply aren\u2019t matching.MS. JOHNSON: We\u2019re living in uncertain times. CFOs and companies overall are concerned about finding people with the right skills. Would it be correct to assume that CFOs are facing more uncertainty than usual right now?DR. GRAHAM: We put some questions in the survey specifically focused on uncertainty. From the headlines you get a sense that there is so much uncertainty right now, so the question is, how is that affecting how companies are running their businesses? This is a global survey, though we\u2019re focusing on the 357 responses from the U.S. today.About 36% of companies said that, yes, we are facing more uncertainty than usual and we\u2019re taking action because of it.But what surprised me a lot was 58% of companies said this is pretty much a normal amount of uncertainty for them right now.MS. JOHNSON: Things don\u2019t seem normal these days. Are journalists too headline sensitive or is it that CFOs have a higher tolerance for uncertainty?DR. GRAHAM: Ultimately the goal of a business and a CFO is to produce a quality product and deliver it to the customer. What the numbers here are telling us is that as long as companies can still deliver a high-quality product to customers reliably, then all of what I would call \u201cheadline volatility\u201d doesn\u2019t affect their day-to-day operations. Apparently, 58% of companies feel like they\u2019re able to do that.MS. JOHNSON: In terms of investment, you asked a question in the survey about hurdle rates, or the cutoff rate of return an investment must be expected to produce to be approved. About 90% of companies set their hurdle rate at about 4% above their weighted cost of capital. Is that in line with previous years?DR. GRAHAM: It is very much in line. You have your weighted average cost of capital, and then companies typically set this hurdle rate 4 or 5 percentage points, on average, above the weighted average cost of capital.What\u2019s really interesting is the hurdle rate since the early \u201880s hasn\u2019t really changed much, while the cost of capital has been coming down. The buffer, if you will, has sort of been getting larger.Trying to understand why that hurdle rate has stayed so stubbornly high is a question we may want to explore on another day, but what we focused on in this survey was whether projects that clear the somewhat high hurdle rate get done.It turns out that companies do pursue a lot of these projects with these great promised returns, but not all of them.MS. JOHNSON: About three-quarters of companies don\u2019t pursue all of them, right?DR. GRAHAM: Exactly. It\u2019s a strength that there are these projects up there promising these great returns, but 77% of companies say they don\u2019t pursue all of these projects. And as a professor, you kind of go, \u201cWell, why is that? What are the reasons?\u201dAnd the No. 1 factor\u2014and this is another interesting thing that came out of the survey\u2014why companies in the U.S. don\u2019t pursue all of these projects is a constraint on management time and expertise. That suggests that maybe there is a shortage of top management talent, which gets back into the tight labor market we talked about earlier.And then, also, companies are working full tilt. You can\u2019t do all of the projects, so you do the ones in your core strength.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'How CFOs Are Feeling.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-cfos-are-feeling-1497838320", "news_title": "How CFOs Are Feeling About the Economy", "keywords": " cfo, cfo conference, cfo network, chief financial officers, duke university, fuqua school of business,john graham, journal reports, wall street journal conference, wsj conference,John Graham,plans,strategy,labor,personnel,capital expenditure,corporate,industrial news,recruitment,cfo - management"}, {"content": "National security is front and center in people\u2019s minds right now\u2014from the continuing fight with ISIS to dealing with provocative moves by Russia. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s executive Washington editor, Gerald F. Seib, spoke with       John McCain,        the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Here are edited excerpts of their discussion.MR. SEIB: What world problem keeps you awake at night more than any other these days?SEN. MCCAIN: Probably in the short term, North Korea because of the progress they\u2019re making on nuclear weapons. And in the long term, Russia. Everybody talks about ISIS. We all know how terrible ISIS is. We know that ISIS is killing people as we speak. They\u2019re very dangerous, and they\u2019re going to continue to kill people for a long time, but they don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon and they don\u2019t have a means to deliver it.Vladimir Putin\u2019s       behavior is more and more aggressive and provocative, whether it be in the conventional weapons as far as continued aggression in Ukraine to the cyberattacks throughout the region. The guy is hellbent on returning the Russian Empire. And that\u2019s what he wants to do.MR. SEIB: China, friend or foe, has been a question that\u2019s puzzled people for the last three decades. Where are we on the China friend-or-foe continuum right now?SEN. MCCAIN: We have to understand the Chinese want to control the Western Pacific.       Lee Kuan Yew,        one of the wisest persons I\u2019ve ever met in my life, told me, \u201cThe Chinese want the West China Sea.\u201d They believe that the last 200 years were accidents of history, and it\u2019s their historic role to be the predominant power in the Asia-Pacific region.That does not mean that China is ready to risk a war. It doesn\u2019t mean that they are ready to have a conflict with the United States of America, but they do believe that that part of the world is a historic Chinese area of control.I also believe that they have the strongest leader that they\u2019ve had since       Deng Xiaoping.       I think we\u2019re going to have to, at some point, exercise what we\u2019ve been to war over a couple of times, and that\u2019s freedom of navigation. If we don\u2019t respect freedom of navigation of the high seas, then we are going to have problems in a lot of other places besides the Pacific.MR. SEIB: What\u2019s the view of the Trump administration in Asia? And what\u2019s the view of the Trump administration in Europe among allies right now? What did you find?SEN. MCCAIN: Uncertainty. They see him say one thing, and then they see him do another, and then they see him say another thing and then do another.MR. SEIB: If there\u2019s a global trade war it\u2019s probably going to start in Asia, where you just were. How acute is the fear of a trade war there?SEN. MCCAIN: If there\u2019s ever anything that describes beauty in the eye of the beholder, it is certainly trade. History shows that one of several factors in the strongest economy of the last 70 years was the new world order established in 1947. That new world order is under stress and pressure that it has not been in 70 years. And so when our secretary of commerce says, \u201cAll we want is a level playing field,\u201d I\u2019ve heard that song before.MR. SEIB: There was a suggestion made yesterday that the White House would just dismiss Bob Mueller, the newly appointed special counsel to look into the questions of the Trump administration\u2019s ties to Russia. What would your advice be if that suggestion came up?SEN. MCCAIN: I can\u2019t believe they would think of such a thing. Look, there are a lot of people in Washington, around this country, that have tarnished reputations, and there\u2019s some question about Mueller? Come on. I think it would be as explosive as anything I can think any single act that the president might take.MR. SEIB: So if you get to the core issue here, it basically was what were the Russians trying to do, A), and B), was there a collusion between the Russian agents and the Trump campaign? What are your answers to those two questions?SEN. MCCAIN: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. And I think that\u2019s the reason why we need these hearings, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always said we need a select committee. I\u2019ve been saying it for weeks, because I\u2019ve seen this movie before as the scandal unfolds, and another shoe drops. We\u2019re going to have to have a complete investigation. For me to draw a conclusion when we haven\u2019t got all the evidence I think would be prejudging. But I think there\u2019s enough out there that we should have a select committee of people who are highly regarded, who will work together in a bipartisan fashion. This thing spills over into all different aspects of American security.The Russians have literally tried to play in all aspects of American life. If you can destroy a free and fair election, you destroy democracy.MR. SEIB: There\u2019s one area we haven\u2019t talked about: how the Syrian mess gets resolved. What\u2019s your advice? What do you want to see happen in Syria?SEN. MCCAIN: I\u2019d like to see us do what President       Obama       told me and       Lindsey Graham       after       Bashar al-Assad       crossed the red line. He said, \u201cI\u2019m going to degrade Bashar al-Assad, I\u2019m going to upgrade the Free Syrian Army, and we\u2019re going to have a change in treatment.\u201d Lindsey and I go out, drive away, \u201cHey, we\u2019re with the president.\u201dAbout 10 days later I\u2019m sitting in my office and CNN says, \u201cOh, the president has decided that he\u2019s going to go to Congress for permission before he acts.\u201d Whoops. I wasn\u2019t the only one who was surprised. The Saudis had planes on the runway, ready to attack. They found out the same way that I did. We need to replace Bashar al-Assad. That\u2019s how they found out, by watching CNN.One of the reasons why President Trump was so well received in that part of the world, one was because he\u2019s not Barack Obama, and two, because he never mentioned human rights.If we abandon our advocacy for human rights, we\u2019re no different than any other nation that rises and falls throughout history. And we\u2019ve already seen the reaction of some of these countries to President Trump\u2019s lack of mention of human rights by seeing increasing crackdowns on human-rights activists. There\u2019s no mention of it whatsoever. Human rights is not the fundamental principle; American self-interest is our fundamental principle.When we abandon that position on human rights, then you start seeing the crackdowns, and the people thrown in jail, and the increase in tension. And it doesn\u2019t work. You can\u2019t change human beings. They want freedom. They want human rights, and they look to us as the role model and our inspiration.Write to  reports@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The article above has been corrected to reflect that President Barack Obama told Sen.

Russia. North Korea. The national-security picture is crowded and complex, and made even more so by questions about the Trump administration\u2019s ties to Russia. To shed light on these issues,       Adam Schiff,        ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, spoke with Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Gerald F. Seib. Here are edited excerpts of their conversation.MR. SEIB: We\u2019re thinking about risk in a dangerous world. You think about it all the time because of your position on the Intelligence Committee. What are the one or two problems that you worry about among all the others?REP. SCHIFF: I think in terms of the most profound crisis that we\u2019re going to see within this president\u2019s term is likely to be if North Korea gets to the point where they can marry a nuclear warhead and an intercontinental ballistic missile. They\u2019re obviously progressing with the miniaturization of the nuclear devices and with their ballistic-missile technology. I do think the administration is right that China is the key. China doesn\u2019t have complete control over North Korea, but they have more control than any other nation. And there\u2019s a lot more they can do.I also worry from the terrorism point of view about any kind of attack that would bring about a fundamental change in America.We have seen a number of attacks, some quite devastating. We just celebrated the terrible anniversary of the shooting in Orlando. But I still worry about the aviation threat. That is a predominant concern of mine. Not only because ISIS has gotten so heavily involved in this space but because al Qaeda remains pernicious and potent.The broader challenges I think that we face are certainly Russia, but also the degree to which we are ceding leadership in Asia to China. The final point that I would make is that through all of my life I\u2019ve lived in a world where freedom and democracy were on the rise. But we\u2019ve reached an inflection point. It is a phenomenal challenge for the United States. It\u2019s a time where we are needed more than ever in terms of being a defender of liberal democracy, and freedom of speech and association, and religion. This is not a time for us to lay down that mantle.MR. SEIB: Let me draw you out a little bit more on the terrorist question. There is a sense when you watch what\u2019s happening in Europe that as ISIS shrinks on the ground, that it\u2019s sending the threat outward in the form of terrorism. Is that how you see it?REP. SCHIFF: It is how I see it, but I don\u2019t think people should lose hope about this. The reality is we have to eliminate this so-called caliphate. That is a necessary prerequisite to defeating this scourge. In the near term or midterm it might result in these foreign fighters coming back home, predominantly to Europe, and increasing the threat there and indirectly increasing the threat here. Nonetheless, we have to cut off the resources they can derive from the caliphate from taxing people, et cetera.Why have we been less subject to this violence? On the front end, we have far fewer people who have left the United States to join the fight. We also have a Muslim community far better integrated in the United States. We obviously don\u2019t want to do anything to alienate or jeopardize that. We need good lines of communication between the Muslim community and law enforcement, and public-safety officials.It\u2019s unlikely we\u2019re ever going to get to zero. We do need a very comprehensive approach to dealing with this. There\u2019s certainly a strong military component in shrinking their ability to plot and plan. Intelligence and information sharing and our relationships with our partners elsewhere are vitally important. But it\u2019s also in terms of online radicalism and lone attackers. It\u2019s never going to be possible to prevent every single attack, unfortunately.MR. SEIB: From what you\u2019ve seen of the cyberthreat and the cyberdefenses of the United States from where you sit on the Intelligence Committee, how well positioned are we as a country and how well positioned are we as a government to help people in the private sector deal with the cyberthreat?REP. SCHIFF: We are way behind in dealing with this problem. We need to, and we are trying to, improve our cyberdefenses, but one thing we have to recognize is our cyberdefenses are never going to be good enough.When you take capable adversaries\u2014like the Russians, for example\u2014if the Russians want to hack into the DNC next year or three years from now, they will hack into the DNC, and they\u2019ll get into the RNC, and they\u2019ll get in my computer if they want to. They have the capacity to do it. And no matter how well you train your workforce\u2014and obviously we\u2019re all going to have to use best practices here\u2014a determined adversary is going to get in.So there\u2019s no cure with a software patch. The only real cure is twofold. We\u2019ve got to educate our country and our public about what to expect, which is part of why I think the Russia investigation that we\u2019re doing in the House and Senate, quite apart from what       Bob Mueller       is doing, is so important. What made the Russian attack so successful last year was that there was no consensus that we ought to reject that foreign interference.And somehow we have to prepare the country for what they may see next. The Russians may go beyond what they did last year in dumping not only authentic stolen documents but forgeries along with it. The best defense is ultimately inoculation. We have to derive a consensus that whoever [a document release] helps and whoever it hurts, we will reject it.Beyond that, we need a deterrent. I took issue with our lack of an adequate response when the North Koreans hacked Sony. I think the Russians were watching. The rest of the world was watching what we would do and what we wouldn\u2019t.MR. SEIB: From what you know right now, the core question in the Russia investigation obviously is collusion. Was there collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians of some variety? Right now, do you think there was collusion?REP. SCHIFF: I think it\u2019s too early to draw any definitive conclusions. When I look at what [former FBI director       James Comey      ] testified to, as a former prosecutor, I say, \u201cThat is all evidence of interference or obstruction.\u201dWhether it is sufficient evidence is another story. And of course it would need to be corroborated. But if I were prosecuting a case of obstruction and I sought to admit director Comey\u2019s testimony, there\u2019s not a judge in the land who would exclude it. It\u2019s clearly relevant evidence. I think there\u2019s relevant evidence on the issue of collusion that warrants our continued investigation.I think the FBI began that investigation for a reason. I think they\u2019re continuing it for a reason. We now have the added very important issue of whether there was any effort to obstruct that investigation. But I do think it\u2019s too early to be drawing conclusions. I already see efforts to try to curtail the investigation.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Adam Schiff Looks at the World.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-adam-schiff-worries-about-1497838200", "news_title": "What Adam Schiff Worries About", "keywords": "adam schiff, cfo, cfo conference, cfo network, chief financial officers, journal reports, national security, north korea, rep. schiff, russia, terrorism, wall street journal conference, wsj conference,Adam Schiff,corporate,industrial news"}, {"content": "Among all the other political drama going on in Washington, the House is looking to address both taxes and the budget.For an inside look at the issues, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Washington bureau chief, Paul Beckett, spoke with       Kevin Brady,        chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Here are edited excerpts of their conversation.MR. BECKETT: We\u2019ve read a lot, we\u2019ve written a lot, about the unpopularity of the border-adjustment tax, which would tax imports and exempt exports from taxation. It\u2019s clearly a difficult issue. Why do you persist in pushing it?REP. BRADY: We know what our competitors do to beat us. They beat us on lower tax rates. They put U.S. companies at a disadvantage here and abroad. How do you stop U.S. jobs from leaving the country? More important, how do you bring back manufacturing, research and headquarters jobs?My current thinking on border adjustment after listening to businesses large and small is a very gradual, five-year transition. We would match that with our exports as well. So we\u2019ll be lifting the made-in-America tax on U.S. exports at the same rate.Businesses need plenty of time to assess their current supply chains and decide what, if any, can return to the United States. And they want plenty of time to see how the dollar adjusts and at what level. While I\u2019m confident it adjusts very quickly, a fair question is: What if it doesn\u2019t?So a very gradual five-year phase-in really resolves the major challenges. More important, for the first time since I\u2019ve been in Congress in 21 years, we have whole industries telling us that under this tax-reform approach, they can now bring significant parts of their supply chain back to the United States.MR. BECKETT: You\u2019ve been having a lot of meetings with the administration and with the Senate. What actual progress, detailed progress, can you show from those meetings?REP. BRADY: We are all focused on moving toward a single unified tax-reform plan. I think that dramatically increases the likelihood of passage this year. We are focused this year on tax reform, which after 31 years would be an achievement in itself.I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s doable. I see a commitment from the Trump White House on this. I do from the Senate as well. We have an incredible amount of work left to do. It is the challenge of a generation for any president and any Congress.But we start with 80% common ground with the Trump tax-reform plan. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do going forward. But I\u2019m confident we can do it.MR. BECKETT: Can you tell me the actual calendar, assuming you want to get it done this year? You also want to get health care done this year. You have the debt ceiling. You have the budget.There\u2019s a very crowded calendar for between now and the end of the year.REP. BRADY: You laid it out in exact sequence. Tax reform. I think it would be incredibly helpful for health-care reform to be approved this summer. The budget really matters this year because balancing the budget over 10 years with the right instructions that allow us to move through the expected filibuster in the Senate is critical to delivering this to the president\u2019s desk this year.MR. BECKETT: It has been a year since the blueprint for tax changes. Does it surprise you that you don\u2019t have a bill by now?REP. BRADY: No. If we had opted to simply tinker around the edges and make a few tweaks, we\u2019d have had this thing done. We can\u2019t afford to do this. This is not the 1980s. Cutting tax rates alone won\u2019t make us competitive, because our competitors, whether it\u2019s China, Europe, Canada or Mexico, have developed very sophisticated, very pro-growth tax schemes that have left us behind. And so we have to go bold if we hope to be competitive for the long term. That naturally creates resistance. But the responses we\u2019re getting from businesses large and small, and responses we\u2019re getting from families, they\u2019re hungry for tax reform. We have to harness that hunger, bust through the status quo to deliver it this year.MR. BECKETT: Many businesses rely on the ability to deduct interest on debt as a core benefit. Why do you want to take that away?REP. BRADY: The overall goal is to be pro-growth. What we\u2019re proposing is to take the tax preference from the source of funds, borrowing, and take that preference to the use of funds, business investment and buildings, equipment, software, technology.This full and unlimited expensing by itself is responsible for half the growth in the tax-reform blueprint. It\u2019s incredibly Main Street job-growth oriented.More important, those investments drive worker productivity, which drives wages, which drives the U.S. economy in a major way.And so the benefits of full and unlimited expensing is that you have in a country where our investment is about a third it was the day that I was born, and it\u2019s the missed ingredient in the current recovery. Unleashing tax-free investment focused on productivity and growth I think is critical to do that.Going forward, I foresee an exemption for small businesses, so they can continue to take advantage of both deductions. They often don\u2019t have access to equity markets.MR. BECKETT: The administration has talked about renegotiating Nafta within four months. Is that realistic?REP. BRADY: It could be. Really, I think the substance should drive the timing here. The good news is that we have in Secretary [of Commerce Wilbur] Ross and [U.S. Trade Representative Robert] Lighthizer leaders who understand that we shouldn\u2019t disrupt the current agreement that has worked well for the U.S. in North America, that whatever is negotiated should build upon that.Basically address the issues that aren\u2019t working for the United States, keep the ones that are, and modernize it in a very positive way, in a way that is a seamless transition going forward.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-house-gears-up-to-tackle-taxes-1497838141", "news_title": "The House Gears Up to Tackle Taxes", "keywords": " cfo, cfo conference, cfo network, chief financial officers, journal reports,kevin brady, rep. brady, taxes, tax reform, wall street journal conference, wsj conference,Kevin Brady,corporate,industrial news"}, {"content": "In the early days of the new administration, President       Donald Trump       and Republican lawmakers have made sweeping changes in financial regulation and health care. Wall Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Gerald F. Seib spoke about the Democratic perspective on those changes with the senior senator from Massachusetts,       Elizabeth Warren,        creator of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation.MR. SEIB: We are at an interesting time in Washington. On financial regulation in particular, it does seem we\u2019re at an inflection point. The Trump administration has come into office on the idea that\u2014and the congressional Republicans believe\u2014the pendulum perhaps has swung too far, that the regulatory pendulum needed to be pulled back. That\u2019s what the Treasury Department and that\u2019s what House Republicans have shown us in the last week. Are they right or wrong?SEN. WARREN: You said Donald Trump came into office on that. That\u2019s certainly not what Donald Trump ran on. Donald Trump ran on breaking up the biggest financial institutions.You do polls across this country, and I\u2019m talking about polls of everybody\u2014Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Libertarians, vegetarians, everybody. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% and upward believe that the largest financial institutions in this country need more regulation, not less regulation.I\u2019ll give you one more on it. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the little agency that\u2019s been in place for about five years that has been the bull's-eye for all of the Republican attacks in the House and many in the Senate.That little agency, among Trump voters, about 55% think the agency should either be left as is or be given greater powers than it currently has.So when we\u2019re talking about pendulums, let\u2019s be real clear that we are not talking about the views of the American people or the voters in the 2016 election.MR. SEIB: Nonetheless, yesterday the Treasury Department put out a report on financial regulation, recommended perhaps 100 different moves, mostly to deregulate. The House passed the Choice Act about a week ago. The Treasury talks about fewer stress tests for banks, more cost-benefit analysis of new regulations, a higher threshold for big-bank rules to kick in, exemptions for small banks from the Volcker rule. That is the Trump administration\u2019s policy as of yesterday.SEN. WARREN: So let me get this straight. The sum of the biggest financial institutions in this country is now bigger than they were when they were too big to fail. The Republican plan, now evidently joined in part with the administration, is to say, \u201cI know, let\u2019s do less regulation, submit them to fewer stress tests, have fewer of them subject to the Volcker rule. Because what could possibly go wrong?\u201dYes, there may be some financial institutions that would have better short-term profits on this. But everyone in this room needs to remember that the most conservative estimate of the costs of that crash in 2008 was not just the $700 billion bailout. It was the $14 trillion that it cost the entire economy in homes lost, in jobs lost, in savings lost. This ought to be one of the things that should unite all of us.MR. SEIB: Republicans make the case that community banks in particular have been devastated by Dodd-Frank, that it hurts average Americans more.SEN. WARREN: But your numbers precede Dodd-Frank. If anyone looks at the numbers in bank consolidation in America, the consolidation starts back in the 1970s. And let\u2019s keep in mind the community banks, along with big banks, are more profitable than ever. Lending in most of these institutions is not down. It is up. There are places where we should do targeted changes in the laws and regulations to make sure community banks don\u2019t have to endure regulations for problems like disrupting the entire U.S. economy. But for a long time now, folks on my side including me have offered to say, \u201cLet\u2019s sit down and write some legislation that is aimed specifically at the community banks and the credit unions, making sure that they get some regulatory relief. But when banks start describing themselves in terms of tens of billions of dollars, it\u2019s an entirely different conversation.\u201dMR. SEIB: Financial regulation isn\u2019t the only big issue on the table. Tax reform is on the table. From the Democrats\u2019 point of view in the Senate, what is possible? What\u2019s not possible? What\u2019s the path forward on tax reform, if you see one at all?SEN. WARREN: It looks like to me that we\u2019re moving forward on a tax bill over the next two or three weeks. It\u2019s called health-care reform. It says, \u201cLet\u2019s cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires. And the way we\u2019re going to pay for it is, we\u2019re going to knock millions of people off health-care coverage, raise costs for people over 50, open the door for insurance companies to be able to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions or to have caps on insurance coverage. So at the moment you need help most, that help will disappear.\u201dThere it is. That is the biggest form of tax relief for millionaires and billionaires that\u2019s right on the table.People have not been shy, companies have not been shy about stepping up where they want to see changes in the law. Companies have said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really important to change the corporate tax rate.\u201d Companies have stepped up to roll back regulations. Where are you all on health care? Let\u2019s face it. You can do this with dollars and cents. What\u2019s the cost that\u2019s climbing the fastest for probably every corporation represented in this room? It\u2019s health care.And the Republicans are sitting over there trying to figure out how to roll back health-care coverage and as part of that, roll back many of the reforms that were starting to drive down costs.By the way, for any of you who have customers, it should matter a lot. If your customers are going to lose health-care coverage, if your customers are going to have minimalist coverage, we\u2019re talking about tens of millions of people who would be affected, one-sixth of the entire U.S. economy.MR. SEIB: Let\u2019s go back to the to the core issue here. Even if the cost curve has flattened out, the premium curve has gone up, way up. So there is a problem here.What do you do about that problem?SEN. WARREN: We\u2019ve actually got some bills on the table right now to start to deal with this. The big one is in the prescription-drug area. And there are a lot of things we could do. Al Franken and I have a bill that\u2019s kind of a menu. It says there are a lot of different ways that we can attack prescription-drug costs.And we\u2019re willing to debate any of them. We\u2019re willing to put them together. It doesn\u2019t have to be a one size fits all. Bernie Sanders and other Democrats and I have got a bill that says let\u2019s import from Canada, where it is often the case that Canadians are buying the same drug from the same manufacturer under all the same constraints, for one-tenth the price that Americans are paying.If we just bend some of that down, it has two immediate effects. One is it reduces the amount out of pocket that a lot of people would have to pay. And the second is, it would reduce the pressure on the insurance companies who are having to cover these huge costs.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'A Call for Increased Regulation, Not Less.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-americans-dont-want-less-regulation-1497838080", "news_title": "Elizabeth Warren: Americans Don\u2019t Want Less Regulation", "keywords": "bank regulation, cfo, cfo conference, cfo network, chief financial officers, dodd-frank,elizabeth warren, financial regulation, journal reports, sen. warren, too big to fail, wall street journal conference, wsj conference,Donald Trump,Elizabeth Warren,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Imagine you are the chief financial officer of a publicly traded company, and the president of the United States has just tweeted something critical about your company.A number of CFOs have found themselves in this very position since       Donald Trump       was elected president. Some companies have seen their shares fall, at least temporarily, in response to critical tweets by President Trump.Dennis K. Berman, financial editor of The Wall Street Journal, discussed the issue with two experts in corporate-crisis management,       Joele Frank,        founder and managing partner of Joele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher, and       George Sard,        chairman and CEO of Sard Verbinnen & Co. Edited excerpts follow.MR. BERMAN: When the president tweets, maybe the thing to do is nothing. Just shut up.MS. FRANK: No.MR. SARD: Sometimes.MS. FRANK: If he\u2019s negative, a company has to defend itself. Companies are learning and have learned. Most of the negative tweets were between the election and inauguration. The companies were slow to respond.MR. BERMAN: George, make the case for shutting up.MR. SARD: You have to quickly assess where it\u2019s getting traction. Because there are times when you make it a bigger story by engaging.He has always had a tendency to sometimes use a carrot and sometimes a stick. You ought to quickly try to assess which it is, and then, particularly if he\u2019s tried to use you to make a larger point, you don\u2019t necessarily have to engage.MR. BERMAN: The press calls, you say, \u201cNo comment.\u201dMS. FRANK: No.MR. SARD: If it\u2019s a job issue, you have your facts straight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 98% of our jobs here in the U.S.\u201d \u201cWe invest X billion dollars.\u201dMS. FRANK: The way we think about it, if it\u2019s early days, you\u2019re able to get into the same news cycle and calm things down.MR. SARD: Right, you don\u2019t want to make it a multiday story.MR. BERMAN: What\u2019s your best practical advice?MR. SARD: The best advice is, before you get to that point, assess yourself.Because if you look at the issues he has tweeted about, it\u2019s almost invariably jobs and pricing. Especially if you sell something to the government, whether it\u2019s drugs or airplanes. You have to really make sure that you\u2019ve gotten your story straight around your pricing and your U.S. jobs.What you don\u2019t want to be called is unaware. If you\u2019ve done that thinking in advance, it\u2019s pretty easy to formulate your answer.But you also want to, importantly, take it off Twitter. You do not want to get into a Twitter war.MR. BERMAN: So never tweet back at the president.MS. FRANK: Use other platforms. Lots of times employers are using letters to their employees. A lot of the work is done through that base to answer the tweets.MR. SARD: What Trump has done so successfully is communicate directly, bypassing the conventional media, with his constituency. Companies need to be able to do the same thing, to go to their constituencies.But typically your response would be on your website. It would be on an email you\u2019d send out to your own folks, your customers.MR. BERMAN: If your client says, \u201cLook, times just aren\u2019t so great, we\u2019ve got to cut 6% of our workforce,\u201d would you say to them, \u201cDon\u2019t say a word\u201d?MS. FRANK: No, it\u2019s about where are you cutting. Are these cuts in the U.S. totally?MR. BERMAN: Yes.MR. SARD: On a case like that you\u2019ve got to be on your front foot and explain why it\u2019s essential to the business.MS. FRANK: What we\u2019ve seen people do is say, \u201cWithout this we won\u2019t be able to do that.\u201dMR. BERMAN: Should every CEO know what percentage of their workforce is in the U.S.?MS.

Greg Walden       of Oregon, who helped shepherd the party\u2019s health-care overhaul bill through the House last month, sat down with Louise Radnofsky, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s White House reporter, to offer his take on where the effort stands. Edited excerpts follow.MS. RADNOFSKY: Should CFOs assume that the ACA will be law of the land this time next year or will it be the American Health Care Act?REP. WALDEN: We are working diligently to rescue the individual insurance market from collapse. It was predicted to happen. It\u2019s happening. And it needs reform.I was also a small-business owner for over 20 years. When it came to purchasing insurance as a small-business owner, which we did for all of our employees, all you could do was throw a dart at the board every year to figure out what the rate increase would be. We had no market power. We had no purchasing power.The House has passed the American Health Care Act to try to do reforms, to get cost control on the Medicaid system, give states more flexibility to design plans that will work for them and move people into an insurance product they can afford.We know there\u2019s more work to be done. We believe we gave the Senate some nice headroom and some dollars set aside in there to make other changes. So they\u2019ve got some flexibility. We\u2019ll see where this leads. But I think we\u2019ll get a bill to the president\u2019s desk before August.MS. RADNOFSKY: Before August you think the Senate will do what it needs to do?REP. WALDEN: Yep.MS. RADNOFSKY: Do you think health insurance should be priced like car insurance, based on a person\u2019s risk? Or should it be priced like a social benefit, where we\u2019re all in this together?REP. WALDEN: I think health insurance is deeply personal because health care is deeply personal. In the auto-insurance market you for the most part can control your behavior. You can follow the rules of the road. You can not be distracted on your devices or additives in your system. You can make those changes. With health care you just wake up one morning and your doctor says, \u201cI got bad news. You\u2019ve got breast cancer.\u201d So it is a different market in that respect. The question is, how do you get an insurance product that people can afford?States have experimented with high-risk pools. Maine has an interesting idea that we tried to look at, where they have an invisible high-risk pool that comes in behind and just takes that high cost and socializes it, so your rates never really reflect the fact that you have some bad health issue. I think you can incentivize people to take better care of themselves, too.MS. RADNOFSKY: Have Americans reached a point where they think health insurance should be more like a social benefit?REP. WALDEN: Well, I\u2019ve done 17 town halls in my district. And for the people that turned out at those\u2014and they were very energized, shall we say\u2014when I asked how many favor a single-payer, government-run health system, the audience went wild.You see this alternative playing out in California right now with their estimated $400 billion government-run, no-private-sector insurance concept that would result in a 15% payroll tax among other things. And that\u2019s just an estimate, which is probably rosy.We have a moment here to try to fix this market. If we don\u2019t, the odds are we\u2019re going to move to a more government-run system. Now, some may embrace that. But we have those systems today, and I would bet every single member of Congress has one or two staff persons like I do that spends all day every day trying to help our veterans get access to the care they\u2019re being denied. So I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the system we want.MS. RADNOFSKY: Will the Cadillac tax ever go into effect?REP. WALDEN: We want to get rid of it. We want to get rid of the tax on medical devices. But if we fail [to pass health-care reform], then, yes, you should presume that all those taxes stay in place.MS. RADNOFSKY: And if you succeed?REP. WALDEN: Then they go away. And by the way, by making the reductions we\u2019re doing, we reset the baseline, which if you want tax reform, passage of this is worth a trillion dollars in tax reform.MS. RADNOFSKY: What about employer-sponsored insurance? Will the tax protection of that continue?REP.

The one that we had from 2010 to 2015 was stable and successful and delivered.

But more importantly, the German position remains, and the EU position remains, that of the 27 remaining EU member states, we want the closest possible relationship with the U.K.MS. TRENTMANN: How are French businesses reacting to the British election?MR. ARAUD: I don\u2019t know about the French business community. But as a diplomat, I would say that our strong interest, the EU interest, would have been to have a strong and stable U.K. government, because the negotiation will be extremely difficult, technically and politically.MS. TRENTMANN: Mr. Darroch, what do you hear from Britain\u2019s business community?MR. DARROCH: There is a lively debate in the U.K. about what our objectives should be in these negotiations. What the prime minister has set out already is that we want a deep and special relationship with the EU. We want this to include cooperation on security issues. But, to have at the heart of it an ambitious free-trade agreement and the most frictionless possible exchange of goods and services across borders, those are the broad objectives she has set out.Of course we have the interests of both the British business community and all the international companies who have invested in the U.K. right at the center of our attention as we go into these negotiations. So we\u2019re looking for an outcome that is good for business, but also reflects all the other objectives that we believe were set when the British people voted as they did last June for leaving the EU.MR. ARAUD: What is now nearly sure is that the U.K. will leave the single market. Because politically, the single market means the free circulation of people, which is at the core of the British political debate. So that\u2019s the single market\u2014apparently it\u2019s over.MR. DARROCH: Of course there is some caution. Businesses hate uncertainty. But a lot of people do seem prepared to bear with us and see how things turn out. The basics of the British economy remain pretty strong: fastest-growing economy in the G-7 for the last two years, scheduled to grow second-fastest to the U.S. economy this year. Very low unemployment.But our objectives are to protect and defend the interests of everyone who is doing business in the U.K., and to get the best possible outcome for the business community.MS. TRENTMANN: Mr. Ruge, I read in British papers that because of the exports that the German economy has to the U.K., Berlin will succumb to German industry and there will be some sort of deal which would accommodate some of the British interests. What is the German government\u2019s response to that?MR. RUGE: Well, the first response is that we\u2019re not negotiating with the U.K., the EU 27 are negotiating with the U.K. It\u2019s no doubt true that German business and business in France will make its voice heard. And they will have a hearing in Brussels and with national governments. But the outcome of this will depend on a number of considerations. Part of them are commercial and business, part of them are strategic. And the strategic consideration [that is] as important as any other, or perhaps more important, is maintaining the EU 27 as a cohesive force.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'What\u2019s Ahead for the U.K. and Brexit.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 22:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-happens-now-with-the-u-k-and-brexit-1497837900", "news_title": "What Happens Now With the U.K. and Brexit?", "keywords": " boris ruge, brexit, british ambassador, cfo conference, cfo network, cfos, chief financial officers, eu, european union, french ambassador,gerard araud, german ambassador, journal reports, kim darroch,sir kim darroch, wall street journal conference, wsj conference,Boris Ruge,Gerard Araud,Sir Kim Darroch,corporate,industrial news,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Which industries will be the next ones to be disrupted by the likes of Uber and Airbnb, with platforms that act as intermediaries between customers and the services they want?Arun Sundararajan,        a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, offered his outlook in a conversation with The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jacob Schlesinger. Edited excerpts follow.MR. SCHLESINGER: How is health care going to be Uberized?MR. SUNDARARAJAN: A whole host of noncritical services\u2014not things like open heart surgery but things like I cut my finger cooking and I need someone to stitch it up for me\u2014can be platform-mediated. You find a registered nurse in your neighborhood. You don\u2019t actually go to an emergency room for a noncritical thing. You instead find a platform-mediated solution.Part of what\u2019s holding us back at this point is that we haven\u2019t built up sufficient trust through platforms for things that are as high-stakes as health care.MR. SCHLESINGER: Elder care is another thing I think you\u2019ve talked about. How does that change in this environment?MR. SUNDARARAJAN: The care industry is going to be a tremendous growth industry. And a lot of the growth is going to come through platform-mediated solutions, where you connect using the reputation that someone has built through a little platform with the kind of child care, the kind of home care, the kind of elder care that you need.MR. SCHLESINGER: How is energy going to be involved in this new world?MR. SUNDARARAJAN: This is not in the immediate future, but in the next five to 10 years: We\u2019re not yet at the point where battery technology is reliable enough to store the solar power that someone generates off their roof, but we will reach that point fairly soon. Once we reach that point, I envisage platforms that make millions of people energy producers\u2014they use some of the power that they produce, and they redistribute it locally. And the local redistribution is key. You\u2019re not just feeding it back into the grid. You are avoiding the inefficiencies associated with long-distance transmission and distribution. And you\u2019re avoiding the inefficiencies associated with centralized power production.MR. SCHLESINGER: And you mentioned professional services. Explain how that changes in this world.MR. SUNDARARAJAN: I\u2019ve seen platforms, like Catalant for management consultants, UpCounsel for legal services, Gigster for high-end machine-learning programming. There are platforms for accounting, for sales\u2014where rather than going to a large branded service provider for certain things, you go to a platform instead.Like, if you struck out on your own as a lawyer now you\u2019d be precluded from a lot of large corporate work because they go to the big firms. What these platforms are doing is trying to strike that middle ground where the individual is running their own tiny business through the platform, but the platform is aggregating demand, giving them scale, giving them a little bit of brand.MR. SCHLESINGER: Beyond specific sectors, what are general traits of industries that you think are ripe for this kind of disruption and industries that are safe from this kind of disruption?MR. SUNDARARAJAN: The simple characteristic is that if there\u2019s an intermediary that is sort of taking a significant fraction of the value that the individual producer is creating, that\u2019s certainly one characteristic. A second characteristic and the one that I\u2019m following more closely is, is there a fundamental sort of inherent economic advantage to a decentralized production model?So, are you tapping into capital that is otherwise being underutilized? Can the person who is producing also use what they\u2019re producing in part and benefit from the fact that they are now the producer? That\u2019s the case with energy.Also the extent to which going to a branded corporate solution is really important as part of the value proposition of the service. For a service where a big part of what you\u2019re buying is the brand associated with the provider\u2014those are less vulnerable to disruption. But on the other hand, if the brand has just been sort of layered on top, and what people really care about is the product or service that\u2019s being delivered, the vulnerability is greater.That\u2019s an interesting thing to think about in the context of the auto industry. A lot of people\u2019s identity used to be tied up in, \u201cThis is the car I drive. This is who I am.\u201d All of you have probably taken an Uber. None of you have probably sent your Uber away because the car was the wrong brand. And this speaks to the disconnect between what you\u2019re ordering and the brand of the machine that actually comes to deliver it.I think down the road, the brand that\u2019s going to matter is the brand of the interface. And the brand interface that is going to win is the one that establishes to you that, \u201cYou can trust my digital stripes. You can trust the brain of the car that I send you because I\u2019m good at software.\u201dMR. SCHLESINGER: How does the structure of a Fortune 500 company change?MR. SUNDARARAJAN: The organization in some sense becomes a lot leaner, but the scope of resources that it\u2019s drawing from expands dramatically. And so I expect smaller corporations in terms of head count internally but much larger corporations in terms of the scope of their economic activity.MR. SCHLESINGER: Will companies still need chief financial officers?MR. SUNDARARAJAN: Oh, absolutely. Top management is going to become more important than ever, actually, because of the complexity of the mesh of resources that you\u2019re going to have to manage and the pace at which business is changing.An openness to thinking about \u201cHow will the way I make money be different 10 years from now?\u201d\u2014whatever industry you\u2019re in, that\u2019s a capability that is certainly going to have to be acquired by any top executive.Write to  reports@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Taxis.

And by watching how many people actually use the information, judgments can start to be made about eliminating some of the information, and so on.

Seawater flooded in through a large gash.As the crew scrambled to save themselves and the ship, seven sailors didn\u2019t make it out of the berthing area. Their bodies were recovered by divers after the ship crawled to the port of Yokosuka.The U.S. Navy on Sunday identified the seven victims as Gunner\u2019s Mate Seaman Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19 years old, from Palmyra, Va.; Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25, from San Diego; Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc T Truong Huynh, 25, from Oakville, Conn.; Gunner\u2019s Mate 2nd Class Noe Hernandez, 26, from Weslaco, Texas; Fire Controlman 2nd Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23, from Chula Vista, Calif., Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin, 24, from Halethorpe, Md.; and Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary Leo Rehm Jr., 37, from Elyria, Ohio.\u201cThe water inflow was tremendous,\u201d Vice Adm.       Joseph Aucoin,        head of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, said in a news briefing on Sunday. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of time\u201d for sailors to react.Badly injured, the captain,       Bryce Benson,        escaped from his cabin. He was airlifted to a nearby hospital where he was receiving emergency treatment on Sunday before being questioned.\u201cHe\u2019s lucky to be alive,\u201d Vice Adm. Aucoin said.The question of why a U.S. destroyer was rammed by a cargo ship more than three times its size, one of the worst incidents in recent U.S. Navy history, has no immediate answers.Some former military and commercial shipping captains speculate that the Fitzgerald may have failed to follow international regulations that require ships to give way to other vessels to their starboard, or right side.\u201cUnless the destroyer lost steering control, which is unlikely, it should have given right of way to the container ship,\u201d said       Yiannis Sgouras,        a retired captain of tankers and cargo ships who worked in the world\u2019s busiest trade route from Asia to Europe.Others caution that there are potentially many other contributing factors to the collision. Tracking data sent by the cargo ship, the ACX Crystal, showed it reversed course around 2:05 a.m. local time, shortly before the time of the collision given by the U.S. Navy of approximately 2:20 a.m.However,             Nippon Yusen K.K.      , the Japanese shipping company that operates the 728-foot-long ACX Crystal, has stated that the collision occurred around 1:30 a.m. That discrepancy hasn\u2019t been resolved. \u201cShe did not reverse the course before the collision. She did after the collision,\u201d a Nippon Yusen company spokesman said.Both Japan and the U.S. are launching investigations, and each side declined to speculate about possible blame. The 20 Filipino crew members of the ACX Crystal, all of whom were unharmed, have been questioned, a spokesman for the Japan Coast Guard said.Adm.       John Richardson,        the U.S. Navy\u2019s chief of naval operations, left for Japan late Sunday in a hastily scheduled trip, defense officials said. He will meet with sailors and families from the Fitzgerald as well as Japanese officials to thank them for their assistance during the incident, officials said. He will also survey the ship and discuss with port officials the work required to get the destroyer repaired, they said.The Pentagon is still attempting to ascertain just what caused the collision, but as of Sunday evening there was no clear explanation for top officials. One official said there was yet no clarity on exactly what occurred.\u201cI don\u2019t even have a guess at this point,\u201d the official said.Around 400 vessels a day pass through the region where the collision took place, around 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, according to the Japanese Coast Guard. Official records show three accidents have been reported in the same area in the past five years.Collisions at sea for the U.S. Navy are extremely uncommon, said       Bryan McGrath,        a former destroyer captain, who said they occur only once or twice a decade, if that. He said he couldn\u2019t remember a recent collision that was this consequential. \u201cThere are 275 ships in the Navy and 100 are under way all over the world,\u201d navigating \u201cmillions and millions of miles\u201d every year, said Mr. McGrath, who retired in 2008 and is now a consultant. \u201cThis is very, very rare.\u201dYoji Koda,        a retired vice admiral and former commander in chief of Japan\u2019s navy, said that when U.S. Navy vessels are in the vicinity of Japan their alert level is the same as civilian vessels. He said one possibility was that either or both of the ships in the latest collision were using an autopilot system for guidance.\u201cAlthough they have watchmen, their responses tend to be delayed,\u201d he said.Vice Adm. Aucoin said all questions about the cause of the incident would require the results of the investigation, adding that the U.S. would work \u201chand-in-hand\u201d with Japan.Navy officials said they were working to inform family members of those killed, and had taken over 500 calls to a hotline for relatives to obtain information about the incident. One senior Navy official said all the crew of the ship were grieving.Vice Adm. Aucoin said that despite the extensive damage to the Fitzgerald, a ship equipped with an advanced Aegis ballistic missile defense system, it would be restored to the U.S. 7th Fleet. That process could take up to a year, he said.The repair process could cost around the same as the $250 million spent over 14 months on restoring the USS Cole, a similar ship to the Fitzgerald, which was heavily damaged by a terrorist bombing in Yemen in 2000.\u2014Costas Paris and Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com and Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'U.S., Japan Probe Deadly Ship Collision.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 21:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/seven-u-s-sailors-confirmed-dead-after-collision-with-cargo-ship-1497750366", "news_title": "Deadly Collision Crushed Captain\u2019s Cabin of USS Fitzgerald", "keywords": "american sailors, collision, navy destroyer, navy ship, u.s. sailors,Nippon Yusen K.K.,9101.TO,JP:9101,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,navy,marine transport,water transport,shipping,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A personal lawyer for President       Donald Trump       maintained Sunday that the president wasn\u2019t being investigated for possible obstruction of justice, contrary to recent news reports, arguing that Mr. Trump would have been alerted to any such development.\u201cThe president is not and has not been under investigation,\u201d Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, said on             CBS\u2019s       \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Asked how he knew that, Mr. Sekulow said there has been \u201cno notification from the special counsel\u2019s office that the president is under investigation,\u201d which he said he would expect in this circumstance.The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported that investigators are now looking into whether the president sought to obstruct a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Russian meddling in the presidential race and possible collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russia. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is examining whether the president fired FBI chief       James Comey       as part of a broader effort to alter the direction of the FBI probe, a person familiar with the matter told the Journal last week.In his comments Sunday, Mr. Sekulow said Mr. Trump\u2019s recent \u00a0tweet in which he said he was being investigated was a reaction to news reports, not confirmation of the probe\u2019s existence.\u201cThe tweet from the president was in response to the five anonymous sources purportedly leaking info to the Washington Post,\u201d he said on NBC. The Washington Post was the first to report an investigation into Mr. Trump over possible obstruction.Subjects of federal probes often aren\u2019t initially told of an investigation in progress. But this case is an unusual one.Earlier in the Russia probe, Mr. Comey had informed Mr. Trump several times that he wasn\u2019t under investigation, prior to Mr. Comey being fired on May 9. Asked if it was possible a probe of Mr. Trump started since then, unbeknownst to the White House, Mr. Sekulow told CBS on Sunday: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a scenario where the president would not be aware of it.\u201dJustin Dillon, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Washington D.C., said it is \u201cridiculous\u201d to surmise that Mr. Trump isn\u2019t under investigation because he or his lawyers haven\u2019t been notified by the Justice Department.\u201cMany don\u2019t know they are being investigated until the government is quite far down the evidence-gathering path,\u201d said Mr. Dillon, now a partner at KaiserDillon, a boutique law firm specializing in white-collar crime. Mr. Dillon isn\u2019t involved with the Trump administration or any of the investigations.Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment, referring questions to Peter Carr, spokesman for Mr. Mueller\u2019s office. Mr. Carr declined to comment on the Russia investigation.Mr. Trump has repeatedly called the Russia investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and denied any collusion by his campaign with Russia. He has also said he put no inappropriate pressure on the course of the Russia investigation.In recent days, Mr. Trump has stepped up his criticism of the investigation, targeting the people leading the Justice Department probe.On Friday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted he was the victim of \u201cthe single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history\u2014led by some very bad and conflicted people!\u201d He added: \u201cI am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!\u201d the president also tweeted.Mr. Trump didn\u2019t name the people he was referring to in the tweets, but they most closely align with Mr. Mueller and the man who appointed him, Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein.On Sunday, he again tweeted about the \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d calling it a distraction from his policy agenda.Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets are aimed at \u201cthe besmirchment\u201d of Mr. Mueller and his investigation. \u201cThey want to lay the foundation to discredit whatever Bob Mueller comes up with,\u201d he said.Sen.       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla.), a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said he believed in the integrity of Mr. Mueller\u2019s review, and cautioned the White House against any steps that might be seen as tampering with the probe.\u201cThe best thing that can happen for the president and country is for a full and credible investigation,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not undermine the credibility of the investigation.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Rosenstein issued a statement saying people should be wary of reported leaks, and of their source.\u201cAmericans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous \u2019officials.\u2019 \" he wrote.Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Lawyer: Trump Not Under Investigation.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 21:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-denies-president-is-under-investigation-1497801420", "news_title": "Trump Lawyer Denies President Is Under Investigation", "keywords": "russian hacking,special counsel russia probe,trump justice department,trump russia election meddlng,trump russia probe,trump tweets,Federal Bureau of Investigation,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "NEW YORK\u2014North Korea claimed Sunday that U.S. officials forcibly seized a diplomatic package from one of their delegations at John F.

They emerge on the scene as teenagers, as if delivered by conveyor belt, and within a few years, varying degrees of fame, trophies and riches follow. But the conclusion of the U.S. Open on Sunday was not a win for the wunderkinds. It was a win for the players who take a little longer, toiling for years with the outlandish idea that their time may yet come.Brooks Koepka\u2019s career began in Europe, took him from Kazakhstan to Kenya and at last reached an apex on the 18th green at Erin Hills. Koepka, a strapping 27-year-old from West Palm Beach, Fla., sank a 2-foot par putt to secure his first career major championship with a final score of 16 under par.That tied the lowest score under par in U.S. Open history, matching Rory McIlroy\u2019s finish at Congressional in 2011. And it marked the seventh consecutive major won by a first-time major champion.Koepka shot a 5-under-par 67 on Sunday to beat runners-up Brian Harman and Hideki Matsuyama by four strokes and provide more proof of the depth of golf\u2019s talent pool in the post-Tiger Woods era.Consecutive birdies on the 14th, 15th and 16th holes turned the closing stretch into a victory march, though Koepka remained characteristically subdued throughout.\u201cThat\u2019s probably the most emotion I\u2019ve ever showed,\u201d Koepka said unsarcastically. When asked what he was referring to, he cited a lone fist pump on the 18th green.After playing college golf at Florida State, Koepka chose a different path than most young players to try to earn status on the PGA Tour. He joined a lower-tier overseas circuit called the Challenge Tour in 2012, played his way onto the European Tour in 2013 and joined the PGA Tour in 2014.Before Sunday, Koepka was hardly a no-name in golf circles. He was ranked 22nd in the world. He played on the winning U.S. Ryder Cup team last fall. He had finished in top 25 in his past seven major championship appearances. But he had won only once before on the PGA Tour\u2014and that was more than two years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think this was only his second win,\u201d said Justin Thomas, who shot a 75 to finish at 8 under. \u201cHe had been knocking on the door for a while.\u201dOn a long list of young stars headlined by Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, Koepka was merely notable at best. But most of the top-ranked players in the world bowed out early this week. And Erin Hills, which on Thursday became the longest major championship course on record, played into Koepka\u2019s greatest strength: pure power off the tee. He ranks fifth on Tour in driving distance, averaging 308 yards.With low winds for most of the tournament, the course\u2019s wide fairways also helped mitigate a glaring weakness: accuracy. Only 55% of his tee shots this season have landed in the fairway, which ranks just 173rd on Tour. Over four rounds at Erin Hills, Koepka hit 88% of fairways.\u201cSome of the misses that would usually be in a bunker or in deep rough in a U.S. Open, they were able to hang on,\u201d he said.Sunday was the first time all week that players saw the course as the USGA envisioned it. After days of light winds and soft greens that helped players set various U.S. Open scoring records, the wind finally came to the defense of Erin Hills.With no past major champion in the top 15 to start the day, it was clear from the outset that the final round would represent a breakthrough moment for someone. Thomas, who on Saturday became the first player to shoot 9 under par in a U.S. Open round, was among the most promising candidates. But Thomas hit his opening drive into a hazard and bogeyed three of his first five holes to fall out of contention early. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have it today,\u201d he said.That left Rickie Fowler as the most prominent player with a legitimate chance to win. But after coming within a stroke of the lead early in his round, Fowler fizzled. He shot a ho-hum 72, with three bogeys and three birdies, to finish at 10 under. At age 28, he remains perhaps golf\u2019s best player\u2014and certainly its most heavily marketed player\u2014without a major championship.\u201cI feel like golf-wise I\u2019m playing at the highest level,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cYou have to measure success in different ways, not just by winning.\u201dBut Koepka said he couldn\u2019t stand the fact that he had won only once on the PGA Tour. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to win so badly,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I\u2019ve underachieved.\u201dHe got a phone call Saturday night from world No. 1 Dustin Johnson, Koepka\u2019s workout pal and fellow South Florida resident, telling him to stay patient and that he would prevail in the end.One night later, Koepka held the trophy, a moment worth the wait.Write to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Koepka Surges to Win the U.S. Open.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 20:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brooks-koepka-wins-the-u-s-open-1497831455", "news_title": "Brooks Koepka Wins the U.S. Open", "keywords": "brooks koepka,erin hills,golf,u.s. open,u.s. open golf,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Frustrated by its inability to attract European viewers, the National Football League is changing the game plan.The NFL is partnering with marketing giant             WPP                   and the investment firm Bruin Sports Capital in a new venture aimed at convincing more Europeans to watch American football on their televisions and mobile devices.The deal calls for Bruin and WPP to launch an independent company with the exclusive rights to market and sell Game Pass, which gives fans live and on-demand access to all NFL games as well as full replays, condensed games, the RedZone channel and other football content. The yet-to-be named new company will be basedin London and is initially focused on selling the product everywhere from Norway to the Vatican in Europe\u2019s 61 territories.In May the NFL announced that the U.K.-based Perform Group would handle Game Pass sales outside the U.S. and Europe.The venture is the latest attempt by the NFL to try to gain a foothold in Europe as it tries to attain NFL commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s goal of reaching $25 billion in revenue by 2027. NFL revenues will be roughly $14 billion this year, but just a small fraction of that comes from overseas. The deal with Bruin and WPP shows this distinctly American league can\u2019t grow overseas at the rates it would like without outside help that can bring specific knowledge of those markets.\u201cWe know these people are out there,\u201d said Michael Markovich, vice president of international media for the NFL, of the potentially loyal fans who might be willing to pay for Game Pass. \u201cWe just have to go find them.\u201dThe venture will require at least a $10 million investment to get off the ground, not including marketing, according to people in the industry. The parties will share profits from the venture.Bruin was founded in 2015 by George Pyne, a former Nascar executive who was also president of the international sports and entertainment conglomerate IMG. The company has already partnered with the NFL to handle its premium ticket and hospitality business known as On Location. WPP is an investor in Bruin.Bruin will hire a chief executive and oversee the day-to-day operations of the company. WPP will handle the marketing of Game Pass. A separate Bruin company, Deltatre, will provide the media and technology platform for streaming the games and other video products included with Game Pass. Deltatre already fills a similar role for the English Premier League soccer and Europe\u2019s soccer confederation, known as UEFA.\u201cSports is becoming more globalized,\u201d Pyne said, pointing to the rising audiences for European soccer in the U.S. \u201cWhen we dig into who is watching the NFL it is a younger, more affluent, dedicated demographic.\u201dStill, international growth for the NFL has been slow and frustrating. The league in 1991 created the World League of American Football, which later became NFL Europe. The league folded that venture in 2007 amid dwindling interest and attendance.In recent years, the NFL has been steadily increasing its slate of overseas games as part of its strategy to grow interest internationally. It now plays four games each season in London and has also played regular season games in Mexico.While the NFL has gained fans in England, it is far less popular there than, say, soccer is in the U.S., where the English Premier League recently sold media rights to NBC Universal for six years for $1 billion.NFL games have been distributed throughout Europe, mostly as part of pay television packages. However, penetration for pay television in Europe lags similar rates in the U.S., especially among young people, with only about 60% of households subscribing to pay television and even fewer opting for the premium sports packages that include expansive NFL coverage.Last season Europe represented roughly 55% of the NFL\u2019s Game Pass subscribers outside the U.S. England and Germany are the two leading markets. Prices in Europe averaged about $200 last year. The NFL won\u2019t say how many international customers subscribe to Game Pass.Markovich said given the league\u2019s ability to sell out its four London games and the growing audiences for NFL games on free-to-air television in Europe, the league should be doing much better with Game Pass, even though few school-age children or teens in Europe play the game, and many NFL games take place in the middle of the night in Europe.Executives involved in the transaction believe the revenue Game Pass produces can triple in the coming years.Dominic Grainger, chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa for WPP\u2019s GroupM, said European sports fans with an affinity for the NFL rather than American expats were the target audience for the product.\u201cWe are going to reach a lot of different people who haven\u2019t been reached before,\u201d he said.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'The NFL\u2019s Digital Push Into Europe.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 19:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-nfls-digital-push-into-europe-1497829768", "news_title": "The NFL\u2019s Digital Push Into Europe ", "keywords": "football,nfl,nfl europe,nfl international series,nfl london,Bruin Sports Capital,National Football League,WPP,WPP.LN,american football,sports,recreation,routine general news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,advertising,spectator sports,performing arts,sports promotion,marketing,public relations,alternative investments,business,consumer services,financial services,investing,securities,leisure,arts,hospitality,venture capital"}, {"content": "CHAMBLEE, Ga.\u2014This Tuesday\u2019s U.S. House special election in Georgia has turned into a defining clash between the two political parties, with both sides targeting a new cadre of potential swing voters: Republicans uneasy with the rise of President       Donald Trump.In the final days before the election, Democrat       Jon Ossoff       is offering a middle-of-the-road message that sets a different tone from his campaign\u2019s inaugural promise to \u201cmake Trump furious.\u201dGOP leaders, fearing an upset in this suburban Atlanta district the party has held for decades, are making an urgent appeal to Republicans to support GOP candidate       Karen Handel,        even if they have their doubts about the president.\u201cI know some of you out there, some Republicans, may even be turned off by our president,\u201d said Sonny Perdue, Mr. Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary, at a sweltering get-out-the-vote rally for Ms. Handel on Saturday in an airplane hangar here. \u201cThis is a race for the heart and soul for America.\u201dThe candidates and outside groups have poured a record $60 million into this district north of Atlanta, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission data by Issue One, a bipartisan campaign finance group.That total includes $31.4 million for Mr. Ossoff by his campaign and outside groups and $23.4 million for Ms. Handel by her campaign and outside groups, the Issue One analysis found. The remaining $4.8 million was spent on other candidates who ran in the first round.The contest is coming down to a battle for such voters as Gracile Dawes, a lifelong Republican who was so dismayed by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign that she ended up voting for a third-party presidential candidate.\u201cI just felt so sad and embarrassed,\u201d said Ms. Dawes after the New York businessman won the White House. She now supports Mr. Ossoff.Jim Griswold,        a Sandy Springs Republican who supports Ms. Handel, doesn\u2019t believe that Mr. Ossoff is as moderate as he seems. \u201cOssoff will be a tool of the left,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Griswold said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to strike an independent pose. It\u2019s a crock.\u201dSwing Republicans and independents could tip the balance in the neck-and-neck race to pick a successor to       Tom Price,        who left Congress to become Mr. Trump\u2019s health and human services secretary.Both Ms. Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, and Mr. Ossoff, a former congressional aide and documentary filmmaker, are acutely aware of the attention showered on the race as the biggest test of strength between the parties since Mr. Trump was elected.The two parties have battled this year in several races that have served as proxies for the national divide, most notably in two special elections for Congress in Kansas and Montana, where Democratic candidates ran far closer to their GOP counterparts than in recent elections, but Republicans still prevailed.But Georgia has long been viewed as the ultimate bellwether of Republican vulnerability in seats that could help Democrats retake control of the House.The district\u2019s suburban, college-educated voters are political weak points for Mr. Trump, according to analyses of the presidential election results and polls this year. That category of voters is heavily represented in many House districts that will be up for grabs next year.\u201cThe whole country is watching us right now,\u201d Mr. Ossoff told supporters in Marietta on Saturday.Most polls show the race nearly tied, but with Mr. Ossoff consistently holding a slight lead.Tuesday\u2019s race is a runoff election because Mr. Ossoff in April received 48% of the vote, 2 percentage points short of the 50% needed to take the seat outright in the first round of the special election.Ms. Handel garnered 20% in the initial contest, ranking second among a crowded field of 18 candidates, 11 of whom were Republican.In a June poll by Atlanta\u2019s WSB-TV, which showed the candidates nearly tied, Mr. Ossoff drew support from 15.3% of Republicans, while 6.8% of Democrats supported Ms. Handel.Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District has been represented in the House for almost 40 years by Republicans, including former House Speaker       Newt Gingrich.       Its boundary lines have changed over the years but not its partisan bent.       Mitt Romney       won the district by 23 percentage points in 2012. In the 2016 GOP primary, the district went for Florida Sen.       Marco Rubio.But voters here weren\u2019t quick to embrace Mr. Trump, who barely beat Democratic presidential candidate       Hillary Clinton       in this district. Republicans have been trying to close what they have seen as a worrisome enthusiasm gap between the parties: Their analysis of first-round voting files found that some 38,000 people who usually vote Republican didn\u2019t participate.To mobilize the GOP, Ms. Handel has walked a fine line with Mr. Trump. She says her responsibility in Congress will be to represent the district, not the White House.\u201cThe race is not about Donald Trump,\u201d she said in an interview after greeting voters at a taco restaurant. \u201cIt is about who people believe is best suited to represent the interests of the district.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump came to the district for a fundraiser and has recorded robocalls to help get out the vote.At the airport rally, Mr. Perdue defended the president and argued that ambivalent Republicans can\u2019t afford the luxury of sitting out this special election.But Mr. Ossoff\u2019s campaign rhetoric has been moderate enough that it is helping him win over voters such as       Eric Scharff,        a Marietta independent who backed Mitt Romney in 2012 but who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016.Mr. Scharff said he supported Mr. Ossoff because he had \u201ca balanced, work-with-both-sides approach.\u201dCentral to Ms. Handel\u2019s drive to bring Republicans home has been her argument that Mr. Ossoff is too far left for the district and will be beholden to House Democratic leader       Nancy Pelosi,        a Californian whom Republicans cite as an emblem of liberalism.Mr. Ossoff\u2019s campaign rhetoric has been consistently moderate. He rarely mentions Mr. Trump on the stump. He talks about cutting federal spending to eliminate waste. He has opposed tax increases on the rich and a single-payer health-care system.Ms. Handel derides all that as faux-moderation, but it appears to be helping him win crossover voters such as Ms. Dawes who are weary not just of Mr. Trump but of the extremes of both parties.\u201cI came out of November feeling that both extremes had gotten so aggressive and angry, they bullied us in the center out of the conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cJon is measured. Calm. Thoughtful.\u201dMr. Ossoff\u2019s approach is also playing well with voters such as Eric Scharff, a Marietta independent who backed Mitt Romney in 2012 but who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Mr. Scharff said he supported Mr. Ossoff because he had \u201ca balanced, work-with-both-sides approach.\u201dStill, if Ms. Handel pulls out a victory, it will be a sign that the district\u2019s GOP still holds a solid core of Trump loyalists such as       John Younker,        a retired engineer in Marietta.\u201cWe have to vote for the Republican,\u201d Mr. Younker said when a canvasser for a conservative group came to his door. \u201cWe want to see Trump\u2019s program continue. He\u2019s a good president.\u201dWrite to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com and Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Georgia Vote Hinges on GOP.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 19:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-georgia-house-race-parties-battle-for-new-swing-voters-1497803512", "news_title": "In Georgia House Race, Parties Battle for New Swing Voters", "keywords": "donald trump,georgia house race,jon ossoff,karen handel,Donald Trump,Jon Ossoff,Karen Handel,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "With             Amazon.com Inc.

She said a public inquiry would answer urgent questions around how the fire spread so quickly and why persistent warnings by residents of the public housing building\u2019s fire hazards were ignored.In three months, Mrs. May\u2019s approval ratings have plummeted, a sign of the extent to which this month\u2019s election damaged her and her Conservative Party.The election result has emboldened pro-EU lawmakers, who are pressuring Treasury chief       Philip Hammond       to champion a Brexit that would maintain as close as possible ties to the EU. Mr. Hammond, who supported remaining in the EU ahead of last year\u2019s referendum, told ITV News on Sunday that the U.K. wanted British exporters to be able to trade with Europe in a way they can now, but denied speculation that the election\u2019s inconclusive results might soften Britain\u2019s negotiating stance.He said the U.K. will definitely leave the EU\u2019s single trading market and customs union, which applies a common external tariff across all member states. He sidestepped a question about how long Mrs. May could stay on as prime minister, saying the country needed \u201ca period of calm.\u201dThe election exposed the deep divisions within the U.K. over Brexit and Mrs. May\u2019s strategy. A Survation PLC poll, published over the weekend, showed that in light of the election result, 47% of people wanted to stay in the single market and customs union, compared with 36% who wanted to leave. The rest didn\u2019t know.David Davis,        the U.K. minister overseeing Brext negotiations, said the U.K. wants both sides to emerge stronger.\u201cI want to reiterate at the outset of these talks that the U.K. will remain a committed partner and ally of our friends across the Continent,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cAnd while there is a long road ahead, our destination is clear\u2014a deep and special partnership between the U.K. and the EU.\u201dTalks continue between the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionists, a small Northern Irish party. Mrs. May wants to secure a loose alliance with the mostly Protestant, pro-British party to prop up her minority government.A key test for Mrs. May will come on Wednesday, when she is expected to lay out her legislative agenda for a parliamentary vote. A senior Conservative lawmaker said Mrs. May\u2019s missteps over recent days have further hurt her standing in the party, but that fellow members of Parliament wanted stability and that there is little appetite for a leadership change. \u201cNobody wants to be involved in an internal squabble,\u201d he said.Anand Menon,        a politics professor at King\u2019s College London, said a leadership challenge would add to the chaos of the party and take up time and resources that are needed for Brexit negotiations. \u201cBut if she keeps hemorrhaging respectability and support they\u2019ll have no choice,\u201d he said.He said that while there is speculation that the election results could soften the U.K.\u2019s Brexit negotiating aims, the safest course for the party is to keep the plan as it is. \u201cAt this point, if we reopen the issues and have a debate about it, it will be fatal for the government.\u201dWrite to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Attack, Fire Raise Pressure On May Before Brexit Talks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 19:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/embattled-at-home-theresa-may-now-faces-tricky-brexit-talks-1497795745", "news_title": "Embattled at Home, Theresa May Now Faces Tricky Brexit Talks", "keywords": "brexit, britain, brussels, eu,grenfell tower,high rise fire, theresa may, uk,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,politics,domestic politics,elections,broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "Four African-American churches on Long Island were spray-painted over the weekend with what police called \u201csatanic graffiti.\u201dSuffolk County police said the incidents of \u201ccriminal mischief\u201d in North Amityville, L.I., have been turned over to the its hate-crime unit for further investigation.Bishop       William H.

Meanwhile, many college grads are underemployed and burdened by student debt. The       Trump       Administration is trying to address both problems by rethinking the government\u2019s educational priorities.President Trump directed Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta       last week to streamline regulations to make it easier for employers, industry groups and labor unions to offer apprenticeships. Many employers provide informal apprenticeships for new workers, but the Labor bureaucracy regulates and approves programs whose credentials are recognized industry-wide.About 505,000 workers are enrolled in government-registered apprenticeships. The programs typically pair on-the-job training with educational courses that allow workers to make money while honing skills in fields like welding, plumbing, electrical engineering and various mechanical trades. While construction apprenticeships are common, training programs are growing in industries like restaurant and hotel management.Nearly all apprentices receive jobs and the average starting salary is $60,000, according to the Labor Department. That beats the pay for most college majors outside of the hard sciences. Last year\u2019s National Association of Colleges and Employers survey estimated the starting salary of education majors at $34,891 and humanities at $46,065.For decades the cultural and economic assumption has been that Americans will be better off with a college degree. This is still true overall, and economic returns to education have risen. This is especially true for those with cognitive ability who acquire skills in growth industries like software design or biological sciences. Politicians have responded by subsidizing college almost as much as they do housing\u2014with Pell grants, 529 tax subsidies and more recently debt forgiveness.Yet the politically inconvenient reality is that not every kid is cut out for traditional college, and those who struggle in high school may be better off learning a trade. Many without academic inclination or preparation often spend years (and thousands of dollars) taking remedial classes to compensate for their lousy K-12 education.The six-year graduation rate for four-year colleges is 60% while the three-year graduation rate at community colleges is a paltry 22%. The       Obama       Administration response was to push even more subsidized student debt to force feed even more kids into college. Student debt doubled in the Obama years to $1.3 trillion, which will burden workers and taxpayers for decades.Another problem is that few colleges and high schools teach vocational skills. The Labor Department Jolts survey of national job openings found more than six million in April\u2014the most since Jolts began tracking in 2000. The vacancies include 203,000 in construction, 359,000 in manufacturing and 1.1 million in health care. These are not jobs that can be filled by Kanye West English deconstructionists. They are also typically jobs that can\u2019t be supplanted by lower-wage foreign competition.While employers subsidize most apprenticeships, the President has proposed spending $200 million to promote the programs. This would still be a drop in the $26 billion bucket (not including student loans) that Washington spends on higher education each year.One objection to shifting this money will come from unions that receive much federal job-training money with poor results. But if others can run a better program, they should get the cash. It\u2019s true that most government job-training programs are ineffective, so it\u2019s good that Mr. Trump has instructed federal agencies to compile a list of those that should be eliminated.An especially odd objection is that apprenticeship training is a mistake because skills become out of date over time, especially later in one\u2019s work life. But that\u2019s a risk throughout the economy, and all the more reason to get young people skills to enter the job market now and build up savings for the future. This makes more sense than subsidizing a college degree for a job at             Starbucks.Perhaps the most important message is that there\u2019s dignity and purpose in all work, college degree or not.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 18:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-non-celebrity-apprentices-1497824477", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Non-Celebrity Apprentices", "keywords": "regulation,government policy,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,employee training,development,political,general news,education,politics,international relations,domestic politics,university,college,government bodies,executive branch,labor department,editorials"}, {"content": "ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia\u2014A North Korean official said that       Otto Warmbier,        the U.S. student released by North Korea last week in a coma after a 17-month detention, was \u201cnot an ordinary citizen of America\u201d and was punished because he had sought to overthrow North Korea\u2019s government.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s father has denied that his son was involved in any such plot, and criticized Pyongyang for having \u201cbrutally treated\u201d his son.The remarks, made by a North Korean official at a meeting here of governmental and nongovernmental representatives organized by Mongolia\u2019s foreign ministry, are the first official view from Pyongyang on Mr. Warmbier\u2019s case, apart from a brief one-sentence statement on Friday saying he had been released on humanitarian grounds.The public comments suggest that North Korea is unlikely to back down from claims that Mr. Warmbier, 22 years old, was an agent of entities in the U.S. seeking to undermine the North Korean state, nor from the position that Mr. Warmbier had committed crimes that merited the harsh sentence that he received in January last year.Mr. Warmbier was sentenced by North Korea to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly stealing a propaganda poster from a Pyongyang hotel on behalf of a Methodist church in Ohio and a secret society at the University of Virginia, with the knowledge of the Central Intelligence Agency.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s father has denied that his son was involved in any such plot, and criticized Pyongyang for having \u201cbrutally treated\u201d his son.Mr. Warmbier, who returned to the U.S. last week, suffered a \u201csevere\u201d neurological injury, and remains uncommunicative, according to hospital authorities tending to him at the University of Cincinnati. The U.S. State Department, which secured Mr. Warmbier\u2019s release, said that it had been told by its North Korean counterparts that Mr. Warmbier had been in a coma for more than a year.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s precarious state could serve as a flashpoint for continued tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.The remarks from       Kim Kwang-hak,        a researcher at the North Korean Foreign Ministry\u2019s Institute for American Studies, suggest that Pyongyang will likely stick to its hard-line stance on the handling of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s case.\u201cOtto Warmbier,       Kenneth Bae      \u2014they committed crimes against the government of DPRK to realize the regime change and the regime collapse of the DPRK,\u201d Mr. Kim said during a heated exchange with Alexandre Mansourov, a Georgetown University professor who represented the U.S. at the foreign policy forum, called the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue, staged in the Mongolian capital last week.North Korea\u2019s formal name is the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, and Mr. Bae is a Korean-American who was released by Pyongyang after a detention of more than two years, after being charged with a litany of alleged crimes against the state.\u201cDo as the Romans do when you\u2019re in Rome,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cEvery country has laws and regulations.\u201dDuring the two-day Ulaanbaatar Dialogue, which gathered representatives from the U.S., China, Japan, Russia and North and South Korea, North Korean officials lashed out repeatedly at Washington for what it called U.S. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       \u201caggressive\u201d threats against it.Ri Yong Pil,        vice president of North Korea\u2019s Institute for American Studies, characterized Mr. Trump\u2019s policy toward Pyongyang as being \u201cmore aggressive\u201d than that of President       Barack Obama\u2019s      , and said that North Korea had no choice but to build up its nuclear deterrence, so as to avoid the fate of Iraq, Libya and Syria.Mr. Kim, the other North Korean delegate, said that Washington\u2019s \u201chostile policy\u201d against Pyongyang \u201cis not abstract\u2014it is very real.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. says it is not seeking regime change, but their actions do not match with their words,\u201d Mr. Kim said, citing the Trump administration\u2019s policy of asking other nations to downgrade their relationships with North Korea, and what he described as the U.S.\u2019s inclusion of Navy SEALs in its annual joint exercises with South Korea.\u201cThis was the same unit that killed       Osama bin Laden,        so you may have a sense of what they are trying to do,\u201d Mr. Kim said. He added that, as North Korea bolsters its nuclear weapons capability, it would prevent the U.S. from ever considering a pre-emptive military strike.\u201cIf we have mutually-assured destruction weapons, a perfect weapons system, in that case, the U.S. will never consider that kind of military option,\u201d Mr. Kim said, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s missile strike on Syria earlier this year proved that the U.S. couldn\u2019t otherwise be counted on to refrain from a pre-emptive strike.\u201cThe best defense is the active offense,\u201d said Mr. Ri. \u201cThe people of the DPRK have been sick and tired of unilateral nuclear threat from the U.S., but now the situation has changed, and we have our capability of striking.\u201dDuring the forum, presided over by Mongolia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the four-member North Korean delegation threatened to walk out after       Lee Hyung-seog,        a South Korean representative, referred to North Korea in a speech as a \u201c21st century feudal dynasty.\u201dThe Mongolian official moderating the panel chastised Mr. Lee, who works for a think tank affiliated with Seoul\u2019s spy agency.

This summer tourists can see more New Yorkers relieving their bladders in public thanks to the council\u2019s reduction in penalties for crimes against public order, and now the council wants to expose the city\u2019s antiterror secrets.A new bill would require the New York Police Department to disclose and describe all \u201csurveillance technology,\u201d which it defines as \u201cequipment, software, or system capable of, or used or designed for, collecting, retaining, processing, or sharing audio, video, location, thermal, biometric, or similar information.\u201d The cops would have to post this information online annually and respond to public comments.The effort is backed by such anti-antiterror stalwarts as the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Brennan Center. Manhattan Democrat       Daniel Garodnick,        a co-sponsor, says the measure would enhance public trust by giving citizens more knowledge about policing techniques.We\u2019ll see how long that trust lasts if the bill makes it easier for terrorists to thwart or evade the NYPD\u2019s antiterror methods. That\u2019s the legitimate worry of police who rely on technology and surveillance to prevent mass murder.

They also comply with the court-ordered Handschu guidelines that impose additional due-process burdens.An NYPD internal committee reviews these cases along with an external, civilian representative, who is currently former federal Judge       Stephen Robinson.       As if this weren\u2019t enough, in 2014 the city council established an inspector general for the NYPD. The miracle is that the cops have been able to keep America safe despite all of this bureaucratic oversight and political second-guessing.New York remains a pre-eminent terror target because of its size and importance as a symbol of American culture and commerce.

He saw his country through the death of the Cold War and the birth of a reunited Germany at the center of a more deeply integrated European Union.Born in 1930, Kohl came of age amid the furies of a nihilistic German nationalism and then amid the wreckage of its defeat. He was compelled to join the       Hitler       Youth, as were all boys in that era, but was part of the first generation of Germany\u2019s postwar leaders too young to have fought in the conflict. His parents instilled in him a devout Catholicism that shaped his later political outlook.He entered politics in the Christian Democratic Union, which with its Bavarian sister party the CSU became Germany\u2019s main center-right party. He rose to the Chancellorship of West Germany in 1982, a position he would hold for a postwar record of 16 years.He took power after years of Social Democratic Ostpolitik, or engagement with East Germany, and when the anticommunism of       Ronald Reagan,       Margaret Thatcher       and       Pope John Paul II       still faced considerable skepticism among putative foreign-policy experts. One of             Kohl\u2019s                   early contributions was to defend plans to deploy       Pershing II       missiles in West Germany against fierce protests across Europe.Kohl also built on the work of his predecessors in reconciling Germany with the rest of Europe. His friendship with French President       Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand       was legendary, and that proved crucial in persuading other European leaders to accept a reunified Germany after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.That reunification\u2014and the creation of the euro, which Kohl accepted as its price\u2014remains controversial. Economists are right that the euro and many economic-policy decisions governing reunification created challenges that still dog the EU. Kohl was right that peaceful German integration was worth the price.Europe\u2019s first tasks after 1989 were political, not economic: to welcome the formerly subjugated people of Eastern Europe back into Western civilization, and to find a way for Germany to be a nation again without being a threat. Kohl, driven by his commitment to European unity, aided both projects with his policy of rapid reunification and the euro. The result was a Continent that weathered the collapse of a malign neighboring superpower while remaining at peace with itself.Historians will remember that achievement more than the commonplace political scandals that engulfed Kohl later in his long career.

The companies signed a confidentiality agreement on April 27, according to people familiar with the matter and a federal filing\u2014amid a board shakeup at Whole Foods, and roughly two weeks after Jana Partners LLC disclosed a stake in the grocery and called for its sale.Amazon and Whole Foods signed a second confidentiality agreement on May 7, the same weekend Whole Foods\u2019 board offered Jana two seats but rejected taking on a partner from the New York hedge fund. After the board changed, the deal coalesced quickly. Mr. Bezos was personally engaged and Mr. Mackey traveled to Seattle for negotiations, the people said.Executives at Amazon and Whole Foods found they shared a willingness to let employees take risks and an emphasis on customer experience, according to people familiar with the matter.The companies have said little about how they plan to integrate, and declined to make their CEOs available for interviews. But at least some benefits of the combination seem clear.Mr. Bezos gains more than 460 stores across the U.S., a network that could let Amazon sell its private-label brands and devices in stores, expand its distribution network, and bolster its Prime Now and Fresh delivery businesses.Whole Foods gets access to Amazon\u2019s data and technology, and the combined buying power of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods could win better prices from grocery suppliers. Also, Mr. Mackey\u2019s new boss has been tolerant of thin profit margins, a welcome relief after activist investor pressure over profit and other issues. Amazon has said Mr. Mackey will remain CEO of Whole Foods.Still, Mr. Bezos\u2019s team is likely to scrutinize Whole Foods\u2019 business practices seeking opportunities for change, former Amazon employees say. To better compete with rivals including         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       for example, Amazon likely will push for lower prices, new technology, and more uniform stores to save costs, they say.Mr. Mackey has balked at activist investors for criticizing Whole Foods as too slow to innovate, despite the company\u2019s recent efforts to do so.Mr. Mackey, a 63-year-old Texan who studied philosophy and religion in college but didn\u2019t graduate, built Whole Foods with his partners into a national brand from one natural-food store in the basement of an Austin, Texas, house. They bought up local health-food chains, using capital from investors to open big stores in a sector long dominated by mom-and-pop shops. Whole Foods patched together 11 regions that were given autonomy to develop their own store concepts, signage and other flourishes.\u201cThey are free to try new things,\u201d said Mr. Mackey in a recent interview. Employees study ideas inside and outside the company and don\u2019t \u201chave to ask permission from Austin,\u201d where Whole Foods is based.Mr. Mackey is more focused on the big picture than immersed in the details of everyday operations, former executives said. A strict vegan, he likes to cook dinners showcasing good eating to bring parts of the company together, said people who have attended.Some say that the close-knit culture has drawbacks. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very paternalistic culture where it\u2019s a job for life. If someone doesn\u2019t deliver, you don\u2019t necessarily suffer the consequences,\u201d said       Burt Flickinger,        a grocery consultant.At Amazon, performance is prized and, as with other tech companies, employees come and go more frequently, former employees say.Mr. Bezos, 53, earned a degree from Princeton University in electrical engineering and computer science and worked on Wall Street before founding Amazon in his garage in 1994. He \u201chas this unique ability to stay focused on a long-term vision, while also staying very focused on the details,\u201d says Joseph Thompson, a former general manager of retail at Amazon and current vice president of marketing and growth at BuildDirect, a home-improvement online marketplace.Despite Amazon\u2019s size, Mr. Bezos tries to maintain a startup culture. Teams are typically kept small (defined by the ability to be fed with two pizzas) and there is a strict process for developing new ideas and inventing devices, which includes writing six-page papers for explanation, according to former employees.When former Amazon employee Eric Heller met with Mr. Bezos and his team more than a decade ago to push for requiring customers to enter credit-card security codes while checking out, the CEO dug in on the details. The requirement would save costs by reducing the likelihood of fraud, but Mr. Bezos worried it would make transactions more cumbersome, Mr. Heller recalls.\u201cUntil my mother knows what a [card verification value] is, we\u2019re not putting it on the transaction page,\u201d Mr. Bezos said, according to Mr. Heller, who has since founded consultancy Marketplace Ignition.Some former employees and industry observers said it would take time for the companies and founders to mesh.\u201cThey will be blended. It won\u2019t happen in three months but in two or three years it will,\u201d said Tom Furphy, former head of Amazon\u2019s consumables and Fresh divisions, and now CEO of Consumer Equity Partners, a venture-capital fund.\u2014David Benoit contributed to this article.Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com and Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Amazon Deal Unites Maverick Chiefs.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 17:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-deal-for-whole-foods-unites-maverick-ceos-1497801315", "news_title": "Amazon Deal for Whole Foods Unites Maverick CEOs", "keywords": "amazon buys whole foods,amazon ceo,amazon deal,amazon whole foods deal,whole foods,whole foods ceo,Amazon.com,AMZN,Whole Foods Market,WFM,John Mackey,Jeff Bezos,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,wooden furniture,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,consumer goods,e-commerce,furniture,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "President       Trump       opened another chapter in U.S.-Cuba relations on Friday when he announced a rollback of portions of the detente policy with Havana introduced by President       Obama       in December 2014. Human-rights groups cheered, libertarians jeered, and the international\u2014and American\u2014left warned that the new policy will harm Cubans and U.S. investors.All sides are dug in, as they have been for decades. Yet the reality is that when it comes to liberating Cuba, the embargo is a distraction. With or without it, the Castro police state will hang on until the civilized world speaks with one voice to condemn the illegitimacy of the regime as it did with South Africa during apartheid.That\u2019s not happening because the communist state\u2019s pro-Castro narrative still has defenders in the West. The human-rights challenge is to expose this big lie. What\u2019s needed is a truth commission that would allow Cubans themselves to tell what really happened.The Trump administration\u2019s changes are aimed at weakening the military dictatorship by denying it easy access to U.S. dollars via the military-owned tourism industry. American companies\u2019 ability to form partnerships with those businesses will be pared back and American travelers will face new restrictions.This is an important symbolic change. Yet the effects are likely to be minimal. Despite the tendentious claims of too many American journalists, Cuba is not \u201cisolated,\u201d nor is it starving because of the embargo. The rest of the world can do business in Cuba and the regime buys all the food and medicine it wants from the U.S.There is no U.S. prohibition on the export of construction materials to nonstate actors in Cuba. But the regime doesn\u2019t allow the free flow of goods because economic freedom is a path to political freedom. Small businesses are permitted only if they don\u2019t become too profitable and their owners don\u2019t express ideas independent of the totalitarian state. Cuban privation is made in Havana.Ra\u00fal Castro       loves to whine about Cuba\u2019s lack of internet capability and to blame it on the embargo. But as one dissident on the island wrote to me last week, the regime is the reason Cubans lack access. \u201cInformation is always power,\u201d he explained, so the \u201cgovernment doesn\u2019t have the will nor is it a priority\u201d to see people informed. Where there is internet, he noted, the government blocks news sites.What is more, he wrote, the regime \u201ckeeps all the money earned by the people\u2019s sweat and uses it for military contingencies, maintenance of weapons, diplomatic personnel, officials, representatives abroad, spies, etc.\u201d If the dictatorship \u201cdecides a dissident should die, it is not difficult to\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0accomplish\u201d the task.Such complaints counted for little with Barack Obama. Instead, in 2016, the U.S. president attended a baseball game in Havana with Castro, who also invited members of the Colombian narcoterrorist group FARC. The U.S. also barred Cuban dissidents from attending the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Havana.Moral myopia about Cuba is explained in some cases by the fact that the regime is the international symbol for anti-Americanism. To condemn Castro would be to acknowledge that the U.S. was right to try to end the tyranny.A high-profile truth project would correct the record. One myth that needs to be debunked is that resistance to the Castro hijacking of a revolution originally meant to restore the 1940 constitution came solely from white, upper-class Havana.In 1958 Cuba was one of the richest countries in Latin America. Cubans widely understood the link between rising living standards and constitutional democracy. They were heavily in favor of removing dictator       Fulgencio Batista       from power to restore the rule of law.       Fidel Castro       and the guerrillas in the Sierra Maestra derived their support from that sentiment.By the summer of 1959 it was clear Fidel wanted absolute power. Among the first to realize it were small farmers living in central Cuba and the foothills of the Escambray Mountains. Those guajiros formed the backbone of a resistance that lasted six years. Their communities suffered unspeakable atrocities in a Soviet-supervised cleansing.The military savagely attacked villages, displacing families and forcibly relocating many to the remote western end of the island. Survivors have told me that the regime also rounded up women and children and made them captive in Havana while it crammed men and boys into chicken coops for days and weeks to crush the rebellion.The Cuba Archive Truth and Memory Project has documented 934 executions mostly in the Escambray. Another 607 political prisoners were executed between 1960 and 1970 and the vast majority of them are believed to have been captured in the Escambray.Mr. Trump has taken a first step toward moral clarity on Cuba. But real progress requires an honest look at the historical record that acknowledges the regime\u2019s many crimes against humanity.Write to O\u2019Grady@wsj.com.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 17:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cubans-need-a-truth-commission-1497821946", "news_title": "Cubans Need a Truth Commission", "keywords": "castro, communism,cuba,fidel, havana, obama, raul, trump, white house,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "At Harvard\u2019s commencement last month, dropout       Mark Zuckerberg      told eager graduates to create a new social contract for their generation: \u201cWe should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP, but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful.\u201d He then said to applause: \u201cWe should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things.\u201d Who wouldn\u2019t like three grand a month?Having the government provide citizens with a universal basic income is the most bankrupt idea since socialism, but others in Silicon Valley still have been proselytizing money for nothing. \u201cThere will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better,\u201d Tesla CEO       Elon Musk      said at the World Government Summit in Dubai earlier this year. \u201cI think some kind of universal basic income is going to be necessary.\u201dRobert Reich,        President Clinton\u2019s labor secretary, summed up the wrongheaded thinking a few months ago: \u201cWe will get to a point, all our societies, where technology is displacing so many jobs, not just menial jobs but also professional jobs, that we\u2019re going to have to take seriously the notion of a universal basic income.\u201dThis is a false premise. All through history, automation has created more jobs than it destroyed. Washboards and wringers were replaced by increasingly inexpensive washing machines, while more women entered the workforce. Automated manufacturing and one-click buying has upended retail, yet throughout the U.S. millions of jobs go unfilled. With Amazon\u2019s proposed purchase of             Whole Foods,       the online giant is primed finally to bring efficiency to the last mile of grocery shopping\u2014but don\u2019t count on all grocery jobs to disappear.The economics, which they apparently stopped teaching at Harvard, are straightforward: Lowering the cost of goods and services through automation allows capital\u2014financial and human\u2014to attack even harder problems. Wake me up when we run out of problems.These kinds of predictions aren\u2019t new, and they\u2019ve been wrong almost always. In 1930       John Maynard Keynes      envisioned that his grandchildren would have a 15-hour workweek.       Sam Altman,        who runs the startup incubator Y Combinator, dabbles in similarly bold but meaningless statements. \u201cWe think everyone should have enough money to meet their basic needs\u2014no matter what, especially if there are enough resources to make it possible,\u201d he wrote last year, while admitting he has no idea \u201chow it should look or how to pay for it.\u201dWhere to begin? First, the cost of a universal basic income would make free college for everyone look like austerity. The cost of anything the government touches tends to increase well faster than inflation\u2014education, health care, housing. Price signals get distorted, but since Uncle Sam is paying, no one seems to care. Anyway, why stop at $3,000 a month? Why not $4,000 a month or $40,000? Everyone deserves a MacArthur genius grant!If last year\u2019s presidential election proved anything, it\u2019s that people want jobs, not handouts. The education system needs reform, but there are already two billion mobile classrooms built into smartphones world-wide. Paying people not to work means you\u2019ll never get them back into the workforce. Why would you want to work when you can bang on a drum all day?The U.S. is already turning European\u2014I really think so. Remember the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cLife of Julia,\u201d which glorified the nanny state? Every year more Democrats push single-payer health care because competition is deemed too messy. The safety net now has a safety net. These are all on the riverbank of paying people not to work. Universal basic income would be the final drowning of capitalism.Many Americans really do need help, and no one should be dying in the streets. But why create an entire class of freeloaders out of people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have sought handouts?The bigger question is why all these Silicon Valley bigwigs are intent on giving away other people\u2019s money. Perhaps it\u2019s a misplaced sense of shame for their riches. Worse, some believe they are chosen to carry society on their backs while the teeming masses can be paid to idle along. Well, as long as they download the latest apps and are given enough to pay for wireless internet and an iPhone upgrade every few years.             Facebook                   and videogames are already huge mind sinks. Add Mr. Musk\u2019s Neuralink direct brain interface and no one will ever get off the couch.Most millennials are hardworking and motivated, but have you noticed that the talk of universal basic income comes just as marijuana legalization is making more gains than ever? It\u2019s already been legalized for recreational use in eight states and for medicinal purposes in 29. Universal basic income, combined with legal weed, could ruin an entire generation.

There\u2019s a saying among gun-carry permit advocates: \u201cWhen seconds count, police are minutes away.\u201dThat was not the case last week but only because Majority Whip Steve Scalise\u2019s Capitol Police detail was on hand and courageously engaged the shooter. Had Rep. Scalise and his security team not been present, congressmen and their aides would have been easy pickings until local police arrived. That took three minutes\u2014but that\u2019s a long time to spend taking cover in a baseball dugout under armed assault. \u201cIt would have been a bloodbath,\u201d said Texas Republican       Joe Barton.In largely rural states like Indiana, where I live, response times can be 30 minutes or more. Maybe that\u2019s why nearly a million Hoosiers hold active gun permits, as per state records, out of an adult population of 4.5 million.I\u2019ve been one of them for decades. I\u2019ve gone Christmas shopping armed, carried at family outings, sporting events and movie theaters. I was fired from a job with the gun tucked in an ankle holster. Aside from the indignity of being fired, the only person in danger was me, when I broke the news to my wife.Indiana assumes\u2014in the absence of evidence to the contrary\u2014that people will protect themselves without reflexive, wanton violence. It works. A gun-use Venn diagram would show a mere sliver of overlap between those who lawfully carry weapons and those who use guns in the commission of crimes. You don\u2019t find National Rifle Association stickers on getaway cars.The inconvenient fact that laws aimed at restraining criminals are only obeyed by non-criminals was vividly demonstrated in this case. Rep.       Barry Loudermilk       (R., Ga.) reported that his aide \u201cback in Georgia, carries a 9mm (pistol) in his car. .\u00a0.\u00a0. He had a clear shot at him, but here we\u2019re not allowed to carry any weapons.\u201dBad news for New York Republican       Chris Collins,        who said, \u201cI can assure you from this day forth\u2014I have a carry permit\u2014I will be carrying when out and about.\u201d Well, when he\u2019s out and about on Capitol Hill he won\u2019t be allowed to carry. He might be permitted to have a gun in his desk\u2014unloaded. It will make a fine paperweight.Mr. Collins\u2019s New York state carry permit is recognized in Virginia, under expanding reciprocity laws that have extended permit rights beyond state lines. He could also carry in Indiana; our reciprocity rules are very liberal, in the least bossy sense of the term. But relying on his New York permit in Maryland or the District of Columbia would get Mr. Collins one phone call and a court date.Mr. Scalise\u2019s heroic security team, Capitol Police agents       Crystal Griner       and       David Bailey,        were armed with handguns and faced a man shooting a rifle. The situation wasn\u2019t likely to offer a good outcome.The truth is that armed citizens can never substitute for police, who train, practice, and re-train constantly. But officers can\u2019t be everywhere. And ordinary citizens\u2014even congressmen\u2014can\u2019t field full-time security teams.

President Trump has fallen short on this pledge, despite strong rhetoric and some excellent appointments. If he wants lasting reforms of the regulatory state, he\u2019ll have to work with Congress to make elected officials accountable again.\u201cWe\u2019re cutting regulations massively,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the Jan. 30 signing ceremony for an executive order commanding agencies to repeal two regulations for every new one. Conservatives may see this as a move in the right direction, but it won\u2019t work: The agencies might have been able to comply before the late 1960s, when they had a freer hand, but not now.In 1970 Congress passed the Clean Air Act. It was one of the first in a long series of statutes that give citizens the right to regulatory protection, command agencies to do what is necessary to protect those rights, and direct courts to enforce the commands.This type of legislation allowed elected officials to claim credit for the benefits of regulations while shifting blame to agencies for the burdens. The system became so politically profitable that politicians from both parties showed practically limitless enthusiasm for giving citizens rights to protection. The Clean Air Act contained 940 detailed commands for the Environmental Protection Agency, some of which require it to issue dozens of separate regulations binding businesses.With so many judicially enforceable commands requiring agencies to regulate, Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order can keep the feds from issuing new regulations only until courts require compliance with the statutes. The order will postpone new regulations\u2014but at the price of exposing businesses to growth-killing uncertainty. Agencies have some wiggle room to reduce the burdens imposed under existing regulations, but doing so requires time-consuming work to demonstrate compliance with each statute\u2019s detailed requirements. Even if the burden-reducing changes survive judicial review, the process takes years.An even more daunting obstacle is the demand for regulatory protection, which gives rise to the laws themselves. At its start, the Reagan administration seemed unresponsive to Americans\u2019 demand for more environmental protection. Membership in green organizations surged, the president\u2019s popularity took a hit, and in 1983 he was forced to give a free hand to a new EPA administrator with strong environmental credentials. If Mr. Trump wants to reduce regulatory burdens without suffering a similar fate, he needs to find smart ways to reconcile Americans\u2019 desire for regulatory protection with their distaste for its burdens.Making the task even more difficult, the regulatory statutes are ridiculously obsolete. The major environmental laws took shape in the 1970s, and most have not been revised since the 1980s. They fail to take advantage of newer, better ways to produce more protection for the regulatory buck.I co-wrote a 2009 study that took ideas from environmental experts of all political stripes to propose smarter statutes, \u201cBreaking the Logjam: Environmental Reform for the New Congress and Administration.\u201d We showed that the country could get more protection with less cost by having the EPA deal with the most dangerous interstate air-quality problems through a national market-based approach.In early 2009 I joined other leaders of the project to discuss these proposals with Democrats and Republicans in Congress. They told us they wished the proposals were already on the books because their colleagues would not shoulder the responsibility necessary for reform. Lawmakers didn\u2019t want to tamper with a status quo that is perfect for them and bad for constituents.Americans can get regulatory statutes that give them more protection with less burden only if members of Congress bear personal responsibility for the consequences of the laws they enact. This can be achieved by requiring Congress to vote to approve or to disapprove all major regulations issued by federal agencies. This would create a powerful incentive to revise statutes so they are more balanced.This idea isn\u2019t new.       James Landis,        a New Deal expert on regulation and later dean of Harvard Law School, proposed it nearly 80 years ago. Before he joined the Supreme Court,       Stephen Breyer       wrote a 1984 law review article about how it could work in practice.Earlier in this Congress, House Republicans passed the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, or Reins Act. Republicans on the Judiciary Committee wrote in a statement that Congress would have to vote on agency actions \u201cthat cost the economy $100 million or more.\u201dThey say nothing about actions that reduce regulatory protection. The Reins Act thus looks more like a poke in the eye to Democrats than a serious reform\u2014guaranteeing it won\u2019t get the 60 Senate votes to overcome a filibuster. Again, lawmakers claim credit while shifting blame: Supporters of the Reins Act can assert they fought burdensome regulations while avoiding responsibility for votes on specific regulatory protections that many constituents want.Members of Congress willing to shoulder responsibility should change the bill\u2019s title to the Responsibility for Regulation Act and make substantive changes so the bill is pro-responsibility rather than antiregulation. To start, the statute should apply to major regulations that reduce protection as well as to those that add costs.As a candidate, Mr. Trump said he supported the Reins Act. As president, he told Congress he wants to reform regulation and work with Democrats. If he reaches across the aisle for an alternative to the Reins Act, he might be able to keep his promise.Mr. Schoenbrod, a professor at New York Law School, is the author of \u201cDC Confidential: Inside the Five Tricks of Washington\u201d (Encounter, 2017).", "news_time": "2017-06-18 17:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/only-congress-can-undo-its-regulatory-mess-1497821745", "news_title": "Only Congress Can Undo Its Regulatory Mess", "keywords": " deregulation, epa, regulation, reins act, rule making,rule of law,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Europe in 2017 is racked with uncertainty\u2014the eurozone crises, the endless challenges of the European Union, national elections that resemble endless rounds of bullet-dodging. Yet even these events are insignificant compared with the deep tectonic shifts beneath the Continent\u2019s politics, shifts that Europeans\u2014and their allies\u2014ignore at our peril.Throughout the migration crisis of recent years I traveled across the Continent, from the reception islands into which migrants arrive to the suburbs in which they end up and the chancelleries which encouraged them to come. For decades Europe had encouraged guest workers, and then their families, to come. As Germany\u2019s Chancellor       Angela Merkel       once admitted, nobody expected them to stay.Yet stay they did, with their numbers swelling even when there were no jobs. Waking up to the results of their policy, European societies rebranded themselves \u201cmulticultural\u201d societies, only to begin wondering what that meant. Could a multicultural society make any demands of its newcomers? Or would that be \u201cracist\u201d?From the 2000s legal and illegal immigration picked up. Boats regularly set out from Turkey and North Africa to enter Europe illegally. Syrians fleeing civil war pushed into the Continent, soon joined by people from across sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, the Middle East and Far East.Today the great migration is off the front pages. Yet it goes on. On an average weekend nearly 10,000 people arrive on Italian reception islands alone. Where do they go? What do they expect? And what do we expect of them?To find the answer to these and other questions it is necessary to ask deeper questions. Why did Europe decide it could take in the poor and dispossessed of the world? Why did we decide that anybody in the world fleeing war, or just seeking a better life, could come to Europe and call it home?The reasons lie partly in our history, not least in the overwhelming German guilt, which has spread across the Continent and affected even our cultural cousins in America and Australia. Egged on by those who wish us ill, we have fallen for the idea that we are uniquely guilty, uniquely to be punished, and uniquely in need of having our societies changed as a result.There is also, for Europe, the sense of what I call tiredness\u2014the feeling that the story might have run out: that we have tried religion, all imaginable forms of politics, and that each has, one after another, led us to disaster. When we taint every idea we touch, perhaps a change is as good as a rest.It is often argued that our societies are old, with a graying population, and so we need immigrants. When these theories are challenged\u2014by asking, for instance, why the next generation of Germany\u2019s workforce might not come from unemployed Greece rather than Eritrea\u2014we are told that we need low-skilled workers who do not speak our languages because it makes Europe more culturally interesting. It is as though some great hole lies at the heart of the culture of Dante, Bach and Wren.When people point out the downsides of this approach\u2014not least that more immigration from Muslim countries produces many problems, including terrorism\u2014we get the final explanation. It doesn\u2019t matter, we are told: Because of globalization this is inevitable and we can\u2019t stop it anyway.All these instincts, when put together, are the stuff of suicide. They spell out the self-annihilation of a culture as well as a continent. Conversations with European policy makers and politicians have made this abundantly clear to me. They tell me with fury that it \u201cmust\u201d work. I suggest that with population change of this kind, at this speed, it may not work at all.Yet still it is possible that the publics will not go along with the instincts of their leaders. Earlier this year, a poll of European attitudes was published in which citizens of 10 countries were asked a tough question: whether they agreed that there should be no more Muslim migration into their countries.

But adapting the German system for the U.S. is little more than a dream.Over half of young Germans enter apprenticeships, which can lead to certification in more than 300 different careers. Many are blue-collar jobs ranging from construction to baking, but apprenticeships also cover white-collar fields like information technology and engineering.An apprenticeship generally involves two to three years of work and study after secondary school. In Germany\u2019s \u201cdual system,\u201d apprentices work on the job for three or four days a week and spend the rest of the time in academic instruction paid for by the government. This setup has been shown to ease a student\u2019s transition into work. Openings in apprenticeships are based on employers\u2019 demands for workers, and youths who\u2019ve earned a vocational certificate are readily hirable.But this comes at a cost. Workers enter the job market with skills that often become obsolete as industries change. The early-career advantage is offset by disadvantages later in life. Research shows that after age 50 German workers with general education do better than vocationally trained ones, many of whom leave the workforce.Germany and the European Union recognize the need to retrain people whose earlier skills become obsolete. There are continuous calls for \u201clifelong learning.\u201d Unfortunately, governments have not figured out effective ways to retrain older workers, and companies often don\u2019t see the advantage of doing so. Training over the course of a career is significantly more prevalent among workers with a general education.Moreover, the U.S. cannot quickly replicate Germany\u2019s deep history of apprenticeships. The German system builds on a half-century of employer experience, on national standards, and on a relatively rigid labor market that relies on certification as a hiring credential.By contrast the U.S. has retreated from vocational education. In high schools, it has morphed into an alternative way to teach basic skills such as math and reading and to motivate students not doing well in the general curriculum. The move toward broad standards and accountability via test scores hasn\u2019t helped vocational education either.Community colleges might provide something like the mixture of education and training found in the German system, but they have not developed serious relationships with industry. The construction trades have found some success with apprenticeships, but this has not been replicated for white-collar jobs. And skill certification is much less important in the U.S. labor market than in the German market.Even if the U.S. succeeded in expanding apprenticeships, the problem of skill obsolescence remains. The American model of providing vocational training to those who do not like or do not do well in the general curriculum does not augur well for adaptation when new skills are required.Employers like the idea of vocational training because it could reduce the demands on them to train new workers. But when the skills they need change, they also may find it easier simply to return to the entry-level market rather than retrain their existing workforce.The largest problem of skills in the U.S. today isn\u2019t a shortage of young workers with specific competencies. Instead it is a need for more general cognitive skills that give workers the ability to adapt to new circumstances and new jobs. In that area, American schools are not competitive with their international competitors\u2014and more apprenticeships won\u2019t help.Mr. Hanushek is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 17:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-style-apprenticeships-simply-cant-be-replicated-1497821588", "news_title": "German-Style Apprenticeships Simply Can\u2019t Be Replicated", "keywords": "apprentice, business, germany, training, trump, vocational education,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "From \u201cFree Speech, the Goose, and the Gander\u201d by lawyer Ken White on his Popehat blog, June\u00a017:Last night a popular alt-right troll disrupted a controversial modern production of       Julius Caesar       staged with a Trumplike figure in the lead role. .\u00a0.\u00a0.The \u201ceye for an eye\u201d theory of respecting free speech is particularly pernicious because it represents the worst sort of collectivism, something the principled Right ought reject.

But there is another cost: The U.S. has become reliant on China and other foreign countries for parts and materials critical to the military. As Defense Department officials told The Wall Street Journal last year, the U.S. relies on an Abu Dhabi-owned company, Globalfoundries Inc., to supply critical microchips used in U.S. spy satellites, missiles and combat jets. (All is not lost: Globalfoundries still makes the chips at plants in the U.S.) Asian countries are dominant suppliers of other high-tech essentials, including telecom equipment and advanced batteries. Though Americans invented many of the marvels that power our world, the U.S. no longer has the capacity to make some of them, and re-creating that capacity would take years.Victoria Bruce\u2019s \u201cSellout\u201d calls attention to this problem by focusing on so-called rare-earth elements\u2014such as praseodymium, neodymium and gadolinium\u2014found in varying quantities throughout the world. They are used in magnets, batteries and other high-tech products, playing an important role in military hardware as well as consumer products. China, she notes, has a near global monopoly on processing them for use in manufacturing. It \u201ccould shut down exports on a whim and ultimately cripple the U.S. Armed Forces.\u201dMs. Bruce, a journalist and documentary filmmaker who was trained as a geologist, builds her case around Jim Kennedy, a Missourian who, as we learn, nearly flunked out of high school and then rebounded to study business at Washington University in St. Louis. He worked for his father\u2019s fund-management firm and eventually bought a hunting-and-fishing lodge in the St. Francois Mountains of southeast Missouri. The lodge was near a dormant iron-ore mine. Mr. Kennedy bought the mine, then discovered that it was loaded with rare-earth elements. He began looking for ways to exploit them.By Victoria Bruce  Bloomsbury, 288 pages, $28He smacked into a huge obstacle: The rare earths were mixed up with thorium, and disposing of this radioactive material would be, for regulatory reasons, prohibitively expensive. Then he discovered that in the 1960s the U.S. government\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Tennessee, had developed plans for a nuclear reactor that would use thorium. Proponents of such reactors have long said that they would be far safer than the plants we have today. Mr. Kennedy was appalled to find that the government shelved the thorium-reactor project in the late 1960s\u2014and that China in recent years had ramped up its research into thorium reactors, drawing partly on U.S. expertise. Hence Ms. Bruce\u2019s strident claim, in her book\u2019s subtitle, that Washington \u201cgave away America\u2019s technological soul.\u201dMr. Kennedy and several allies spent years trying to persuade Congress and federal authorities to revive the thorium-reactor project and to create a cooperative\u2014a private-public consortium of sorts\u2014to rebuild America\u2019s capacity for processing rare-earth elements. They got the brush-off.Ms. Bruce suggests that Mr. Kennedy\u2019s plan is essential to any revival of U.S. manufacturing\u2014a stretch. Indeed, \u201cSellout\u201d is more a polemic than a sober examination of both sides of these matters. Ms. Bruce appears to regard Mr. Kennedy as a sage with the answers for whatever ails America. She describes him as a \u201crebel intellectual\u201d who is funny, \u201csuper smart\u201d and possessed of \u201cboyish good looks.\u201d Those who support his ideas are depicted as patriots and geniuses; those who disagree, as fools or knaves.The questions that Ms. Bruce raises, though, are vital. Three decades ago, the U.S. was a major maker of so-called permanent magnets, which contain rare earths and are used in weapons and car parts, among other things. Magnequench, a one-time division of General Motors, developed some of these magnets but was sold in 1995 to a group of investors that included two Chinese firms. The investor group later shut down Magnequench\u2019s plant in Indiana. In general, while U.S. entrepreneurs and lawmakers showed scant interest in rare-earth processing, China made it a priority.Mr. Kennedy blames the decline of American manufacturing on free trade and on the government\u2019s failure to back the industries he considers critical. Whatever the merits of his particular claims, policy may well be part of the problem. Ms. Bruce notes that Congress seems more interested in requiring the military to buy domestically produced sneakers than U.S.-made missile parts. But the challenge is much bigger than that. If we want to revive manufacturing, we\u2019ll need to rethink policies on education, taxes and regulation, aiming to encourage more investment in factories of many kinds.The U.S. was magnificent at manufacturing when we needed to be, mobilizing the nation to make airplanes and tanks to win World War II. After the war, though, we squandered our world-beating abilities\u2014partly through complacency and partly through a preference for the individualistic arts of design and marketing over the organizational and technical disciplines of manufacturing.Rather than taking a broader look, Ms. Bruce burdens us with too much about Mr. Kennedy\u2019s personal life and meanders through too many digressions. At one point, we get the history of lead mining in Missouri since 1723, followed by a discussion of Cornish miners\u2019 lingo and lunch habits. And the prose can get purplish: \u201cMore than three billion years before a recycled collection of atoms became Jim Kennedy, during the earth\u2019s pre-Cambrian period, the area that is southeastern Missouri began writing its geologic story.\u201d Despite such flaws, \u201cSellout\u201d mines an important topic: the national-security risks arising from our loss of industrial expertise and manufacturing capacity.Mr. Hagerty is a Pittsburgh-based staff reporter for The Wall Street Journal.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 17:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/outsourcing-our-security-1497821442", "news_title": "Outsourcing Our Security", "keywords": "book review,contracts,orders,corporate,industrial news,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews,basic materials,resources,industrial electronics,industrial goods,mining,quarrying,technology"}, {"content": "A small autonomous-cars company owned by             General Motors Co.        GM 0.11%       is getting into the high-definition mapping business, a move that could help the Detroit auto giant compete with Google and others in the race to develop self-driving vehicles.Cruise Automation, the San Francisco startup GM bought last year,\u00a0is recruiting a leader for a fledgling mapping unit, according to the company\u2019s website. The role involves overseeing a fleet of mapping vehicles, collection of data needed to lower dependence on human drivers and the creation of \u201cprocesses that will eventually scale mapping to 100+ cities.\u201dThe move is part of an aggressive\u00a0expansion of Cruise, which GM acquired to help it combat             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google car project and other Silicon Valley companies looking to edge in on the auto business.Cruise is also recruiting a head of mergers and acquisitions charged with scouting out potential investments. The M&A leader will look for business targets as well as \u201cacqui-hire opportunities,\u201d a Silicon Valley term for recruiting talent.A GM spokesman, authorized to speak for Cruise, declined to comment on the moves.Currently employing more than 150 people, Cruise has begun rapid growth since GM acquired it in 2016. A new San Francisco headquarters being constructed for Cruise could add 1,100 employees over five years.GM is the No. 1 U.S. car seller, but is far behind Google\u2019s mapping efforts.Google\u2019s car project, now called Waymo, is expected to be a beneficiary of the tech giant\u2019s solid position in high-definition maps. The mapping advantage has given Alphabet\u2019s various business units an advantage over             Apple Inc.       and other companies competing in other business sectors.GM isn\u2019t the only auto maker playing catch-up in HD maps.             BMW AG      , Mercedes-Benz-parent         Daimler AG       and             Volkswagen AG\u2019sAudi                   recently grouped together to buyNokia Corp.\u2019s       mapping service in 2015 for more than $3 billion.Intel Corp.      , eager to catch up with competitor             Nvidia                   in the autonomous-car market, announced a deal earlier this year to acquire a 15% stake in the map company as well. Intel is in the process of closing its $15 billion purchase of             Mobileye                   NV, an Israeli supplier of cameras and software for autonomous driving functions.Keeping pace with Google has proven difficult.When Apple tried to catch up with Google with its own maps, it stumbled out of the gate with a glitchy\u00a0product that Chief Executive       Tim Cook       ultimately ended up apologizing for to users in 2012. Apple since spent years trying to improve its maps.Uber Technologies Inc. also has been working on maps, especially after it became increasingly concerned about the threat of Google\u2019s self-driving robot taxis.GM ultimately may have an advantage that Google didn\u2019t have when its map program began years ago: a fleet of cars on the road. Last year, GM announced it would explore with Mobileye the use of real-time data taken from the auto maker\u2019s OnStar system to create the kinds of maps required for self-driving cars.GM sells about 10 million cars annually all over the globe, many of which are connected to OnStar.\u201cLook at how many cars GM sells\u2014it won\u2019t take much to have that data very quickly,\u201d said       Dave Sullivan,        an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based analyst for AutoPacific Inc., which consults auto makers.The efforts to develop maps at Cruise go back several years, with engineers working to develop their own in-house since about the time of the company\u2019s founding in 2013, two people familiar with the effort said. Developers felt as if they couldn\u2019t buy from third-party providers maps with the kinds of nuance they were looking for in complex urban environments, one of these people said.GM is also working to expand Cruise\u2019s specialized test fleet, with Chief Executive\u00a0      Mary Barra       saying last week that Cruise will have about 180 electric Chevrolet Bolts within a few months, up from 50. The company has been testing the cars in San Francisco, Scottsdale, Ariz., and near GM\u2019s headquarters in southeast Michigan.GM\u2019s test fleet could grow to around 300 in coming months, according to a person with familiar with the company\u2019s plans.\u00a0The test Bolts have radars and cameras, allowing them to better read the road and conditions that affect driving.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com and Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'GM Puts Mapping Effort Into High Gear.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 17:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gms-cruise-automation-wades-into-hd-mapping-to-aid-autonomous-car-efforts-1497813863", "news_title": "GM\u2019s Cruise Automation Wades Into HD Mapping to Aid Autonomous-Car Efforts ", "keywords": "autonomous cars,cruise automation,high-definition mapping,self-driving vehicles,General Motors,GM,Alphabet Inc.

Now they are making inroads in the New Jersey suburbs.Co-working startup Vi Coworking LLC opened a site in June at a redevelopment project at Fort Monmouth, after finding success with a 5,000-square-foot co-working space it launched a little over a year ago at the Bell Works redevelopment in Holmdel.Hugo Neu Corp., meanwhile, launched a 5,000-square-foot space at its commercial redevelopment project at Kearny Point last summer\u2014and has since doubled the size.\u201cThe demand is stronger than we thought,\u201d said Nick Shears, director of leasing at Hugo Neu. \u201cWe would get people looking for traditional office space and saw the co-working space and said, \u2018This is better because I am not ready to commit on a multiyear lease.\u2019\u201dCo-working spaces, which offer short-term commitments, are often associated with the technology and startup worlds, emphasizing community and a more casual office setting that sometimes comes with free beer and ping pong. Those in the suburbs vary, offering a more subdued d\u00e9cor and setting geared toward somewhat older professionals, but sharing an emphasis on networking.The rise of the suburban shared-office facility, typically under 15,000 square feet in New Jersey, has been fed by a growing number of independent workers, said co-working operators, real estate developers and brokers. Many of them are leaving the corporate world to strike out on their own, eliminating a long commute and establishing more of a balance between personal and work life, said the experts.Larger companies also are fueling demand, using these facilities as spots to allow valued employees a flexible work option close to home. About half of the customers using co-working provider Serendipty Labs Inc. work for established companies, said Chief Executive John Arenas. Serendipity, which operates a number of facilities around the U.S., opened locations in Ridgewood, N.J., and Stamford, Conn., last year and has franchise sites under development.\u201cWorkplace strategy at companies has become much more sophisticated in the last three to four years,\u201d Mr. Arenas said. \u201cAs companies try to retain top talent and support mobility, they have taken a hard look at third-party space providers.\u201dThe Sparta, N.J., location of C3Workplace LLC, opened in 2013, draws a combination of business owners and commuting professionals who are at a level at their companies to justify having an office near their home, said Donna Miller, president of C3Workplace, which also has a co-working site in Montclair.\u201cMany of my clients are in the sandwich generation, where they are taking care of children and aging parents,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big load to carry so you have to be close to home and change things up on the fly.\u201dWhile there is some skepticism that the co-working trend will last, some landlords are embracing it as a way to give life to their buildings and help incubate firms that eventually will lease office space at other of their properties. That was part of Vi Coworking\u2019s pitch to Somerset Development LLC, the company behind the Bell Works redevelopment, said Chris Pall\u00e9, Vi\u2019s co-founder.In the year since its Bell Works launch, Vi\u2019s co-working space has had one of its clients, a video technology startup called Vydia Inc., more than double its workforce and sign a lease for longer-term space in the complex. Vydia Chief Executive Roy LaManna said he credits co-working for helping it attract technology employees.Somerset is about to launch a second co-working space called Design Lab to bring together professionals in different fields focused on design.\u201cWe look at Vi and Design Lab as incubators and feeders bringing vitality and life on an evolving and continuing basis to Bell Works, so the value to us goes beyond the actual cost per square foot and income,\u201d said Ralph Zucker, Somerset\u2019s president. \u201cWe look at those dollars also as marketing dollars creating a building amenity.\u201dWrite to Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Co-Working Comes to New Jersey.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 16:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/co-working-spaces-spread-to-the-suburbs-1497790800", "news_title": "Co-Working Spaces Spread to the Suburbs", "keywords": "3cworkplace,bell works,chris palle,cowork, coworking,design lab,donna miller, fort monmouth,new jersey,ralph zucker,serendipity,somerset, suburbs, urban space, vi coworking,vydia,wework. hugo neu,Hugo Neu,Vi Coworking,economic performance,indicators,economic news,real estate markets,political,general news,real estate,property,primary metals,real estate transactions,basic materials,resources,commercial,industrial real estate,construction"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The marital debate that riveted Omaha Democrats has ended peacefully.In Nebraska\u2019s second district, former Democratic Rep.

Driving the interest is a desire on the part of individuals to spend and invest in ways that are consistent with their values. Data also show that socially responsible investments can outperform over the long run; since 1990, the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index has returned an average of 8.4% a year, versus 7.6% for the S&P 500 index.\u201cThere is a fair amount of evidence from investor surveys that millennials and women are especially interested in sustainable and impact investing,\u201d says       Jon Hale,        director of sustainability-investing research at Morningstar Inc.

An investor\u2019s answers determine which of several portfolios a service recommends. The services generally offer periodic rebalancing of investments to adhere to an investor\u2019s desired asset allocation and tax-loss harvesting, a strategy of selling investments that have gone down in price to book losses that may offset taxable gains on other holdings.Some also give investors the option to contact an adviser. TIAA, for example, includes financial advice in the 0.3%-of-assets fee for its new service, dubbed Personal Portfolio. If a client has complex planning needs, TIAA consultants can \u201ccreate a plan at no additional charge and with no obligation,\u201d says a spokeswoman. Other services, in contrast, are fully automated or simply provide help-desk assistance on the mechanics of opening the account.Despite the head start of startups including Betterment and Wealthfront, the robo field is now dominated by traditional financial-services companies. The two biggest players are Vanguard Group, which had $65 billion in assets in its Personal Advisor Services as of March 31, and             Charles Schwab Corp.      , with $16 billion in its Intelligent Portfolios service. Vanguard currently offers one socially responsible fund within a robo\u2014the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund\u2014but has no imminent plans to introduce others; Schwab has no such fund in its robos.Before signing on, it is important to consider the fees. Many of these services charge from 0.45% to 1% or more for advisory services and investment fees. That is generally higher than the 0.3% to 0.5% that is typical of many established robo services.It is also important to understand the investing approach and services.\u201cIn the old days, socially responsible investing was mostly used by religious organizations that wanted to exclude stocks of certain companies or industries that violated their principles,\u201d including alcohol and tobacco firms, says       Greg Wait,        president of Prophecy Impact Investments LLC, a robo featuring socially responsible investing that made its debut in January.Now, Mr. Wait says, managers of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that take a socially responsible approach typically look for companies that \u201cproactively adopt positive policies,\u201d such as using renewable energy, promoting women or paying above-average wages.Most of the new robos use socially responsible ETFs and mutual funds. Wealthsimple, a Canadian robo-adviser that introduced a service in the U.S. in January, uses six ETFs from companies including             State Street                   Global Advisors, Invesco Ltd. subsidiary PowerShares Capital Management LLC and             BlackRock Inc.       that favor companies that promote women, use clean technologies and demonstrate community engagement, among other factors. Others use a mix of active and passive funds. Prophecy Impact Investments builds its portfolios with mutual funds from companies specializing in socially responsible investing including Domini Impact Investments LLC, Calvert Research & Management and Pax World Investments.Others give clients the flexibility to buy or avoid specific stocks. OpenInvest, a San Francisco-based company that launched a robo adviser that takes a socially responsible approach in September, lets investors choose from among 10 investment \u201cthemes,\u201d including climate change, supporting women in the workplace and divesting from weapons makers, among others.It also allows investors to add or remove specific stocks. For example, some clients dumped United Airlines Inc. in the wake of its decision to forcibly remove a passenger after overbooking a flight, says OpenInvest co-founder       Josh Levin.       OpenInvest automatically rebalances the portfolio to ensure the client remains diversified and broadly tracking the market.Write to Anne Tergesen at anne.tergesen@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Bots Grow More Socially Responsible.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 16:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/robo-advisers-latest-foray-socially-responsible-investing-1497697212", "news_title": "Robo Advisers\u2019 Latest Foray: Socially Responsible Investing", "keywords": "investors,millenials,robo advisors,socially responsible investments,Wealthfront,Vanguard Group,BlackRock,BLK,Invesco,IVZ,Betterment,United Airlines,Morgan Stanley,MS,Charles Schwab,SCHW,State Street,STT,Corporate Insight,Pax World Investments,Prophecy Impact Investments,TIAA,Wealthsimple,Calvert Research & Management,Joe Ziemer,Jon Hale,Sean McDermott,Greg Wait,Josh Levin,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,corporate social responsibility,political,general news,personal investments in stocks,personal finance,personal investments,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,unit trusts,mutual funds,financial investments,alternative investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,sustainable investment,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "Legg Mason is emerging as a somewhat unexpected winner in the asset manager shake-up. For investor enthusiasm to continue, it needs to show that its growth bets will pay off.So far this year, investors have pulled tens of billions of dollars from actively managed mutual funds in favor of low-cost exchange-traded funds. This has hit some of Legg Mason\u2019s rivals, such as             Franklin Resources,        BEN 0.71%       AllianceBernstein, and many midsize asset managers.But Legg Mason has recently enjoyed decent inflows, thanks to diversification across both asset classes and investment vehicles. In the three months through March it saw $3.9 billion of net inflows led by its fixed-income specialist Western Asset Management, active equity manager ClearBridge Investments and U.K.-based Martin Currie.Importantly, Legg Mason says only around half of its U.S. retail sales last fiscal year were in the form of traditional mutual funds. Much of the rest went into separately managed accounts, a lower-cost personalized offering for individual investors.The company\u2019s new suite of \u201csmart-beta\u201d ETFs have gotten only modest traction, with around $200 million under management at the end of May. Speaking at an analyst event on Thursday, Chief Executive       Joseph Sullivan       said two institutional investors have notified the company they intend to invest around $450 million in those ETFs. Some $250 million of this is being reallocated from another Legg Mason vehicle, so it isn\u2019t a net new inflow. But it does, as Mr. Sullivan noted, underscore \u201cthe importance of vehicle choice\u201d in retaining client funds.Legg Mason also is benefiting from rivals\u2019 pain.       Thomas Hoops,        Legg Mason\u2019s head of business development, said at the same event that an unspecified large distributor recently eliminated 20% of the asset managers on its platform and sharply reduced allocations for many others.\u00a0But Legg Mason was relatively unscathed, losing just 1% of its assets with this distributor, he said.Still, it isn\u2019t all blue skies from here. The company talks a lot about its ETF offerings, but is still absolutely tiny compared to rivals like BlackRock,             State Street                   and Invesco.\u00a0 It is making a big bet on developing a whole new category of nontransparent, actively managed ETFs-\u2014a concept that doesn\u2019t yet have regulatory approval and won\u2019t necessarily be popular if it does get the nod.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.As part of its diversification drive, Legg Mason also recently acquired a robo adviser and an alternative asset manager.Investors already are giving Legg Mason credit for its relative success. Its own shares are up by 33% so far this year. At 14 times forward earnings, its shares now trade at a slight premium to peers. Four other large asset managers, excluding investor darling BlackRock, are valued at 13.4 times, having risen an average 6% this year.For Legg Mason to continue that kind of outperformance, \u00a0it needs to do more than just tread water while rivals drown.Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Legg Mason Must Build on Healthy Start.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 16:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/legg-mason-a-survivor-in-the-active-manager-massacre-1497817231", "news_title": "Legg Mason: A Survivor in the Active-Manager Massacre   ", "keywords": "actively managed mutual funds,asset managers,etfs,exchange traded funds,Franklin Resources,BEN,Invesco,Legg Mason,LM,AllianceBernstein Holding,AB,BlackRock,BLK,State Street,STT,Joseph Sullivan,Thomas Hoops,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,personal investments,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,financial investments,educational services,professional,management training,business,consumer services,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "The Senate and House intelligence committees are set\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0to hold two open hearings examining Russian hacking efforts during the 2016 election, featuring testimony from current and former Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials as well as state election directors.Steve Sandvoss,        the executive director of the Illinois State Board of Elections, is expected to walk the Senate committee through a cyberattack last July that allowed hackers to breach a database of up to 200,000 personal voter records.The board informed the state attorney general\u2019s office of the cyberattack. The board was subsequently contacted by the FBI, but the agency hasn\u2019t informed the board who was responsible for the attack, according to       Ken Menzel,        the board\u2019s general counsel.An information-technology report to the board in August said the FBI was \u201chighly confident\u201d that no voter data had been altered.The Senate committee will hear testimony from       J. Alex Halderman,        a Michigan computer scientist who helped lead a push last year for an examination of paper ballots and electronic voting machines in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan to conclusively prove that hackers hadn\u2019t manipulated the results. A series of legal rulings ultimately halted some of the recount efforts, while others were completed and found no widespread irregularities.The hearings represent the most robust effort to date to elicit public testimony from state election officials concerning what federal officials have described as an aggressive and sustained effort by Russia to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.Special counsel       Robert Mueller       is investigating whether campaign advisers to President       Donald Trump       had ties to the Russian activities, a probe that has expanded to include whether the president obstructed justice by trying to influence its outcome, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Russia has denied the allegations. On Sunday, a personal lawyer for Mr. Trump, who has called the investigations a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d denied that the president was under investigation.States are also examining their own systems. A survey by The Wall Street Journal of election officials in nearly 50 states found many continue to participate in a DHS program of periodic checks of their election systems for any vulnerabilities. Many officials had been in touch with the FBI before the election, when the bureau had provided states with a list of suspicious IP addresses.The North Carolina State Board of Elections\u2019 investigations unit, led by a former FBI agent, is investigating the reported attempts to compromise VR Systems Inc., a Tallahassee, Fla., firm whose electronic poll book software was used on Election Day in 21 of the state\u2019s 100 counties.The software deals with checking voters in, not with counting their votes. But on Election Day last year, that system failed in Durham County, which holds the state\u2019s most reliable Democratic voters. That forced the county to issue ballots by hand, meaning longer lines and delays\u2014factors that can often depress turnout. The county voted for Democrat       Hillary Clinton       by 77.7%, while Mr. Trump won the state with 49.8% of the vote, according to the state\u2019s board of elections.\u201cThe Republicans were claiming that this was Democratic voter fraud, but maybe the other explanation, the simplest answer, is most likely to be the correct one. Look at the Russians,\u201d said       Gerry Cohen,        former special counsel to the North Carolina legislature and an expert on state election law. \u201cIf you were trying to hurt Democrats in North Carolina, shutting down Durham\u2019s Election Day voter check-in would be your quickest and most effective\u00a0method.\u201dThe aim of the Senate hearing, according to an email sent by a committee aide to those testifying, is to \u201cgive the public an unclassified look at Russian activity in the 2016 U.S. election, as well as a look at what we are facing from an election security standpoint in 2018 and 2020.\u201dFormer Homeland Security Secretary       Jeh Johnson,        meanwhile, will testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0to discuss \u201cRussian active measures\u201d during the 2016 election.Department of Homeland Security officials have said at least 20 states were targeted during the 2016 election. Last August, the FBI issued a warning to state governments that cited the Illinois breach and a hacking attempt in Arizona. Speaking before the House Judiciary Committee in September, then-FBI Director       James Comey       said the agency\u2019s counterintelligence investigators were \u201cdoing an awful lot of work\u2026to understand just what mischief is Russia up to in connection with our election.\u201dAn FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on the agency\u2019s investigation.In early June, the website the Intercept published a top-secret National Security Agency document that said Russian military intelligence had executed a cyberattack on at least one U.S. voting software supplier in August 2016.The document also said Russian operatives had sent \u201cspear-phishing\u201d emails to more than 100 email addresses linked to local government organizations\u2014potentially including local election officials\u2014in the days preceding the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The NSA report, however, didn\u2019t draw conclusions about whether such activity had any effect on the outcome of the election.At least five counties in Florida have reported receiving the phishing emails described in the Intercept article that appeared to come from VR Systems. But none appear to have resulted in a breach of their voting systems.VR Systems this month said it had no indication that any customers had been compromised by the phishing emails and said it has \u201cpolicies and procedures in effect to protect our customers and our company.\u201dAs states undertake their own investigations of the 2016 election, DHS is weighing whether to maintain the designation of voting apparatus as \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d which gives the federal government additional authority to protect the systems, Homeland Security Secretary       John Kelly       said in testimony to the Senate Homeland Security Committee earlier this month.That decision was made by Mr. Kelly\u2019s predecessor, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Kelly testified that he has had a \u201clarge amount of pushback\u201d on the determination from states and members of Congress.Many states have expressed concern about additional federal authority over their election systems and have said the Constitution provides states the right to run their own elections.In his testimony earlier this month, Mr. Kelly said he doesn\u2019t support rolling back the designation and hopes to persuade states that they allow the federal government to be helpful on such issues. When asked about the review of the designation, a DHS official defended it, emphasizing that it allows the department to \u201cprioritize our cybersecurity assistance to election officials, for those who request it.\u201d\u201cA designation makes it easier for the federal government to have full and frank discussions with key stakeholders regarding sensitive vulnerability information,\u201d the Homeland Security official said. The official also noted that the designation creates no new regulations for states.\u2014Arian Campo-Flores, Sharon Nunn and Byron Tau contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com, Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com and Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Russia Hacking Efforts Are Set For Hearings.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 16:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-officials-to-testify-on-possible-russian-involvement-in-2016-election-1497787201", "news_title": "State Officials to Testify on Possible Russian Involvement in 2016 Election   ", "keywords": "congressional hearing,cyberattacks,cybercrimes,cybersecurity,cyber security,cyberthreat,election 2016,election 2016 hacking,presidential election hacking,russian election hacking,russian hacking,russian hacking hearing,voter fraud,Federal Bureau of Investigation,Department of Homeland Security,management,management moves,board of directors,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,department of homeland security,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014The British government sought to defend itself from accusations it hadn\u2019t done enough to prevent the deadly fire that swept through a London high-rise last week, saying the cladding that appears to have contributed to the fire\u2019s spread is already banned for use on tall buildings in the U.K.At least 58 people are presumed dead from the fire that ripped through a west London low-income residential tower, police said over the weekend, warning that the number might change as the search operation continues.Residents, who had complained for years that the building wasn\u2019t fire-safe, said the newly installed cladding may have contributed to the fire\u2019s quick spread.Asked if the government would implement a ban on the type of cladding used in Grenfell Tower, a 24-story building consumed by a blaze early\u00a0Wednesday, Treasury chief       Philip Hammond       on Sunday said: \u201cMy understanding is that the cladding in question, this flammable cladding, which is banned in Europe and the U.S., is also banned here.\u201d\u201cSo there are two separate questions. One is: Are our regulations correct, do they permit the right kind of materials, ban the wrong kind of materials?\u201d, Mr. Hammond told the British Broadcasting Corp. \u201cSecond question is: Were they correctly complied with?\u201dThese issues will be the focus of the public-inquiry order by Prime Minister       Theresa May,        as well as a criminal investigation by the police, he said.The material was a sandwich of metal panels and a common plastic known as polyethylene, according to the company that conducted the installation as part of the building\u2019s refurbishment last year.This kind of material wouldn\u2019t be compliant with current building-regulations guidance, and shouldn\u2019t be installed in buildings above 18 meters (59 feet) in height, the department for communities and local government said. It said it couldn\u2019t specifically comment on the type of cladding used on Grenfell Tower.The fire-safety rules first came into effect in 2007 and were last amended in 2013.The cladding wouldn\u2019t have met widely adopted U.S. standards, building groups said, though the material has been used in a number of high-rise buildings around the world.Robert Pontin,        a spokesman for Harley Facades Ltd., the company that installed the cladding, has previously said the company was unaware of a link between the fire and the material.The Conservative government also came under sharp criticism for not having concluded a review of fire-safety standards prompted by a 2009 fire in a high-rise in south London, which killed six people. Mr. Hammond denied an accusation that the government \u201csat\u201d on the review, which is yet to be published.\u201cThe point is, these are very complex, technical issues, and in this case technical, expert research was commissioned so that the decisions could be properly informed.\u201dProtesters on\u00a0Friday\u00a0barged into a meeting of local authorities responsible for Grenfell Tower, chanting: \u201cWe want justice!\u201d and \u201cShame on you!\u201d The building is owned by the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, a subdivision of London.Mrs. May has ordered a public inquiry into the blaze and said she had established a \u00a35 million ($6.3 million) fund to pay for emergency supplies, food, clothes and other costs, such as for funerals.The mounting pressure on the government follows a major setback in elections this month, when the ruling Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority days before the start of Brexit talks with the European Union.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 15:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-government-deals-with-aftermath-of-deadly-high-rise-fire-1497811357", "news_title": "U.K. Government Deals With Aftermath of Deadly High-Rise Fire ", "keywords": "blaze,cladding,fire,government response,grenfell tower,highrise,high rise fire,insulation,u.k. government,Harley Facades,Theresa May,political,general news,crime,legal action,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "A cyberattack last year paralyzed MedStar Health computers, forcing the Maryland operator of 10 hospitals and more than 300 outpatient centers to shut down its entire electronic-record system. Doctors logged patient details with pen and paper. Laboratory staff faced delays delivering test results.\u201cIt was three weeks before we got most of everything that was important to us on a daily basis back and operational,\u201d       Craig DeAtley,        director of the MedStar Institute for Public Health Emergency Readiness, said during a panel organized by federal health officials last year to address cyberthreats.Yet the attack\u2014and others last year at hospitals in California and Kentucky\u2014don\u2019t appear on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s public list of data breaches. The attacks involved ransomware, a type of software that locks away data until victims pay a ransom. HHS rules say hospitals need only report attacks that result in the exposure of private medical or financial information, such as malware that steals data. When ransomware\u2019s data encryption meets that threshold is a gray area.Proponents for more mandatory reporting say this regulatory gap limits the health-care system\u2019s ability to fight cybercriminals. Hospitals left in the dark about attacks hitting their rivals are less likely to be ready to defend themselves, they say.Regulators can\u2019t protect patient safety if they are unaware when hospital medical records are held for ransom, says Congressman       Ted Lieu,        a California Democrat who along with Congressmen Will Hurd, a Texas Republican, is pushing HHS to require hospitals to report ransomware attacks.\u201cI view it as a loophole that ransomware does not have to be reported,\u201d Mr. Lieu said in an interview.Opponents say HHS reporting comes with a harsh spotlight, potential penalties and liability risks.Spokeswomen for HHS didn\u2019t respond to a request to clarify the agency\u2019s position on the issue. In a report to Congress this month, an HHS-led task force of industry and public officials stopped short of calling for required disclosure of ransomware attacks. The report called for a \u201cflexible approach\u201d to sharing cybersecurity information and recommended the industry build on voluntary efforts already under way.The dilemma has grown more acute as ransomware proliferates. Two large, multistate hospital operators \u201cface significant challenges to operations\u201d from a global ransomware assault in May called WannaCry, HHS disclosed in an email to health-care executives and officials this month. The attack also halted surgeries at British hospitals, shut European auto plants and affected some U.S. medical devices.WannaCry \u201chighlighted the disturbing reality that the true state of cybersecurity risk in this sector is underreported by orders of magnitude,\u201d       Leo Scanlon,        deputy chief information security officer for HHS, said during a U.S. House hearing on cybersecurity this month.MedStar spokeswoman       Ann Nickels       declined to say whether MedStar reported the 2016 ransomware attack to HHS, and declined to specify how many patients\u2019 data were affected. HHS publicly reports breaches that expose confidential data for at least 500 people. HHS declined to comment on the attack, saying it \u201cdoes not release information about current or potential investigations.\u201dMedStar \u201cshared insights privately\u201d with other hospital operators about the attack, Ms. Nickels said. \u201cOur position all along has been that we are not making public statements about lessons learned and the specific circumstances of the malware event we handled a year ago,\u201d she said in a statement.On a Friday evening in February 2016, ransomware swiftly spread throughout Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, locking doctors and nurses out of computers,       Steve Giles,        the hospital\u2019s chief information officer, told a California senate hearing a few months later.Hollywood at first tried unsuccessfully to unlock the computers, before paying $17,000 in ransom in bitcoin. They were so unfamiliar with the digital currency they first googled \u201chow to get bitcoin,\u201d then hunted down an ATM in a vape shop to convert cash to the digital currency, he said. Criminals released 900 separate decryption codes to unlock the hospital\u2019s computers, Mr. Giles said.The attack doesn\u2019t appear on HHS\u2019s public list. The hospital didn\u2019t report it to HHS, but media reports prompted HHS to inquire about the breach, Mr. Giles said. HHS ultimately didn\u2019t require the hospital to report the attack after Hollywood officials offered evidence the ransomware didn\u2019t expose patient data, he said.A ransomware attack in March 2016 forced Methodist Hospital in Kentucky to update its website with a warning the hospital was \u201cworking in an Internal State of Emergency,\u201d according to       Randy McCleese,        who joined the hospital as chief information officer this year. Local press reported the hospital shut down its system to halt the malware\u2019s spread. An internal investigation found no patient records were compromised, Mr. McCleese said. The attack also didn\u2019t appear on the HHS list of public breaches.HHS has been taking steps toward clarifying reporting requirements. In July 2016, the agency released guidance stressing that hospitals must report ransomware attacks to the agency and patients, unless hospitals can prove confidential information remained so. Health-care attorneys said they expect that to increase reporting.Hospitals have financial and competitive incentives to avoid all but required reporting, some lawyers say. Data breaches reported to HHS require hospitals to notify everyone involved, which can be costly. And HHS investigations can lead to financial penalties. Metro Community Provider Network, a suburban Denver clinic operator, agreed to pay HHS $400,000 after hackers stole confidential records, HHS said in February. Metro Community didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Write to Melanie Evans at Melanie.Evans@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Ransomeware Is Often Unreported.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 15:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-some-of-the-worst-cyberattacks-in-health-care-go-unreported-1497814241", "news_title": "Why Some of the Worst Cyberattacks in Health Care Go Unreported", "keywords": "cyberattacks,cybersecurity,ransomware,MedStar Health,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,political,general news,crime,legal action,malware,cybercrime,hacking,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,human services department,health care,life sciences,hospital care,healthcare provision,technology"}, {"content": "BAGHDAD\u2014Iraqi forces on Sunday pushed into Mosul\u2019s historic Old City, in what is expected to be the final and most intense phase of the fight to retake the country\u2019s second-largest city from Islamic State control.The U.S.-backed offensive began soon after sunrise, with troops advancing on the Old City from three sides, Iraqi military officials said. By nightfall some units had pushed forward a few hundred yards, the military said, which can be considered a substantial gain in an urban environment.\u201cWith the blessing of God, the army, counterterrorism forces and federal police started breaking into the Old City to liberate what is left of the western side of Mosul,\u201d Lt. Gen Abdul Amir Yaralla, operations commander in Nineveh province, said in a brief statement.The fighting is expected to mark the heaviest and bloodiest stage of the monthslong fight for Mosul because the Old City district is a densely populated warren of narrow streets and alleys, which will likely require house-to-house combat to clear out the militants.\u201cFor sure Daesh is going to fight in a fierce way since this is their last place,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Abdul Ghani al-Assadi, commander of Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism force, the country\u2019s special forces, using another name for Islamic State. \u201cBut we have taken into consideration how the place is densely populated, the streets are narrow and explosive devices might be placed by the enemy.\u201dThe Iraqi military said it has given Islamic State fighters a chance to surrender via announcements by loudspeaker on the battlefield. But both Iraqi and U.S. forces have said in the past they expect the militants to keep fighting.As night fell, Lt. Gen. Jabbar al-Darraj, commander of the country\u2019s 16th division, said on state TV that he hoped Islamic State fighters would give up, and that the Iraqi troops remained ever mindful of noncombatants.\u201cWe have prepared safe corridors to receive civilians and prepared vehicles to transport civilians when we reach them,\u201d he said.The fight for Mosul began in October, with Iraqi military and Kurdish Peshmerga troops pushing through rural areas and outlying villages primarily to the east of the city. Despite casualties among the troops, they made relatively quick progress before entering the city itself.With U.S.-led coalition air support, including a new policy from Washington that allowed a more visible American troop presence on the ground and greater flexibility in air and artillery targeting, the Iraqi forces retook the east side of the city by the end of January.In February, Iraqi troops crossed the Tigris river, which splits the city in half, and began squeezing Islamic State deeper into the heart of Mosul\u2019s dense neighborhoods. Fighting slowed in recent weeks as Iraqi troops engaged in bitter street-to-street battles in the neighborhoods adjacent to the Old City.Iraqi troops struggled to advance through streets jammed with abandoned cars, booby-trapped houses and hidden Islamic State sharpshooters, while trying to avoid causing civilian casualties among the thousands of residents rounded up to be used as human shields by Islamic State.As many as 100,000 civilians remain in the Old City, according to United Nations estimates last week. Fighting has displaced more than 600,000 people just from the west side of the city, the U.N. estimates, with a large number of those pushed into camps near the city.Iraqi forces gave no timeline for concluding the operation, though officials praised its launch before the end of Islam\u2019s holiest month of Ramadan.\u201cThese are blessed days, these are the last 10 days of Ramadan and we hope to achieve victory,\u201d said Abdulwahab al-Taee, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, in a statement.Write to Ben Kesling at benjamin.kesling@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Iraqi Forces Push to Retake Mosul.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 15:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraqi-troops-press-into-mosuls-old-city-to-dislodge-isis-1497774518", "news_title": "Iraqi Troops Press Into Mosul\u2019s Old City to Dislodge ISIS", "keywords": " iraq, isis, islamic state,mosul,political,general news,national,public security,risk news,military action"}, {"content": "Israel has been regularly supplying Syrian rebels near its border with cash as well as food, fuel and medical supplies for years, a secret engagement in the enemy country\u2019s civil war aimed at carving out a buffer zone populated by friendly forces.The Israeli army is in regular communication with rebel groups and its assistance includes undisclosed payments to commanders that help pay salaries of fighters and buy ammunition and weapons, according to interviews with about half a dozen Syrian fighters.

April sales fell 2.3% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million. Though demand appears to be strong, due to factors like job growth and millennials looking to buy homes, a tight supply of inventory is raising concerns.

Tribune then filed for bankruptcy, and Zell exited the reorganized company in 2011.Recently, the 75-year-old Mr. Zell, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans, and a gold bracelet, talked with Barron\u2019s about real estate and stocks, and about the real estate guy in the White House. Because the book is a love song to his refugee parents and to immigration, we asked him about that, too. Here\u2019s what he said.Barron\u2019s: You real estate guys are telling us what to do\u2014      Donald Trump       in the White House, you with your book. What grade would you give this president?Mr. Zell: An incomplete. He\u2019s learning on the job. They all do, but most of them came from a political environment. In politics, you are very sensitive about hiring and firing. In the business world, and particularly for him, firing people was a daily occurrence. His ability to say, \u201cLet\u2019s take a risk on this guy, and if we don\u2019t like him, we\u2019ll get rid of him\u201d is a very different mind-set. He should stop tweeting. Never pick a fight with somebody who buys ink by the barrel. Not that I\u2019m a great fan of the press, but I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s a long-term positive in taking on the people whose job it is to cover you. The strength of our society is predicated on respect for his office. That\u2019s missing right now.Barron\u2019s: Yet you\u2019ve been optimistic about his administration\u2019s ability to stoke growth.Mr. Zell: In his first year, President       Barack Obama       spent a trillion dollars on a stimulus bill, which achieved nothing other than almost a trillion dollars of debt that is now worth more than that. Trump has a unique opportunity to create stimulus by deregulation. He has already rolled back the rule about navigable waters [which extended the reach of federal water regulations]. One change that would help small businesses is to modify Dodd-Frank, reduce the unrealistic compliance costs for small banks, so that lending is more readily available. Another is to roll back excessive environmental legislation. I worry about too much capacity. If you double the size of the Environmental Protection Agency, you then have a whole bunch of people thinking up new regulations to keep busy.Barron\u2019s: Last year, you predicted a recession for 2017. Then you walked back that prediction.Mr. Zell: Another Democratic administration would have led to a recession. Trump\u2019s election gave us extra innings because there\u2019s more optimism in the business sector. Smaller businesses were basically destroyed by the Obama administration. Compliance was a giant animal that gobbled up everything. However, this recovery began in 2009. There aren\u2019t many examples of 10-year recoveries in U.S. history.Barron\u2019s: In 1999, you called stock prices insane. What about now?Mr. Zell: The stock market isn\u2019t a reflection of the whole. It reflects a few companies that dominate:Amazon.com at 150 times earnings, instead of XYZ regular company at six times. Back in 1999, the first thing a company did was go public. Now we have unicorns, a very sophisticated form of avoiding price detection. That changes the whole perspective. In 1999, instead of Amazon, I talked about Cisco Systems . I said that at the growth rate on which it was being valued, it would be 25% of the U.S. economy in 10 years. Well you could say the same thing about Amazon\u2014to justify 150 times earnings, you have to assume it will be 25% of the U.S. economy in 10 years. Not likely.Barron\u2019s Let\u2019s talk about real estate. Have apartment prices bottomed in New York City and San Francisco?Mr. Zell: For 20-some-odd years, our nation has built over a million single-family homes a year. In the Great Recession, it was down to 400,000. Now it\u2019s 800,000. There\u2019s a significant shortage of new single-family houses, but also a shortage of demand. That has increased demand for multifamily. Until the past 18 months, there was no new significant supply of multifamily. In 2017, the U.S. will build 387,000 multifamily units, the most since maybe the early \u201970s. It\u2019s affecting everywhere. New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., have such significant inbred demand that it will continue to balance out. I don\u2019t know about other places in the country. Miami has got as many multifamily units under construction now as before the Great Recession, except demand from Brazilians and Venezuelans has slowed because of currency depreciation and recessions in those countries. Chicago has almost unlimited land. New York and Seattle are a bunch of islands, San Francisco is a tiny little city. That isn\u2019t the case in Dallas, Houston, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., or Atlanta.Barron\u2019s: What\u2019s your view of commercial real estate today?Mr. Zell: A very significant supply is coming on. In previous periods of oversupply, new supply was added serially. This time, from the end of the Great Recession till a couple of years ago, very little office space was added. Over the past 18 months, New York added Hudson Yards, with 18 million square feet of space. Nobody has identified new demand to fill the supply. I usually have an optimistic answer. This time, I don\u2019t have one.Barron\u2019s: How about retail and malls?Mr. Zell: Never has quality been more relevant. Slowly but surely, the dominant real estate investment trusts or shopping malls are being converted into mini-downtowns. The dominant malls\u2014such as in Short Hills, N.J., or Stamford, Conn.\u2014will be fine. The corner efficiency strip malls, which have supermarkets, will also do OK. But everything in between, like the big box retailers, is increasingly obsolete. There aren\u2019t enough megachurches to fill them. We are overstored, and then you bring in the internet.Barron\u2019s: Let\u2019s talk about an equally traumatized industry\u2014newspapers. You had a painful experience with Tribune. Now,             New York Times                   stock is up 63% since November. Would you do Tribune all over again?Mr. Zell: Just like in real estate, barriers to access are so critical. If tomorrow you started a blog and were clever enough and wanted to compete with the New York Times, you could. Lots of people have done it and been very effective. Long term, that will affect the margins of media companies. I doubt I would want to buy a newspaper company today. But if I had the same set of facts in front of me now as I did then, I would do the Tribune deal again. Is there some other way I could have communicated how dire the circumstances were and gotten leadership and employees to support it, rather than fight it? Maybe. I didn\u2019t succeed.Barron\u2019s: What\u2019s in your personal portfolio?Mr. Zell: Probably 30% real estate, 70% non real estate. I\u2019m not a stock market or hedge fund investor particularly. I do a lot of private equity, probably 20% of the portfolio.Barron\u2019s: What\u2019s a better investment, high-quality REITs or private real estate through a fund that uses leverage?Mr. Zell: Liquidity equals value. I\u2019ve been the leader of the equitization of the real estate industry over the past 25 years. In 2009,       David Simon       [CEO of Simon Property Group (SPG)] sold a bond issue and equity and achieved the liquidity to survive and to lead at the top. Even in recession, REITs have access to capital\u2014something private real estate does not. REITs offer stability, transparency, liquidity, and a stable dividend. Private real estate offers higher returns for higher risk.Barron\u2019s: What big social themes will affect the markets?Mr. Zell: Deferral of marriage is one. When I graduated college, I got married 10 days later, and a year later, 95% of the people around me were married and had moved to Tic-Tac-Ville. Forty years ago,             Motorola                   built a campus in Chicago\u2019s northwest suburbs. They hired engineers out of school who bought single-family homes nearby. That campus now is empty. When Equity Residential went public in 1993, our portfolio was all garden apartments in the suburbs. Today, it is all high-rises in 24/7 cities. Today\u2019s graduates don\u2019t even think of getting married until their late 20s, early 30s. They want urban living in 24/7 cities. They want optionality. That doesn\u2019t just impact real estate; it\u2019s eight more years of disposable income and social networking. Social networks have opened more eyes to what\u2019s out there, and the more people open their eyes, the less they are willing to commit.Barron\u2019s: You\u2019ve been a fan of high-quality cannabis. Have you invested in this theme?Mr. Zell: I haven\u2019t. Our laws around cannabis are crazy and should have been changed a long time ago. Cannabis creates a lot of attention, and who I am makes me an immediate target of attention. I don\u2019t think mixing the two is a good thing.Barron\u2019s: Your book is a love song to immigration. What\u2019s your view of today\u2019s rhetoric?Mr. Zell: We know what happens to an anti-immigration society. Japan is being emptied out. If you don\u2019t propagate, and don\u2019t immigrate, you shrivel. The enormous growth of this country was built on immigration and the mental set of an immigrant. My parents each had six siblings. They pleaded with them to leave Poland [before World War II]. They turned them down.Immigrants are the ultimate consumers of what we\u2019ve historically sold: freedom. Maybe 75% would use their freedom to watch TV. But the rest would start a business and work 20 hours a day, instead of 10. Our immigration policy needs to encourage people like this who are contributors. We need to encourage the students who come to our universities to stay here.Am I being too subtle? You may not agree with me, but nobody should walk out of the room and say, \u201cWhat do you think he meant?\u201dWrite to Leslie Norton at leslie.norton@barrons.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 15:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-zell-speaks-his-mind-1497812419", "news_title": "Sam Zell Speaks His Mind", "keywords": "Equity Residential,EQR,Equity Office Properties Trust,Equity Commonwealth,EQC,Anixter International,AXE,Tribune ,TRCO,TRBAA,tronc,TRNC,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,corporate restructuring,wires,cables,printing,publishing,newspaper publishing,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,closed-end funds,investment trusts,real estate investment trusts,real estate,construction,financial services,industrial,office reits,industrial goods,investing,securities,media,entertainment,residential reits"}, {"content": "For months, as millions of New Yorkers descended into the subway braving spiraling delays and nightmarish commutes, Mayor       Bill de Blasio       was talking ferries.As mayor, Mr. de Blasio doesn\u2019t control the subway system. Governor       Andrew Cuomo,        a fellow Democrat who oversees the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, does\u2014a fact the mayor is fond of noting.Recently, New Yorkers have endured tens of thousands of delays, including one that left passengers on an F train trapped underground for nearly an hour without air conditioning.For the mayor, the ordeal may have been a tipping point. In the days since, he has been a louder advocate for subway riders, saying he would step in with a plan of his own if the MTA doesn\u2019t confront the issue.\u201cThere\u2019s a crisis right now on our subways and it has to be addressed,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said Thursday during an unrelated news conference.Until recently, the mayor has said relatively little about the subways.Instead, he largely had focused on the transit alternatives within his control: The city\u2019s new ferry system, a light-rail initiative planned for Brooklyn and Queens, and an express-bus service the mayor has described as \u201ca real workhorse\u201d for commuters.\u201cWe need to first think about the things we can do right now,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said earlier this month.While transit advocates mostly have praised Mr. de Blasio\u2019s initiatives, they contend there are no replacements for a working subway system. According to city estimates, for example, the new ferries will carry 500,000 passengers in a year. Nearly six million people ride the subway every day.Mr. de Blasio, some say, should be using the mayoral bully pulpit to champion for subway riders, as well. In a nod to that criticism, the mayor has said he would do more to advocate for frustrated straphangers. This week, he rode a C train in a show of solidarity. Two crowded trains came and went before he found one with room to board.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to be in control of the subways to be an advocate for the subways,\u201d said       Mitchell Moss,        Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University.The century-old subway system is straining to keep up with record-high ridership and decades of underfunding. Its aging infrastructure and signal systems have driven delays up sharply in recent years.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo said the city should contribute more money to the MTA. \u201cThe best way the mayor could help is by paying his fair share of capital and operating expenses\u2014that would directly improve service for riders,\u201d said       Dani Lever,        the spokeswoman.Mr. de Blasio has committed $2.5 billion to the MTA\u2019s five-year, roughly $30 billion capital plan, while the state has said it would contribute $8.3 billion. The plan includes funding for suburban projects, as well as New York City. Transit advocates and experts say the budget in general falls far short of what is needed to make the critical upgrades the subway system requires.The mayor doesn\u2019t take the subway regularly. He is driven most mornings from Gracie Mansion on the Upper East Side to work out at a gym his former Park Slope neighborhood in Brooklyn, and then, to City Hall in lower Manhattan.Mr. de Blasio has tried to hammer home the message with voters that Mr. Cuomo is in charge of the subway system. It isn\u2019t easy.A NY1/City University of New York poll last month showed 33% of voters blamed the mayor for the subway\u2019s issues, while 31% blamed the governor; 32% weren\u2019t sure who was at fault.John Raskin,        executive director of the Riders Alliance, a transit-advocacy group, said it was critical New Yorkers understood who was in charge. That person, he said, is Mr. Cuomo.\u201cWe don\u2019t want that blurred,\u201d Mr. Raskin said. \u201cEvery time someone looks to the mayor, who has no ability to fix the problem, it alleviates the pressure on the governor, who does.\u201dIn the past few decades, New York City mayors have attempted to exert some control over the subway system, with varying degrees of success.The late       Ed Koch       embarked on a campaign in the 1980s to rid subway cars of graffiti. In 1995, then-Mayor       Rudy Giuliani       won a battle to merge the MTA\u2019s transit police with the New York Police Department, giving the city more control over policing in the system.The next mayor,       Michael Bloomberg,        pushed hard for a congestion-pricing plan that would have charged motorists a fee to drive in parts of the city to help fund mass transit. The effort died amid opposition from state lawmakers. Bloomberg advisers still lament the plan\u2019s demise, saying it would have provided critical funding for subway improvements.Mr. de Blasio has said he has no plans to push for a congestion-pricing initiative because of the fierce opposition it would face in Albany.NYU\u2019s Mr. Moss, who served as an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said Mr. de Blasio should do more to advocate for state and federal funding that is critical to keeping the subway, and by extension the city, moving.The mayor has said in recent days that he empathized with frustrated riders, particularly those on the ill-fated F train this month, because he used to take the subway from his Park Slope home before he got a car. That was about 18 years ago.\u201cI rode the F train for many, many years,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cI can absolutely relate to what people must have gone through.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-18 14:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyc-mayor-ratchets-up-subway-pitch-1497812249", "news_title": "NYC Mayor Ratchets Up Subway Pitch ", "keywords": "mta,new york city subways,nyc subway problems,nyc transit,Bill de Blasio,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,urban,commuter transit,urban mass transit systems,road,rail transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "The woman now considered the world\u2019s greatest pipa player spent years asking herself, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201dWu Man,        now 54 years old, was the first person to get a master\u2019s degree in her instrument\u2014a four-stringed lute with a two-millennia history\u2014at China\u2019s top music school, the Central Conservatory of Music, in Beijing. She became its youngest faculty member. She had learned the very limited repertoire of notated pipa songs, which numbered a few dozen, given its oral tradition roots.In 1979, she got a glimpse of the world outside thanks to the historic tour in China of       Seiji Ozawa       and the Boston Symphony. Three months later, violinist       Isaac Stern       visited her school. He gave a master class where he taught musicians to project to the last row of the audience, a new concept.Ms. Wu saw an alternative to what she considered the all-too-smooth path that lay before her as professor. It meant stepping onto a bigger stage\u2014and ultimately to the U.S.\u2014to find out the possibilities for her instrument and for herself as a musician. And for the last 25 years, \u201cthat is what I\u2019m doing.\u201dHer step on the broader stage brings her to New York this week.This Tuesday and Wednesday, Ms. Wu will join the Shanghai Quartet for concerts at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City. The program will include only works of Chinese composers, including Oscar winner       Tan Dun,        Pulitzer Prize winner       Zhou Long       and Ms. Wu herself. On Thursday she and the Mir\u00f3 Quartet will perform the world premiere of Chinese composer Ye Xiaogang\u2019s \u201cGardenia\u201d at the International Festival of Arts & Ideas in New Haven, Conn.She was a Fellow at Harvard\u2019s Radcliffe Institute in 1998 when cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who lives near Boston, asked if she were interested in joining \u201cthis ensemble idea,\u201d she said. Her goal was to introduce the pipa to different audiences.At Mr. Ma\u2019s invitation, she joined him the following year to perform at the White House dinner hosted by President       Bill Clinton       for Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, becoming the first artist from China to perform at the White House.Mr. Ma recalled, in an email, \u201cThose first Silk Road Ensemble rehearsals included musicians from Azerbaijan to China, Iran to Uzbekistan, with as many different languages and musical traditions. You can imagine the challenges!\u201dA year ago, Ms. Wu became an adviser on the visiting committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s musical instruments department, which has among its holdings a 400-year-old Ming dynasty pipa with 110 hexagonal ivory plaques depicting Taoist, Confucian and Buddhist figures. \u201cIf we have a question about a source in China, she can advise as to who is a good go-to person,\u201d explained       Ken Moore,        the department\u2019s curator emeritus.This year the Silk Road Ensemble\u2019s sixth album, \u201cSing Me Home,\u201d won a Grammy for Best World Music Album, while its documentary, \u201cThe Music of Strangers,\u201d was nominated for a Grammy for best music film.Last month, Ms. Wu and three musicians (from Tajikistan, China and Italy) toured 12 Chinese cities as part of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture\u2019s Music Initiative. The concerts, which featured Central Asian lutes (the dutar, tanbur and sato) along with frame drums and the pipa, incorporated talks and demonstrations. \u201cEspecially at this time, we need to know each other, know the neighbor,\u201d said Ms. Wu, who served as artistic director.After that, Ms. Wu was at Indiana\u2019s DePauw University to serve among the dozen faculty of the weeklong Global Musician Workshop, the training program inspired by Mr. Ma\u2019s Silk Road Ensemble, the international artists collective.Think of the workshop as \u201ca lot of tiny Silk Road Ensembles,\u201d said       Brian Grimm,        of Madison, Wis., who plays the seven-stringed Chinese zither, guqin\u2014an instrument that dates back 3,000 years\u2014along with the pipa, cello, and bass guitar.Under Ms. Wu\u2019s guidance, Mr. Grimm\u2019s group of musicians\u2014playing the clarinet, cello, piano, violin, tabla, guquin and pipa\u2014would take on a love song from China\u2019s Sichuan province and try different styles: a funky Afrobeat version, upbeat bluegrass. \u201cWe\u2019d keep tweaking so that we could perform it three different ways,\u201d Mr. Grimm said.Working with musicians from different traditions \u201cbrings me life,\u201d Ms. Wu said.It was Ms. Wu\u2019s parents who chose the pipa for her to play at age 9, seeing it as the most important Chinese instrument, steeped in history, literature, painting and poems, and with a beautiful shape. \u201cI think they are right,\u201d she said.Write to Elizabeth Yuan at elizabeth.yuan@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Pipa Prodigy Set to Play at Armory.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 14:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pipa-prodigy-to-play-new-york-city-stage-1497811328", "news_title": "Pipa Master Wu Man to Play New York City Stage", "keywords": "chinese composers,chinese orchestra,festival of arts & ideas,music,park avenue armory,pipa,silk road ensemble,yo-yo ma,Wu Man,political,general news,arts,entertainment"}, {"content": "The developer behind a Brooklyn Heights project to build a new library and condominium tower has secured a $280 million construction loan, allowing the mixed-use redevelopment to move forward.The Hudson Cos. on Thursday closed on a $280 million loan provided by real-estate finance company             Starwood Property Trust Inc.       and Related Fund Management, a division of real-estate firm Related Cos., Hudson said.Starwood provided $200 million and Related contributed the rest of the debt, Hudson said.Hudson also closed on the $52 million purchase of the Brooklyn Heights Public Library site from New York City, a transaction that will fund the build out of a new library at the site, as well as much needed improvements at eight other branches.\u201cThis is the poster child for public-private projects,\u201d said       David Kramer       president of Hudson.The Brooklyn library system has long faced challenges of underfunded expenses to maintain and improve its aging library buildings, which, on average are more than 60 years old, said       David Woloch,        executive vice president of external affairs for the Brooklyn Public Library.\u201cThis is really a game changer for us,\u201d Mr. Woloch said. \u201cThis one asset is generating an unprecedented amount of public benefit.Hudson\u2019s $470 million project at 280 Cadman Plaza West, selected from a number of proposals by the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the library, includes a 36-story tower that would house the new 26,620 square-foot library, a 9,000 square-foot science, technology, engineering and math lab for students, and 134 condominium units.Brooklyn Roasting Company and pop-up food vendors selected by Smorgasburg, the weekly seasonal outdoor-food market, would occupy the two retail spaces on the site.

Meanwhile, data showed that accelerating inflation and slow wage growth are eroding spending power for the economy\u2019s all-important consumer.The FTSE 250 index of midsize British companies fell 2.1%\u00a0Thursday, its worst day this year amid pressure from retailers. Though the index recovered\u00a0Friday, fund managers said the stumble was a warning shot.\u201cI think U.K. equities are going to have a tough time over the next few years, specifically the retail side,\u201d said Seema Shah, global investment strategist at             Principal Global Investors,        PFG 0.44%       a manager of $620 billion in assets.Meanwhile, money flowed out of U.K. funds for the eighth week in a row, figures from fund tracker EPFR Global showed\u00a0Friday, with a net redemption of $563 million. A survey by             Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch published earlier in the week showed that the U.K. remains the least popular market for European investors.On Monday, the U.K. will begin negotiations to exit from the EU, a process many investors believe will be bad for its economy and which may have been complicated by Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       loss of her parliamentary majority in this month\u2019s election.To be sure, many economists predicted a recession in 2016 if Britons voted to leave the EU, and this hasn\u2019t happened. Economic growth has since accelerated and business investment has remained resilient.But the economy\u2019s reliance on consumers spending almost all their earnings long predates Brexit and isn\u2019t diminishing. Consumer spending is responsible for\u00a065% of the U.K. economy against an average of 55% over the EU, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And British consumers are sitting on large debts, raising further questions about their continued ability to power the economy.During the fourth quarter of last year, U.K. households saved only 3.3% of their income, the lowest proportion since official records started in 1963. And household debt compared to income, while still below where it was in 2008 before the financial crisis, is predicted to grow faster over the next five years than previously expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the U.K.\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog.That is hurting stocks reliant on the British consumer.\u00a0 Measured in U.S. dollars, the FTSE Local U.K. index, which tracks U.K.-exposed shares, has fallen 14% since the Brexit referendum in June last year.On Friday, sterling was trading at around $1.28, down 15% since the Brexit vote. This has made things worse for consumers, because\u00a0higher import costs push up prices.In May, the annual rate of inflation was 2.7%, above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Workers\u2019 purchasing power fell 0.6% in the three months through April..\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the trend in retail sales improving soon,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cRetailers have not finished yet passing on higher import prices to consumers, wage growth looks set to remain depressed and banks are reporting that they intend to restrict the supply of unsecured credit.\u201dBecause this kind of inflation isn\u2019t driven by stronger growth or a tighter labor market,\u00a0all these concerns could boost the market for British government debt, or gilts. Yields on 10-year gilts have fallen in recent months, after hitting a peak of 1.5% in January.On Thursday, three out of the Bank of England\u2019s eight rate setters voted to increase interest rates, surprising investors who expected a less hawkish stance. But yields edged up only a little and closed the week at\u00a01.017%.\u00a0Investors typically sell bonds when they believe there is a chance rates will rise. Bond yields move opposite to prices.Jim Leaviss, a fund manager at M&G Investments, which manages \u00a3265 billion ($338 billion) in assets, said he believes investors have been buying gilts precisely because they have been anticipating U.K. consumers\u2019 woes and the brake that would place on rate rises.\u201cYou see it priced in because nobody expects the Bank of England to raise rates in the foreseeable future,\u201d Mr. Leaviss said.Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Investors Cool on Britain.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 14:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/britannia-no-longer-rules-for-investors-1497787201", "news_title": "Britannia No Longer Rules for Investors ", "keywords": " brexit, britain, economy, investors,u.k., united kingdom,European Union,Principal Global Investors,PFG,Jim Leaviss,Samuel Tombs,economic performance,indicators,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commodity,financial market news,insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "If       Theresa May\u2019s       position was precarious a week ago, it looks even worse now.The British Prime Minister was already facing accusations that her robotic public demeanor and inability to connect with ordinary voters had cost the Conservative party its parliamentary majority in the June 8 general election. Now her bungled response to a deadly fire in a residential tower block in which at least 58 people died has reinforced doubts about her leadership.Meanwhile, her inability so far to complete a deal to secure the parliamentary backing of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party has raised further questions about her political skills. All this on the eve of the formal start of Brexit talks, the most consequential negotiations in Britain\u2019s postwar history, which start Monday.Even so, Mrs. May\u2019s position is more secure than it looks. Both her party and the DUP know that failure to maintain a united front risks handing power to the Labour Party and its far-left leader       Jeremy Corbyn.For Brexiters, there is the added anxiety that a protracted and potentially messy Conservative leadership election could derail the Brexit timetable which already only has 21 months of its allotted two years left to run, giving opponents of Brexit a pretext to try to overturn the referendum result. With their support, Mrs. May is likely to remain as Prime Minister with an unchanged Brexit strategy. This would see the U.K. quit the EU\u2019s customs union and single market, end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and end the automatic right of EU citizens to live and work in the U.K.\u2014a strategy which is after all broadly accepted by the Labour Party.Even so, the core Brexit fault line that runs right through the Conservative party and the country is likely to remain unresolved. At the heart of the U.K.\u2019s Brexit agonies lies a divide between those who believe that a post-Brexit U.K. needs to remain closely bound to EU structures and rules to minimize barriers to trade with its closest trading partners\u2014perhaps like Turkey, by creating a customs union with the EU\u2019s custom union or, like Norway, by creating parallel legal structures that replicate the single market\u2014and those who want Britain to have maximum flexibility to forge a new economic model centered on new trading arrangements with the rest of the world.What hard-line Brexiters really fear is that an EU-supporting establishment will try to impose a half-baked version of Brexit that will leave the U.K. bound by rules over which it will cease to have control; what proponents of a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit fear is that hard-liners are bent on a path that will inflict major economic damage.Until the election, many assumed this tension would come to a head early in the negotiations, most likely in a fight over the so-called Brexit bill\u2014the money that the EU wants the U.K. to pay to settle its outstanding obligations and which the EU says is a precondition for talks on any future free trade deal. In the grand scheme of things, the sums themselves are less important than the opportunity that the bill offers hard-line Brexiters to blow up the talks early in the process, thereby guaranteeing a complete rupture with the EU. Thanks to the weakness of Mrs. May\u2019s position, this no longer looks so likely since any attempt to walk away early in the negotiations could prompt a split in the Conservative party which the Labour Party could easily exploit, having explicitly committed itself to opposing a \u201cno deal\u201d scenario in its manifesto.But this just means that the inevitable showdown has been deferred to later in the Brexit process when Mrs. May must bring any deal back to parliament. Her problem is that there is next to no chance that the U.K. and EU will have negotiated a new trading relationship by the end of the two-year Article 50 process. The best she can expect to show for a deal to pay the Brexit bill is a prolonged transitional deal, almost certainly taking the form of some kind of standstill agreement that preserves all the current U.K. arrangements and obligations for a period of several years. This would almost certainly be accompanied by some form of declaration on the framework for a new trade deal, but this wouldn\u2019t be legally binding and there\u2019s no guarantee it would be delivered.The British Parliament would then be confronted by a deeply unpalatable choice: pay the bill or crash out of the EU with no deal at all, forcing businesses into a sudden chaotic adjustment. Hard-line Brexiters might still try to torpedo the deal if they thought what was being contemplated kept the U.K. too closely aligned with the EU and in any case left the U.K. at the mercy of the EU. But even if parliament did accept a deal on these terms, the U.K. would still be left facing the same cliff-edge at the end of the transitional period. Either way, the toxic question of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU is unlikely to be resolved for many years.Write to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 13:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-brexit-talks-start-u-k-tensions-simmer-1497808178", "news_title": "As Brexit Talks Start, U.K. Tensions Simmer", "keywords": "brexit,brexit talks,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "KABUL\u2014Taliban militants attacked a police headquarters in eastern Afghanistan on Sunday, killing at least seven policemen and injuring several others, Afghan officials said.A suicide bomber detonated a truck laden with explosives at the entrance of the police headquarters in Gardez city, the capital of Paktia province, early in the morning, according to       Mohammad Rahman Qadari,        a member of the provincial council in Paktia.

Islamabad denies that it is supporting the insurgency.In a development that could further complicate relations between the neighbors, Pakistan on Sunday said two of its diplomats had gone missing in Afghanistan\u2019s eastern Nangarhar province on their way home to Islamabad.Militants and criminals regularly target this busy route.

The better question might be, where do the U.A.E. and the other nations currently boycotting Qatar stand on this existential threat?Ambassador Otaiba must certainly be aware that the United Nations and the U.S. Treasury Department list 10 times as many suspected terrorists and terrorist financiers from the boycotting countries as from Qatar. Surely his excellency also remembers that the U.A.E. was singled out in the 9/11 Commission\u2019s report for its role in laundering money to terrorists, and that Emiratis, not Qataris, were among the hijackers who flew planes into the Twin Towers.Ambassador Otaiba calls upon Qatar \u201cto return to the community of responsible nations,\u201d and criticizes television news channel Al Jazeera for inciting violence, though he fails to mention that the U.A.E. financed the military coup that overthrew Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected government, and that the U.A.E. allegedly bankrolled the coup plotters who attempted to overthrow the elected government in Turkey.The ambassador writes that the U.A.E. did not act \u201cin haste\u201d against Qatar, yet the U.A.E. never brought any of its complaints to the responsible entities at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) before launching aggressive diplomatic and economic measures against us. Instead, as leaked emails show, the ambassador and the U.A.E. government privately conspired against Qatar in the shadows.It has become clear that the current campaign against Qatar is not about terrorism, Al Jazeera or any of the other issues highlighted by the boycotting nations. It is about Qatar\u2019s independence, which some apparently view as a threat. We would like our brothers in the GCC to know that we are a threat to no one.

I will not, in any way, defend the 10 students\u2019 Facebook posts, but most colleges need to hear if one is attending by May 1 so they can offer admission to students on the wait list. By Harvard\u2019s rescinding these 10 students\u2019 admission in June, they may not have any other college to attend, as presumably they turned down all other admission offers.Curtis PehlBaltimoreHarvard doesn\u2019t owe anything to the 10 students who were denied their admission for offensive behavior on social media. What Harvard does owe these students is a tough life lesson, one that they clearly missed somewhere in their perhaps privileged upbringing. Despite qualifying for admission, Harvard has said to these 10 young adults, you have gone beyond social norms. You have crossed a line that is unacceptable to our institution, and I would hope others, and we are not obligated to admit you and teach you the errors of your ways.I don\u2019t feel sympathy toward these students. Life is unfair, words matter and what better time to learn than at age 18.

The company, a longtime Venezuelan military supplier, didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for comment.The ban is the latest sign of international isolation of Venezuelan President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,        who\u2019s battling an economic collapse, falling popularity and defections from the ruling party as protests against his rule approach 80th day.To quell the unrest, Mr. Maduro has called for a special assembly with powers to rewrite the constitution. Polls show 85% of Venezuelans reject his proposal, with two thirds of the voters demanding general elections.More than 70 Venezuelans, mostly protesters, have died so far. At least one has been killed by a tear-gas canister fired at point-blank range by a police officer, according to the country\u2019s Attorney General.\u201cWe are very happy with Brazil\u2019s solidarity,\u201d Venezuela\u2019s opposition lawmaker Jorge Mill\u00e1n, who had publicized the Condor deal, said by telephone Sunday. \u201cWe will continue denouncing to the international community Maduro\u2019s attempts to buy material to repress and assassinate protesters to remain in power.\u201dVenezuela\u2019s foreign, defense and information ministries didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the Brazilian ban on tear gas sales.Shortages of hard currency and a shrinking pool of suppliers have forced Venezuelan security officers to resort to old stocks of tear gas that have expired up to a decade ago to contain the unrest, despite the health warnings on the canisters. Deaths and wounds from live weapons, which are banned at protests by Venezuelan law, are becoming a daily sight at demonstrations.Since coming to power last year, the administration of Brazilian President       Michel Temer       has emerged as one of the sharpest critics of Mr. Maduro\u2019s slide to authoritarianism, marking a turnaround from his leftist predecessor       Dilma Rousseff.While Mr. Temer himself has avoided speaking publicly about the crisis in Venezuela as he battles corruption allegations and protests of his own, his government has taken a series of measures against Mr. Maduro. Brazil led recent efforts to suspend Venezuela from South America\u2019s trade group Mercosur. Last month, Mr. Temer also met with the family of jailed Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and said Brazil was ready to provide humanitarian aid to the country.\u201cBrazil condemns the escalation of repression in Venezuela and appeals to the government of that country to respect the constitution,\u201d Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement this month.Write to Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.com and Samantha Pearson at samantha.pearson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 13:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-suspends-sales-of-tear-gas-to-venezuela-1497804919", "news_title": "Brazil Suspends Sales of Tear Gas to Venezuela", "keywords": "chavismo,gas canisters ,protests,venezuela economy,venezuela opposition,venezuela unrest,Brazil's Defense Ministry,Condor Tecnologias\u00a0N\u00e3o-Letais,contracts,orders,non-governmental contracts,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,real estate,property"}, {"content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia\u2014People in Indonesia like the idea of growing beards just as much as hipsters in Brooklyn or Berlin.Sports stars such as David Beckham and the Houston Rockets\u2019 James Harden helped cement the trend, as have actors such as       Brad Pitt       and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan.The thing is, some Indonesian men struggle to grow beards and often end up with just a few wispy strands or some spotty patches of peach fuzz. It is something that many Asian men face, from Japan to Vietnam, Thailand and China. Japanese-American YouTube star Ryan Higa last year poked fun at the difficulties some faced during \u201cNo-Shave November,\u201d when men try to grow facial hair to raise awareness of men\u2019s health issues.Now 23-year-old student Fariz Gamal thinks he has found a better way of doing it: Just use minoxidil, the active ingredient in Rogaine and other hair-loss treatments.In a Jakarta coffee shop, Mr. Gamal explained how he stumbled across the stuff when he was trying to grow his own beard and get women to notice him. \u201cI never had much success approaching girls before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after using minoxidil for six months I had a pretty good beard. And I also got a girlfriend.\u201dMr. Gamal\u2019s discovery is providing a new lease on life for a baldness treatment that is often the butt of jokes in the West. He is now promoting the hair-loss treatments through his website, Misterbrewok, or Mister Beard in Indonesian. He has nearly 28,000 followers on the photo-sharing site Instagram, many of whom submit before-and-after shots comparing their new beards with their old, baby-fresh faces.Recently, Mr. Gamal has begun touring Indonesia to meet his \u201cBeard Bros,\u201d as his customers call themselves, sharing tips on how to grow a thick, luscious beard and maybe selling a few bottles of hair-growth treatment afterward, much as traveling salesmen used to do in the Old West.More important, they encourage each other to keep going through long months of doubt until some whiskers finally begin to show.\u201cI had only a small bit of mustache and some stubble when I started using minoxidil,\u201d said one Beard Bro, Kamal Muhammad, 21. \u201cI got stuck on the fourth month when there wasn\u2019t much progress, but I realized it was just a matter of time before I would make my breakthrough.\u201dHe says his beard has now grown so much that he has had to trim it a couple of times\u2014something he didn\u2019t dare imagine a few months before.The effect on his love life? \u201cAwesome,\u201d Mr. Muhammad said.Minoxidil was first conceived as a tablet in the 1950s to treat ulcers, but it turned out to be more successful as a way to lower blood pressure. It also encouraged hair growth, prompting the drug\u2019s developer, Upjohn Co., to patent it as a rub-on treatment for male pattern baldness in the 1980s. The Rogaine brand is now owned by             Johnson & Johnson.Generic versions soon followed, among them Mr. Gamal\u2019s favorite formula, which is sold under             Costco\u2019s       Kirkland Signature imprint. The treatment is applied twice a day. He sells a one-month supply for 150,000 rupiah or $11. Customers are willing to pay a markup for a variety of reasons, including talking through their needs with Mr. Gamal.There are potential side effects. In some cases, users can put on a few pounds because minoxidil can encourage water retention. Mr. Gamal recommends people with low blood pressure avoid it, too.A Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman said Rogaine, where registered, is approved for the treatment of hereditary hair loss and isn\u2019t indicated for use on the face or other parts of the body and people looking for such a solution \u201cshould consult with a health-care professional.\u201d Costco didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.When Mr. Gamal first began rubbing minoxidil on his face in 2015 he didn\u2019t want anyone to know what he was doing. \u201cI was afraid that people would say it was fake, that it\u2019s not really me,\u201d he recalled. He feared the worst when his friends found out his secret.To his surprise, they wanted to buy some of his stash of Kirkland Signature Hair Regrowth Treatment, Extra Strength.He also began to attract a separate group of customers. Mr. Gamal estimates that around 20% of his customers buy minoxidil to grow beards to make them look more religious as a more conservative form of Islam begins to take root in Indonesia, which traditionally has practiced a more relaxed take on the faith.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely part of the market,\u201d Mr. Gamal said. He thinks it is a segment that will support sales even if the rest of the world hits \u201cpeak beard\u201d and starts shaving again.But the desire to emulate soccer stars such as Lionel Messi or Sergio Ramos seems to be what many other beard-growers are aiming for, he says\u2014along with the romantic payoff.A study of facial hair fashions in Britain between 1842 and 1971 by academic Nigel Barber found beards and mustaches grew more popular in Britain whenever there were more single men competing for fewer women.Something similar appears to be happening in Indonesia, where the number of males born has risen from 98 per 100 females, to over 105 today.Mr. Gamal says he has carried out informal surveys, which found that 60% of Indonesian women find neatly-trimmed beards attractive, including his current girlfriend, Gingy Anna Karnadi, who sat across the table from him. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she said.Then there is the case of Muhammad Wildan Attamimi in Purwakarta, a town 60 miles southeast of Jakarta, who began using minoxidil in mid-2015 and found himself becoming surprisingly attractive.One friend messaged him out of the blue after he changed his profile picture on BlackBerry Messenger to show off his new whiskers. \u201cShe asked how I was doing,\u201d Mr. Attamimi, 27, recalled.Then he noticed a client at the notary\u2019s office where he worked was trying to flirt with him. \u201cThe ladies suddenly began looking at me in a different way, like they were interested,\u201d he said.A little later a friend introduced him to Sri Fina Wulandari. \u201cShe told me she likes my beard,\u201d said Mr. Attamimi, who is still shocked by the turn of events.They got married late last year.\u2014Anita Rachman contributed to this article.Write to James Hookway at james.hookway@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 12:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hair-raising-idea-a-beard-business-sprouts-in-indonesia-1497804809", "news_title": "Hair-Raising Idea: A Beard Business Sprouts in Indonesia", "keywords": "beards,hair growth, minoxidil,rogaine ,corporate,industrial news,entrepreneurs,page-one stories"}, {"content": "This month\u2019s brief technology-stock rout reveals an underside for investors of a steady 2017 rally: Shares of giant tech firms are cropping up everywhere, complicating efforts to diversify portfolios.Alphabet Inc.,        GOOGL 0.59%       Apple Inc.,             Microsoft Corp.       and other tech giants are more heavily represented than they were just a year ago in many so-called factor-based investing strategies. Many of these follow indexes that aim to beat or tamp down risk in the broader market, rather than mimic it, by systematically selecting stocks according to observed traits such as low volatility and momentum.Technology now represents 11.3% of the $7 billion             PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio        SPLV 0.36%       exchange-traded fund, which buys the least-volatile S&P 500 stocks. That compares with 2.9% a year ago, according to Invesco Ltd., the ETF\u2019s sponsor.Google parent Alphabet was tapped in February for the first time ever to join. Microsoft joined the ETF in May for the first time since 2012.The development means investors holding a mix of seemingly disparate funds in the name of diversification could be surprised to find heavy concentrations in the same group of in-favor stocks, making them vulnerable in bouts of selling. Rules-based funds and strategies that gradually added tech stocks could sell them in a downturn, adding to price declines.\u201cThe fear is that if fundamental events cause volatility to rise, these same passive vehicles will sell and exacerbate downside volatility,\u201d said       Robert Boroujerdi,        head of global securities research at             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Factor-based strategies, a type of so-called quantitative investing, have long been available to large investors, but are increasingly available to smaller ones in the form of mutual and exchange-traded funds. There were some 637 \u201csmart-beta\u201d ETFs, a catch-all term that includes factor investing, at the end of May with a collective $619 billion in assets, according to Morningstar.ETFs represent a sliver of the money that follows quantitative investment strategies but, because of requirements for ETFs to disclose their holdings daily, they provide a window into how other, larger strategies are positioned. That current market conditions leave quant ETFs heavy in tech indicates that hedge funds using similar signals to buy and sell are likely bulked up on this sector as well. Quant-focused hedge funds held $932 billion at the end of the first quarter, according to estimates by HFR Inc.Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market value, is the biggest position in indexes such as the S&P 500, which ranks holdings according to size. But Apple is likewise a large position in a slew of factor-driven ETFs offered by             BlackRock Inc.,       the world\u2019s largest money manager by assets under management, among others.Apple is the top holding in BlackRock\u2019s             iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF,       representing nearly 10% of the portfolio. Value strategies\u2014the oldest and best-known factor\u2014broadly seek to purchase shares for less than their underlying business worth.At the same time, Apple is a large holding in a separate BlackRock ETF that aims to capture momentum, or the investment strategy based on the idea that stocks that have risen swiftly in the recent past are likely to continue to do so in the future.Apple is the fourth-largest position in the             iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF,       which seeks out firms with high returns on equity, low indebtedness and stable earnings growth. Apple is also a small holding in iShares\u2019 low-volatility stock ETF.All told, Apple is in five low-volatility ETFs with a collective $14 billion and nine momentum ETFs with $17.7 billion, according to data firm XTF. Alphabet resides in seven low-volatility ETFs and three momentum ETFs, while Microsoft is in 11 low-vol ETFs and four momentum ETFs.An unusual mix of market moves and longer-term industry trends helps explain why tech shares have come to populate an array of overlapping strategies.Fast gains in 2017 for the largest U.S. tech and internet stocks came alongside rare placidity. Until early June, the price swings experienced by this group over the previous six months were near the lowest on record, according to Mr. Boroujerdi. Price volatility for big-cap tech stocks fell below that of stocks in the S&P 500\u2019s utility and consumer-staples sectors, which are viewed as more staid.Financial adviser Chad Carlson, in Itasca, Ill., said the perception that Apple is a safe stock to own permeated client conversations in the past few years\u2014a sign in his view that investors have grown complacent.Mr. Carlson said one client of his had about 40% of his net worth in Apple, directly and across various funds, but he refused to diversify because of his experience with high returns, low volatility and his assumption Apple\u2019s rise would continue.Until this month, he said, \u201cPeople took extraordinary risk in Apple without feeling the actual risk.\u201dWrite to Chris Dieterich at chris.dieterich@wsj.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Big Tech Stocks Foil Strategies to Diversify.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 12:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/market-turns-upside-down-as-go-go-tech-stocks-join-slow-mo-funds-1497803746", "news_title": "Market Turns Upside-Down as Go-Go Tech Stocks Join Slow-Mo Funds", "keywords": "low volatility funds,momentum,stock volatility,tech stocks,Invesco,IVZ,Alphabet Inc.

BA 1.27%       and         Airbus               SE, the world\u2019s top two jetliner makers, have warned investors that orders for new planes would decline this year. But they have said that airline customers generally still want plenty of new aircraft and there is no danger production plans\u2014key to earnings\u2014are in jeopardy. Order books stretch out for years, ensuring plenty of cash flow, even if buyers slow the recent blistering pace of new purchases.They have a chance to prove that this week, as top aerospace executives, suppliers and airline buyers converge here for the Paris Air Show, which kicks off Monday. Over croissants and foie gras at Le Bourget Airport north of the French capital, Boeing, Airbus and smaller rivals will jostle for sales in what is typically the best opportunity of the year to announce new orders.For industry watchers, the event will go some way in determining whether the recent orders slowdown is simply a cooling-off period amid years of supercharged growth, or something more worrisome. Few, however, are expecting a sudden turnaround.\u201cWe expect a quiet show on the order front,\u201d said       Ken Herbert,        an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. In particular, Middle East airline buyers and plane lessors that drove deals at recent shows have largely filled their appetite, Mr. Herbert said.In the first five months of the year, Airbus has secured 73 net orders, compared with 162 deals signed for the comparable period a year earlier. Airbus says it expects plane deliveries to outpace new order bookings this year\u2014the first time that has happened since 2009.Boeing has done better. The Chicago-based plane maker has secured 176 net commercial jetliner orders as of June 13, 10 more than the same period last year.Airbus and Boeing are expected to announce deals for as many as 680 jets in Paris, estimates consultant Deloitte. That is down 10% from the 2015 Paris Air Show. Paris alternates with Farnborough, England, as the host of the annual aviation event.Amid the big, existing order books, shareholders have become somewhat less sensitive to deal announcements, focusing instead on deliveries. Those dictate when plane makers are paid.Both plane makers have backlogs stretching past 2020 for their most popular models, underpinning big expected increases in output in the coming years. Boeing had a backlog of 5,646 planes at the end of May. Airbus\u2019s stood at 6,705 planes.\u201cWe could have no sales for a number of years and we would still have to increase production to chew down that backlog,\u201d Airbus chief plane salesman       John Leahy       said. Especially popular are the two manufacturers\u2019 single-aisle planes, models for which demand so far has remained buoyant.That has created its own problems, as both Boeing and Airbus have struggled over the past few years with stretched supply lines. Seats, toilets and engines have all been in short supply for both companies at different times amid their recent production increase.\u201cOrders don\u2019t matter, it\u2019s deliveries that count,\u201d said       Aengus Kelly,        chief executive of leasing company             AerCap Holdings                   NV, one of the largest buyers of Airbus and Boeing planes.Still, any sense at the end of the week that orders are dropping off faster than the industry has expected could spook investors. Especially vulnerable is demand for some of the biggest planes, such as Boeing\u2019s 777 long-range jet and Airbus\u2019s A350. Airlines such as             American Airlines Group Inc.       and             Delta Air Lines Inc.       are among the carriers in recent weeks to announce deferrals of some big plane orders.Airlines in the Middle East, large buyers of big planes, are grappling with multiple headwinds. Low oil prices have depressed lucrative business travel, and a U.S. ban on the use of laptops and tablets on inbound flights from some Middle East airports has dented bookings for Persian Gulf carriers.Emirates Airline, the world\u2019s largest by international traffic, has signaled a wait-and-see approach on new long-haul plane purchases for now. Qatar Airways is facing even more pressure, after Persian Gulf neighbors essentially slapped Qatar with an air blockade over long-simmering political squabbles.Airbus has booked 30 net deals for its A330 and A350 widebody jetliners this year, 46% fewer than at the end of May in 2016.\u00a0Boeing has sold only 32 of its 777s and 787 Dreamliners through June 13.\u201cWe are seeing a slight pause in widebody orders,\u201d said Robin Lineberger, head of Deloitte\u2019s aerospace and defense practice.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Jetliner Makers Jostle for Sales.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 12:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-paris-air-show-biggest-plane-makers-to-tout-production-as-new-orders-slow-1497783601", "news_title": "At Paris Air Show, Plane Makers Tout Busy Production Schedules as New Orders Slow", "keywords": "aviation,carriers,jet makers,jet orders,paris air show,plane makers,plane purchases,Boeing,BA,Airbus SE,AIR.FR,FR:AIR,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,jet fuel markets,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,aerospace,defense,air transport,industrial goods,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va.\u2014The day before he opened fire on a baseball practice for congressional Republicans outside Washington, D.C.,       James T. Hodgkinson       said he was making plans to return home to Illinois.He canceled his membership at the YMCA in Alexandria, saying he was moving. He had a mechanic check his van\u2019s tires and asked if they could handle the drive west.Whether the 66-year-old with a history of criticizing President       Donald Trump       and GOP policies envisioned a getaway\u2014or truly intended to go back to Illinois\u2014is among the unknowns about the early-morning June 14 rampage, which critically injured Rep. Steve Scalise (R., La.), House Majority Whip and wounded three others. Mr. Hodgkinson, armed with a rifle and handgun, was fatally shot by police.On Saturday, MedStar Washington Hospital Center upgraded Mr. Scalise\u2019s condition to \u201cserious\u201d from \u201ccritical,\u201d after another surgery. The hospital said he continued to show signs of improvement and was \u201cmore responsive, and is speaking with his loved ones.\u201dThe hospital said that would be the final update of the weekend.Goateed and heavyset, Mr. Hodgkinson was a loner with set routines, say those he met during his months in Alexandria: early mornings at the Y, sitting with a laptop at the same table by the coffee machine; lunch at the same Chinese restaurant where he always ordered General Tso\u2019s chicken; regular stops at Pork Barrel BBQ, whose bartenders recall his taste for inexpensive canned beer and watching golf on television.One acquaintance, former Alexandria Mayor       William Euille,        said he never knew Mr. Hodgkinson had any interest in politics, let alone that he was an ardent       Bernie Sanders       supporter who seethed over Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Posts on a             Facebook                   page that appeared to be Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s suggested as much.\u201cHe seemed rational, he spoke well,\u201d Mr. Euille said. \u201cHe showed no sense of depression or being torn up about anything.\u201dBut late Sunday afternoon, three days before the shooting, Y member       Kris Balderston       observed Mr. Hodgkinson talking disapprovingly at the TV on the stationary bike he was using. \u201cNot in a crazy way, not ranting,\u201d he said. From a nearby elliptical machine he could see Mr. Hodgkinson flipping between CNN, MSNBC and Fox News. The object of his irritation: Republicans.\u201cHe would kind of groan,\u201d said Mr. Balderston, a public-affairs executive who spent 20 years working for Bill and       Hillary Clinton.       \u201cI thought in my head, \u2018Boy, that\u2019s kind of counterintuitive. That guy looks like a blue-collar Trump guy, and he\u2019s harrumphing about the Republicans.\u2019\u201dAnd less than 24 hours before the ballfield attack, Mr. Hodgkinson went on a profanity-filled rant about Mr. Trump after mechanic Crist Dauberman casually griped about working six days a week.\u201cHe flipped,\u201d Mr. Dauberman said. \u201cHe went from normal conversation to irate cursing, yelling, about Trump and what they\u2019ve done with the taxes and that this is his fault I gotta work six days a week and what\u2019s going on in the country.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d Mr. Dauberman said, \u201che didn\u2019t say he was going to hurt anyone or do anything.\u201dMr. Hodgkinson arrived in Alexandria sometime in March, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and lived out of a white cargo van. His wife,       Sue Hodgkinson,        told reporters near her home in Belleville, Ill., that she thought he planned to work on tax issues and that he had sold most of what he owned from a home-inspection business.After joining the Y on April 4, he visited often and at various times of day, using the gym equipment and spending time in the common area, the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington said. Staff didn\u2019t get any complaints or see \u201cinappropriate or unusual\u201d behavior, the Y said. Members said he stood out because he always wore jeans or other street clothes.Mr. Euille, a regular exerciser, said he first spotted Mr. Hodgkinson one morning about a month and a half ago, sitting at a round table in the Y\u2019s lounge. Days later Mr. Hodgkinson approached and they exchanged greetings, and a couple of days after that he asked the former mayor for breakfast and lunch recommendations within walking distance.On another occasion Mr. Hodgkinson asked Mr. Euille about finding work. Mr. Euille said he passed along a safety-inspector job opening, but Mr. Hodgkinson told him he wasn\u2019t qualified.Mr. Euille said he also shared several happy-hour suggestions at his request. Mr. Hodgkinson was a familiar presence at one of those places, Pork Barrel BBQ on Mount Vernon Avenue, the main commercial corridor in the bustling Del Ray neighborhood.A majority of the bartenders remember him, said part-owner       Bill Blackburn.       \u201cHe kept to himself, didn\u2019t really talk to anybody,\u201d he said.Mr. Hodgkinson never discussed politics at the Y, Mr. Euille said, even with cable news blaring from flat-screen TVs. Sometimes fellow Y members would glance at the TV and complain about the news, Congress or Mr. Trump, the former mayor said. Not Mr. Hodgkinson.\u201cHe never commented or participated in any of those conversations,\u201d Mr. Euille said. \u201cHis head was glued to the laptop.\u201dMr. Euille said he didn\u2019t know what Mr. Hodgkinson did on the computer. Only once did Mr. Hodgkinson call him and the front desk attendant over to his table to share a joke he had pulled up.The ex-mayor said he didn\u2019t ask Mr. Hodgkinson about his background or what brought him to Alexandria, just across the Potomac River from the nation\u2019s capital. He said he knew Mr. Hodgkinson had some kind of vehicle because after showering he would stash his gym bag there and return with his laptop, but he never saw the van.Initially he thought Mr. Hodgkinson was in town for an extended business trip but came to conclude he was homeless or staying with friends. One morning this month, Mr. Euille saw Mr. Hodgkinson\u2019s oversize gym back sitting open on a locker room bench. Inside were street clothes, books and various items in plastic bags.\u201cIt looked like he had all his worldly possessions,\u201d he said.Mr. Euille said he last saw Mr. Hodgkinson around 9:30 Tuesday morning, the day before the shooting, sitting at his usual table with his laptop. But the two didn\u2019t chat.Around 10 that morning Mr. Dauberman said Mr. Hodgkinson pulled into the Del Ray Service Center, down the road from the Y. After his tirade about Mr. Trump, Mr. Dauberman said he brought the conversation back to the van\u2019s tires.\u201cHe was trying to find some work, so he had been staying in the area, but he was planning on going back to Illinois\u2014would the tires make it back?\u201d Mr. Dauberman recalled.Mr. Dauberman said the van didn\u2019t look run down or like he was living in it. \u201cAnyone would have thought this was a normal middle-aged guy,\u201d he said, adding that his criticism of the president didn\u2019t stand out despite the harshness: \u201cThat\u2019s half of America.\u201dNot long after he left the service station, Mr. Hodgkinson walked into the South China Restaurant two blocks away. Employee Levis Jimenez-Najar had grown used to seeing him every day at lunch over the prior two to three weeks.She said he always ordered General Tso\u2019s chicken with fried rice for $5.75, always paid cash, always got it to go\u2014except on Tuesday when he ate at a booth. His only comment to her: he liked the food.\u2014Shibani Mahtani contributed to this articleWrite to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Ballfield Attacker Had History of Criticizing GOP.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 11:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/man-who-opened-fire-on-congressmen-was-a-loner-with-set-routines-1497799887", "news_title": "Man Who Opened Fire on Congressmen Was a Loner With Set Routines", "keywords": "gop,gop shooter,partisan divide,political debate,political rancor,political violence,James T.

It is neither very wealthy nor very populous. Yet in the last 20 years, Wisconsin has gone from a completely unremarkable golf state to a frequent host of major events and a destination for golf travel.The U.S. Open at Erin Hills last week marked the state\u2019s second major championship in three years. Whistling Straits, about 70 miles to the northeast on the shores of Lake Michigan, hosted the PGA Championship in 2004, 2010 and 2015 and will host the 2020 Ryder Cup.Add to that list the newly opened Sand Valley Golf Resort in rural Nekoosa, Wis.\u2014built by the developers of Oregon\u2019s famed Bandon Dunes resort\u2014and Wisconsin suddenly has a trio of highly-rated, destination public access courses.Josh Lesnik,        president of Kemper Sports, which manages Sand Valley, said their emergence reflects a shift in the golf industry. Where once courses were built on less than ideal land near population centers, now developers are choosing idyllic spots that are further removed.Whistling Straits is on a picturesque lakefront property, and the other two were built on lands well-suited for golf, with the glaciated terrain of Erin Hills and the sand dunes of Sand Valley.\u201cWe lost our way a little bit in America in where we were building golf courses,\u201d Lesnik said. \u201cWe were building courses on less than great sites for actual golf.\u201dAll three courses benefit to some degree from their relative proximity to Chicago, but their remote locations mean they still need to convince people that the golf is worth the trip. To that end, at least for Whistling Straits and Erin Hills, hosting major championships has been key to their marketing plan.Dirk Willis, group director for golf at Kohler Co., which owns Whistling Straits, said when it opened in 1998, the general reaction was, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be nuts to think you can develop a world-class golf destination in the middle of farm country.\u201dBut the sight of the world\u2019s best golfers playing the course on national television exposed its dramatic vistas to the masses.\u201cYou need to create some sort of aura and some sort of interest in your golf course,\u201d Willis said. \u201cHosting majors, having dramatic events happen at our courses helps us create that.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-18 11:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wisconsin-becomes-a-golf-destination-1497800442", "news_title": "Wisconsin Becomes a Golf Destination", "keywords": "erin hills,golf,sand valley,u.s. open,whistling straits,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy has so far been more bark than bite: dramatic rhetoric about shaking up the old order, backed mainly by new studies and completion of routine Obama-era cases touted with extra fanfare.That may change as soon as this week, when the president bares his \u201cAmerica First\u201d teeth with more ferocity, advancing plans to curb steel imports in the name of \u201cnational security.\u201dIn doing so, Mr. Trump is dusting off little-used presidential powers rooted in a claim rarely invoked in world commerce\u2014one that has the potential to destabilize the global postwar trading regime.\u201cJustifying import restrictions based on national security is really the \u2019nuclear option,\u2019\u201d Chad Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote recently, warning of a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d as trading partners \u201cuse similar exceptions to halt U.S. exports of completely different products to their markets.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump isn\u2019t the first president to shield the long-troubled steel industry from imports, none has made steel protectionism so central to his political persona, branding prior import limits insufficient.In April, Mr. Trump began to make good on his campaign promises, exhuming Section 232 of a 1962 trade law giving presidents the power to block imports that threaten national security, and ordering aides to provide options on how to carry out the law. Officials are preparing to do so by the end of June, with action expected to follow quickly.\u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing that very soon,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a June 7 Ohio speech. \u201cThe steel folks are going to be very happy.\u201dDo steel imports threaten security?The Bush administration weighed that question in 2001, and rejected the idea\u2014the last time a Section 232 investigation was launched. The Commerce Department concluded at the time that only a tiny fraction of domestic steel output was needed for security-related uses, and that could be \u201ceasily satisfied\u2026even if there were a substantial diminution of U.S. production.\u201d It also noted most steel imports come from close U.S. allies, which remains true today. About 60% of steel imports last year came from Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and South Korea.But domestic laws give an American president wide latitude to determine what threatens security, and Trump aides have made clear they take a more expansive view than predecessors.The law\u2019s \u201cdefinition of national security is much broader than what you might think,\u201d Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       told a Wall Street Journal conference Monday, citing measures like trade\u2019s impact on employment. He said officials were looking beyond strict military concerns, noting that \u201cthere is only one U.S. manufacturer of the kind of steel that goes into transformers\u201d for the electrical grid. \u201cThat, to me, is a legitimate national security issue,\u201d Mr. Ross added.Global rules also give countries tremendous discretion to curb imports for national security. That\u2019s where the Trump actions could have the biggest repercussions.The international trading system has long reflected the uneasy balance between the need to create consistent rules that could be enforced globally with the need to respect the sovereignty of member states.The postwar arrangement overseen by the World Trade Organization includes a national security exemption, giving countries significant freedom to use it how they see fit.Trade law scholars call it the WTO\u2019s only \u201cself-judging\u201d provision, or, as one put it with foreshadowing irony in a 2011 treatise, \u201can unreviewable trump card.\u201d Officials have long worried that the exemption, if used liberally, could upend the whole regime, posing a no-win dilemma for the Geneva-based trade arbiters.The WTO could declare the policy illegal, stoking domestic political anger toward a world government challenging a country\u2019s right to protect itself. Or it could approve the plan, encouraging other nations to go the same route, triggering a tit-for-tat protectionism the system was designed to prevent.The result for 70 years has been the trade version of the Cold War\u2019s \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d doctrine preventing nuclear war.Only 10 national security complaints have been lodged in Geneva since 1949, all settled before the parties pushed the world trade body into making a ruling. Most involved diplomatic disputes, like the U.S. embargo against Cuba. The only transparently commercial case was Sweden\u2019s 1975 quotas on footwear, which was quickly dropped under pressure and ridicule from allies.In 55 years, the U.S. had launched only 26 Section 232 studies, with just two leading to limits, both on oil imports: from Iran in 1979 and Libya in 1982. Ronald Reagan did brandish the 232 threat as a bargaining chip, using it to persuade Japan in 1986 to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d cut machine-tools exports.Mr. Trump has already launched two such probes\u2014on aluminum as well as steel\u2014and Mr. Ross said Monday \u201cothers are being considered.\u201dWhen world trade leaders first created the national security exemption in 1947, officials acknowledged they were creating a potentially perilous loophole, one participant warning at the time that \u201cthe spirit in which Members of the Organization would interpret these provisions was the only guarantee against abuses,\u201d according to records of that debate.Trump aides are still wrestling with just how strong to make their steel curbs, a struggle indicated when they twice canceled congressional briefings on the measure last week. But Mr. Trump\u2019s core trade pledge has been to challenge the spirit American presidents have applied to the global trading system for 70 years, which is why the looming steel case could have such broad reverberations.Write to Jacob M.

EU leaders will discuss a six-month extension of broader economic sanctions at a summit late in the week.EU and Russian officials say the latest sanctions, which curtail defense, energy and financial ties, will harm the Russian economy\u2014though Russia\u2019s economy appears to have adapted.At the same time, the EU also wants to broaden what it terms \u201cselective engagement\u201d with Moscow.The EU and the U.S. have linked economic sanctions to the February 2015 Minsk cease-fire accord, which aimed to end fighting between Ukraine\u2019s forces and Russia-backed separatists. Progress on the agreement has stalled, European diplomats say, meaning there was little real debate about sticking to the course and extending the sanctions until January 2018.A formal decision will come shortly after the summit, officials said. The EU has also placed a travel ban and an asset freeze on 37 businesses and 150 people, including top aides to       Mr. Putin.Despite the expected extension, U.S. and European sanctions could be set to diverge for the first time since the Ukraine crisis began. The U.S. Senate\u00a0last week\u00a0backed a bill that would impose new sanctions on Russians linked to human-rights abuses, arms sales to Syria and cyberattacks. The measures also curtailed President       Donald Trump\u2019s       ability to ease sanctions, something he floated doing during the presidential campaign, causing consternation in the EU.Still, the proposed bill has drawn criticism from Germany and Austria because it would let Mr. Trump penalize European firms involved in the construction of Russian energy-export pipelines.Russia\u2019s economy in 2014 entered a two-year recession, sparked by sanctions and plunging oil prices, but the World Bank forecasts it to grow 1.3% this year.So far, U.S. and European restrictions on drilling technology haven\u2019t curbed Russian oil production, which has broken post-Soviet records. The sanctions target attempts to develop huge resources in the Arctic and hard-to-recover oil in Western Siberia.Financing for Russian companies dried up in 2014 as Western banks and investors hesitated to lend to any firms there. But Western capital markets have more recently cracked open, allowing Russia\u2019s government and large firms to more easily tap international debt markets.A huge Arctic gas project led by Russia\u2019s second-largest gas producer, PAO Novatek, said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0that it had agreed a credit line of \u20ac425 million ($475 million) with several European banks. Novatek is barred by U.S. sanctions from raising loans in dollars.European officials say the sanctions are hurting parts of the Russian economy.They acknowledge easier credit conditions for some Russian firms. A European Commission paper circulated to member states Thursday, seen by The Wall Street Journal, said half the Russian bonds issued so far this year were listed in the EU compared with 15% in the first four months of 2016. However, officials say sanctioned Russian state-owned companies are still squeezed because they must repay $26 billion in overseas debt over the next two years while Russian banks are still struggling with high levels of nonperforming loans.The paper said that European exports to Russia of dual-use goods\u2014products that can be used for civilian or defense purposes\u2014fell 9.6% last year. EU authorities denied 164 export requests for products to Russia last year, more than for any other country.Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that sanctions had an impact but the measures\u2014and Russia\u2019s countersanctions on EU food exports\u2014had even helped some sectors, including agriculture.\u201cYes, they affected us,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cDramatically or not? I think not.\u201dThe commission paper said the drag on the EU economy created by its sanctions against Russia and Russian countermeasures was just 0.1% of EU output in 2016 and is expected to be zero in 2017.Meanwhile, the deep political freeze between Moscow and major European capitals following the Ukraine crisis is easing, despite the election of French President       Emmanuel Macron,        who accused Russia of trying to undermine his campaign.Attention has gradually turned away from Ukraine to other crises, like the fight against terrorism, where Russia and the EU have at least some common ground.In April, EU foreign policy chief       Federica Mogherini       was one of several top European officials to visit Moscow recently for the first time since the Ukraine crisis. She returned with plans to restore regular bilateral meetings on foreign policy issues.Tensions with Russia over Syria have faded since the end of the large-scale Russian bombing of major cities like Aleppo. European diplomats are watching to see whether U.S. ties with Russia ease if Mr. Trump meets Mr. Putin on the sidelines of the Group of 20 leaders meeting in Germany next month.To be sure, the full sweep of trade, energy and political talks that took place between the EU and Russia before the Ukraine crisis no longer happens. Gone are the twice-yearly EU-Russia summits. The Kremlin remains locked out of what is now the Group of Seven leading economies.However, Russian diplomats are feeling more at home again in the EU capital.Opening a press briefing last month, Russia\u2019s EU ambassador,       Vladimir Chizhov,        pointed to the \u201cheavy program of contacts\u201d Mr. Putin was having with European leaders, including visits by German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       and Italian Prime Minister       Paolo Gentiloni.There was a time, Mr. Chizhov said, when \u201csome people in the West liked to talk about Russia being isolated on the world stage...I think an understanding has blossomed that we need dialogue.\u201dWrite to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 11:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-eu-preps-sanctions-extension-russia-adapts-1497782291", "news_title": "As EU Preps Sanctions Extension, Russia Adapts ", "keywords": " eu, merkel, putin,russia, russia sanctions, sanctions, vladimir putin,European Union,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers"}, {"content": "Some 100 fledgling companies will seek funding from legacy players during a special, weeklong event at the air extravaganza.Aerospace entrepreneurs and startups for the first time will have a prominent role at this year\u2019s Paris International Air Show, invading the turf of giant companies that previously enjoyed ultimate domination of the event.The presence of the newcomers ensconced in a dedicated meeting hall where they plan to make serial pitches for funding demonstrates that established players increasingly are looking to find innovation from such upstarts. From manufacturing breakthroughs to new designs to cutting-edge materials, the startups offer industry leaders different ways of looking at technology or operations.\u201cWe are just at the beginning of a new wave,\u201d says Francois Chopard, the founder and chief executive of Starburst Accelerator, which started operating some five years ago and is organizing the event. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an exponential trend, because so many more entrepreneurs than before want to enter into the process.\"Dozens of legacy companies including Airbus SE,             Boeing Co.Thales Group,Raytheon Co.       and             Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp.       over the years have paid Mr. Chopard\u2019s group for the privilege of listening to pitches and evaluating what each startup has to offer. Starbust, for its part, provides guidance to startups and conducts technical due diligence on prototypes or demonstrators. About two-thirds of the startups slated to seek funding in the coming week are based in France or the U.S.At previous air shows here and in Great Britain, the contingent of startups was much smaller and had a lower profile, according to Mr. Chopard. But this time, he says, \u201cour job is to put them squarely in front of big companies and venture capitalists.\u201dThe next step may be for the incubator to join forces with NASA or the Pentagon\u2019s advanced research arm to find a government outlet for some of its innovate concepts. Three months ago, Starburst hosted a smaller pitch session in Southern California, the home of many space startups. And\u00a0in a previously unimaginable move, a different association representing private space ventures is contemplating holding its own event during the show.Taken together, efforts to highlight these fledgling companies amount to the latest demonstration of how fast traditional players are reacting to the booming commercial space segment roiling the industry.Anne Bondiu-Clergerie, director of research for the French Aerospace Industries Association, the air show\u2019s sponsor, has likened the impending activities to \u201ca boarding pass for the future,\u201d because of \u201cthe abundance of projects, talents and new technologies\u201d that will be revealed.In an interview, Mr. Chopard revealed that his long-term goals include investing directly in the most promising startups.Ventures that have benefited from Starburst\u2019s connections include Airmap Inc., a Los Angeles-based provider of air-traffic control services for unmanned aircraft, and Arralis Ltd., an Irish startup providing antennas and broadcast expertise. Both companies managed to snare tens of millions of dollars in funding.Incubator officials point to Boom LLC, a Colorado startup planning to build a mini-supersonic airliner, as one of their shining success stories. Boom ultimately envisions a 45\u2013seat aircraft, called the XB-1, with a top speed of more than twice the speed of sound. With the help of Starburst, chief executive       Blake Scholl       has garnered more than $30 million in initial funding, and is pushing ahead with construction of a scaled-down demonstrator. Backers include billionaire       Richard Branson\u2019s       own space startup, Virgin Galactic LLC.\u201cWe\u2019re much closer to flight than anyone else,\u201d Mr. Scholl said in an interview last year.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 11:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aerospace-startups-see-stepped-up-role-at-paris-international-air-show-1497798699", "news_title": "Aerospace Startups See Stepped-Up Role at Paris International Air Show", "keywords": "aerospace innovation,aerospace startups,boom xb-1,london to new york flight time,paris air show,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014            Boeing\u2019s        BA 1.27%       commercial airplane boss sees big market potential for a new jetliner the company has been studying but still wants more time before committing billions of dollars to the project.The decision is among the most closely watched in the aerospace industry by airplane buyers, Boeing suppliers and rival             Airbus SE.       Boeing, in the process, may revamp how it builds and sells planes.\u201cWe do see a gap in the middle of the market between the single aisles and the twin-aisle\u201d planes,       Kevin McAllister       told reporters on the eve of the Paris Air Show, the aerospace industry\u2019s biggest gathering this year where plane makers and their suppliers hobnob with customers. Mr. McAllister said demand for such a plane could be up to around 4,000 aircraft.Still, Mr. McAllister, who joined Boeing from             General Electric Co.       in November, said he will not rush a decision. \u201cOur focus right now is: can we put together a business plan that makes sense,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d rather take the time to do it right.\u201dBoeing already has spent about three years talking to 57 potential customers about the prospective plane design. It would seat more than 200 passengers and be sized between Boeing\u2019s workhorse 737 single-aisle plane and the 787 Dreamliner long-range jetliner. The plane would enter service around 2025.Meanwhile, Boeing is expected to introduce this week a new, larger model of its 737 which would seat up to 230 passengers. \u201cWe have a lot of customers very interested in the aircraft,\u201d Mr. McAllister said.The larger, brand new plane would be aimed at flying trans-continental U.S. routes. Other potential uses include servicing trans-Atlantic city pairs that don\u2019t warrant a big plane, such as Washington to Prague.Mr. McAllister said the new model under study could be sold with a greater focus on services. Boeing also may rebalance the plane parts it builds itself rather buying from suppliers. The company may also take a new approach to how planes are put together.Customers are eager for Boeing to make a decision. \u201cWe have a gap with the aircraft available today from Boeing and Airbus,\u201d said       Christian McCormick,        managing director at China Aircraft Leasing Corp., though he is uncertain whether that gap warrants a new type of plane. \u201cWe are anxious what the results are and whether they consider the market is there,\u201d Mr. McCormick said.Other potential customers have also signaled interest.The aircraft under study would aim to replace the 757 jetliner Boeing delivered from 1982 to 2005. The replacement would be designed to seat 20% more passengers and fly 20% farther,       Randy Tinseth,        vice president of marketing for Boeing\u2019s commercial planes, said Friday.Boeing said the twin-aisle plane would be built largely using existing technologies.The jury is still out whether Boeing would select one engine provider or give buyers a choice. Engine makers said if they are the only supplier, they could offer Boeing a lower price.For plane buyers the equation looks different. \u201cThe best stimulation for excellence is competition,\u201d Mr. McCormick said, \u201cnot just for the engine but also airframe type\u201d signaling customers would like Airbus to offer a plane, too.Airbus has said it is happy with its current mix of products and would wait to see whether it needed to respond to a new Boeing plane.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 11:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-considers-spreading-wings-with-new-plane-1497798139", "news_title": "Boeing Considers Spreading Wings With New Plane ", "keywords": "boeing,boeing 737,boeing aircraft,boeing paris air show,paris air show,Boeing,BA,Airbus SE,AIR.FR,FR:AIR,General Electric,GE,Kevin McAllister,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,aerospace products,parts,civil aircraft,aerospace,defense,industrial goods"}, {"content": "The tumble of U.S. bond yields to 2017 lows this month is the latest sign that investors are losing faith that the Trump administration will succeed this year in implementing policies that will result in a broad increase over time in economic growth and inflation.For now, falling bond yields are helping to fuel fresh stock-market gains, as falling borrowing costs and a softening dollar loosen financial conditions. But many investors are concerned that falling inflation expectations and a flattening yield curve point to a slowdown ahead in a tepid recovery, reflecting both softening growth projections and weakening bank profits.Investors haven\u2019t given up hope. Banks and small caps, both of which are deemed likely to benefit from tax cuts and looser regulation, have moved up since former FBI Director       James Comey\u2019s       testimony showed no immediate risk to the Trump administration.

The retreat of the dollar and the scaling back of antitrade rhetoric have proven a tonic to the Mexican peso, which in the days after the U.S. election might well have been deemed the asset class least likely to succeed.WSJ subscribers can get The Daily Shot\u2014a chart-by-chart briefing on markets and economics\u2014sent to their email each morning.

More than 26,000 aircraft-related noise complaints were registered in 2016, up from about 24,000 the previous year, according to the town of East Hampton. Most come during the summer.Kathleen Cunningham,        who has lived in East Hampton for 40 years about 3 miles from East Hampton Airport, said she can feel the aircrafts coming.\u201cThe physical pulsing you can actually feel it in your chest when it\u2019s low enough,\u201d said Ms. Cunningham, who is chair of a group called the Quiet Skies Coalition. \u201cIt vibrates the house. It vibrates the glassware.\u201dAccording to the town, there are about 25,000 takeoffs and landings a year and more than 8,000 helicopter landings and departures at East Hampton Airport. Commercial airlines can\u2019t use the airport, which opened in the 1930s and sits about 5 miles west from town hall, but private jets can.Larry Cantwell,        the East Hampton town supervisor, said he and the town board want to keep the airport open, but are sensitive to residents\u2019 concerns. The roughly $5 million in annual revenue generated by the airport goes toward its budget, which generally is about the same, he noted.\u201cI love the airport. I hate the noise,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said. \u201cWe believe, with some local restrictions, we can help control the problem. And right now our hands are tied.\u201dOther East End communities grapple with air-traffic noise\u2014Southampton has a heliport, Westhampton Beach has a county-run airport and Montauk is home to a privately-owned airport.The town is limited in what it can do because of a legal fight that sits at the U.S. Supreme Court. The case landed there after air-charter operators sued the town, which owns the airport, in federal court in 2015 for setting morning and evening curfews on flights and limiting the number of trips certain aircraft can make. The limitations were enacted to address the noise complaints.The lower court sided in part with the town in 2015. The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the companies. The Supreme Court is considering reviewing the case.The legal debate rests on whether a federal-aviation law enacted by Congress in 1990 pre-empts East Hampton\u2019s ability to pass its own restrictions on air travel. The aviation companies contend this law pre-empts the town\u2019s control. The town disagrees.\u201cCongress perceived that a \u2018patchwork quilt\u2019 of local noise restrictions continued to stymie the airport development required for the nation\u2019s aviation\u201d when it passed a federal law regulating air traffic, the appeals court wrote in its November ruling.Attorneys for the aviation companies that sued the town declined to comment. In court papers to the Supreme Court, the attorneys said the quarrel is \u201cproperly addressed to Congress, not the Court.\u201dThe Supreme Court, which will recess at the end of June, could announce whether it will hear the town\u2019s appeal later this month, Mr. Cantwell said.The noise complaints started mounting a few years ago after ride-share apps made it easier to catch a helicopter ride, primarily from New York City, for a Hampton jaunt. Helicopter landings and departures increased to nearly 8,400 in 2014, up 47% from the previous year, according to court papers filed by the town.John Kelly,        director of operations for Shoreline Aviation, a firm that offers chartered seaplane service, said his company has flown into East Hampton for nearly four decades.\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can to mitigate our noise,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cWe fly at the highest altitude available depending on weather and safety.\u201dSome locals say there is only one solution.\u201cClose the airport,\u201d said       Patricia Currie       of the group Say No to KHTO, which is the airport code for the East Hampton Airport.\u201cThousands and thousands of people are impacted by this so that a handful can travel for convenience and to save themselves a couple of hours journey on the highway,\u201d said Ms. Currie, who lives in Noyack, N.Y., about 7 miles from the airport.Ms. Cunningham, whose glassware chatters when aircraft land, said the town should be able to set its own flying curfews because it owns the airport.\u201cEvery taxpayer in the town of East Hampton owns that airport,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said. \u201cThey should have a right to govern it as benefits the entire community, not just the flying public.\u201dIf the Supreme Court declines to hear the case, Mr. Cantwell said the town will ask the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to set restrictions. He concedes that both are long shots.So, for now, East Hampton will have to tolerate the noise\u2014and the complaints.Corrections & Amplifications   An earlier version of this article contained a caption incorrectly identifying a propeller plane as a jet.

What seems uncertain is just about everything else.Brian Harman, a 30-year-old lefty who has never so much as finished in the top 25 at a major, will tee off with the lead at 12 under par. The closest major champions on the leaderboard\u2014Sergio Garcia and Louis Oosthuizen\u2014are tied for 17th place at 4 under. In between are a slew of young players with a shot to overtake Harman, led by Justin Thomas, Tommy Fleetwood and Brooks Koepka at 11 under.Here are the top story lines to watch in the fourth round:How will Harman handle playing with the lead?To understand how improbable it is for Harman to be even in the conversation this late in the tournament, consider the following: He has played in the U.S. Open only twice before. Both times, he missed the cut. His best finish at a major is a tie for 26th place at the\u00a02014 British\u00a0Open. The high points on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 are two wins on the PGA Tour. One of them came just last month at the             Wells Fargo                   Championship, where he held off world No. 1 Dustin Johnson to win by one stroke. He has never been in a situation comparable to this one.\u201cI think everyone has doubts; everyone has fears,\u201d Harman said after shooting a 5-under-par 67 on Saturday. \u201cFor me, just trying to figure out what they are and kind of rationalize them and deal with them.\u201dWill one of golf\u2019s best young stars have his breakthrough moment?At just 24 years old, Thomas has emerged as one of the best players in the game. He has three wins on the PGA Tour already this season, and he has posted some staggeringly low scores. In January, he became the youngest player to shoot a 59. On Saturday, he posted the lowest U.S. Open score ever relative to par with a 9-under 63. The biggest threat to him winning Sunday may be the player with whom he is sharing a rental house this week: Rickie Fowler.Fowler, 28, has long been one of golf\u2019s most marketable young stars. He has five top-five finishes at majors. He took the early lead with an opening-round 65, but begins Sunday two strokes back at 10 under.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really cool day for someone,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to my shot at it.\u201dWill a winner emerge by the end of Sunday?Unlike in the other three majors, if two or more players are tied at the end of the fourth round, the U.S. Open makes no attempt to sort it out on Sunday. If that happens, the players would return for an 18-hole playoff on Monday. Not since the 2008 duel won by       Tiger Woods       over Rocco Mediate at Torrey Pines has the U.S. Open gone to a playoff. But a bunched leaderboard at Erin Hills going into Sunday raises the possibility. With three players just one stroke off the lead and eight players within four, 72 holes might not be enough.How will the course play?In its first year hosting the tournament, Erin Hills has proved to be nothing like the grind-for-par courses that typify the U.S. Open. Its wide fairways require strong winds to challenge players off the tee, and the wind has been a non-factor so far. That could change Sunday, with the wind speed forecast to exceed 20 mph for the first time since play began Thursday. But pretournament and overnight rains have kept the course soft all week, emboldening players to be more aggressive than usual, and they had their way with it Saturday. The third-round scoring average was just .01 over par, the lowest for a U.S. Open round on record since 1983.Will the U.S. Open scoring record survive?The lowest winning score ever at this tournament is 16 under par, shot by Rory McIlroy in 2011. Only one other player has ever finished the U.S. Open at double digits under par: Tiger Woods at 12 under in 2000. Though McIlroy was lower through 54 holes in 2011\u2014he began his final round at 14 under\u2014what makes it a question worth pondering is the sheer number of players already at double-digits below par. There are five of them, and if one starts reeling off birdies early in the fourth round, the record will come into play.Write to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 09:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-open-5-things-to-watch-on-sunday-1497792389", "news_title": "The U.S. Open: 5 Things to Watch on Sunday ", "keywords": "erin hills,u.s. open golf tournament,u.s. open records,u.s open final round,golf,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond sought to pour cold water on any notion that the ruling party\u2019s recent election setback could change Britain\u2019s negotiating stance in the coming Brexit talks, saying the U.K. would \u201cdefinitely\u201d leave the European Union\u2019s single market and customs union.With the first round of negotiations between the EU and the U.K. set to begin Monday, Mr. Hammond also struck a defiant tone against Brussels\u2019s financial demands, accusing it of \u201cegregious\u201d posturing.Prime Minister       Theresa May       last week held meetings with officials from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, seeking to hash out an alliance following her Conservative Party\u2019s failure to secure a majority in the election earlier this month.Critics have said the election result amounts to a rejection of her negotiation strategy, which envisaged a clean break with the bloc. Questions have also been raised over whether a deal with the DUP, which wants a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border with Ireland, could also change Britain\u2019s aims in negotiations.But speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday, Mr. Hammond said there would be no change in course.\u201cDefinitely, we\u2019re leaving the EU, and because we\u2019re leaving the EU we will be leaving the single market. And, by the way, we\u2019ll be leaving the customs union,\u201d he said.\u201cThe question is not whether we\u2019re leaving the customs union, the question is what do we put in its place in order to deliver the objectives\u2026of having no hard land border in Ireland and enabling British goods to flow freely, backwards and forwards across the border with the European Union,\u201d he said.Britain aims to secure a deal ensuring it can segue seamlessly from the customs union to the new arrangement, he said, with its main focus on avoiding bureaucratic delays at the U.K.-EU border. He said any potential tariffs are \u201ca relatively small part of the problem.\u201dMr. Hammond also hit back at EU officials, who say that the U.K. will have to pay about \u20ac55 billion to \u20ac60 billion ($61.6 billion to $67.2 billion) to leave the bloc, a \u201cdivorce bill\u201d covering a range of past commitments made by the U.K. that it hasn\u2019t paid for yet.\u201cI don\u2019t recognize these sums at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is the most egregious pre-negotiation posturing that I\u2019ve seen for a very long while.\u201dBeginning Monday, the talks will have to be completed and an agreement reached by the end of March 2019, unless all EU governments agree to an extension.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   EU officials have suggested the U.K. will have to pay about \u20ac55 billion to \u20ac60 billion ($61.6 billion to $67.2 billion) to leave the bloc.

Large medical providers.The former Atrium Mall in Chestnut Hill, Mass., has been repositioned as a wellness and medical facility that will include the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute as a tenant. The institute recently signed a 15-year lease for two floors of the 286,000-square-foot property, taking up 140,000 square feet of space.Dana-Farber expects to open the facility to patients in late 2019, providing clinical trials and patient care such as exams, infusions and supportive services for newly diagnosed adult cancer patients.Other tenants in the former mall, now called Life Time Center, include Life Time Athletic, a gym and wellness center, and a clinic for reproductive medicine. The Dana-Farber signing brings the center to more than 95% leased.For medical tenants, malls offer some advantages. Cancer-treatment centers house large equipment that requires sturdy structural support, and the ground floor of a converted mall offers a larger footprint than is typically available in a traditional medical office building, said       Eric Johnson,        national director of health care at real-estate services firm Transwestern Commercial Services LLC.What\u2019s more, malls are typically located along major transportation arteries, catching the eye of hospital workers and large physician networks, among others.\u201cThe Life Time Center location is ideal for our patients coming in from the west and south,\u201d said       Wendy Gettleman,        vice president of facilities management and real estate at Dana-Farber.\u00a0\u201cIt is both a satellite location and close enough to our main campus to allow us to look at this as a clinical growth solution for our Yawkey Center that will soon be at capacity.\u201d She added that the location is convenient for staff who commute to and from Dana-Farber\u2019s main campus.The oversupply of retail space and fast-changing consumer preferences are prompting many shopping-center tenants to rethink how much real estate they need. That, in turn, is forcing landlords to expand the definition of shopping mall to include other pursuits that in decades past wouldn\u2019t have fallen under their purview, such as medical care.Jackson Medical Mall in Jackson, Miss., might have been one of the first malls to bring in medical tenants. The property was repurposed in the late 1990s into a medical facility and now houses the University of Mississippi Medical Center Cancer Institute and offers radiation and oncology services, among other medical treatments. The trend is gathering pace now as more physicians expand their practices and look for locations that are convenient for patients and provide ample parking.The Maury Regional Cancer Center has been a tenant of Columbia Mall in Columbia, Tenn., since 2012. In Nashville, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center operates Vanderbilt Health at One Hundred Oaks mall, where it has been an anchor tenant in the mixed-use property since 2009. The Biggs Park Mall in Lumberton, N.C., counts Southeastern Regional Medical Center among its tenants. And in California, UCLA Health offers primary health care at the Village at Westfield Topanga in Woodland Hills.Some landlords are adding medical centers to complement the existing retail tenant mix, while others such as Atrium are narrowing their focus, marketing their properties as specializing in health care. There isn\u2019t a fixed formula for success; property owners need to adapt to factors such as demographics and other economic drivers in the market.\u201cWe have been very pleased with the performance of [One Hundred Oaks mall], driven in large part by the built-in traffic generated from the Vanderbilt University Medical System,\u201d said       Jim Garvey,        portfolio manager of LaSalle Property Fund, which purchased the mall five years ago.The once-failing mall is now 98% occupied, with Vanderbilt Health occupying 450,000 square feet, or about half of the total gross leasable area at the property. And Mr. Garvey said co-tenants such as             Ulta Beauty,       Chipotle and Skechers are benefiting from the consistent traffic from medical center employees, patients and visitors.The Atrium in Chestnut Hill once had tenants such as             Abercrombie & Fitch,       Pottery Barn and the Cheesecake Factory, before hard times hit. In 2012, with occupancy at 20%, the Bulfinch Companies Inc., a private real-estate investment, development and management firm, purchased the property for $46 million. It closed the mall a year later, and gutted the building and reskinned it with a glass facade. The company also repaved the 1,000-space parking garage, added a tracking system to better inform drivers about the availability of parking space on each level, and converted the loading dock area into a medical service area. Redeveloping the property cost more than $100 million, according to the Bulfinch Companies.With Life Time Center\u2019s proximity to the Longwood Medical Area in Boston, the Bulfinch Companies said having a medical and wellness tenant mix would work in tandem neighboring properties in the area.\u201cWe see the location of this property as a natural extension to the Longwood Medical Area, a thriving medical community that features some of the country\u2019s leading institutions,\u201d said       Eric Schlager,        chief executive officer of the Bulfinch Companies.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-light-shopping-with-your-drug-infusion-1497787203", "news_title": "Some Light Shopping With Your Drug Infusion?", "keywords": "anderbilt university medical center ,atrium mall,biggs park mall ,bulfinch companies,columbia mall,dana-farber cancer institute,dead malls,life time center,malls,maury regional cancer center,medical centers,one hundred oaks mall,shopping malls,southeastern regional medical center,the village at westfield topanga,ucla health,vanderbilt university medical center ,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,Vanderbilt University,Bulfinch Companies,Life Time Center,Maury Regional Cancer Center,UCLA,University of Mississippi Medical Center Cancer Institute,Yawkey Center,Eric Johnson,Jim Garvey,Wendy Gettleman,political,general news,health,real estate,property,renting,letting,pharmaceuticals,building construction,retail construction,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,superstores,real estate transactions,health care,life sciences,commercial,industrial real estate,construction"}, {"content": "TOKYO\u2014Two investigations\u2014one American and one Japanese\u2014are set into the collision between a U.S. destroyer and a container ship, but it isn\u2019t clear whether either will have the authority to unearth all the facts.Clouding the investigations is a bilateral treaty on the status of American forces in Japan. The treaty gives the U.S. jurisdiction over \u201coffenses arising out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty\u201d even if the offenses take place on Japanese territory.That language likely applies to the collision that took place early Saturday off Japan\u2019s Izu Peninsula between the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship chartered by shipping line             Nippon Yusen K.K.      , said former Japanese military officials. The bodies of seven U.S. service members have been recovered from the Fitzgerald, U.S. officials said.The accident took place in Japan\u2019s territorial waters, according to the nation\u2019s coast guard, which said it opened an investigation into whether one or both sides were negligent in their duty to avoid dangerous navigation.Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, said he had also ordered a full investigation into the cause of the collision.For any investigation, key questions would include whether U.S. sailors were following procedures to detect ships in the neighborhood. If they weren\u2019t, that could be an \u201comission done in the performance of official duty\u201d\u2014the type of offense over which Japan doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction, according to the treaty.Vice Adm. Aucoin said the U.S. would \u201cwork hand in hand with our Japanese partners\u201d in the investigation. Asked whether the U.S. Navy would make the Fitzgerald\u2019s crew available to Japanese authorities for questioning, Vice Adm. Aucoin didn\u2019t answer directly, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re going to cooperate with all the stakeholders in this, especially the Japanese.\u201dA spokesman for the Japanese coast guard said his side has requested cooperation from the U.S. side and discussions are continuing, but no conclusion has been reached.\u201cThis is an accident that happened during the performance of official duty,\u201d said Kyoji Yanagisawa, a former top official in Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry. \u201cBasically, Japan can\u2019t get involved.\u201dAt the same time, the U.S. Navy doesn\u2019t have the same powers as Japan to get information from the other ship in the collision, the ACX Crystal container ship, which unloaded cargo in Tokyo\u2019s port on Sunday. The Japanese coast guard said it interviewed the container ship\u2019s Filipino crew members and an official of the Japan Transport Safety Board said it was examining the damage on the ship.The U.S.-Japan treaty, which dates to 1960, includes a clause anticipating a politically sensitive situation. The U.S. should \u201cgive sympathetic consideration to a request\u201d for a waiver of its jurisdiction if Japan \u201cconsiders such waiver to be of particular importance,\u201d the clause says.Japan might make such a request if its own citizens were harmed, but that wasn\u2019t the case in this collision, Mr. Yanagisawa said.Yoji Koda, a retired vice admiral in Japan\u2019s navy, said he expected Japanese authorities ultimately wouldn\u2019t be able to interview the U.S. crew members directly.\u2014Alastair Gale and Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.Write to Peter Landers at peter.landers@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 07:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treaty-gives-u-s-not-japan-upper-hand-in-probe-1497785378", "news_title": "Treaty Gives U.S., Not Japan, Upper Hand in Probe ", "keywords": " destroyer, japan,navy ship collision, sailors, ship accident,uss fitzgerald,Nippon Yusen K.K.,9101.TO,JP:9101,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,disasters,accidents,man-made disasters,navy,transport accidents,transport,marine transport,water transport,shipping,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "ISLAMABAD\u2014Pakistan\u2019s ruling power structure has long been summed up with the saying \u201cAllah, Army and America.\u201dChina is now staking a claim to supplanting the U.S. with tens of billions of dollars of investment, an embrace that promises Pakistan economic benefits and saddles it with debt\u2014ensuring the relationship will last.Chinese President       Xi Jinping       has made Pakistan his flagship partner in a program to spread Chinese-built infrastructure\u2014and Beijing\u2019s sway\u2014across Asia and beyond. Pakistan has so far signed on to $55 billion in Chinese projects, many of them guaranteeing China a high return on its investments and granting tax breaks to Chinese companies.Former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       \u201cAsia pivot\u201d is giving way to Mr. Xi\u2019s infrastructure juggernaut, in a model that could be replicated across the region.\u201cChina came in when no one else was willing to invest,\u201d said Commerce Minister Khurram Dastagir. The U.S. missed its chance, he said.Beijing calls its program \u201cOne Belt One Road,\u201d referring to the ancient sea and land Silk Road trade routes that China seeks to revive. Pakistan Prime Minister       Nawaz Sharif       inaugurated the program\u2019s first big completed project here in late May, a Chinese-built, coal-fired power plant in his home province of Punjab.China is building roads, railways, power plants and a port, and has lent Pakistan $2 billion in under two years to shore up its foreign-exchange reserves.A promised $1 trillion Chinese splurge hasn\u2019t yet materialized for many countries. But in Pakistan, $18 billion in projects are under construction in what is known as the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.The centerpiece is Pakistan\u2019s Arabian Sea port at Gwadar, under expansion and run by a Chinese company to enable trade in goods from China\u2019s southwest.Pakistan calculates that the Chinese investments will add 2 percentage points to growth in the next few years by providing infrastructure needed to kick-start industrialization.President Donald Trump has abandoned what was viewed by the Obama administration as a counterbalance to China, a trade deal with nations in the region called Trans Pacific Partnership. An American official said civilian aid to Pakistan, a longtime ally, remained substantial but \u201cgetting our message out is a challenge.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese are winning the perceptions game, whatever the reality. That then leads to political outcomes, because people see the inevitability of China\u2019s rise and China\u2019s power,\u201d said       Ely Ratner       of the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent U.S. think tank.While Washington\u2019s approach in Asia is military-led, Beijing is binding countries to its interests with economics, said Mr. Ratner.At a Chinese celebration of its belt and road plan in Beijing in May,       Matt Pottinger,        senior director for East Asia at the National Security Council, welcomed the initiative but called for Beijing to \u201censure that privately owned companies can bid in a fair process.\u201dThat means that American businesses should be allowed to compete for contracts, U.S. officials said.There is little sign of that in Pakistan. Islamabad chooses bidders from an all-Chinese short-list provided by Beijing. Pakistani officials say this is because Chinese companies bring their own financing.The U.S. has asked to participate in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, but nothing has come of it, one of the American officials said.Much as the U.S. secured the Pakistan alliance with aid to the country\u2019s powerful military, China has made the Pakistani army a beneficiary. Many construction contracts that weren\u2019t given to Chinese firms have been awarded to the military\u2019s engineering arm. The military has raised a special force, now at 15,000 and set to double in size, to protect Chinese projects.Since 2001, Islamabad has received $33 billion in U.S. military and civilian aid, according to the Congressional Research Service. But U.S. aid hasn\u2019t yielded any high-profile infrastructure projects in Pakistan, and Pakistani officials say that joining America\u2019s war on terror has cost it $123 billion in economic losses and tens of thousands of lives.\u201cWe want to move away from geopolitics, to geoeconomics, from fighting wars for others,\u201d said       Ahsan Iqbal,        Pakistan\u2019s planning minister, who oversees the Chinese investment. \u201cOur vision is to place Pakistan as the hub of trade and commerce in this region.\u201dChina\u2019s expenditure isn\u2019t aid.

But on display will be President Donald Trump\u2019s evolving relationship with America\u2019s corporate chieftains.Some 300 business leaders have met with       Mr. Trump       since he took office promising the nation\u2019s top executives a direct line to the Oval Office and a chance to shape economic policy. The discussions have helped the president project an image of CEO-in-chief as he awaits a major legislative victory and have given CEOs a voice in initiatives like the administration\u2019s push to expand apprenticeship programs.But corporate leaders are learning about the limits of their clout. Hopes for an overhaul of the corporate-tax code this year are fading, some executives and corporate lobbyists say, as the White House and lawmakers struggle to reach consensus on a plan that could get through Congress. Mr. Trump\u2019s move to quit the Paris climate accord has been a stinging lesson for some that White House face time doesn\u2019t always translate into influence.Dozens of business leaders urged the president publicly and privately to keep the U.S. in the climate agreement; many were taken aback when he rejected their pro-business case for upholding the deal, people involved in the lobbying effort say.Even Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s elder daughter and one of his senior advisers, bet CEOs could sway her father. According to people familiar with the effort, she appealed to             Dow Chemical Co.       head       Andrew Liveris       and             Apple Inc.       chief       Tim Cook       to make the case directly to the president.Monday\u2019s meeting, five months into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, is shaping up as a gauge of the value of these sessions to business leaders. Some, including             International Business Machines Corp.       CEO       Ginni Rometty       and Apple\u2019s Mr. Cook, have faced public or employee pressure not to attend such meetings.Tanya Meck, a partner at Global Strategy Group, a Washington-based public affairs firm whose client roster has included             Comcast Corp.      , Airbnb Inc. and             Microsoft Corp.      , said some chief executives are weighing those factors before accepting White House invitations.\u201cIt is very much an individual decision,\u201d Ms. Meck said.The White House talks, framed as listening sessions, often turn casual and wide-ranging once cameras leave the room. Participants describe a president who absorbs information from the volley of conversation rather than from dense briefing binders.\u201cHe\u2019s a business guy, so he\u2019s in his element.\u201d said       James Kamsickas,        CEO of automotive supplier             Dana Inc.       and a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s manufacturing-jobs council.The White House sent participants a memo laying out Monday\u2019s agenda. An early draft solicited ideas for making government \u201coperate like a modern technology enterprise.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re 10 to 20 years behind in a lot of technology,\u201d said       Chris Liddell,        a former chief financial officer at             General Motors Co.       and Microsoft who helps manage the White House\u2019s business relationships.Executives expected to attend Monday\u2019s session include heads of             Amazon.com Inc.,       Apple, Microsoft and Google parent             Alphabet Inc.Notably absent will be             Tesla Inc.\u2019s       CEO,       Elon Musk,        who attended a similar tech-leader roundtable at Trump Tower in December. Mr. Musk quit his role in business councils that advise the president after Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris accord.             Salesforce.com Inc.       leader       Marc Benioff      \u2014who tweeted he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in the Paris withdrawal\u2014is no longer coming to the Monday session as planned because of a scheduling conflict after the meeting date was changed, according to a person familiar with the matter.White House officials say they have received an enthusiastic response from executives who see the overall effort to improve government efficiency as an apolitical goal. \u201cModernizing government services is not politicized,\u201d Mr. Liddell said in an interview in his West Wing office.Upon his arrival at the White House, Mr. Liddell said, he was surprised to learn that various federal agencies still use the computer-programming language known as Cobol. Mr. Liddell said he first learned the language in the 1970s as an engineering student. \u201cIt\u2019s that old!\u201d a White House aide said.Most business leaders say they remain committed to advising the president and see the sessions as a way to learn how Mr. Trump ticks. Though he campaigned on his success as a businessman, Mr. Trump wasn\u2019t well known to most CEOs outside New York before his election.Another factor keeping CEOs at the table: the narrowing window many see for legislating policies to boost competitiveness, particularly on corporate taxes.\u201cThere\u2019s a real priority to get that done while there\u2019s [Republican] alignment in Congress and the White House,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the business group Partnership for New York City, who led some 50 CEOs to Pennsylvania Avenue in April. Right now, \u201cthe issues at stake are just too important to withdraw from the conversation.\u201dThere have been disappointments. At the meeting with the New York CEOs, Mr. Trump acknowledged their concerns about any tax-reform bill that eliminated state and local-tax deductions, a painful prospect for New York and other states with high taxes.\u201cWe\u2019re all lucky that I\u2019m from New York because in some ways New York has unique problems,\u201d he told them. Yet, when the White House presented the first rough outline of its tax proposal a few weeks later, it called for taking away the deductions.On occasion, business leaders have prompted an about-face from Mr. Trump. During the campaign, he vowed to shut down the Export-Import Bank, calling its financing unnecessary. But he softened after a conversation with             Boeing Co.       CEO       Dennis Muilenburg,        according to people familiar with the matter. And in an April interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump reversed himself, calling the bank important for small companies.Mr. Trump has also used meetings to bolster his agenda. At a March meeting with heads of trucking companies, White House officials asked them to bring a couple of big rigs onto the South Lawn, where the president spontaneously climbed into a cab and posed for pictures.Inside the White House, CEOs pressed for a gas tax increase to help fund Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to spur $1 trillion in highway and other infrastructure spending. Weeks later, Mr. Trump said he was open to the tax increase, citing the trucking chiefs\u2019 support.\u2014Ted Mann and Yoree Koh contributed to this article.Write to Vanessa Fuhrmans at vanessa.fuhrmans@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Puts Tech\u2019s Clout to Test Trump to Meet With Tech Leaders.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ceos-have-access-to-trump-but-do-they-have-clout-1497783602", "news_title": "CEOs Have Access to Trump, \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tbut Do They Have Clout?", "keywords": "ceos,economic policy,oval office,white house,Salesforce.com,CRM,Mr. Trump,Kathryn Wylde,Ginni Rometty,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,computer services,real estate transactions,business,consumer services,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "The start of the Philadelphia dance sound of the 1970s can be traced back 45 years to the Spinners\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll Be Around.\u201d The song\u2019s rollicking conga-infused backbeat would become the inspiration for many Philly disco hits that followed.When \u201cI\u2019ll Be Around\u201d was released in August \u201872, it appeared on the B-side of a Spinners\u2019 single. After radio DJs discovered the song, it climbed to #3 on the Billboard pop chart that fall and to #1 on the R&B chart.Recently, the song\u2019s co-writer and producer Thom Bell (who received a Grammy Trustees Award this year), the song\u2019s lyricist Phil Hurtt and drummer Earl Young talked about the influential hit\u2019s evolution. Edited from interviews.Thom Bell: One Friday afternoon in early \u201872, I was at Philadelphia\u2019s Sigma Sound Studios producing a Stylistics record. When we finished, Vince Montana, a superb percussionist and a friend, started teasing me.\u201cMan, Thommy, I bet you can\u2019t write a simple song with three chords, like the old doo-wop stuff.\u201d I laughed and said, \u201cDoo-wop was nice, Vince, but we\u2019ve evolved.\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, but I still bet you can\u2019t do it. You need three legs to dance to some of this stuff.\u201dBack at my office that evening, I couldn\u2019t shake Vince\u2019s challenge. I turned to my piano and played a series of three-chord combinations. Eventually I landed on E major 7, G sharp minor and F sharp major 6 (Mr. Bell illustrates on the piano).I realized I had the start of a song for Bobby Smith, the Spinners\u2019 lead singer. The Spinners had just signed with Atlantic, and I was producing two songs for them\u2014\u201cHow Could I Let You Get Away\u201d and \u201cJust You and Me Baby.\u201d I wanted a third, for insurance.What I loved about Bobby\u2019s voice is that he had an unusual vibrato and rarely sang on the beat. The melody and rhythm that I came up with was perfect for his voice. When I was done, I needed a lyric. But there was a problem.My writing partner, lyricist Linda Creed, was leaving on her honeymoon and I couldn\u2019t wait until she returned. The Spinners were coming into the studio that Tuesday to try out all three songs.So the next morning, on Saturday, I went into my office and found lyricist Phil Hurtt, Bunny Sigler\u2019s writing partner, in another office.I played Phil the song on the piano. Then I gave him a cassette tape of me playing piano and humming the melody.I told Phil the title I had in mind\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll Be Around\u201d\u2014which was based on my melody. I didn\u2019t tell him what kind of storyline I wanted. I left that to him.Phil Hurtt: That evening, I was watching the 76ers basketball game with the sound down and listening to Thommy\u2019s tape. I started writing the lyric based on his title.As soon as I came up with the first line, \u201cThis is our fork in the road,\u201d the rest came fast. (Mr. Hurtt sings a verse): \u201cYou made your choice, now it\u2019s up to me / To bow out gracefully /Though you hold the key, but baby / Whenever you call me, I\u2019ll be there.\u201dMy lyric was about a guy who loves his girl but he understands that she\u2019s confused and wants to date someone else. Instead of getting angry, he lets her go. He\u2019s hurt, but he\u2019s betting she\u2019ll come back.He\u2019s giving her space and offers a safety net. He knows there isn\u2019t much he can do if she wants to leave. His play is to be there if things don\u2019t work out for her. It was an unusual theme then from a guy\u2019s perspective.Mr. Bell: As soon as I heard Phil\u2019s opening lines\u2014\u201cThis, is our fork in the road / Love\u2019s last episode / There\u2019s nowhere to go, oh no\u201d\u2014I loved it.The romantic storyline was perfect for the Spinners. Now that I had the song\u2019s words, I wanted to be sure the song worked for the guys. The Spinners had a distinct, vulnerable sound.When Bobby and the Spinners came in that Tuesday, I played piano and sang Phil\u2019s words. Then Bobby and I went over the lead vocal part.Once he was set, I worked with the rest of the Spinners. I sang each of the background notes I wanted them to sing, and they tried them out. Before they left, I recorded each Spinner singing his part and gave them each a tape.They had just come off the road and were heading home to Detroit for two weeks to rest. By practicing their parts at home, we\u2019d save time and money when they came back to record.When the Spinners left, I began writing and arranging the basic rhythm-track arrangement. After I finished, I brought the musicians in to record.On the intro, I had Norman Harris open with three notes using octaves on his guitar resolving in an E major 7 chord. Then I answered his line with three chords on the Clavinet, which sounds like an electrified harpsichord.I wanted the Spinners to record more uptempo dance stuff, so I had the drummer, Earl Young, emphasize the second and fourth beats. The flavor he came up with was fantastic. It became the start of the Philly dance beat that was adapted for many disco hits that came later.Earl Young: As a session drummer, I had to have a thousand different beats in my head. I didn\u2019t do solos or stick-spinning stuff. I played grooves. My job was to come up with a beat that made the lead vocalist want to sing, so you could hear that energy and excitement in his voice.On \u201cI\u2019ll Be Around,\u201d I created a medium-tempo dance beat. I hit the snare and floor tom-tom at the same time on the second and fourth beats to give them a fatter sound.Meanwhile, I played what I call my \u201cIndian beat\u201d on the bass drum\u2014two hits on the first beat and a one hit on the second, repeating the pattern on the third and fourth beats. This gave the song its groove.Mr. Bell: When the Spinners came in to record, they put on headphones and added their vocals to the rhythm track. Once the vocal track was combined with the rhythm track, it was time to overdub the horns.After I recorded their parts, Don Renaldo and his strings overdubbed my \u201csweetening\u201d arrangement. Then I overdubbed myself playing tambourine on the second and fourth beats to add a little shimmer.I also added female background vocals. The Spinners were great, but they had low voices. The song needed a greater vocal range. I auditioned about 20 singers and hired Barbara Ingram, Evette Benton and Carla Benson. They were students at Glassboro State College in New Jersey. I found them through my first wife, who was best friends with Barbara\u2019s big sister.This was the first time I used female background singers with the Spinners. After \u201cI\u2019ll Be Around,\u201d I used them on everything I produced. They became known as the \u201cSweethearts of Sigma.\u201dBy the end of the year, with \u201cI\u2019ll Be Around\u201d a hit, Atlantic had me produce the rest of the tracks for \u201cSpinners,\u201d the group\u2019s first album for the label, released in April 1973.Mr. Hurtt: The first time I heard \u201cI\u2019ll Be Around\u201d on the radio, I loved it. The only change I noticed in my lyric was the addition of the word \u201conce\u201d: \u201cAnd love can burn once again, but I know you know.\u201dI didn\u2019t write that word in my original lyric. Bobby Smith must have added it so the line would be easier to sing at that tempo. Hey, it worked.My kids called the song tuition. In the 1980s, they were in college, and whenever they heard it, they\u2019d call and say \u201cHey, dad, chich-ching!\u201dMr. Bell: In November \u201872, I saw Vince Montana at one of my recording sessions. I said, \u201cHey, remember that three-chord song you said I couldn\u2019t write? \u2018I\u2019ll Be Around\u2019 is #1 on the R&B chart and #3 on the pop side.\u201dVince looked down, shook his head and just laughed. Hey, if Vince hadn\u2019t challenged me that day, I probably never would have written that song.", "news_time": "2017-06-18 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-story-behind-ill-be-around-1497783606", "news_title": "The Story Behind \u2018I\u2019ll Be Around\u2019", "keywords": "anatomy of a song,i'll be around,the spinners,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014For more than a year, American diplomats have held secret talks in Pyongyang and European cities with North Korea\u2019s top nuclear negotiator, hoping to free U.S. prisoners and even establish a diplomatic channel to constrain North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.The official dispatched by North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un      \u2014      Madame Choi Sun Hee      \u2014is well known to U.S. officials, fluent in English and is believed to have direct access to Mr. Kim. That raised expectations that the regime eventually might engage with the Trump administration about the future of Pyongyang\u2019s weapons efforts. So did the agreed release this month of 22-year-old American prisoner      Otto Warmbier,        until it emerged he was in a coma.\u201cGiven the reported status of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s condition, any diplomatic path forward is going to be extremely difficult,\u201d said       Suzanne DiMaggio       of the New America Foundation, a Washington think tank, who helped establish an unofficial channel with the North Koreans early last year. But she had a suggestion for Pyongyang to begin to repair the damage: \u201cIf the North Koreans immediately released the remaining three prisoners, it could set up an atmosphere for potentially serious talks.\u201dPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly said he isn\u2019t seeking regime change in North Korea and hasn\u2019t ruled out negotiations to curb North Korea\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear and ballistic-missile programs.Still, there is concern inside the U.S. government about Mr. Warmbier\u2019s health and his treatment by North Korean guards during 18 months in custody. He was returned to the U.S. in a coma, and doctors said he has lost an extensive amount of brain tissue.Early last year, Ms. DiMaggio established through interlocutors in Stockholm a \u201ctrack two\u201d dialogue with North Korea, a term reflecting the fact no active U.S. officials were present at the initial meetings. She made the first of two trips to the North Korean capital in February 2016, in an early bid to help defuse the nuclear crisis.Ms. DiMaggio has long worked to establish diplomatic channels to countries in conflict with the U.S. She held numerous track two discussions with Iranian officials before the Obama administration formally started nuclear negotiations with Tehran in 2012.Madame Choi was a major player in nuclear and missile negotiations that took place both during the       Bill Clinton       and       George W. Bush       administrations, current and former U.S. officials said. Her official title now is the director-general of the North America affairs bureau of North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry.\u201cWhen Track Two participants meet with her, what they\u2019re getting is someone who can convey very accurately to us what the North Koreans want us to hear,\u201d said Robert Einhorn, a former senior State Department official who worked on North Korea in the Obama and Clinton administrations and met Madame Choi last month. \u201cShe\u2019s a valuable interlocutor because of her experience and connections.\u201dBill Richardson,        the former New Mexico governor and U.S. energy secretary, separately began a string of about 20 meetings with North Korean diplomats in New York at about the same time as Ms. DiMaggio\u2019s trips that were focused on gaining Mr. Warmbier\u2019s release. The North Koreans\u2019 favorite spot for meetings was The Palm steakhouse in New York, close to their United Nations offices.Mr. Richardson sent his own representative to Pyongyang last September to seek Mr. Warmbier\u2019s release. \u201c[Mr. Warmbier\u2019s] situation will temper the desire for dialogue for the time being,\u201d said Mr. Richardson, a self-proclaimed champion of engagement. \u201cI\u2019m so unhappy and disgusted by what\u2019s happened to him.\u201dThe Obama administration had largely frozen direct contacts with North Korea in a policy that became known as \u201cstrategic patience.\u201dThe two sides reached a preliminary agreement in 2012 that called for Pyongyang to freeze its missile tests in return for the U.S. shipping food aid to the country. But the deal collapsed after the North test-fired what it claimed was a rocket for a civilian satellite program.Obama administration officials grumbled that any agreements with Pyongyang appeared futile.Mr. Richardson has held negotiations with North Korean officials on prisoner issues dating back to the 1990s, when he was a congressman and then-President Clinton\u2019s ambassador to the U.N. But he said the dynamic of his encounters has changed under the rule of Mr. Kim, who took power in late 2011.North Korean Foreign Ministry officials, he said, aren\u2019t as aware of developments in Pyongyang as they were under Mr. Kim\u2019s father and grandfather, the previous leaders of the communist country. The issue of American prisoners, Mr. Richardson said, appeared now to be totally under the mandate of the North\u2019s security forces.\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable my interlocutors didn\u2019t even know about Otto Warmbier\u2019s status,\u201d Mr. Richardson said in an interview.Following Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the official and nonofficial American contacts with the North Koreans started to merge, said U.S. officials and participants in the dialogue.The State Department\u2019s special representative for North Korea,       Joseph Yun,        was first scheduled to attend a meeting with Madame Choi and other North Korean diplomats in New York this February, these officials said.But the Trump administration canceled the North Koreans\u2019 visas at the last minute after Mr. Kim\u2019s half brother was assassinated in Malaysia. The U.S. believed the killing was state-sanctioned, a charge Pyongyang has denied.In May, Mr. Yun attended a meeting with Madame Choi in Oslo that was organized by Ms. DiMaggio and the Norwegian government. It largely focused on the status of the American prisoners.Mr. Yun and Madame Choi had dinner and a two-hour meeting in the Norwegian capital. But the senior North Korean diplomat didn\u2019t provide any details about Mr. Warmbier\u2019s declining health, according to senior U.S. officials. She did promise to provide access to American prisoners in North Korea, using Swedish diplomats in Pyongyang.Madame Choi told reporters in Beijing after leaving Norway that Pyongyang would be willing to meet U.S. officials for talks on the nuclear issue \u201cif the conditions are set.\u201dAmericans who have met Madame Choi said the North Korea diplomat is steadfast that Pyongyang will maintain its nuclear weapons arsenal but is open to the possibility of limiting it. \u201cThey have not ruled out partial steps, like a cap or freeze as a temporary measure,\u201d said Mr. Einhorn, who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey don\u2019t attack that; nor do they says it\u2019s acceptable.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until June 6 that North Korea invited Mr. Yun for a direct meeting in New York with Pyongyang\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., according to the State Department. It was here that the U.S. finally was notified that Mr. Warmbier was in a coma.The revelation resulted in Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson\u2019s       decision to send a diplomatic and medical team to Pyongyang to bring the University of Virginia student home.Three Americans remain in North Korean prisons.\u2014Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.comAppeared in the June 19, 2017, print edition as 'Negotiators in Secret Talks.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-north-korean-nuclear-negotiator-secretly-met-with-u-s-diplomats-1497783603", "news_title": "Top North Korean Nuclear Negotiator Secretly Met With U.S. Diplomats", "keywords": " choi sun hee, donald trump,north korea, north korea nuclear,otto warmbier, secret talks,New America Foundation,Kim Jong Un,Bill Richardson,Joseph Yun,Choi Hee Sun,Suzanne DiMaggio,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,international relations,nuclear weapons programs,politics,domestic politics,risk news,government bodies,executive branch,military action,state department,weapons programs,dj exclusive news - all"}, {"content": "Madison Avenue has a new power player: Arthur Sadoun.Mr. Sadoun       was installed earlier this month as the new chief executive of advertising giant             Publicis Groupe SA        PUBGY 0.55%      .

We have to overcome the fragmentation that now makes marketing splintered. We must be delivering expertise in technology and data and think very broadly about creativity.WSJ: Have Google and Facebook done enough to calm the concerns marketers have about brand safety and measurement?Mr. Sadoun: We\u2019ve been pleased to see Google and Facebook\u2019s recent efforts in this area. But there is a lot more they will need to do. Clients are worried by the lack of transparency on how and where their marketing messages are distributed and/or seen, how the algorithms work and the \u2018just trust us\u2019 approach. Today, leveraging data is key to marketing, but the limited amount of data clients get back about their [marketing] programs and the lack of a true ability to work across platforms, like they can do on the open internet, is a problem. It\u2019s the clients\u2019 money and data after all. We need a lot more access.WSJ: Publicis recently wrote down the value of Sapient, a digital-technology company. What\u2019s been the biggest challenge?Mr. Sadoun: The premium we paid for Sapient was not completely justified due to slower growth than we had anticipated. So we reflected this slower growth by taking this noncash charge. The struggles for growth, partly, came from us underestimating how difficult it is to get technologists and marketing working together. They are different cultures. We have been winning business and seeing momentum globally.WSJ: There is a real lack of trust between agencies and marketers following the Association of National Advertisers\u2019 probe that discovered a lack of transparency in the way agencies conduct business. How can ad companies repair the relationships?Mr. Sadoun: At Publicis, we believe any areas of conflict of interest must be eliminated right away and clients should never feel that there is any part of the process that they do not have transparency into. While we have passed all the audits to date, we remain committed to reaffirming a trusted and principled relationship.WSJ: There has been a huge rise in populism around the world. What does that mean for marketers?Mr. Sadoun: We have to acknowledge that there is almost everywhere in the world a middle class that is really in pain. This is something that we need to take into account at the political level, but also in the way we communicate. It has never been so important to make sure that whatever you do, you make people understand what you bring into their day-to-day life. This is what we are trying to do with our clients. A brand that is strong is a brand that is playing a concrete role in people\u2019s life.WSJ: Where will ad companies be in five years?Mr. Sadoun: The one prediction I will make is that there is likely to be more changes in our industry in the next five years than in the past 20.Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-publicis-chief-arthur-sadoun-takes-on-a-turbulent-era-1497778202", "news_title": "New Publicis Chief Arthur Sadoun Takes On a Turbulent Era", "keywords": "advertising,cannes advertising,cannescmo,cannes lions,digital advertising,facebook,google,publicis ceo,Alphabet Inc.

Known as \u201cprogrammatic\u201d ad buying, it is now the way the vast majority of digital display ads are sold.Programmatic advertising allows the buyer to target consumers across thousands of sites, based on their browsing history or shopping habits or demographics. Doing so is more cost-effective than buying more expensive ads on a handful of well-known sites.But marketers don\u2019t fully control whether their ads will show up in places they would rather avoid: sites featuring pornography, pirated content, fake news, videos supporting terrorists, or outlets whose traffic is artificially generated by computer programs.The confusion stems from the convoluted infrastructure of the ad-technology world: a maze of agencies, ad networks, exchanges, publisher platforms and vendors. Instead of buying space on websites, brands can buy audiences\u2014categories of people\u2014and their ads are placed on sites those people visit.The problems arise when those people are on sites where brands don\u2019t wish to appear.As the issues pile up, marketers are taking action, with the help of companies that independently verify that their ads aren\u2019t going to toxic locations. Brands are cutting down their purchase of ads through open exchanges\u2014public pools of ad space from hundreds of thousands of sites\u2014opting instead for methods that give them more visibility into where ads are appearing.On open exchanges, it \u201cjust becomes harder and harder to figure out if your ad is showing up in a legitimate ad experience,\u201d said       Kristi Argyilan,        senior vice president of marketing at retailer             Target Corp.Marketers have been dealing with these issues for years. But the \u201cbrand safety\u201d risks in digital advertising have hit home with multiple high-profile episodes in recent months.In March, a number of big brands including             PepsiCo Inc.,Wal-Mart Stores Inc.L\u2019Or\u00e9al SA       and             AT&T Inc.       pulled their ads from YouTube and the Google Display Network, a network of third-party websites, after revelations that ads ran alongside objectionable content, including videos promoting anti-Semitism and terrorism.Google, a unit of             Alphabet Inc.,       promised to better police its content and give marketers more information about where their ads appear on YouTube. It also said it would bolster its technology that automatically screens videos, and it set a 10,000-view threshold for a video channel to reach before it can make money from ads.\u200bSome advertisers, satisfied with Google\u2019s efforts, have begun spending again, while others, including big marketers such as SC Johnson & Son Inc.,             Procter & Gamble Co.       and             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co., haven\u2019t returned, according to people familiar with the matter.J.P. Morgan is working with Google to get its ads back on \u201csafe YouTube channels\u201d and expects to return soon, one of the people said.P&G is working closely with YouTube to test the safeguards it has put in place since the problems arose, a spokeswoman for the company said. A spokeswoman for SC Johnson declined to comment.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here.\u201cMany advertisers never left and many have decided to come back,\u201d Google said in a statement. \u201cWhile they know that no system can be perfect, they appreciate the actions we\u2019ve taken and know we are taking this seriously and are committed to getting better and better.\u201dThough the number of ordinary web users who saw an ad in an offensive YouTube video was likely small, the combination of the public-relations damage from the revelations and the potential for more widespread exposure down the road led marketers to act.Breitbart, which is popular with the \u201calt-right\u201d\u2014a loose conglomeration of groups, some of which embrace white supremacy and view multiculturalism as a threat\u2014became a controversial landing spot for advertisers in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. Brands that have pulled out of Breitbart include Kellogg Co., eyewear company Warby Parker and insurer Allstate Corp.A spokesman for Breitbart declined to comment.The recurring issues have caused brands to adjust their overall approach to automated ad buying.Colgate-Palmolive Co.       is adding language to the contract it has with its ad-buying firm, which requires it to maintain blacklists of sites the company doesn\u2019t want to have its ads appear on, according to people familiar with the matter. Colgate didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\u2018We needed to make sure our ads are showing up where our ads make contextual sense.\u2019Advertisers are doubling down on using online ad verification services such as Integral Ad Science Inc. and White Ops Inc.OpenSlate, which helps advertisers vet YouTube channels, currently works with roughly 230 advertisers, more than twice as many as last year. \u201cThe interest in finding out where your ads are running and who saw your ad has skyrocketed over the past three months,\u201d said OpenSlate CEO       Mike Henry.More marketers are purchasing ads through \u201cprogrammatic direct\u201d deals, in which a publisher uses technology to sell directly to advertisers, and \u201cprivate programmatic marketplaces,\u201d in which a publisher or a select group of publishers can sell to a select group of advertisers, in real time. Automation is involved in both, but the risks are far lower than with open exchanges.Display-ad spending on programmatic direct deals in the U.S. is expected to grow by 35% this year to $18.2 billion, while spending on private marketplaces will increase 39% to about $6 billion, according to eMarketer. By contrast, spending on open exchanges is forecast to grow by 8.4% this year to $8.3 billion.Target pulled back from buying via open exchanges at the end of 2015 and now uses private marketplaces to buy ads from about 160 different publishers.Hewlett Packard                   Enterprise, which spun out from Hewlett-Packard Co. in 2015, set up private marketplaces with about 15 publishers including Forbes and CNN about a year ago.\u201cWe needed to make sure our ads are showing up where our ads make contextual sense,\u201d said       Chris Drago,        the company\u2019s senior director of global media. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be on Victoria\u2019s Secret because someone is there buying bras for his wife.\u201dWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.comAppeared in the June 20, 2017, print edition as 'The Web\u2019s Perilous Paths for Brands.'", "news_time": "2017-06-18 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/advertisers-try-to-avoid-the-webs-dark-side-from-fake-news-to-extremist-videos-1497778201", "news_title": "Advertisers Try to Avoid the Web\u2019s Dark Side, From Fake News to Extremist Videos", "keywords": "cannes advertising,cannescmo,cannes lions,digital advertising,fake news,mobile advertising,the ad maze,Belkin International,Breitbart News Network,marketing,markets,advertising,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunication services,digital marketing,internet service providers (discontinued from 11th july 2017),public relations,business,consumer services,computing,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014Advertising executives love to talk up how they use mountains of data to target consumers. But gathering that data is about to become more of a headache, at least in Europe.New European Union legislation that goes into effect next May will restrict how companies can collect and use personal information about web users in Europe, requiring that they obtain \u201cunambiguous\u201d consent from those users.The move contrasts with the U.S., where lawmakers recently voted to overturn privacy rules that would have required telecom companies to get consumers\u2019 permission before sharing their web-browsing and app usage with third parties.Privacy activists say the European rules are aimed at helping individuals take back control of their personal information. But they could hit the advertising sector hard, striking ad-tech companies, ad-buying arms of big agencies and web publishers, industry experts say.Once the new rules are in effect, European users browsing the internet will have to provide their consent every time they enter a new website to allow that site\u2019s publisher to share their personal information with other companies, which may have to be named as part of the consent form.Lobbyists say this could lead to more intrusive pop-ups upon entering websites.\u201cAnything that creates a higher bar to entry will affect both publishers and marketers,\u201d said       Simon Morrissey,        head of data and privacy at the law firm Lewis Silkin LLP in London. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get the consent that you need then you can\u2019t obtain the data that you want or you can\u2019t use the data for the purposes intended.\u201dA group representing the EU\u2019s national data-protection regulators is still clarifying its guidance on exactly where it thinks the bar should stand for user consent.In most cases, companies can no longer demand that users consent to the sharing of their personal information with third parties as a requirement for access to an online service, said       Jan Philipp Albrecht,        a member of European Parliament who participated in the drafting of the rules.Mr. Albrecht also said that marketing practices like pre-ticked boxes and consent forms that can be long and complicated will run afoul of the rules.The rules also say companies can\u2019t collect data for one part of their business and use it for another. Finally, consent must be as easy to take away as it is to give. Citizens can also ask to have their data erased.In Europe, companies that violate these rules could be fined as much as 4% of the firm\u2019s annual world-wide revenue, or \u20ac20 million ($22.4 million), whichever is greater.The new rules also apply to tech juggernauts like             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google and             Facebook Inc.,       though they may be in a relatively stronger position because they have direct relationships with large numbers of consumers and the ability to mine their own data.Most vulnerable are ad-tech firms that use data to target ads across the internet without any explicit consumer relationship, according to       Townsend Feehan,        chief executive of the European unit of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an online advertising trade group. Data-warehouse firms that buy data that may have been collected for different purposes also would be affected.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here.\u201cThe ad-tech companies are in a particularly difficult position,\u201d Ms. Feehan said. \u201cThey are going to be dependent on the publishers to get that consent for them.\u201dLawyers and lobbyists say there could be court battles to determine how strictly the new rules should be interpreted by the regulator.GroupM, the media-buying giant owned by             WPP                   PLC, has formed a working group that includes lawyers, privacy experts, product leaders, information officers, data architects and compliance professionals to make sure that its agencies\u2014and in particular its automated ad-buying businesses Xaxis and mPlatform\u2014 comply with the regulations.Havas SA\u2019s       media agencies will include a data appendix in every contract in which they state who owns the data and how it was collected.Ad-tech provider AppNexus is planning to invest in its European data-center infrastructure to ensure that data originating in Europe stays in Europe, said       Julia Shullman,        deputy general counsel of commercial and privacy at the company.Acxiom,       a marketing-services company that collects data like how many times consumers shopped online over the past year with a particular brand, their household income, and whether they are interested in golf or art, has increased its privacy budget by about 30% to comply with the new rules, according to its privacy officer in Europe,       Sachiko Scheuing.Ms. Scheuing has documented what data Acxiom holds on its customers, where it is held, whether it has permission to do so, whether it is stored safely, and how it can be extracted or deleted if requested.\u201cThe key is really to show that you take accountability very seriously,\u201d she said.Write to Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-18 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/advertisers-brace-for-europes-new-data-rules-1497778203", "news_title": "Advertisers Brace for Europe\u2019s New Data Rules", "keywords": "ads,ad tech,cannes,cannescmo,cmo,data privacy,digital advertising,privacy,user consent,Jan Philipp Albrecht,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,data mining,knowledge,information management,political,general news,privacy issues,information security,public relations,business,consumer services,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "In the past two years, the cold and allergy relief brand Zicam has shifted its TV ad-buying strategy markedly. Instead of just buying ads aimed at gender and age groupings\u2014the traditional currency of TV\u2014the company chose to target audience segments most receptive to cold-medicine pitches.Zicam began giving big chunks of its media-buying budget to Simulmedia, whose software helps find TV audiences representing more specific groups of people. Zicam found more than 45 networks and shows that would be a good fit. In the cold season that ended in early 2016, Zicam put 60% of its TV budget into Simulmedia and said it enjoyed an 8% lift in sales.Across the board, marketers are clamoring for these sorts of targeting opportunities in television, and the industry is racing to cater to their desires. Digital advertising has trained a generation of marketing executives to expect the ability to reach very fine audience segments, and TV\u2019s setup has looked hopelessly unsophisticated in comparison.\u201cTV has been limping around conducting business on a currency that doesn\u2019t reflect consumer behavior for decades,\u201d said       Linda Yaccarino,        head of ad sales for NBCUniversal.Networks are doing everything they can to change that\u2014whether it means joining with vendors like Simulmedia or developing their own proprietary ad-targeting systems, or both.Viacom Inc.,21st Century Fox Inc.       and             Time Warner Inc.\u2019s       Turner joined forces a few months ago to start building OpenAP, a system intended to standardize the precise categories ad buyers can purchase in TV. That way an advertiser who wants to reach soda drinkers or people in the market for a minivan doesn\u2019t have to deal with different data approaches at different networks.NBCUniversal also has announced that it would set aside $1 billion in ad inventory in 2017 to sell against highly specific audience segments. Other networks have similar initiatives.The word \u201cprogrammatic\u201d is often used to describe this activity in TV\u2014in an effort to tie it to the use of automated or \u201cprogrammatic\u201d systems in digital advertising, in which buyers bid in real-time for available inventory.But TV\u2019s targeting efforts are a far cry from what has happened in the digital ad world. The targeting opportunities still aren\u2019t anywhere near as granular. The nature of cable and broadcast TV means that selling and inserting ads in real time isn\u2019t possible, or even advisable. But that could all change when more households have internet-enabled TV systems and more programming is delivered on-demand rather than in a continuous, \u201clinear\u201d stream.Credit Suisse                   predicts that targeted linear TV products will open up a revenue opportunity of more than $100 billion for TV networks, according to its Future of Advertising report from April. Other analysts predict there will be increasing turbulence in TV advertising from the growth of online video and cord-cutting.OpenAP promises to allow an ad buyer or agency to submit information about who it wants to target\u2014people who buy yogurt, for example\u2014and use various data sources to drill down. Perhaps, for example, they know yogurt buyers tend to be women in their 20s who like to do yoga, and from anonymized data they know where those people live. The networks will cross-reference that information with data on what similar households tend to watch. Ads can then be purchased on shows with viewers that fit that profile. Deals will then be hammered out with the networks one-by-one.Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter.

Some ad executives say the initiative needs more scale to be more relevant.L\u2019Or\u00e9al SA       began selecting TV commercial space through advertising technology firm TubeMogul in 2015 to target certain consumers. By using detailed sets of first- and third-party data\u2014loyalty program and purchase data, for example\u2014L\u2019Or\u00e9al is able to find audiences at levels as granular as women who bought lipstick from specific retailers over the past 30 days.TubeMogul, which was acquired by Adobe Systems Inc. last year, uses TV viewing data to help L\u2019Or\u00e9al buy inventory targeting similar households more broadly. After buying TV ads through TubeMogul, L\u2019Or\u00e9al says it has seen a lift in product sales.To group all consumers into a broad audience and expect the same desired action is \u201cnot the way of the future,\u201d said       Nadine McHugh,        a senior marketing executive at L\u2019Or\u00e9al. \u201cWe understand the power of TV content, but how do we leverage our investment for optimal results out of our dollars in that environment?\u201dAdvertisers can define their budgets and target audiences through TubeMogul\u2019s system. The software then sends recommendations for available TV inventory, along with specified pricing. If the advertiser chooses to buy the inventory, TubeMogul or the advertisers then need to deal with the relevant networks, which then check for availability.From there, the old-school negotiation and transaction commence\u2014a sign that while targeting of ads on TV may be getting more \u201cprogrammatic,\u201d booking of ad slots hasn\u2019t really changed.\u201cThat\u2019s a limitation of the TV ecosystem,\u201d said Denise Colella, senior vice president of advanced advertising products and strategy at NBCUniversal.
