But this time their fans left Nationals Park without a sour taste in their mouth or venom in their words. Washington scored three runs in the last of the ninth to tie the game and then hit machine Daniel Murphy lined a single over the head of the left fielder for a walk-off RBI with one out in the 10th as the Nationals beat the second-place Atlanta Braves 5-4. The seventh walk-off win of the year came one night after the Nationals lost to the Braves in a game that began after a non-rain delay of more than three hours. That game ended around 1:20 a.m. Friday morning.  I was trying to go up the middle,  Murphy said of his winning hit Friday night.  I was able to stay on it.  The rally in the 10th was started by Adrian Sanchez, who singled up the middle for his first major league hit one week after making it to The Show for the first time. Sanchez went to third on a single to right by Ryan Zimmerman off former teammate Ian Krol.  I had literally no clue what he would throw me,  Zimmerman said. Sanchez, who had singled in his sixth career at-bat, then scored on the hit by Murphy that would have been deep enough for a sacrifice fly if need be. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at NationalsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatch At first it didn't cross my mind. All I wanted to do was to find a way to get on base,  Sanchez said of his first major league hit, via translator Octavio Martinez. The loss was a bitter one for Atlanta manager Brian Snitker, who watched closer Jim Johnson give up three runs in the ninth. Snitker wasn't around for the ending as he was ejected after he thought Washington catcher Matt Wieters swung at a pitch during the ninth-inning rally. Wieters later drove in the tying run with a sacrifice fly.  Those things happen. You hate it when it does,  Snitker said of the late loss.  A lot of really good things (happened). We had our chances; we came right back (in the top of the 10th) with a runner on second and couldn't get it done.  Will Snitker look at the replay of the non-strike call to Wieters?  I don't think I even need to,  said Snitker, who was ejected by third-base umpire and crew chief Mike Everitt. The winning pitcher was Matt Albers (5-1), who got a double play in the top of the 10th inning, while former Washington lefty Krol (1-2) was saddled with the loss. Murphy and Anthony Rendon had RBI singles before Wieters drove in the tying run with his sacrifice fly. Freddie Freeman went 2-for-4 with a homer and three RBIs for the Braves. Freeman led off the seventh with a homer against Max Scherzer as the Braves took a 2-1 lead. Scherzer was replaced in the eighth by lefty Oliver Perez, who yielded a two-run single to Freeman as Atlanta assumed a 4-1 advantage. Scherzer, the potential All-Star Game starter, gave up four runs in 7 2/3 innings with 10 strikeouts while throwing 120 pitches. He now has 60 games of at least 10 strikeouts in his career. Atlanta starter R.A. Dickey lost his no-hit bid as Stephen Drew led off the sixth with a double and then scored on a single by Wieters to make it 1-1. Dickey went seven innings and allowed the one run on three hits with seven strikeouts. Matt Adams had two doubles and Brandon Phillips was 2-for-4 for Atlanta. The first-place Nationals are 51-35 while the second-place Braves are 41-44. The Braves finally broke through Friday as Ender Inciarte led off the fourth inning with a double. He scored on a single by Phillips that grazed the glove of Murphy. Scherzer entered the contest with at least 10 strikeouts in seven of his last eight games. Dickey had allowed just two runs in his previous three starts after giving up eight in five innings on June 13 at Washington. He was in line for the win before Johnson faltered.  I have no problems with him,  Snitker said of Johnson.  He has saved a lot of games. He has been a workhorse. We are fighting to get to .500. That is a good ballclub over there. We will be back tomorrow.  NOTES: Atlanta OF Danny Santana (possible calf infection) was sent to Atlanta due to fears of being contagious, according to manager Brian Snitker. INF-OF Jace Peterson was slated to arrive after the game started for Atlanta, coming from Triple-A Gwinnett. ... The Nationals put OF Michael A.

Carlos Carrasco struck out 11 in seven innings and Lonnie Chisenhall and Bradley Zimmer homered as the Indians unleashed a 16-hit attack to beat the Detroit Tigers 11-2 on Friday night at Progressive Field. It's the second consecutive 11-2 victory by the Indians. They beat San Diego on Thursday by the same score.  It's nice to see us play the way we played tonight. So many guys contributed,  Indians acting manager Brad Mills said. Zimmer and Francisco Lindor each had three hits, and Michael Brantley had four RBIs as the Cleveland offense erupted for the third consecutive game. The Indians have collected 44 hits in those three games.  We had big hits all the way around. Some really good at bats,  Mills said. Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez reached a milestone when he singled in the second inning for the 2,000th hit of his career. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at IndiansDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatch Man, that's a lot of hits. And it couldn't happen to a better guy,  Mills said.  Two thousand hits, that's special,  Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said.  Not a lot of people can say that they've done that. That's something Victor should be proud of.  Carrasco (10-3) allowed two runs and nine hits with 11 strikeouts and one walk, including striking out the side on nine pitches in the fifth inning.  When you see big-league hitters missing the ball by five feet, that means he's doing something right,  said Lindor.  Carrasco was tough,  Ausmus said.  His fastball command was very good and his slider is always tough on right-handed hitters, and we have a lot of right-handers. He's one of the best pitchers in the American League.  Detroit starter Jordan Zimmermann (5-7) gave up five runs and eight hits in three innings.  When he is inconsistent, it's usually a lack of movement on his slider, and that was the case tonight,  Ausmus said. Leading 5-1, the Indians blew it open with a four-run sixth inning and two in the seventh. Zimmer led off the sixth with a solo home run against reliever Chad Bell. Lindor added a two-run triple later in the inning and Brantley followed with an RBI single. An RBI single by Lindor and sacrifice fly by Brantley in the seventh completed Cleveland's scoring. The Indians broke a scoreless tie in the third inning. With one out, Jason Kipnis doubled to right field and went to third on an infield single by Lindor. He stole second and then scored along with Kipnis when Brantley pulled a double into the right field corner. Edwin Encarnacion grounded out to send Brantley to third. Jose Ramirez reached on an infield single to short, scoring Brantley to make it 3-0. Chisenhall then hit the first pitch Zimmermann threw him into the seats in right field for his 12th home run to extend the Cleveland lead to 5-0. In the top of the fourth, Carrasco gave up a single to Alex Avila leading off the inning. Justin Upton drew a walk, but Carrasco got Miguel Cabrera to ground into a double play. Avila went to third on the double play and scored on a single to center by J.D. Martinez, cutting the Cleveland lead to 5-1. Carrasco rebounded in the fifth inning with his nine-pitch, three-strikeout inning.  That was huge. We had the bases loaded and no outs and didn't score in the fourth, and you thought maybe the momentum was starting to shift,  Mills said.  Then to have Carlos to go out there and strike out the side on nine pitches, that was a big key for us.  NOTES: Indians manager Terry Francona underwent a successful cardiac ablation procedure on Thursday to correct an irregular heartbeat. The procedure was done at Cleveland Clinic. Francona, who will not manage the American League All-Star team, is scheduled to rejoin the Indians on July 14. Bench coach Brad Mills will continue to serve as the acting manager. ... RHP Corey Kluber, who was selected to the AL All-Star team but will start Sunday night against the Tigers, will attend the game but not pitch on Tuesday night in Miami. . . Tigers DH Victor Martinez singled in the second inning for the 2,000th hit of his career. Ironically, Martinez's first 900 major league hits came as a member of the Indians. ... Tigers OF Justin Upton was added to the American League All-Star team. RHP Michael Fulmer, the only Tigers player selected to the AL team, will not pitch in the game because he's starting Sunday night in Cleveland.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-indians-writethru-idUSMTZED78R3YSO5"},

The presidential race went into a run-off after none of the three candidates won a majority late last month. A populist former martial arts star, Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party won the most votes, but fell short of the required majority. Voters regard Battulga as a resource nationalist who is suspicious of China. He faces the candidate of the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP), Miyeegombo Enkhbold, who came second. Enkhbold has stood behind the current government and prime minister, pledging to stay the course for economic recovery following a $5.5-billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund and partners in May. Battulga has captured the attention of voters who feel Mongolia has got a bad deal on investments, promising greater government control of strategic mines, such as Rio Tinto's, Oyu Tolgoi copper mine.Enkhbold, for his part, has promised to deliver money owed from a universal child welfare fund.

The race has been clouded by allegations of corruption and voter fraud by all sides, with many voters dismayed by their choice of candidates and the government's inability to bring them prosperity.

For many voters, handing in blank ballots is a last-ditch effort to deny either candidate a majority, so forcing a re-run of the poll from scratch, with selection of fresh candidates.  Mongolia is a parliamentary democracy.

Golf Channel analyst and former PGA Tour player Brandel Chamblee stoked controversy in a Golf Channel column on Wednesday by calling Langer's putting stroke into question. Langer, a former world number one and two-time Masters champion, said his stroke did not breach the rule. “I’m certain that I am not anchoring the putter and that my putting stroke is not violating the Rules of Golf,” Langer said in a statement released via the PGA Tour. “I have been in contact with the USGA and rules officials ... and each time I have been assured that my putting stroke is within the Rules of Golf.  I will continue to play with the same integrity that I’ve displayed throughout my career.” In his column, Chamblee wrote,  ...

Langer did not alter his long putter anchored (looking) putting technique, except to say he was moving the butt end away from his body after making practice strokes with it touching his body.” The rule states that “while making a stroke, a player may not anchor the club (i) ‘directly’ or (ii) indirectly through use of an ‘anchor point’,” noting that an anchor point exists when the player intentionally holds a forearm in contact with any part of his body to establish a gripping hand as a stable point around which the other hand may swing the club. Chamblee wrote that it was the use of the word “intentionally” that had created a grey area. “Intent is the get-out-of-jail-free card for both the player and those who are meant to police the player,” he wrote. In a statement released along with Langer’s, the United States Golf Association (USGA) said it had seen “no evidence” of any player breaching the rule. “We are confident that Rule (14-1b) has been applied fairly and consistently and have seen no evidence of a player breaching the rule, which does not prohibit a hand or club to touch a player’s clothing in making a stroke.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Peter Rutherford","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-seniors-langer-putter-idUSKBN19T04Y"},

Heavily armed police commandos moved in after activists had spent much of the day attempting to wrest control of the streets from more than 15,000 police, setting fires, looting and building barricades. With meetings between leaders of the club of 20 largest global economies finished for the day, police stormed the last holdouts, who had gathered in the Schanzenviertel district, an area known for its left-wing activism and culture of squatting. With two months to go before she seeks re-election, Chancellor Angela Merkel had hoped to cement Germany's growing global leadership role with a demonstration of its unwavering commitment to free speech, assembly and dissent by holding the summit in the center of a city with a proud radical tradition. Protesters torched cars and lorries, smashed windows in banks, looted retail stores and hurled paving slabs and other objects before police managed to restore order. Some 197 officers were injured after two days of clashes in the port city. Police made 19 arrests and detained dozens more. Standing in a nearby falafel restaurant, Mohammad Halabi, 32, a Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee some 18 months before, surveyed the scene with disbelief.  They are crazy. I can't believe my eyes,  he said.  They have such a beautiful country and they're destroying it.  But G20 participants said they had never seen protesters closer to such a summit than in Hamburg and praised the work of police in keeping the event safe, suggesting Merkel's gamble had paid off.

Below, burning barricades billowed thick smoke. Despite the chaos that threatened to overwhelm parts of the city during much of the day, the summit, with thousands of participants from dozens of countries, was largely unaffected. Police declined to clear U.S. first lady Melania Trump's motorcade to leave her hotel for a tour of the historic harbor, and protests delayed buses taking visitors away from the state dinner that concluded the meetings.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Time and time again, the Tampa Bay Rays had runners on and a chance to score, but Drew Pomeranz kept getting out of jams, leading the Boston Red Sox to an 8-3 win on Friday night at Tropicana Field. The Rays went just 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position, stranding 10 runners overall, and Boston got help from three inning-ending double plays, bouncing back after two slow games offensively.  Drew had to pitch with his back against the wall a few times, and really showed I thought a lot of tenacity in those moments,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  We were able to turn key double plays, but a very good strong offensive night up and down the lineup.  Pomeranz (9-4) gave up two runs in six innings, and Boston (50-37), which lost to Tampa Bay on Thursday, tagged Rays starter Jake Odorizzi (5-4) for a season-high seven runs before he left in the fifth inning. The Rays (45-43) couldn't build on an impressive 4-1 win in the series opener on Thursday. Boston's Dustin Pedroia had a two-run home run, extending Odorizzi's streak to 13 starts giving up at least one home run, a team record and matching the longest in the majors this season. The Rays had chances to get back in the game, but couldn't come up with hits with runners in scoring position. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RaysBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchThey hit into three inning-ending double plays. With runners at second and third in the second, the Rays had both runners tagged out on a bunt by Mallex Smith. Wilson Ramos grounded into 5-4-3 double plays to end the fifth and seventh innings. Tampa Bay got a solo home run by Steven Souza, his 17th, matching a career high, to pull within 7-3 in the seventh against reliever Heath Hembree. Boston got a solo home run from Hanley Ramirez -- his 13th -- off reliever Adam Kolarek to tack on a late run. Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel, who had pitched only once in the previous six days, pitched a scoreless ninth in a non-save situation. The Red Sox tagged Odorizzi for four runs and four hits in the third inning. Tzu-Wei Lin singled and scored on an RBI double by Mookie Betts, who in turn scored on an RBI single by Andrew Benintendi. Pedroia followed with a two-run homer -- his third home run of the season -- to give Boston a 4-0 lead. Jackie Bradley Jr. added a solo home run in the fourth to make it 5-0 for the Red Sox.  Very good offensive night,  Farrell said.  We were able to put together a big inning with the four-run third inning to give us a little bit of breathing room.  The Rays struggled early against Pomeranz but scored two in the fourth on an RBI double by Wilson Ramos and an RBI single by Brad Miller, who was back in the lineup after being activated from the disabled list. Odorizzi's pitch count grew quickly and he didn't make it out of the fifth inning, giving up a single to Pedroia and then walking the next three batters, including Bradley with the bases loaded. Christian Vazquez added an RBI groundout against Rays reliever Chase Whitley, padding the lead to 7-2. Odorizzi, frustrated after the game, said he's looking forward to the All-Star break, hoping he can rebound in the second half of the season as he did last year.  I just didn't execute. I need to do a better job of executing and that's the first half in a nutshell,  he said of his three fifth-inning walks.  Just poor execution and opposition taking advantage of it, not getting away with anything.  Odorizzi was 3-5 with a 4.47 ERA before the All-Star break last season, then 7-1 with a 2.71 ERA after the break.  It just got away from me. Just one of those games that's a crappy game,  he said.  I know I've been going not so good, so it stands out a little bit.  The Red Sox played without shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who left Thursday's game in the first inning after being hit in the right hand with a pitch. X-rays were negative, but Bogaerts had said after Thursday's game that he wasn't able to throw a ball and hadn't even tried to grip a bat. Lin filled in at shortstop and scored Boston's first run in the third. NOTES: The Rays placed INF Tim Beckham on the 10-day disabled list with a left ankle sprain, with 2B Brad Miller getting activated from the DL to take his place. Miller had been sidelined by a groin strain but returned to the lineup with two singles and two walks Friday night. With the addition of Adeiny Hechavarria at short and Miller back at second, Beckham may be relegated to a utility role when he returns healthy. ... Rays RHP Chris Archer, who pitched Sunday and is 7-5 with a 3.95 ERA this season, was named as an All-Star. He's replacing pitchers who are scheduled to throw Sunday, even though he's scheduled to pitch Sunday himself. Rays manager Kevin Cash will be part of the AL coaching staff.

China said last month a joint declaration with Britain over Hong Kong, which laid the blueprint over how the city would be ruled after its return to China in 1997, was a historical document that no longer had any practical significance. In response, Britain said the declaration remained in force and was a legally valid treaty to which it was committed to upholding. China says no foreign country has a right to get involved with Hong Kong as it is an internal affair for China, and has also reacted angrily to six-monthly reports the British government gives to Parliament about Hong Kong. Meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg on Friday, Xi told May that bilateral relations should be cultivated on the basis of  consolidating strategic mutual trust , China's foreign ministry said on Saturday.  Both sides should uphold the principle of mutual respect and equality, and respect each other's core interests and major concerns,  the ministry cited Xi as saying.   Both sides must seek common ground while shelving differences.  There was no direct mention of Hong Kong in the statement. On Wednesday, British Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field met Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming in London and made clear Britain's commitment to the joint declaration, Britain's Foreign Office said.  This declaration, registered with the UN, remains in force until July 2047. As a consequence, the minister did not accept the Chinese government's position that this was purely an historical document,  the Foreign Office said.     While China and Britain have a history of disputes over human rights and the future of Hong Kong, ties have warmed in the past few years and economic links have grown in what both countries call a  golden age , though Britain upset China last year by putting on hold a nuclear project it later approved. China is high on Britain's list of countries with which to sign a free trade deal once Britain leaves the European Union.

Williams, the former top-ranked tennis player in the world, on Friday won her third-round match at the Wimbledon tournament in England. A statement from the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department said a video, taken from the entrance to the gated community where Williams lives, indicates she acted lawfully in entering the intersection before the crash.

When the traffic light changed, an approaching car driven by Barson's wife, Linda, collided with Williams' vehicle. The initial traffic report said Williams, 37, was at fault for failing to yield the right of way to Barson. But on Friday, Major Paul Rogers of the Palm Beach Gardens Police Department said a fuller investigation began after Barson's death on June 22.  He said police have not made a final determination of fault in the investigation. The Barson family attorney, Michael Steinger, in a statement issued Friday, said the video  continues to support the fact that Ms. Williams remained in the intersection at a red light, violating the Barsons' right of way.

Federer has won all four meetings against the Russian-born German, the most prominent exponent of old-fashioned 'serve and volley' tennis. But when it comes to receiving, the 27th-seeded Zverev has taken radically different approaches to dealing with the Swiss's serve.  I have played him on several occasions now, and he's played me different every time,  said Federer.   In Australia he played me really close on the second serve and would try to attack me, everything that he saw that was short he would come.   Whereas in Halle when I played him he played from way back, which is highly unusual on the grass. Especially second serve.  So I guess I don't know quite what to expect in the match on Saturday,  added Federer, who will be posed very different questions by the left-hander.  Because he serves and volleys, points are played differently. I will train and warm up with left-handed players.

Zverev, whose younger brother Alexander is also in the third round at Wimbledon, suggests that, with nothing to lose, he may taken an even more cavalier approach than usual.  I think this time I will try to go all or nothing, maybe even more than before. I don't know,  he said.  Hopefully he's going to have not his best day, because if he has one of those days, it's really tough to beat him. It's very tough, believe me. Then see how it goes.  It depends how he serves. See how the bounce is, see if I can read his serve well on grass or not. We'll see. I haven't decided myself yet,  he said. If Federer is to be stopped from advancing to the last 16, Zverev will have to do something to disturb his cool.  I don't know if it's something I can do or he can do to himself. I'll maybe give him a mean, angry look before the match,  he joked.  So far every time we saw each other, we've been joking around in the locker room or warmup area. He seemed pretty relaxed to me.

Kuczynski's promise not to pardon Fujimori during last year's presidential election helped him scrape together a narrow victory against Fujimori's daughter, Keiko Fujimori. But last month Kuczynski proposed a potential pardon for Fujimori, 78, for health reasons as his finance minister was ousted by Congress, which is dominated by Fujimori's supporters.  It would be a betrayal. A betrayal of his word and his promise to the families of the victims of the dictatorship,  said protest organizer Jorge Rodriguez.  At least 2,000 protesters participated in the march through the streets of Lima, witnesses said.  Fujimori's human rights violations cannot be pardoned for humanitarian reasons,  said Giancarlo Portugal, a 26-year-old student who participated in the march.   Fujimori has been convicted of leading groups that massacred civilians and kidnapped journalists during his years in office from 1990-2000. Despite his autocratic style, Fujimori still has a solid following among Peruvians who credit him with fixing an economy in crisis and quashing a bloody leftist insurgency.

In an interview with local broadcaster RPP on Friday, Kuczynski said his decision would be based strictly on a medical review that should be completed by the end of year.  I'll follow the medical recommendation,  Kuczynski said. Slideshow (8 Images)But the proposed evaluation, which was not requested by Fujimori, is widely seen as a political gesture. While pardoning Fujimori might help Kuczynski ease tensions with Congress, it would anger the leftist groups that helped elect him. Kuczynski, who took office nearly a year ago to cap a distinguished career in finance and public administration, has vowed to transform Peru into a modern country and is leading regional efforts to pressure Venezuela to enact democratic reforms. Fujimori's doctor, Alejandro Aguinaga, said Friday that Kuczynski's committee for presidential pardons has not received any new information about Fujimori's health. But Aguinaga said Fujimori suffers from various ailments that merit a pardon, including a recurrent growth on his tongue, a hernia in his back and a recent episode of an abnormally fast heart beat.

Tesla said in a statement on Friday that it was extremely misleading to look at registration data from one month, that deliveries varied month-to-month for operational reasons, and that deliveries increased by more than 53 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.   Looking at the quarter in total is the smallest time frame in which to obtain reliable, meaningful information about our deliveries. Deliveries naturally fluctuate from month to month for a variety of normal operational reasons.   In the first month of the quarter, Tesla builds cars primarily for overseas markets, in the second month for North American markets (not including the West Coast) and in the third month for the West Coast,  Tesla said in the statement to Reuters. Focusing on April registrations  cherry picks  data, it said.  Tesla earlier this week reported first-half global deliveries of its Model S and its Model X SUV at the low end of its own forecast, driving down the stock and raising questions about demand for the older models. The findings come as investors worry that demand for Tesla's luxury Model S sedan is waning ahead of the mass market Model 3 launch. Tesla’s share price more than doubled between early December and late June as investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk’s strategy to transform the low-volume luxury electric car maker into a diversified producer of mass market vehicles, storage batteries, electric commercial trucks and rooftop solar panels. The company’s market value rose past larger rivals General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N).  Since June 23, however, Tesla shares have fallen by nearly 20 percent amid concerns that demand for the company’s existing models is weakening. Overall sales of electric vehicles in the United States remain stuck at less than 1 percent of total vehicle sales, despite a growing number of models fielded by Tesla and other car makers. Tesla said earlier this week that battery pack production problems held back vehicle output in the second quarter until early June. California, a haven for environmentalists and techies, is one of the company's leading markets. The company does not break out results by geographic area. IHS analyst Stephanie Brinley cautioned that a single month of data could not fully explain Tesla demand.   If Tesla had an issue with its production for the month, that could explain  the drop in registrations, she said, noting in particular the problems with battery pack output. Still, she said, Tesla's Model S, launched in 2012, could be in need of a refresh.   They haven’t changed much on the exterior or much on the package,  and it is a high-fashion car, she said.  I can certainly understand where Model S sales may be softening a little bit because it’s an older product. That could be contributing to the issue.   Industry data reviewed separately by Reuters showed that the Model S registrations in California were uneven over the first four months of 2017, varying by more than 1,000 units month-to-month. In percentage terms Model S growth peaked in February, decelerated in March and turned negative in April in California. Brinley said it was difficult to assess whether that reflected demand or availability. IHS measures vehicle registration, which comes after a sale. Registration in California and overall in the United States rose sharply for the combined first four months of the year, but April showed steep declines. IHS has not released data for May or June. Chief Executive Musk in May stoked concerns that the Model 3 would cannibalize demand for the Model S when he told investors that some  confused  Tesla buyers regarded the new Model 3 as an upgrade to the Model S, affecting Model S orders. The new car is a $35,000 mass market vehicle, which costs about half the price of the Model S. Tesla reported first-half 2017 global deliveries rose to 47,100 in 2017. Tesla had predicted 47,000 to 50,000. Musk in May said there would be demand for 100,000 luxury Teslas. IHS reported April Tesla registrations fell to 2,177 from 2,867 in California. Nationally they dropped nearly 10 percent to 3,911 from 4,334. For the first four months, California registrations rose to 6,926 from 5,804 and U.S. registrations rose to 15,288 from 10,937. Tesla shares fell 5.6 percent to close at $308.83 on Thursday, although the stock is up about 45 percent for the year to date.

Fernandez, who ran up deficits but was popular with the poor for generous welfare spending during her eight years in power,  got 35.6 percent voter intention in the survey of Buenos Aires province by local pollster Ricardo Rouvier & Associates. Her nearest rival, Esteban Bullrich, Macri's former education minister, trailed by 9 percentage points. The race will pit Fernandez's brand of free-spending populism against Macri's belief that open markets and tight fiscal policy are the way to prosperity for the grains-rich but economically ailing country. Buenos Aires is home to about 40 percent of Argentine voters. No matter who wins the Senate seat, neither Fernandez's nor Macri's coalitions can gain control of Congress in the October mid-term elections. But if Macri's Cambiemos (Let's Change) coalition gets more votes than Fernandez's Unidad Ciudadana (Citizens' Unity) party in population centers like Buenos Aires, Argentine asset prices would be expected to rise.  A strong showing by Cambiemos would be decoded by investors as a sign that Macri can keep cobbling together the votes needed to get his market-friendly reforms through Congress in the second half of his term, and prepare the ground for a strong re-election bid in 2019,  said Ignacio Labaqui, who analyzes Argentina for New York-based consultancy Medley Global Advisors. The possibility of a political comeback by Fernandez, who implemented heavy trade and currency controls while in office, has been cited by local economists as one of the reasons for a recent weakening of the local peso.   Fernandez led Argentina from 2007 to 2015. Since then she has kept up a war of words against Macri, who upon taking office in December 2015 promptly ditched the economic controls that scared off investment during the Fernandez years. While welcomed by the markets, Macri's more austere policies, such as cutting energy, transportation and education subsidies, have not gone down well with low-income families. The Rouvier poll was taken June 27 to June 30 among 1,600 Buenos Aires voters. It had a 2.4 percent margin of error.

Shell Pakistan said in an email the company was reviewing the report, adding  we respect the role of the regulator and will consider the report as we cooperate with investigations by authorities and as we conduct our own investigation . Shell Pakistan has said the tanker was owned by a contractor it hired to transport its fuel. At least 217 people were killed in the explosion and 61 were injured, according to Amir Mehmood, spokesman for Victoria Hospital in nearby Bahawalpur city. The energy regulator ordered Shell Pakistan to pay a penalty of 10 million rupees ($95,000). In addition, the regulator ordered the company to pay one million rupees ($9,400) in compensation to the families of each of those killed and half a million ($4,700) for each person injured. The regulator also ordered the company to upgrade its  infrastructure  in line with its standards. The company has the right to appeal against the fine and compensation demand, he said. The regulator also criticised police and highway authorities for failing to cordon off the accident site.  A separate government inquiry into police conduct was being carried out, said Punjab provincial government spokesman Malik Muhammed Ahmed Khan. The chairwoman of the OGRA, Uzma Adil Khan, said many fuel companies were not meeting safety requirements introduced in 2009, and the regulatory body had been slow to enforce them.  This incident is certainly a wake-up call for all of us,  she said. The vice chairman of the Pakistan's oil tankers association, Zaman Khan, said the accident last month was an anomaly.   Tankers meet international standards,  he said.

Tesla said in a statement on Friday that it was extremely misleading to look at registration data from one month, that deliveries varied month-to-month for operational reasons, and that deliveries increased by more than 53 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.   Looking at the quarter in total is the smallest time frame in which to obtain reliable, meaningful information about our deliveries. Deliveries naturally fluctuate from month to month for a variety of normal operational reasons.   In the first month of the quarter, Tesla builds cars primarily for overseas markets, in the second month for North American markets (not including the West Coast) and in the third month for the West Coast,  Tesla said in the statement to Reuters. Focusing on April registrations  cherry picks  data, it said.  Tesla earlier this week reported first-half global deliveries of its Model S and its Model X SUV at the low end of its own forecast, driving down the stock and raising questions about demand for the older models. The findings come as investors worry that demand for Tesla's luxury Model S sedan is waning ahead of the mass market Model 3 launch. Tesla’s share price more than doubled between early December and late June as investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk’s strategy to transform the low-volume luxury electric car maker into a diversified producer of mass market vehicles, storage batteries, electric commercial trucks and rooftop solar panels. The company’s market value rose past larger rivals General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N).  Since June 23, however, Tesla shares have fallen by nearly 20 percent amid concerns that demand for the company’s existing models is weakening. Overall sales of electric vehicles in the United States remain stuck at less than 1 percent of total vehicle sales, despite a growing number of models fielded by Tesla and other car makers. Tesla said earlier this week that battery pack production problems held back vehicle output in the second quarter until early June. California, a haven for environmentalists and techies, is one of the company's leading markets. The company does not break out results by geographic area. IHS analyst Stephanie Brinley cautioned that a single month of data could not fully explain Tesla demand.   If Tesla had an issue with its production for the month, that could explain  the drop in registrations, she said, noting in particular the problems with battery pack output. Still, she said, Tesla's Model S, launched in 2012, could be in need of a refresh.   They haven’t changed much on the exterior or much on the package,  and it is a high-fashion car, she said.  I can certainly understand where Model S sales may be softening a little bit because it’s an older product. That could be contributing to the issue.   Industry data reviewed separately by Reuters showed that the Model S registrations in California were uneven over the first four months of 2017, varying by more than 1,000 units month-to-month. In percentage terms Model S growth peaked in February, decelerated in March and turned negative in April in California. Brinley said it was difficult to assess whether that reflected demand or availability. IHS measures vehicle registration, which comes after a sale. Registration in California and overall in the United States rose sharply for the combined first four months of the year, but April showed steep declines. IHS has not released data for May or June. Chief Executive Musk in May stoked concerns that the Model 3 would cannibalize demand for the Model S when he told investors that some  confused  Tesla buyers regarded the new Model 3 as an upgrade to the Model S, affecting Model S orders. The new car is a $35,000 mass market vehicle, which costs about half the price of the Model S. Tesla reported first-half 2017 global deliveries rose to 47,100 in 2017. Tesla had predicted 47,000 to 50,000. Musk in May said there would be demand for 100,000 luxury Teslas. IHS reported April Tesla registrations fell to 2,177 from 2,867 in California. Nationally they dropped nearly 10 percent to 3,911 from 4,334. For the first four months, California registrations rose to 6,926 from 5,804 and U.S. registrations rose to 15,288 from 10,937. Tesla shares fell 5.6 percent to close at $308.83 on Thursday, although the stock is up about 45 percent for the year to date.

The plane was turned around due to an in-flight altercation detailed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in an affidavit filed the next day as part of the criminal complaint against Hudek, who was a first-class passenger on the flight. According to the FBI, the incident began when Hudek lunged for an exit door at the front of the plane, grabbed the handle and tried to open it, prompting a desperate scuffle with crew members and passengers who battled to subdue him. In the course of the disturbance, the FBI said, Hudek repeatedly punched a flight attendant and a fellow passenger, and persisted in trying to pull open the door, even as a second flight attendant struck him over the head with two large wine bottles.

Dicamba use and complaints about its use have spiked in the past two years in the United States. More farmers are spraying it to control hard-to-kill weeds in fields planted with crops bioengineered to survive the chemical, which is produced by Monsanto Co, Germany's BASF and others. The bans are the latest regulatory setback for Monsanto, which sells dicamba-tolerant crop seeds and licenses the biotech traits to other seedmakers. Officials in California announced last week that the company's flagship herbicide glyphosate would be labeled as a probable carcinogen in the state.  Based on feedback and research, the Department of Agriculture is going to hit the pause button on all dicamba products,  Missouri Director of Agriculture Chris Chinn said in a statement. Distributors are not allowed to sell it and farmers cannot apply it, effective immediately, but the state will work with industry to develop new handling guidelines as soon as possible, she said. Missouri has received more than 130 complaints of pesticide drift this year believed to be caused by dicamba, the Missouri Department of Agriculture said. Arkansas' 120-day ban will go into effect as soon as paperwork is filed with the Arkansas Secretary of State, said agriculture department spokeswoman Adriane Barnes. The state's House and Senate Agriculture Committee voted on Friday to follow recommendations by the Arkansas Plant Board and Governor Asa Hutchinson to ban dicamba use. The state also approved an increase in fines for illegal use of dicamba to up to $25,000, from $1,000 currently, effective Aug. 1. Arkansas has logged nearly 600 complaints of crop damage as of Friday, according to the Arkansas Agriculture Department.

But the new company would use a bigger portion of available airwaves than any single telecoms provider is allowed, exceeding the maximum allowed frequency limit of 140 megahertz, said the source, asking not to be identified. Enacom and the National Commission for the Defense of Competition, or CNDC, both have to approve the merger, which would create a company with a market cap of about $11 billion, according to brokerage Itau BBA.  Definitely, at one glance, there is an excess of the 140 megahertz limit that the combined company would have. This is the merger's first problem,  the source said. Radio airwaves have become an increasingly valuable commodity for wireless telecoms operators which need them to satisfy demand for video and music streaming among other data-heavy services. Argentina's Communications Ministry plans to increase the maximum allowed megahertz limit to between 160 and 180, but that would still be too low for the estimated 220 megahertz that the combined company would have, the source said. The excess frequency would have to be returned to the state, the source added. That step would be part of a broader regulatory review expected to take at least six months, the source said. The merger of the two separate companies in which Mexican billionaire David Martinez holds stakes will require shareholder as well as regulatory approval. Telecom Argentina is to issue 1.184 billion shares,leaving Cablevision shareholders with 55 percent of the combinedcompany, the companies said in announcing the merger plan.  Shortly after taking office in December 2015, Macri signed a decree to allow phone companies to offer pay television services, an area that had long been dominated by Cablevision, an internet, cable TV and data transmission company that was previously part of Grupo Clarin (CLA.BA).     Grupo Clarin, Argentina's largest media conglomerate, saidlast August it was spinning off Cablevision.

The Chicago Cubs' third baseman went 4-for-5 with two home runs, a triple and a single in a 6-1 victory against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the opener of a three-game weekend series.  I felt pretty good about my approach, where I'm at and taking my walks,  said Bryant, who recorded his 10th career multi-homer day along with four RBIs and three runs scored for the Cubs (43-43).  But you need a game like that to get back on track and hopefully it gets the team back on track, too.  Anthony Rizzo got in on the fun with his team-leading 20th homer of the season. Cubs starter Eddie Butler had no decision in a four-plus inning effort in a sluggish game that took 3 hours, 46 minutes to complete. But he was rather impressed with Bryant's effort. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at CubsPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatch It's unbelievable, he put the team on his back,  Butler said.  Those things are huge, the amount of hustle and he was really locked in. We're going to need that through the rest of this stretch and same thing in the second half.  Carl Edwards Jr. (3-1) struck out three, walked two and didn't allow a hit over 1 2/3 innings of relief to earn the victory. Pirates starter Trevor Williams (3-4) took the loss in a 3 2/3 inning outing while Andrew McCutchen paced the Pirates (40-47) with a 3-for-4 afternoon plus a walk.  We definitely had some opportunities there in the game, we just weren't able to get the big hit like we needed,  McCutchen said.  Trevor pitched his tail off for us and we weren't able to finish like we should have. If we were able to finish, we were able to win that game.  Chicago broke a scoreless tie in the fourth on Bryant's triple into the left field corner. Rizzo then clubbed his homer, sending Williams' 2-2 pitch into the right field bleachers for a 3-0 lead. It gave him 20 homers for the fifth straight year and at least 20 before the All-Star break for the third time. That spelled the end for Williams, who threw 98 pitches while giving up three earned runs on six hits while striking out three and walking a pair. Butler departed in the top of the fifth after plunking Josh Harrison with his second pitch of the inning. He gave up four hits, walked three and struck out one in his outing.  I would have liked to have been more effective with my pitches, but I was able to do enough to keep us there, knotted a zero for a while,  Butler said. Kyle Schwarber collected a leadoff double -- his first hit since returning from Triple-A Iowa on Thursday -- to open the Cubs' fifth. Schwarber reached third on Jason Heyward's fielder's choice grounder but was tagged out at home on Victor Caratini's infield ground ball. Bryant then launched a towering solo home run -- his 17th of the season -- deep into the left field bleachers with two out in the sixth for a 4-0 Cubs lead. The Pirates broke the shutout in the seventh as Josh Bell doubled home McCutchen with one out, trimming the Chicago lead to 4-1. Bryant's second homer of the day -- his 18th -- came with two outs in the eighth and brought home Willson Contreras for a 6-1 advantage. Both teams had plenty of base runners but no runs through the first 3 1/2 innings, including bases-loaded situations in the Pirates' first and the Cubs' second.  We had 11 men on base, for three innings it was mayhem out there,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  There was a lot to watch and a lot going on. Men are out there trying to create things -- both sides. Those missed opportunities they usually can come back to haunt you.  NOTES: Friday's series opener kicked off a 10-game run against NL Central Division opponents for the Pirates. ... OF Starling Marte went 0-for-3 in his third rehab game at Triple-A Indianapolis on Thursday. He's serving an 80-game PED suspension and is eligible for reinstatement on July 18. ... The Pirates moved C Elias Diaz to Triple-A Indianapolis while calling up RHP A.J. Schugel. ... Cubs C Willson Contreras has 23 home runs since last year's major league debut and surpassed Cal Neenan (1957-58) for the most by a Cubs' catcher in his first two seasons. ... Chicago recalled RHP Dylan Floro from Triple-A Iowa on Friday and optioned LHP Jack Leathersich to Triple-A. ... C Victor Caratini made his first start Wrigley Field and went 0-for-2 with a walk.

Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May, after claiming without evidence that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election. U.S. civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have called the panel a voter suppression tactic by Trump, a Republican who won the presidential election by securing a majority in the Electoral College tally of delegates even as he lost the popular vote to Clinton by some 3 million votes. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a watchdog group, has filed a lawsuit to block the commission's data request until its privacy impact can be weighed. A hearing in the case was scheduled for Friday afternoon. Related CoverageFactbox: How U.S. states responded to Trump panel's voter data requestThere is a wide consensus among state officials from both parties and election experts that voter fraud is rare. States rejecting the commission's attempts to gather voter information have called it unnecessary and a violation of privacy. Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance with the commission's requests. Republican Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the commission's vice chairman, said in a statement sent by the White House that 14 states and Washington, D.C., had rejected the request outright.   The commission will meet on July 19 to swear in members, formulate objectives and discuss next steps after asking the 50 states to turn over potentially sensitive voter information, according to a General Services Administration (GSA) notice published in the Federal Register. A June 28 letter from the election panel sought names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories. Matthew Dunlap, Maine's Democratic secretary of state and a commission member, on Friday dismissed Trump's claim that millions of voters illegally cast ballots.  We just don't see that,  he told CNN.  People are incredibly law abiding.  Although Maine is one state that has pushed back at the commission's request, Dunlap said he hopes the panel can tackle voting issues including ballot access and hacking. A Republican commission member, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, defended the panel, telling CNN on Thursday that fraud with even  one vote per precinct ... can change the course of history.  A court filing in the Electronic Privacy Information Center case also showed the panel plans to house data on White House computers rather than at the GSA. The Washington Post, which earlier reported the filing, noted GSA would be required to follow specific privacy requirements. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trump's favor. Moscow has dismissed the accusations. Trump has denied any collusion and has questioned the agencies' conclusion as well as any Russian role.

The drop means the Mercedes driver, second in the championship behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, cannot equal Michael Schumacher's pole position record of 68 at his home British Grand Prix next week. The triple world champion, who is currently on 66 poles and won in Austria last year, will have to wait until Hungary at the end of the month at the earliest. He had been favorite to take the top slot at the scenic Red Bull Ring after dominating Friday's two free practice sessions with Vettel second fastest. Qualifying is on Saturday after a final practice and Hamilton will be hoping that he is fastest to minimize the drop and that Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas is second to deny Vettel the top slot. A Mercedes team spokesman said the gearbox problem resulted from the previous race in Azerbaijan, where Hamilton started on pole but finished fifth after having to pit to fix a loose headrest. Formula One regulations stipulate that gearboxes must last six races unless a driver fails to finish for whatever reason. The Formula One technical delegate said in a statement he had been informed by Mercedes last Tuesday that the gearbox was damaged and needed changing, a detail the team had kept secret. Hamilton, who had told reporters earlier that pole was the goal, is 14 points behind Vettel after eight of 20 races. Both drivers have won three races. The pair clashed in Baku when Vettel drove into the back of the Mercedes while they were behind the safety car and then banged wheels angrily after pulling alongside. Vettel, who finished fourth in Baku, apologized for the incident of  road rage  -- and for claiming that Hamilton 'brake-tested' him -- after a hearing in Paris on Monday. Mercedes ruled out that contact as the cause of the gearbox problems.

The triple Formula One world champion, who has been on pole position at the Red Bull Ring for the past two years, was favorite for the hat-trick to move closer to Michael Schumacher's all-time record of 68. However, his team said later in the day he would collect a five-place penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change - something they had known but kept quiet about since Tuesday at least. Hamilton is on 66 poles, meaning another in Spielberg on Saturday would have set him up to equal the record at Silverstone, his home British Grand Prix, next week. Related CoverageHamilton handed five-place grid penalty in Austria The goal is pole,  he had told reporters after twice lowering his own circuit lap record during the day's two sessions.  But it's still going to be a tough race on Sunday for sure.  Hamilton, winner in Austria last year, is 14 points behind Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel after eight races but still has a good chance of going into the August summer break in the lead. Vettel, who like Hamilton has won three times so far this year, was only 0.147 seconds slower than his rival on Friday and Ferrari have a habit of closing the gap by the time Sunday comes around.

We had to swap out a spark plug during FP2 (the second session), but the guys did a great job to turn the car around and we still managed to complete our program,  Hamilton said.

There's already a nice balance and it feels good out on track. This car is so quick in comparison to what we raced here last year.  It's tricky, but a proper thrill to hook up a lap.

The drop means the Mercedes driver, second in the championship behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, cannot equal Michael Schumacher's pole position record of 68 at his home British Grand Prix next week. The triple world champion, who is currently on 66 poles and won in Austria last year, will have to wait until Hungary at the end of the month at the earliest. He had been favourite to take the top slot at the scenic Red Bull Ring after dominating Friday's two free practice sessions with Vettel second fastest. Qualifying is on Saturday after a final practice and Hamilton will be hoping that he is fastest to minimise the drop and that Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas is second to deny Vettel the top slot. A Mercedes team spokesman said the gearbox problem resulted from the previous race in Azerbaijan, where Hamilton started on pole but finished fifth after having to pit to fix a loose headrest. Formula One regulations stipulate that gearboxes must last six races unless a driver fails to finish for whatever reason. The Formula One technical delegate said in a statement he had been informed by Mercedes last Tuesday that the gearbox was damaged and needed changing, a detail the team had kept secret. Hamilton, who had told reporters earlier that pole was the goal, is 14 points behind Vettel after eight of 20 races. Both drivers have won three races. The pair clashed in Baku when Vettel drove into the back of the Mercedes while they were behind the safety car and then banged wheels angrily after pulling alongside. Vettel, who finished fourth in Baku, apologised for the incident of  road rage  -- and for claiming that Hamilton 'brake-tested' him -- after a hearing in Paris on Monday. Mercedes ruled out that contact as the cause of the gearbox problems.

Government data on Friday showed that average hourly earnings in June rose just 2.5 percent on the year and have slowed in the past two quarters rather than accelerating even as workers become scarce due to continued economic strength. The lack of wage growth is mirrored across the developed world, most of which has staged a slower recovery than the United States.  For decades, higher wages had been driven by gains in worker productivity, but there are few signs now of an investment boom or of innovations fundamentally changing the way work is done. Productivity growth in the U.S. has averaged just one percent since 2005, half the level of 1990-2004; in the past five years the annual growth rate has been a dismal 0.5 percent.    There is no shortage of explanation as to why wage growth remains tepid – shadow slack, reduced bargaining power due to globalisation, de-unionization, automation, etc. – but what is puzzling is that wage growth, at least according to the average hourly earnings measure, was clearly accelerating in 2015 and 2016,  JPMorgan Economist Michael Feroli wrote after the data release.  Why it would slow only in the last two quarters is a mystery.  While most economists say the jobs numbers alone are enough to keep the Federal Reserve on a path to hike rates again this year, the slow wages growth implies limits to how high the Fed can push rates and raises questions about the longer-term health of the U.S. economy, which depends on consumer spending for 70 percent of its activity. International Monetary Fund data shows that across the developed world, the share of national income paid out to workers had fallen to less than 40 percent by 2015 from close to 55 percent in 1970, driven largely by technological change and globalisation.  You can’t continue to get all this job growth but there is no wage pressure. So something is not adding up at all,  said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. In March 2014 Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she believed that  perhaps 3 and 4 percent wage inflation would be normal.  Now the level appears to be stuck lower.  The new benchmark for what we call good is lower than what we historically thought,  said San Francisco Fed chief researcher Mary Daly, one of the Fed system's top labour economists.  I would suggest the landing place doesn't seem surprising to me given that we have very low productivity growth and inflation that’s not up to 2 percent,  Daly said in an interview last month. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said on Thursday the government could take some steps to boost productivity. Among these would be investing in basic research, infrastructure, education and public health, including clean air and drinking water.

The ceasefire, due to start at noon Damascus time (0900 GMT) on Sunday, was announced after a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit of major economies in the German city of Hamburg. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the area covered by the ceasefire affects Jordan’s security and is a “very complicated part of the Syrian battlefield.” Russia and Iran are the main international backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while Washington supports some of the rebel groups fighting to topple him. “I think this is our first indication of the U.S. and Russia being able to work together in Syria, and as a result of that we had a very lengthy discussion regarding other areas in Syria that we can continue to work together on to de-escalate the areas,  Tillerson said. Previous similar ceasefires have failed to hold for long and it was not clear how much the actual combatants -- Assad's government and the main Syrian rebel forces in the southwest -- are committed to this latest effort.     Former U.S. President Barack Obama struggled to find a strategy to end Syria's civil war, which killed nearly half a million people, turned cities into ruins and forced millions to flee abroad. Syria has also tripped up Trump, who promised better relations with Moscow but angered Russia in April by ordering missile strikes against a Syrian air base to punish Assad after a chemical weapons attack.  The Syria deal appeared to give Trump a diplomatic achievement at his first meeting with Putin where they also discussed the thorny issues of Moscow's alleged interference in the U.S. 2016 presidential election and North Korea's nuclear ambitions.                     Related CoverageSyria ceasefire 'first step' to more robust arrangement: U.S. officialUK defense minister welcomes Syria ceasefire, wants to see resultsGoals in Syria          Backed by Russian air power, Assad has regained ground in the last year or so lost to the mostly Sunni Muslim rebels. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the accord includes  securing humanitarian access and setting up contacts between the opposition in the region and a monitoring center that is being established in Jordan's capital.  The ceasefire should pave the way toward a more robust pacification effort, said a senior State Department official involved in the talks.  It is a first step in what we envision to be a more complex and robust ceasefire arrangement and de-escalation arrangement in southwest Syria, certainly more complex than ones we have tried in the past.   The official said further discussions would be needed to decide crucial aspects of the ceasefire, however, including  monitoring its enforcement. Tillerson said that by and large the objectives of the United States and Russia in Syria  are exactly the same.  But Washington and Moscow have long been at odds over Syria.     The United States has often called for the removal of Assad, who it blames for shootings of protesters at the start of the conflict and, more recently, chemical weapons attacks on civilians. Russia and Iran strongly back the Syrian leader, who gives both countries a strategic foothold in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite the ceasefire deal, Tillerson said the United States still sees  no long-term role for the Assad family or the Assad regime. And we have made this clear to everyone. We certainly made it clear in our discussions with Russia.  Robert Ford, who resigned in 2014 as U.S. ambassador to Syria over policy disagreements, said the Trump administration, like that of Obama, has  no national objective for the future of Syria nor any strategy for how to secure an objective were one identified.  By contrast, Russia's overall aim is clearer, said Ford, now a fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank in Washington.  The Russian objective is to insulate Damascus and the Syrian national government from outside pressure trying to pressure it into major concessions,  he said. A group of Syrian rebels that took part in the latest peace talks in Kazakhstan this month said in a statement it had “great concern over the secret meetings between Russia and Jordan and America to conclude an individual deal for southern Syria in isolation from the north,” which it described as an unprecedented event that “divides Syria and the opposition.”  The Syrian government and the Southern Front, the main grouping of Western-backed rebel groups in southwest Syria, did not immediately react to the ceasefire deal. It was not immediately clear exactly which areas of southwestern Syria would be covered by the ceasefire but earlier talks between the United States and Russia about a “de-escalation zone” covered Deraa province, on the border with Jordan, and Quneitra, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon welcomed any ceasefire in Syria but wanted to see results on the ground.  The recent history of the Syrian civil war is littered with ceasefires and it would be nice ... one day to have a ceasefire,  Fallon said at an event in Washington.

Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, known for his bold approach to cars, clean energy and space exploration, trumped dozens of competing proposals to build the gigantic lithium-ion battery that will serve as emergency back-up power for South Australia - a state racked by outages. But under the agreement, Tesla must deliver the 100-MW battery within 100 days of the contract being signed or it will be free - a commitment Musk made in a Tweet in March.   There will be a lot of people that will look at this -'Did they get it done within 100 days? Did it work?'  Musk told reporters in South Australia's capital city of Adelaide.   We are going to make sure it does.  The battery, designed to light up 30,000 homes if there is a blackout, will be built on a wind farm operated by France's Neoen - parts of which are still under construction. Musk said failing to deliver the project in time would cost his company  $50 million or more , without elaborating. It will be the largest lithium-ion battery storage project in the world, overtaking an 80 megawatt-hour facility in California, also built using Tesla batteries. Over the last three years, South Australia has decided to  shut down its coal-fired power stations and instead rely on wind, solar and gas. In particular it has raced ahead of the rest of the country in turning to wind power, which supplies 40 percent of its energy. The move has been applauded by environmentalists but left the state prone to outages as there is no way to store enough energy when the wind doesn't blow. In September, South Australia's 1.7 million residents were left without power, some of them for up to two weeks, when the grid overloaded and collapsed. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk speaks during an official ceremony in Adelaide, Australia, July 7, 2017 to announce that Tesla will install the world's largest grid-scale battery in the South Australian state. AAP/Ben Macmahon/via REUTERSThe battery is aimed at getting around the problem of inadequate storage.  Cost-effective storage of electrical energy is the only problem holding us back from getting all of our power from wind and solar,  said Ian Lowe a professor of science at Australia's Griffith University.  This project is a significant innovation to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale storage.  Lithium Ambitions  Dozens of companies from 10 countries, including privately owned Lyon Group, working with U.S. power company AES Corp (AES.N), expressed interest in the project. Now the sector is waiting to see if Musk can make good on his promise.  Tesla has been telling the world that it can and will finish the project within three months, said a source at a Korean competitor to Tesla, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.  It seems that confidence helped Tesla win, but typically this kind of project takes six months so we have to wait and see whether or not Tesla can do it,  the source said. Lithium-ion batteries have been in widespread use since about 1991, but mostly on a small scale, such as in laptops and cell phones. A typical lithium-ion battery can store 150 watt-hours of electricity in 1 kilogram of battery, representing more than double the capacity of nickel batteries. For their proponents who have long been pushing for grander use, the success of Musk's big South Australian experiment will be key to greater acceptance.  For lithium technology to take off on a global scale, they clearly need the storage capacity to make sure renewables can deliver 24 hours a day, seven days a week,  said Adrian Griffin, a geologist who specializes in lithium extraction.

The emergency 120-day ban of dicamba, produced by Monsanto Co, Germany's BASF and others, will go into effect as soon as paperwork is filed with the Arkansas Secretary of State, said agriculture department spokeswoman Adriane Barnes. Monsanto, which sells dicamba-tolerant crop seeds but does not have a dicamba formulation approved for sale in Arkansas, called the ban  premature.   It's not been clear to us that the investigation has been completed and that there is an understanding of what's going on,  said Lisa Safarian, Monsanto's vice president of North America.  This puts Arkansas farmers at a competitive disadvantage.  The ban will not have a material impact on Monsanto earnings, she said. The Arkansas Plant Board and Governor Asa Hutchinson recommended the ban after a spike in complaints that dicamba is drifting into neighboring fields and damaging crops. The state has logged nearly 600 complaints of crop damage as of Friday, according to the Arkansas Agriculture Department. The state's House and Senate Agriculture Committee voted on Friday to follow those recommendations. The Arkansas Legislative Committee elected to take no action, meaning the ban could go forward. Officials also approved an increase in fines for illegal use of dicamba to up to $25,000, from $1,000 currently, effective Aug. 1, Barnes said. Monsanto's newest biotech varieties of soybeans and cotton, sold under the Xtend name, are engineered to tolerate the herbicide. But most farmers in Arkansas do not plant the varieties so their crops are vulnerable to off-target drift. Supporters say dicamba is needed to control difficult-to-kill weeds. Opponents say it is prone to drifting and can damage crops not engineered to tolerate it. The ban is the latest regulatory headache for Monsanto after officials in California announced last week that the company's flagship herbicide glyphosate would be labeled as a probable carcinogen in the state. Monsanto has invested more than $1 billion in a dicamba facility in Luling, Louisiana, to supply demand it expects will blossom. Monsanto's dicamba formulation is approved for use in 33 other states.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, known for his bold approach to cars, clean energy and space exploration, trumped dozens of competing proposals to build the gigantic lithium-ion battery that will serve as emergency back-up power for South Australia - a state racked by outages. But under the agreement, Tesla must deliver the 100-MW battery within 100 days of the contract being signed or it will be free - a commitment Musk made in a Tweet in March.  There will be a lot of people that will look at this -'Did they get it done within 100 days? Did it work?'  Musk told reporters in South Australia's capital city of Adelaide.  We are going to make sure it does.  The project likely involves linking hundreds of smaller battery modules and is  very doable,  although the 100-day deadline might be tight, Sankar Das Gupta, chief executive of Canadian lithium-ion battery supplier Electrovaya, told Reuters. The battery, designed to light up 30,000 homes if there is a blackout, will be built on a wind farm operated by France's Neoen, parts of which are still under construction. Musk said failing to deliver the project in time would cost his company  $50 million or more  without elaborating. It will be the largest lithium-ion battery storage project in the world, overtaking an 80 megawatt-hour facility in California that also was built using Tesla batteries. Over the past three years, South Australia has decided to shut down its coal-fired power stations and instead rely on wind, solar and gas. It has raced ahead of the rest of the country in turning to wind power, which supplies 40 percent of its energy. The move has been applauded by environmentalists but left the state prone to outages as there is no way to store enough energy when the wind does not blow. In September, South Australia's 1.7 million residents were without power, some of them for up to two weeks, when the grid overloaded and collapsed. The battery is aimed at getting around the problem of inadequate storage.  Cost-effective storage of electrical energy is the only problem holding us back from getting all of our power from wind and solar,  said Ian Lowe a professor of science at Australia's Griffith University.  This project is a significant innovation to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale storage.  Lithium Ambitions Dozens of companies from 10 countries, including privately owned Lyon Group, working with U.S. power company AES Corp , expressed interest in the project. Now the sector is waiting to see if Musk can make good on his promise.  It seems that confidence helped Tesla win but typically this kind of project takes six months so we have to wait and see whether or not Tesla can do it,  said a source at a Korean competitor to Tesla, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Late last year, Tesla took about three months to provide a 20-megawatt energy storage system to a substation owned by Southern California Edison Co, the California utility said.  The Tesla technology is very mature. It's very well understood,  said Haresh Kamath, a battery researcher at the Electric Power Research Institute in California.  It's not a moonshot.  Lithium-ion batteries have been in widespread use since about 1991, but mostly on a small scale, such as in laptops and cell phones. For their proponents who have long been pushing for grander use, the success of Musk' s big South Australian experiment will be key to greater acceptance.  For lithium technology to take off on a global scale, they clearly need the storage capacity to make sure renewables can deliver 24 hours a day, seven days a week,  said Adrian Griffin, a geologist who specialises in lithium extraction.

We have not given up hope,  Tillerson told reporters after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on the sidelines of a G20 summit, just days after North Korea conducted what it said was its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Tillerson said the U.S. approach of stepping up pressure on North Korea through sanctions required patience.  I call it the peaceful pressure campaign ... This is a campaign to lead us to a peaceful resolution because if this fails, we don't have very many good options left,  he said.  It's one that requires calculated increases in pressure, allow the regime to respond to that pressure, and it takes a little time to let these things happen.  The United States, Japan and South Korea agreed on Friday to push for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution to apply new sanctions on North Korea. U.N. diplomats said the United States had given China a draft sanctions resolution. But Washington faces an uphill struggle to convince Russia and China to give quick backing to new U.N. sanctions. Experts say North Korea's ICBM launch on Tuesday was a major step forward in its declared intent to create nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States. Some U.S. experts say the missile appeared to have the range to hit Alaska, Hawaii and parts of the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Washington has warned it is ready to use force if need be to stop North Korea's weapons programs but the consequences of that could be catastrophic and it prefers global diplomatic action.

N.Korea sanctions resolution: diplomatsRussia has said further sanctions will not resolve the issue and on Thursday objected to a U.N. Security Council condemnation of North Korea's launch because the U.S.-drafted statement labeled it an ICBM, a designation Moscow disagrees with. Diplomats said on Friday that negotiations on the statement had stalled. Tillerson said Trump and Putin held differing views on how to deal with North Korea but that Washington would continue to press Moscow to help.  We're going to continue those discussions and ask them to do more. Russia does have economic activity with North Korea,  he said.

Trump has warned Beijing it could face U.S. economic and trade pressure unless it does more to rein in North Korea. Tillerson said China's responses to U.S. calls for it step up pressure on North Korea had been uneven.  China has taken significant action and then I think for a lot of different reasons, they’ve paused and didn’t take additional action,  he said. Referring to a U.S. decision last week to impose unilateral sanctions on two Chinese individuals and a shipping firm and to  accuse a Chinese bank of money laundering, he said:  Slideshow (3 Images) We've continued to make that clear to China that we would prefer they take the action themselves and we're still calling upon them to do that.  Tillerson said a Chinese and Russian proposal for the United States and South Korea to suspend joint military exercises in return for a freeze in North Korean weapons testing was unacceptable as it would freeze North Korea's programs at too high a level of capability.  We're asking North Korea to be prepared to come to the table with an understanding that these talks are going to be about how do we help you chart a course to cease and roll back your nuclear program. That's what we want to talk about.   We're not interested in talking about how do we have you stop where you are today.  North Korea on Friday described Tuesday's missile test as a  gift package  and vowed to deliver more.  “The U.S. will receive more ‘gift packages’ of different sizes from the DPRK (North Korea) in endless succession, as it tries harder to destroy, by means of sanctions and pressure, the overall national power and strategic position of the DPRK which have been drastically boosted,” the official KCNA news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said on Wednesday she would propose new sanctions to the 15-member U.N. Security Council in coming days. Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. Following a nuclear weapons test by North Korea in September it took the U.N. Security Council three months to agree strengthened sanctions.

Speaking at a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky, McConnell said:  If my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur,  the Associated Press reported.  No action is not an alternative,  McConnell was quoted as saying.  We've got the insurance markets imploding all over the country, including in this state.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed McConnell's comments as a possible opening that could help achieve a bipartisan solution to fix problems with former President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law, dubbed Obamacare.  It is encouraging that Senator McConnell today acknowledged that the issues with the (health insurance) exchanges are fixable and opened the door to bipartisan solutions to improve our healthcare system,  Schumer said in a statement.  Democrats are eager to work with Republicans to stabilize the markets and improve the law,  he added. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks at a Harden County Republican party fundraiser in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, U.S., June 30, 2017.Bryan WoolstonMany of the individual health insurance markets established under Obamacare have struggled, hurt by an unfavorable balance of sick and healthy customers, and some insurers have pulled out because of uncertainty on whether the government will continue to fund cost-sharing subsidies to help individuals pay premiums. Republicans have been fighting to repeal Obama's signature piece of domestic legislation since it was first approved. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress made repeal a central campaign promise last year. But efforts to replace the healthcare law this year have run into difficulties. The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a replacement bill in May. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 23 million people would lose insurance coverage under the House plan, the Senate made clear it would write its own bill rather than voting on the House measure. The Senate unveiled its healthcare measure in late June. That measure's fate was uncertain after the CBO predicted that under it 15 million people would lose health insurance in 2018, with the number growing to 22 million as a result of cuts to the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled that would take place in 2025. At least one Republican senator publicly opposed the bill and others were critical of it. McConnell can only afford to lose two Republicans from his 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate and still pass the measure.

Bern Museum of Fine Arts head Nina Zimmer, who took ownership of 150 drawings, lithographs and paintings this week ahead of an exhibition slated to begin in November, said research shows none of these were stolen by National Socialists. But questions linger over the provenance of some of the collection's pieces still in Germany, where a 2012 raid by authorities on a Munich apartment produced a sensation: 1,500 long-lost works by modern masters, including Pablo Picasso, Otto Dix and Henri Matisse.  Every restitution is a victory for us,  Zimmer said in an interview, while acknowledging such provenance sleuthing remains unpredictable.  I cannot make any promises.  In addition to Zimmer's exhibition in Bern, the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn, Germany, is also planning to display items from the collection, which to date has produced only five works confirmed to have been stolen by the Nazis. Four have been returned to heirs, so far, including a Matisse portrait,  Sitting Woman,  that belonged to Paris-based collector Paul Rosenberg.  Massive Trove Before its discovery five years ago, the massive trove was hidden for years in the German and Austrian homes of Cornelius Gurlitt.  His art-dealer father, Hildebrand, amassed it after being enlisted by the Nazis to sell so-called  degenerate  modern art they had seized from German museums.  Though original estimates for the collection's value topping $1 billion were likely exaggerated, experts said, the find is still spectacular.

When Cornelius Gurlitt died aged 81 in 2014, he named the Bern museum as benefactor.  It accepted, on the condition works whose lineage was unclear must remain in Germany.   The Bern museum is now working with the German Lost Art Foundation, which tracks Nazi era art thefts, to unravel the collection's murky past, though not everyone is pleased with the progress. Slideshow (5 Images)Christopher Marinello, a lawyer who helped Rosenberg's heirs recover their lost Matisse in 2015, said the pace of research has been glacial -- even after he provided German researchers with  full and complete provenance on a silver platter,  he said. Government Bureaucracy  Internal and governmental bureaucracy in Germany is quite out of control,  Marinello said in an email on Friday.  There is an inherent lack of sympathy for the victims of Nazi looting.    The German Lost Art Foundation, which took over from a previous task force last year, contends it is making  positive strides  including digitizing documents and making them available via the country's Federal Archives. The foundation is now scrutinizing 1,039 works from Gurlitt's collection, it said, of which 152 have produced some provenance evidence or claims from possible heirs that indicate they could be Nazi loot. Its work continues until December.  One of the biggest challenges is reaching reliable conclusions and addressing research gaps, especially in such a short period of time,  the foundation's Nadine Bahrmann said in an email.

It's been dry and they are not going to get a whole lot of rain,  said Don Keeney, meteorologist with MDA Weather Services. Persistent heat in the northern Plains has already scorched the spring wheat crop, sending Minneapolis Grain Exchange spring wheat futures soaring to a four-year high above $8 a bushel this week.  In North Dakota, the top spring wheat state, drought has hit ranchers as well as grain farmers, doubling hay prices as grazing land becomes scarce.  Western Corn Belt states such as Iowa and Nebraska, the No. 1 and 3 U.S. corn producers, have escaped major weather stress so far. The U.S. Department of Agriculture this week rated 78 percent of Iowa's corn and 75 percent of Nebraska's crop in good to excellent condition. But soil moisture is lacking in portions of both states, leaving corn more vulnerable to heat stress.  It will be a compounded effect in those drier areas. That does equate to a little more impact on the crop,  said Mark Licht, an Iowa State University extension agronomist. The latest weekly U.S. Drought Monitor, prepared by a consortium of climatologists, showed two-thirds of Nebraska and half of Iowa were abnormally dry. Next week's warm-up arrives just as the corn crop is starting to pollinate, the most critical stage for determining yield. Hot and dry conditions during pollination tend to limit yield potential. Rains in the western Midwest are likely to be limited as long as the high-pressure ridge that has been baking the northern Plains persists. As a result, said Commodity Weather Group meteorologist David Streit,  You are depending on scattered thundershower activity to do all the heavy lifting, instead of a classic front or storm system like you often see in the spring or fall.

Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, driven by hefty gains in healthcare, government, restaurants and the professional and business services sectors, the Labor Department said on Friday. It was the second biggest payrolls increase this year and beat economists' expectations for a 179,000 rise. “It’s a good run-of-the-mill jobs report,” Gundlach said in a telephone interview. Gundlach, known on Wall Street as the  Bond King,  said the payrolls report will keep the U.S. central bank in a tightening mode. “It’s not ‘old school’ sequential tightening when the Fed hiked at every meeting until something breaks,” such as a U.S. recession, Gundlach said. “What we have now is the ‘new old school’ sequential tightening.” Gundlach, who oversees more than $109 billion in assets under management at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine, said it appears as though the Federal Reserve has been paying attention to record stock prices. “I think the Fed is emboldened to hike when the stock market is pushing near highs and when there is a sense or whiff of panic in the air, they start to talk cautiously.” Friday, the Fed said in its semiannual report to Congress that vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system  remained, on balance, moderate.  Gundlach said the Fed was  getting awfully specific  on asset prices in its semiannual report.  It almost sounds like they are saying, 'I warned you and don't blame us.' I told you we were going to do this (hike rates) and asset prices are going down. If stocks go down 10 percent in October, don’t blame us.    The Fed's report stated that forward equity price-to-earnings ratios rose a bit further and are now at their highest levels since the early 2000s, while a measure of the risk premium embedded in high-yield corporate bond spreads declined a touch from an already low level, implying high asset valuations in the market as well. (bit.ly/2sP7Rb5)  Prices of CRE (Commercial Real Estate) have continued to advance at a rapid clip amid slowing rent growth and rising interest rates, though there are signs of tightening credit conditions in CRE markets,  the Fed said.  In derivatives markets, investor compensation for bearing near-term volatility risk has remained low, suggesting a sustained investor risk appetite.

Shares of Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc, Hi Crush Partners LP and Smart Sand Inc each fell more than 10 percent. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc fell nearly 9 percent and Emerge Energy Services LP lost nearly 8 percent. On Thursday, privately held Unimin Corp, the third largest supplier by capacity of so-called frack sand, said it would open a new mine in West Texas and produce up to 5 million tons of sand annually, beginning early next year. Fracking is short for hydraulic fracturing, a technique in which sand and water are forced into wells at high pressure to free up trapped oil and gas. Unimin's proposed Permian Basin mine would bring total new sand supplies recently announced for West Texas to about 32 million tons a year, said Brad Handler, oilfield services analyst at Jefferies LLC.  Sand sales, and prices, have been rising this year because shale producers are using more sand per well and drilling more wells. Sand-mining capacity nationwide today is about 85 million tons, but Handler projected that producers will need about 100 million tons in 2018.   Investors are fearing that this onslaught of supply and  lower-than-expected oil prices will leave demand a lot less than 100 million tons,  he said, referring to Friday's market sell off.  Prices for frack sand obtained at the mine is between $35 a ton to $38 a ton, up from a recent bottom of about $18 to $19 a ton, Handler said. Much of the sand supplied to West Texas comes from mines in Wisconsin and Illinois, and transportation adds about $90 a ton to reach the Permian Basin.  The price of sand is a key factor in shale wells. The material represents about 12 percent of the cost of drilling and fracturing a well, he said. With oil prices under $45 a barrel, producers are eager to cut sand supply costs.   Investors are looking at all the new mine capacity in the Permian and that threatens the pricing outlook for sand from existing companies,  located farther away, Handler said.

The growth of Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google and other tech companies has strained neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay area that were not prepared for an influx of tens of thousands of workers during the past decade. Home prices and commute times have risen. Tech companies have responded with measures such as internet-equipped buses for employees with long commutes. Facebook has offered at least $10,000 in incentives to workers who move closer to its offices.  Those steps, though, have not reduced complaints that tech companies are making communities unaffordable, and they have mostly failed to address the area's housing shortage.   The problem with Silicon Valley is you don't have enough supply to keep up with the demand,  said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at real estate research firm CoreLogic.  With Facebook's construction plan, the company said it wanted to invest in Menlo Park, the city some 45 miles (72 km) south of San Francisco where it moved in 2011.  The company said it wants to build a  village  that will also have 1.75 million square feet of office space and 125,000 square feet of retail space.

Facebook/Handout via REUTERS Part of our vision is to create a neighborhood center that provides long-needed community services,  John Tenanes, Facebook's vice president for global facilities, said in a statement.  The 1,500 Facebook housing units would be open to anyone, not just employees, and 15 percent of them would be offered at below market rates, the company said.  Facebook said it expects the review process to take two years.

Menlo Park Mayor Kirsten Keith said in an interview that there were concerns about whether the Facebook plan would increase traffic, a subject the city's planning department would study. She said, though, that Facebook's plan fits with the city's own long-term plan for development, and that the city was excited about the additional housing.  Facebook's Tenanes said the density of the proposed development could also entice spending on transit projects.   The region's failure to continue to invest in our transportation infrastructure alongside growth has led to congestion and delay,  he said.

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency found that risks to banks lurk in competition from nonfinancial lenders and in the rapid evolution of money laundering and terrorism financing methods.  The OCC pointed to heavy reliance on third-party servicers and vendors as a place where banks could be vulnerable to a variety of threats, as they rely on outside firms to carry out critical activities or provide cyber security.  Many banks have increasingly leveraged and become dependent on third-party service providers to support key operations within their banks. Over time, consolidation among service providers has resulted in large numbers of banks (becoming) reliant on a small number of service providers,  according to the regulator.  It added that that can create  concentrated points of failure for certain lines of business or operational functions for a large segment of the banking industry.  Banks also could run the risk of falling afoul of multiple new or amended regulations in lending and real estate, because their vendors are not aware of regulatory changes, the OCC said. Banks may rely on outside firms or software to process loan applications, underwrite or close loans, which could open them to challenges in complying with the new regulations.   The OCC said loan growth in commercial real estate and looser underwriting standards are also top areas of risk. The regulator is keeping its eye on a number of areas that could develop into systemic risks or may affect certain banks, as well: England's departure from the European Union known as Brexit, declines in commodity prices, auto loans and interest-rate changes. The agency found that U.S. banks' revenue increased 3.6 percent in 2016 from 2015, mostly due to their net interest income - the difference between interest earned on assets and paid on liabilities - which had the largest gain since 2010. Meanwhile, residential mortgages began growing again last year, helping boost bigger banks.

Islamic State militants are waging an insurgency in the rugged, thinly populated Sinai Peninsula. They have killed hundreds of soldiers and police since 2013, when the military ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi after mass protests against his rule. The two cars blew up at two checkpoints outside of a military compound just south of Rafah, on the border with the Gaza Strip, the security sources said.  In a statement Islamic State said its fighters targeted the  compound because the military was preparing to launch operations against the Sunni Muslim militant group from there. The security sources said another 26 soldiers were injured in Friday's attacks. The military put the casualties lower, saying the attacks had killed and injured a total of 26 soldiers, without providing a breakdown of the figure. The attack is the most severe in Sinai since at least July 2015, when Islamic State militants assaulted simultaneously a slew of checkpoints and military sites around North Sinai. At least 17 soldiers were killed, according to an official tally. Related CoverageIslamic State claims car bomb attacks on military checkpoints in Egypt's Sinai: statementFriday's bombings present a challenge for general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who describes Islamist militancy as an existential threat and himself as a bulwark against extremism in a region beset by violence and war. Counter-Strike Security sources described Friday's attack as a coordinated strike, with car bombs blowing apart checkpoints as gunmen in four-wheel drive vehicles shot down soldiers running for cover.  Militants in armored vehicles meanwhile fired rocket propelled grenades at a military site just beyond the checkpoint, the sources said. The military carried out a counter-attack almost immediately after, deploying fighter jets to kill over 40 militants suspected of involvement and destroying six of their vehicles, according to a video released by the military showing aerial footage of air strikes. The military posted photos of five dead militants in blood-soaked fatigues lying in the sand. It did not name their affiliation.   Law enforcement forces in North Sinai succeeded in thwarting a terrorist attack on some checkpoints south of Rafah,  a military statement said.

Islamic State militants are waging an insurgency in the rugged, thinly populated Sinai Peninsula. They have killed hundreds of soldiers and police since 2013, when the military ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi after mass protests against his rule. The two cars blew up at two checkpoints outside of a military compound just south of Rafah, on the border with the Gaza Strip, the security sources said.  In a statement Islamic State said its fighters targeted the  compound because the military was preparing to launch operations against the Sunni Muslim militant group from there. The security sources said another 26 soldiers were injured in Friday's attacks. The military put the casualties lower, saying the attacks had killed and injured a total of 26 soldiers, without providing a breakdown of the figure. The attack is the most severe in Sinai since at least July 2015, when Islamic State militants assaulted simultaneously a slew of checkpoints and military sites around North Sinai. At least 17 soldiers were killed, according to an official tally. Related CoverageIslamic State claims car bomb attacks on military checkpoints in Egypt's Sinai: statementFriday's bombings present a challenge for general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who describes Islamist militancy as an existential threat and himself as a bulwark against extremism in a region beset by violence and war. Counter-Strike Security sources described Friday's attack as a coordinated strike, with car bombs blowing apart checkpoints as gunmen in four-wheel drive vehicles shot down soldiers running for cover.  Militants in armored vehicles meanwhile fired rocket propelled grenades at a military site just beyond the checkpoint, the sources said. The military carried out a counter-attack almost immediately after, deploying fighter jets to kill over 40 militants suspected of involvement and destroying six of their vehicles, according to a video released by the military showing aerial footage of air strikes. The military posted photos of five dead militants in blood-soaked fatigues lying in the sand. It did not name their affiliation.   Law enforcement forces in North Sinai succeeded in thwarting a terrorist attack on some checkpoints south of Rafah,  a military statement said.

If Elliott, the hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, proceeds with such a bid, it would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. Elliott would seek to convert its debt in the company to equity, as well as raise new equity financing for its bid, the sources said. As with Buffett's deal, a bankruptcy judge would have to approve Elliott's alternative plan. Elliott's stance illustrates the complexities of acquiring companies whose debt is trading at distressed levels. SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, another famed dealmaker, saw the $14 billion merger between the Japanese company's satellite startup OneWeb and debt-laden peer Intelsat SA collapse last month after many of the latter's creditors refused to back the deal.  The hedge fund believes it can put together a higher offer than the deal announced on Friday by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which has a total value of $18.1 billion including debt, the people said. In May, Elliott held about $2.9 billion of Oncor parent Energy Future Holdings' roughly $10 billion debt load, with its investment concentrated in a layer of unsecured payment-in-kind notes trading at deeply distressed levels. The hedge fund amassed its position in Energy Future's debt from October to May, according to court papers.  Elliott is considering pursuing an alternate deal for Energy Future because it thinks Berkshire's offer undervalues the Oncor business, seen as the bankrupt company's crown jewel asset, the people said. Elliott may also seek to use its rights as a creditor to Energy Future to block the sale of the company to Berkshire in bankruptcy court, according to the sources.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Elliott declined to comment, while Oncor and Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire's pursuit of Energy Future comes after two other suitors, most recently NextEra Energy, failed to win approval from regulators. The unsecured payment-in-kind notes Elliott holds fell in value by close to 30 percent in secondary trading on Friday on news of the Berkshire deal, to about 29.5 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns over these notes' recovery prospects. When NextEra clinched a deal last year to buy Energy Future and Oncor in a deal worth $18.4 billion, including debt, Berkshire also submitted a bid at the time, the sources said. Berkshire's bid then valued Energy Future at more than its deal on Friday does, the sources added.  Elliott has developed a reputation on Wall Street as an aggressive debt investor, having engaged in a fierce battle with Argentina over its sovereign debt that spanned more than a decade.  Elliott filed a lawsuit in May against Energy Future asking for it to consider debt reorganization alternatives, including a plan that would involve converting Elliott's significant debt holdings in the company to equity, eventually putting Oncor under the hedge fund's control.

Tomic, who said he could not find motivation during his first round defeat, was fined 11,600 pounds ($15,010.40) for  unsportsmanlike conduct  after also admitting he took a medical pause just to break up the momentum of the game. On Thursday, the 24-year-old was dropped by his sponsor Head who disassociated themselves from his comments. But American Gilbert, who has also coached American Andy Roddick and Japan's Kei Nishikori and as a player reached the last eight at Wimbledon in 1990, said Tomic needed to question his own attitude.  I'm 55 years old and I have been coming here since I was 21. This is the Cathedral of our sport and you should want to play here for free,  he told Reuters in an interview.  He needs to find in himself why he said those things and why he acted that way.  He got off light with the fine that he got. They could have taken his first round prize money off him and suspended him,  he said. No Excuse Defenders of Tomic have said he has been attacked for being honest and that other players sometimes feel the same. But Gilbert said that was no excuse.  Whether he is honest or not, that is not how you act when you are a professional tennis player and he's been here at the quarter-finals (in 2011).   If you are bored, you need some soul searching,  he said. Gilbert's former protege, American Andre Agassi, who has admitted to  hating  tennis in the past, struck a different tone when asked about Tomic and life on the grind of the tour.  It is not easy, for some people it is harder than others based on a variety of reasons. The fact that he is aware of how he is feeling, I think is a step in the right direction,  he told Reuters Television in an interview.  You have got to identify a problem before you can solve it. If he has identified that he is not liking the game then my suggestion would be go about finding your solution . World number one Andy Murray, however, was adamant that players should be taken to task for feigning injury.   If you're saying you're taking injury timeouts and stuff purely to try and throw the opponent's rhythm off, to use it tactically, that isn't good,  he told reporters.   Something has to happen with that. That's breaking the rules intentionally. I'm not saying he's the only player that does it. But if you go and say that, obviously you're going to get fined.

The growth of Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google and other tech companies has strained neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay area that were not prepared for an influx of tens of thousands of workers during the past decade. Home prices and commute times have risen. Tech companies have responded with measures such as internet-equipped buses for employees with long commutes. Facebook has offered at least $10,000 in incentives to workers who move closer to its offices.  Those steps, though, have not reduced complaints that tech companies are making communities unaffordable, and they have mostly failed to address the area's housing shortage.   The problem with Silicon Valley is you don't have enough supply to keep up with the demand,  said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at real estate research firm CoreLogic.  With Facebook's construction plan, the company said it wanted to invest in Menlo Park, the city some 45 miles (72 km) south of San Francisco where it moved in 2011.  The company said it wants to build a  village  that will also have 1.75 million square feet of office space and 125,000 square feet of retail space.

The 1,500 Facebook housing units would be open to anyone, not just employees, and 15 percent of them would be offered at below market rates, the company said.  Facebook said it expects the review process to take two years.

Menlo Park Mayor Kirsten Keith said in an interview that there were concerns about whether the Facebook plan would increase traffic, a subject the city's planning department would study. She said, though, that Facebook's plan fits with the city's own long-term plan for development, and that the city was excited about the additional housing.  Facebook's Tenanes said the density of the proposed development could also entice spending on transit projects.   The region's failure to continue to invest in our transportation infrastructure alongside growth has led to congestion and delay,  he said.

The world number one and defending champion was far from his best against the 29th-ranked Fognini, but still booked a fourth- round spot with a rip-roaring 6-2 4-6 6-1 7-5 win on Friday.  Murray saved five break points in the fourth set, before winning five successive games to prevent himself being dragged into an energy-sapping decider that would have put further strain on the niggling hip injury he has been nursing.  I didn't feel like I played my best tennis,  Murray told reporters.  But I won and I got through it. You know, that's a really positive thing.    It is the 10th successive year Murray has reached the last 16 at Wimbledon and he had never lost at this stage to somebody ranked as low as Fognini.  Yet, with the Italian showman having beaten Murray in three of their six previous outings, this was never going to be easy for the Briton and so it proved in an encounter where the momentum swung dramatically from one player to the other. Polar Opposites In tennis terms, Murray and Fognini are polar opposites: the Italian is the epitome of attacking flamboyance, while Murray is a determined defender. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 7, 2017   Great Britain's Andy Murray’s wife Kim Sears celebrates during his third round match against Italy’s Fabio FogniniToby MelvilleFognini also spent much of Friday's encounter strutting around Centre Court, while Murray's awkward gait seems to have been exaggerated by his hip problem.  That did not seem to be troubling Murray, however, when he broke Fognini twice and raced to take the first set.  Slideshow (6 Images)The Italian battled back at the start of the second, breaking in the first game, before immediately surrendering the advantage, which prompted him to hurl his racket into the ground and receive his first ticking off from the umpire. He regained his cool and broke Murray's serve again in the fifth game, this time consolidating and holding firm to clinch the set. It was then Murray's turn to regain the upper hand as Fognini appeared to be struggling with an ankle injury that required treatment on court, allowing the world number one to wrap up the set with two breaks of serve.  Murray's hopes of an easy route into the last 16 were dashed, however, as the Italian came out firing in the fourth. After Fognini received a point penalty for what the umpire called a visible obscenity, he broke Murray in the fifth game and then had a series of set points both on his serve and the Briton's. Yet, with the Centre Court crowd willing Murray on, the Scot fought back, breaking twice before serving out with an ace.

Michaels is credited with having ushered back into English common parlance the honorific as an alternative to  Mrs.  and  Miss , titles that mark a woman's marital status. Michaels, who lived in New York City and her native city of St. Louis, died from acute leukemia, said Howard Nathanson, a cousin, in a phone interview. A woman of many professions - she was a civil rights activist, technical editor, restaurateur and taxi driver, Nathanson said - her push for the adoption of  Ms.  in feminist circles was at first unsuccessful.  She described the initiative as  a timid eight-year crusade   initially met with indifference by her peers until finally catching fire following a radio interview in the late 1960s, she said in a newspaper interview in 2000. The honorific was eventually adopted by leading feminist figure, Gloria Steinem, through the founding of the influential  Ms.  magazine in 1971, according to a magazine blog post. Though Michaels did not coin the title, it had fallen into disuse until, as a young woman in New York City, she stumbled upon mail that addressed its female recipient as  Ms.   I was stunned. Never having seen the term before, it seemed to provide me with the perfect solution to a problem that had bothered me for years,  she told the Japan Times newspaper.  (I) was looking for a title for a woman who did not 'belong' to a man,  she said in a 2007 interview with The Guardian. The first known use of  Ms.  goes back to 1901, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. It is used  when the marital status of a woman is unknown or irrelevant,  the dictionary says.  Mrs. , in contrast, is used before a married woman's surname, while  Miss  is used  as a title prefixed to the name of an unmarried woman or girl,  according to the dictionary. Michaels died on June 22 but the family published her obituary in a St. Louis newspaper on Thursday. She was divorced - and as a young woman indifferent to the institution of marriage, she said. In tributes on Friday, Twitter users celebrated Michaels' legacy.       Language is important. She made a real difference,  wrote Christina Richards, a psychologist, in one tweet.  MS. FOR LIFE,  wrote another user, Christine Chalifoux. In St. Louis, Nathanson, 63, said his older cousin  was not one to crow  about having left her mark on feminism.  I think the cause was more important to her than the acclaim,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  My daughter would refer to Sheila as her kick ass cousin,  said Nathanson.  Because she was involved in so many causes and she was fiercely loyal to them.

Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after. Uber denies it used any of Waymo's trade secrets. A trial is scheduled for October. Waymo and ride-hailing service Lyft, which is a competitor to Uber, announced a partnership to get self-driving vehicles on the roads earlier this year. As part of its litigation defense, Uber requested documents and other information about the deal from both Waymo and Lyft. In a ruling on Friday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ordered Waymo to disclose due diligence documents over the deal, saying Uber could use them to assess Waymo's argument that it suffered monetary damages from Uber's actions. Corley said Lyft did not have to produce any documents. A Waymo spokesman did not have immediate comment on the ruling. Also on Friday, Waymo said it would dismiss three out of four patent claims it had filed against Uber, while maintaining one patent claim over a circuit for its laser technology. U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the case, had previously said Waymo's patent claims appeared meritless.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/uber-alphabet-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JY1TL"},

In its brief order, the Supreme Court did not give any reasons for lifting an injunction against the so-called  cocaine mom  law imposed last April by a federal judge in Madison, Wisconsin, who said it was unconstitutionally vague.  Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have kept the injunction in place.  Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said the decision was  a victory for the rule of law and restores important tools that make mothers and children safer and stronger.  Wisconsin's Unborn Child Protection Act, enacted in 1998, gives courts power over any expectant mother who  habitually lacks self-control  over drugs or alcohol, placing an unborn child at risk. The law allows officials to hold the pregnant woman in custody if she refuses treatment.  Former Wisconsin resident Tamara Loertscher sued state officials in 2014 after a hospital in Eau Claire, Wisconsin reported her for testing positive for after methamphetamines and marijuana while she was three months pregnant.  She said she had stopped using the drugs, but a juvenile court judge jailed her for 18 days until she agreed to be assessed by a drug treatment facility.  She submitted to weekly drug testing and gave birth to a healthy baby boy in 2015, according to court papers.  An attorney for Loertscher, Jeff Bowen, said in an email he was disappointed with Friday's decision to keep the law in place, noting the lower court ruling was based on  extensive evidence.  Loertscher claimed the law's terms were ambiguous, in violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of due process under the law. She was supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Public Health Association, which said that the law's coercive measures actually deter women who use drugs from accessing prenatal care. Last April U.S. District Judge James Peterson sided with Loertscher, blocking enforcement of the unborn child law statewide.  The state appealed, and last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in Chicago refused to lift the injunction while it reviews the case.  The state then turned to the Supreme Court, arguing that the injunction threatens the health and lives of unborn children.

In a written order on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Dora Irizarry in Brooklyn accepted the resignation of Bart Schwartz, chairman of professional monitoring firm Guidepost Solutions LLC. Schwartz had been appointed receiver after prosecutors in December accused Platinum leaders of running a more than $1 billion fraud. The six men have pleaded not guilty.

News of the attacks surfaced a week ago when Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a June 28 alert to industrial firms, warning them of hacking targeting the nuclear, power and critical infrastructure sectors.  DOE is working with our government and industry partners to mitigate any impact from a cyber intrusion affecting entities in the energy sector,  a Department of Energy representative said in an email to Reuters.  At this time, there has been no impact to systems controlling U.S. energy infrastructure. Any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks.  It was not clear who was responsible for the hacks. The joint report by the DHS and the FBI did not identify the attackers, though it described the hacks as  an advanced persistent threat,  a term that U.S. officials typically but not always use to describe attacks by culprits. The DOE discussed its response to the attacks after Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas was among at least a dozen U.S. power firms breached in the attack, citing current and former U.S. officials who were not named.  A representative with the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp declined to say if the plant was hacked, but said it continued to operate safely.   There has been absolutely no operational impact to Wolf Creek. The reason that is true is because the operational computer systems are completely separate from the corporate network,  company spokeswoman Jenny Hageman said via email. A separate Homeland Security technical bulletin issued on June 28 included details of code used in a hacking tool that suggest the hackers sought to use the password of a Wolf Creek employee to access the network. Hageman declined to say if hackers had gained access to that employee's account. The employee could not be reached for comment. FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in front of the displayed cyber code in this illustration picture taken on March 1,  2017.Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File PhotoThe June 28 alert said that hackers have been observed using tainted emails to harvest credentials to gain access to networks of their targets.  Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,  the report said. David Lochbaum, a nuclear expert at the nonprofit group Union of Concerned Scientists, said reactors have a certain amount of immunity from cyber attacks because their operation systems are separate from digital business networks. But over time it would not be impossible for hackers to potentially do harm.  Perhaps the biggest vulnerability nuclear plants face from hackers would be their getting information on plant designs and work schedules with which to conduct a physical attack,  Lochbaum said.   The DOE said it has shared information about this incident with industry, including technical details on the attack and mitigation suggestions.   Security professionals from government and industry are working closely to share information so energy system operators can defend their systems,  the agency representative said.  Earlier, the FBI and DHS issued a joint statement saying  There is no indication of a threat to public safety  because the impact appears limited to administrative and business networks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not received any notifications of a cyber event that has affected critical systems at a nuclear plant, said spokesman Scott Burnell.  A nuclear industry spokesman told Reuters last Saturday that hackers have never gained access to a nuclear plant.

The economy added 222,000 jobs last month, Labor Department data showed, exceeding expectations of a 179,000 gain, putting the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates once more this year. However, muted wage growth may give the Fed room to pause if need be.  The fears of rates rising too quickly have dissipated and market participants are looking for bargains in stocks that have sold off recently,  said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York.  Maybe there was just enough bad news in a great jobs number to keep the Fed off the gas pedal.  Perceived chances of a rate hike at the U.S. central bank's December meeting stood at 48.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Policymakers have taken opposing views on inflation after it retreated further below the Fed's 2 percent target in May, creating uncertainty over the future path of rate hikes.

Jimmy Causey, 46, escaped from the Lieber Correctional Institution in Ridgeville on Tuesday. He appeared to have coordinated the breakout using the smuggled cell phone and then used the tools to cut through fences, state Department of Corrections Director Bryan Stirling said. Causey, who is serving a life sentence for kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges, also left a makeshift dummy in his bed to deceive prison guards.  We believe that a drone was used to fly in the tools that allowed him to escape,  Stirling said at a news conference. Texas Rangers captured the inmate at an Austin, Texas, motel early on Friday. He had a handgun, a shotgun, ammunition, four cell phones and more than $47,000 in cash, state Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel said. It was Causey's second prison escape. In 2005, he and a fellow inmate escaped from another prison and were captured days later, Columbia television station WIS reported. Deliveries of contraband to prisons by drones have become increasingly common as the unmanned aircraft grow more popular. A Maryland inmate was convicted in 2016 of trying to smuggle drugs into a prison using an unmanned aircraft. In 2015, a drone dropped illicit drugs and tobacco into an Ohio prison's exercise yard, sparking a fight. In Britain, police recovered two drones carrying cell phones and drugs near a London prison last year and have set up a special unit - Operation Airborne - to catch offenders trying to fly contraband into jail. Stirling said he and prison officials from around the United States have repeatedly asked federal authorities to allow state agencies to block cell phone transmissions from prisons.

In a written order on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Dora Irizarry in Brooklyn accepted the resignation of Bart Schwartz, chairman of professional monitoring firm Guidepost Solutions LLC. Schwartz had been appointed receiver after prosecutors in December accused Platinum leaders of running a more than $1 billion fraud. The six men have pleaded not guilty. At the suggestion of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Irizarry appointed former bankruptcy judge Melanie Cyganowski, now head of law firm Otterbourg's bankruptcy group, as Schwartz's replacement. The agency is pursuing civil claims against the Platinum leaders. However, Irizarry stopped short of approving changes the SEC proposed to the court order describing the receiver's duties, saying she would rule on that later. Some Platinum investors have criticized the changes as an attempt by the SEC to exercise control over the receiver, which they say could harm the value of their investments. Schwartz asked to resign in a June 23 letter. He said he believed investors would benefit from sinking more capital into some of Platinum's investments to increase their value, while the SEC favored a quick liquidation. The SEC's new proposed order on the receiver's role removes language about realizing Platinum assets'  true and proper value,  while adding more language about an  orderly liquidation.  In a June 30 letter to the court, a group of Platinum investors said the new proposed order  handcuffs  the receiver. The investors said they believed they stood to gain more than $100 million from Schwartz's plan to make additional investments, calling his early removal a  nightmare scenario.  The SEC had called for Schwartz to be removed because he once did work for an unnamed law firm that is now a debtor to the Platinum estate. But in his letter, Schwartz said that did not present any conflict of interest. Platinum was the subject of a Reuters investigation published in April 2016 that highlighted its many complicated and illiquid investments in controversial companies.

After three months of anti-government unrest that has killed at least 90 people, Maduro has called for the Constituent Assembly, with powers to reform the national charter and supersede other institutions, in an election he says will bring peace. Opponents plan a rival, unofficial referendum on July 16 to give Venezuelans a say on what they view as a sham poll by the leftist president, accusing him of trying to formalize a dictatorship in the South American OPEC nation. Maduro has been trying to drum up his base, mostly state workers and poorer Venezuelans.

Do you agree,  he said to a chorus of  Yes! . Roughly 2.8 million state employees, a sizeable part of Venezuela's population of around 30 million, are often obliged to attend government rallies. Some have said they have  already come under pressure to vote on July 30.  This is crazy.

Maduro's wife and son are also running.  The opposition has said Maduro's pressure on workers is another sign he is violating democracy. Opponents are calling on him to agree to elections to replace him amid a brutal economic recession that has Venezuelans unable to afford basic food and medicine.  According to a recent survey by pollster Datanalisis, 67 percent of Venezuelans oppose the new assembly to rewrite the constitution, which was reformed by late leader Hugo Chavez in 1999. The Catholic church has also come out against the plan.  Slideshow (3 Images) This congress has been pushed forward by force and its result will be to render constitutional a military, socialist, Marxist and communist dictatorship,  Archbishop Diego Padron, who heads the main church authority Venezuela's Episcopal Conference, said on Friday.  The opposition coalition is hoping to further delegitimize Maduro's plans with their own vote, which will ask Venezuelans  their views on rewriting the constitution, the opposition's alternative push for an election, and the military's responsibility for  recovering constitutional order.   Should Venezuelans overwhelmingly vote against Maduro, lawmaker Freddy Guevara said the opposition would call for a national strike to pressure the president. Voting for the referendum will take place in some 1,766 sites and Venezuelans abroad, many of whom have fled Venezuela's meltdown, can participate, opposition lawmakers announced on Friday. University deans will oversee the process.  This is a civic rebellion,  Guevara said during the press conference.  We're at a historic moment, I'm sure there will be a before and after July 16.      State prosecutor Luisa Ortega has also broken ranks with Maduro over the constituent assembly. Amid an apparent bid to oust her, the Supreme Court named a deputy prosecutor, whom Ortega has rejected as illegitimate.  On Friday, the court-appointed deputy prosecutor entered the headquarters of the state prosecutor by hiding in the trunk of a car but was expelled by security personnel, a source at the prosecutor's office told Reuters.

June employment figures for both sides of the border came in stronger than expected. Canada added 45,300 jobs, topping the 10,000 forecast, while U.S. nonfarm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs, ahead of the 179,000 economists were expecting. Canada's 10-year bond yield touched its highest since June 2015 at 1.894 percent. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index fell 50.84 points, or 0.34 percent, to 15,027.16. It touched 14,915.78 during intraday trading, its lowest since mid-November. Of the index's 10 main groups, six declined.  Unfortunately the TSX, which is very heavily resourced based, stay hostage because of our constituent base,  said Sid Mokhtari, market technician and director of institutional equity research at CIBC World Markets. The energy group retreated 1.5 percent, while materials, which includes miners and other natural resource companies, lost 1.7 percent. The two sectors account for roughly a third of the index's weight. Financials, which account for another third, were nearly flat. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd was among the most influential movers on the downside, falling 1.4 percent to C$36.33. Encana Corp declined 2.2 percent to C$10.80. U.S. crude futures fell 2.8 percent to settle at $44.23 a barrel. Prices fell after data showed U.S. production rose last week just as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' exports hit a 2017 high, casting renewed doubt over the producers' efforts to curb persistent excess supply. Mokhtari said the energy sector had been demolished in recent months and that it was nearing a bottom.  It's too early to have a table-pounding 'buy' into the sector, but I do get a sense there's enough bearish sentiment for the complex that makes it attractive just from a contrarian perspective,  he said. Barrick Gold Corp stock fell 2.6 percent to C$19.81, while Goldcorp Inc was down 2.7 percent to C$16.15.

Kidney transplant is the preferred treatment for patients with end stage renal disease because it helps them live longer with a better quality of life and fewer hospitalizations than dialysis, the alternative. The primary factor the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) uses for allocating kidneys from deceased donors is how long patients have been waiting for organs. Under the old UNOS system, waiting times were largely based on when people joined the waiting list for a kidney. In part to address long-standing racial and ethnic disparities in the old system, in 2014 UNOS started calculating wait times based either on when people joined the waiting list or when they began dialysis, whichever came first.  For the study, researchers examined data on 179,071 people on the kidney transplant waiting list from June 2013 to September 2016, including the 34,133 individuals who received organs. White patients had a significantly higher kidney transplant rate than black or Hispanic patients under the old system, but with the new system the differences narrowed to the point where they might have been due to chance.  For some patients, it can take months or even years to get on the waiting list, due to significant delays and differences in how long doctors might wait to send patients for evaluation at transplant centers, said senior study author Dr. Rachel Patzer of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. “The new system tends to even the playing field by starting the clock at the start of the disease process,” Patzer told Reuters Health.  “For those that get a transplant sooner, their post-transplant survival is much better the less time spent on dialysis prior to transplant,” Patzer said by email.  The monthly transplant rate under the old UNOS system was 1.07 percent for white patients, compared with 0.80 percent for black people and 0.79 for Hispanics.  With the new system, however, the monthly transplant rate dropped to 0.95 percent for white people. At the same time, it rose to 0.96 percent for black people and 0.91 percent for Hispanic patients, researchers report in Health Affairs.  One limitation of the study is the relatively short duration of follow-up time after the new UNOS system took effect, the authors note. They also lacked data that might show how individual patient characteristics influenced who received a kidney or how long they waited.  Under the old system, for example, white patients might have had an advantage because they were more likely to have private health insurance, access to education about transplants or a car to get to the transplant center, said Amy Waterman, deputy director, Transplant Research and Education Center at the Terasaki Research Institute affiliated with the University of California Los Angeles.  “Since the clock started for waiting time when patients were listed at the transplant center officially, those who went forward for transplant evaluation faster, the white patients, benefited since they could begin accruing waiting time and move up the waiting list for a matching kidney,” Waterman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. The longer patients remain on dialysis, the more likely they are to die or develop other illnesses or complications of end stage renal disease that decrease their ability to have a transplant, said Dr. Clive Callender, a researcher at Howard University College of Medicine and founder and president of the National Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP) who wasn’t involved in the study. “The best advice is to get transplanted without dialysis and with a live donor,” Callender said by email.  “The fewer dialysis treatments you have, the better the chances you survive for a long period of time,” Callender said.

Venezuela's crude production has sharply decreased since 2012 amid a lack of investment and payment delays to oil service companies, affecting exports to PDVSA's customers, including those in the United States. PDVSA and its joint ventures sent 29 crude cargoes to the United States last month versus 42 cargoes in May, a 29 percent fall in the shipped volumes. Compared with exports in June 2016, the decrease was 25 percent. The main U.S. recipient of Venezuelan crude last month was refining firm Valero Energy. Sales to Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] declined almost 66 percent versus May to 68,400 bpd in June. OPEC member Venezuela is enduring an economic and political crisis in which opponents of socialist President Nicolas Maduro are calling on him to agree to elections to replace him. PDVSA's low production and frequent refinery woes have forced the company this year to increase its own crude and products imports amid cash flow problems that have led to delayed payments to suppliers and creditors.  The Venezuelan firm earlier this week awarded companies including Rosneft, Lukoil, Elemento Services and Helsinge several tenders to buy over 15 million barrels of fuels and components for the second half of 2017. Venezuelan crude sales to the United States recovered temporarily in April to 741,000 bpd, but they started declining again in May. The average for the first half of 2017 was 650,685 bpd, almost 8 percent less than the same period of last year.

Some have said they have  already come under pressure to vote on July 30.  This is crazy. (They're saying), workers who don't go to vote will be sacked,  said one employee of state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.[PDVSA.UL], asking to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to media.   I'll vote, but null. I'm not going to vote for any of these nuts running for the assembly,  he added. A second PDVSA worker, who supports the opposition, said company auditoriums were being used to give presentations about the constituent assembly.  I'm worried ... but I'm committed to the cause and I won't vote,  he said.

Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERSMany familiar faces of the ruling Socialist Party are vying for a seat, including former Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez and powerful party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello. Maduro's wife and son are also running.  The opposition has said Maduro's pressure on workers is another sign he is violating democracy. Opponents are calling on him to agree to elections to replace him amid a brutal economic recession that has Venezuelans unable to afford basic food and medicine.  According to a recent survey by pollster Datanalisis, 67 percent of Venezuelans oppose the new assembly to rewrite the constitution, which was reformed by late leader Hugo Chavez in 1999. The Catholic church has also come out against the plan.  Slideshow (3 Images) This congress has been pushed forward by force and its result will be to render constitutional a military, socialist, Marxist and communist dictatorship,  Archbishop Diego Padron, who heads the main church authority Venezuela's Episcopal Conference, said on Friday.  The opposition coalition is hoping to further delegitimize Maduro's plans with their own vote, which will ask Venezuelans  their views on rewriting the constitution, the opposition's alternative push for an election, and the military's responsibility for  recovering constitutional order.   Should Venezuelans overwhelmingly vote against Maduro, lawmaker Freddy Guevara said the opposition would call for a national strike to pressure the president. Voting for the referendum will take place in some 1,766 sites and Venezuelans abroad, many of whom have fled Venezuela's meltdown, can participate, opposition lawmakers announced on Friday. University deans will oversee the process.  This is a civic rebellion,  Guevara said during the press conference.  We're at a historic moment, I'm sure there will be a before and after July 16.      State prosecutor Luisa Ortega has also broken ranks with Maduro over the constituent assembly. Amid an apparent bid to oust her, the Supreme Court named a deputy prosecutor, whom Ortega has rejected as illegitimate.  On Friday, the court-appointed deputy prosecutor entered the headquarters of the state prosecutor by hiding in the trunk of a car but was expelled by security personnel, a source at the prosecutor's office told Reuters.

Venezuela's crude production has sharply decreased since 2012 amid a lack of investment and payment delays to oil service companies, affecting exports to PDVSA's customers, including those in the United States. PDVSA and its joint ventures sent 29 crude cargoes to the United States last month versus 42 cargoes in May, a 29 percent fall in the shipped volumes. Compared with exports in June 2016, the decrease was 25 percent. The main U.S. recipient of Venezuelan crude last month was refining firm Valero Energy. Sales to Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL] declined almost 66 percent versus May to 68,400 bpd in June. OPEC member Venezuela is enduring an economic and political crisis in which opponents of socialist President Nicolas Maduro are calling on him to agree to elections to replace him. PDVSA's low production and frequent refinery woes have forced the company this year to increase its own crude and products imports amid cash flow problems that have led to delayed payments to suppliers and creditors.  The Venezuelan firm earlier this week awarded companies including Rosneft, Lukoil, Elemento Services and Helsinge several tenders to buy over 15 million barrels of fuels and components for the second half of 2017. Venezuelan crude sales to the United States recovered temporarily in April to 741,000 bpd, but they started declining again in May. The average for the first half of 2017 was 650,685 bpd, almost 8 percent less than the same period of last year.

The forfeiture will include some 5,500 artifacts purchased by Hobby Lobby Inc that originated from the region of modern-day Iraq and were shipped under false labels, as well as an additional $3 million to settle the civil charges, the Department of Justice said in a statement.  The protection of cultural heritage is a mission that (Homeland Security Investigations) and its partner U.S. Customs and Border Protection take very seriously as we recognize that while some may put a price on these artifacts, the people of Iraq consider them priceless,” Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York, said in the statement. Privately held Hobby Lobby said that it was new to the world of antiquities when it began acquiring historical items in 2009 and made mistakes in relying on dealers and shippers who  did not understand the correct way to document and ship  them. A cuneiform tablet, an ancient clay artifact that originated in modern-day Iraq is seen in this  undated handout photo obtained by Reuters July 5, 2017. United States Attorney's Office Eastern District of New York/Handout via REUTERSThe company's president, Steve Green, is the chairman and founder of the Museum of the Bible, which is under construction in Washington, D.C. The artifacts being forfeited include cuneiform tablets and bricks, clay bullae and cylinder seals. Cuneiform is an ancient system of writing on clay tablets. Slideshow (3 Images) At no time did Hobby Lobby ever purchase items from dealers in Iraq or from anyone who indicated that they acquired items from that country,  Green said in his statement.  Hobby Lobby condemns such conduct and has always acted with the intent to protect ancient items of cultural and historical importance. ... “We have accepted responsibility and learned a great deal,” Green added, saying that the company has now  implemented acquisition policies and procedures based on the industry's highest standards.  Federal prosecutors say that when Hobby Lobby, which is based in Oklahoma City, began assembling its collection it was warned by an expert on cultural property law to be cautious in acquiring artifacts from Iraq, which in some cases have been looted from archaeological sites. Despite that warning and other red flags the company in December 2010 purchased thousands of items from a middle-man, without meeting the purported owner, according to prosecutors. A dealer based in the United Arab Emirates shipped packages containing the artifacts to three Hobby Lobby corporate addresses in Oklahoma City, bearing false label that described their contents as  ceramic tiles  or  clay tiles  and the country of origin as Turkey.

The deal with Omar Khadr marks the fifth time the Canadian government has settled with citizens who were detained abroad following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. All five blamed Canadian law enforcement and security forces for being complicit in their suffering. In 2010, the Canadian Supreme Court said Canada had breached Khadr's rights by sending intelligence agents to interrogate him in Guantanamo and sharing the results with the United States.  There are serious costs when the government violates the rights of its citizens,  Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said at a news conference. Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan after a firefight with U.S. soldiers. He spent a decade at the U.S. military base on the eastern tip of Cuba, which came to be used as a prison for terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the 2001 attacks on the United States.  Khadr pleaded guilty to killing a U.S. Army medic and became the youngest inmate held at Guantanamo Bay. He later recanted and his lawyers said he had been grossly mistreated. The settlement marks the end of a C$20 million ($15.55 million) civil suit Khadr filed against the Canadian government.  Sources close to the case said this week he would receive C$10.5 million. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said reaching a settlement was the only sensible course, given the court's ruling that officials had engaged in wrongdoing. Critics say law enforcement and security officials took short cuts in the wake of the 9/11 attacks that resulted in a slew of abuses.

Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative party, said the deal was  not just wrong but disgusting  and called on Khadr to give the money to the widow of the U.S. medic. Trudeau's Liberals took power in 2015, and moved to give legislators more oversight of law enforcement and security agencies. The government wants to create the post of intelligence commissioner to examine requests by agencies to gather information abroad. Slideshow (5 Images)Alex Neve, head of Amnesty International's Canadian wing, said it was an open question whether the reforms could prevent Khadr's case from happening again.  One of the reasons why settlement is so important ... is that it does ... make some headway against impunity and guard against future repetition,  he said by phone. The Conservatives, who were in office from 2006 to 2015, described Khadr as dangerous and resisted calls to press the United States for leniency. Paul Champ, one of Khadr's first lawyers, said it was not clear whether those responsible in Canada's national police force and spy agency had really learned their lesson.  Canadian officials have resisted responsibility and accountability for so long that I fear many ... will view this as a political settlement rather than a true repudiation and sanction for their conduct,  he said by e-mail.

In its brief order, the Supreme Court did not give any reasons for lifting an injunction against the so-called  cocaine mom  law imposed last April by a federal judge in Madison, Wisconsin, who said it was unconstitutionally vague. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have kept the injunction in place. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said the decision was  a victory for the rule of law and restores important tools that make mothers and children safer and stronger.  Wisconsin's Unborn Child Protection Act, enacted in 1998, gives courts power over any expectant mother who  habitually lacks self-control  over drugs or alcohol, placing an unborn child at risk. The law allows officials to hold the pregnant woman in custody if she refuses treatment. Former Wisconsin resident Tamara Loertscher sued state officials in 2014 after a hospital in Eau Claire, Wisconsin reported her for testing positive for after methamphetamines and marijuana while she was three months pregnant. She said she had stopped using the drugs, but a juvenile court judge jailed her for 18 days until she agreed to be assessed by a drug treatment facility. She submitted to weekly drug testing and gave birth to a healthy baby boy in 2015, according to court papers. Attorneys for Loertscher could not immediately be reached on Friday. Loertscher claimed the law's terms were ambiguous, in violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of due process under the law. She was supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Public Health Association, which said that the law's coercive measures actually deter women who use drugs from accessing prenatal care. Last April U.S. District Judge James Peterson sided with Loertscher, blocking enforcement of the unborn child law statewide. The state appealed, and last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in Chicago refused to lift the injunction while it reviews the case. The state then turned to the Supreme Court, arguing that the injunction threatens the health and lives of unborn children. Addicted women  will lose the help they have grown accustomed to receiving, at their most vulnerable hour,  the state added in legal papers.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-cocaine-idUSL1N1JY1RN"},

Brent crude LCOc1 settled down $1.40, or 2.9 percent, at $46.71 a barrel, after falling to $46.28, its lowest in more than a week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 finished $1.29, or 2.8 percent, lower at $44.23 a barrel, after trading as low as $43.78.  Both benchmarks posted a sixth weekly decline in the past seven weeks with WTI down 3.9 percent on the week and Brent off 2.5 percent.  The stream of relentless supply continues,  said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata.  He said OPEC exports were 2 million barrels per day (bpd)higher in June than in 2016, despite of an extension of a 1.8 million bpd production cut deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  We've seen exports last month from OPEC much stronger than they were in April and May, seemingly indifferent to the OPEC production cut deal,  Smith said.

[RIG/U] On Thursday, U.S. government data showed that U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA rose 1 percent to 9.34 million bpd last week after a drop the previous week due to maintenance work and storm shutdowns.  It takes somewhat lower prices to slow down U.S. production,  said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.     Amidst rising U.S. production, the market largely ignored a 6.3 million-barrel slump in U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI last week to 502.9 million barrels, the lowest since January.           U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said it expected WTI prices to remain below $50 until mid-2018, adding that   if output cuts from the OPEC are not enough, U.S. shale production will need to slow down for a chance of a balanced market in 2018.  Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to July 3, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. The increase came after hedge funds and other money managers cut U.S. crude net longs to a nine-month low in the previous week.

The Minsk agreement called for a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy. Related CoverageUkraine says U.S. special representative will help end Russian aggression At the request of President (Vladimir) Putin, the United States has appointed ... a special representative for Ukraine, Ambassador Kurt Volker,  Tillerson told reporters after a meeting between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko welcomed the choice, writing in a message on Twitter that it would help end what he called Russian aggression and restore Crimea to Ukraine.  Important & timely move in the interests of ending Russian aggression and restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, including Crimea,  Poroshenko tweeted. Volker was a career diplomat who served as permanent representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama. He is currently a foreign policy and national security expert at the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University.  Kurt's wealth of experience makes him uniquely qualified to move this conflict in the direction of peace,  Tillerson said in a statement.  The United States remains fully committed to the objectives of the Minsk agreements, and I have complete confidence in Kurt to continue our efforts to achieve peace in Ukraine.  Julie Smith, a former Pentagon official who worked on European and NATO policy during the Obama administration, praised the choice of Volker as Ukraine envoy, but said she was puzzled at Tillerson's statement that he filled the position at Putin's request.  So Ukraine didn't matter enough to this administration to have them appoint a special envoy in the first place?  said Smith, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.  It was a bizarre word choice.

Two years after coming within two points of beating eventual champion Serena Williams at the same stage, Watson was two games from reaching the second week of a grand slam for the first time but came unstuck in a 3-6 6-1 6-4 defeat by Victoria Azarenka.  I was gutted to lose that one. Just felt like I'd fallen at the same hurdle again. It hurt a lot today,  said Watson, who was toppled by Agnieszka Radwanska in the last 32 in 2012.  I've got to the third round quite a few times now in different slams. I really wanted to make that push for the second week for my singles.   The first few times I'd got to the third round, I was pleased with myself that I'd done well. (Now) I feel like I'm under-achieving.  Watson had never won a set off Azarenka before, let alone won any of their four previous encounters. But when the Briton won the first set on Friday with some sweetly struck winners, the Centre Court air was thick with anticipation that her coach Morgan Phillips would be investing in a heavy duty razor soon -- as he had promised to shave his legs if Watson reached the second week at Wimbledon. While little went her way in the second set, Watson again found her range in the third as she snapped back from being broken in the seventh game by drawing level at 4-4. It prompted one booming male voice to shout out:  Come on Miss Watson   Even when Azarenka was serving for the match at 5-4, Watson showed plenty of heart to claw herself two break points. But for all the fight she put up, Azarenka drew on the wealth of experience she has gained from winning two Australian Open titles to extinguish the Briton's challenge.      I backed myself more today as I'd been in the situation before,  said Watson, who will break back into the top 100 following her run here.  Yeah I did fall at the final hurdle, but I felt confident and fought as hard as I could for every single point.  As if facing Azarenka once was not enough, the Wimbledon draws appeared to have played a cruel trick on Watson as two hours later she was facing her again in a mixed doubles match on Court 8 with Finnish partner Henri Kontinen. This time Watson did get the upper hand on the Belarussian.  Well, I definitely didn't want to lose to her twice in one day, so I was very pleased to get through that, finish on a good note. Obviously I would have wanted to get the singles,  she added .  But she's so experienced. She's been at the top of the game for a long time. She just hung in there and played really well when it mattered.

Washington and Moscow have long questioned each other's commitment to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which banned nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500-5,500 km (300-3,400 miles). Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Russia President Vladimir Putin has disregarded Russia's obligations under the INF Treaty for years.  His recent deployment of banned nuclear-tipped missiles poses serious threats to U.S. national security interests,  Royce said.  And it's just one more example of Russian aggression that undermines global stability.  The U.S. military said in February that Russia had secretly deployed the ground-launched SSC-8 cruise missile in violation of the treaty. Russia has denied violating the treaty. Royce filed his measure as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a must-pass annual bill that sets policy for the Pentagon. The deadline for filing NDAA amendments was Friday. Royce's filing also coincided with President Donald Trump's first face-to-face meeting with Putin since he became the U.S. president in January. Trump promised a rapprochement with Moscow as he campaigned for president but many U.S. lawmakers, including many of his fellow Republicans, have sought to take a tough line against Russia.

Prices as measured by the benchmark IPCA index fell 0.23 percent in June, the sharpest drop since August 1998. The annual inflation rate fell to 3.00 percent, at the bottom end of the central bank's target band of 4.5 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage point.     A weaker-than-expected economic recovery has weighed on Brazilian inflation and allowed the central bank to cut the benchmark Selic rate from its highest level in eight years.     The bank has been signaling since its last policy meeting that it could reduce the pace of rate cuts to 75 basis points per meeting, from the current 100 basis points, because of growing political uncertainty.     Those bets lost some steam after the IPCA release. Rate-future yields indicated traders saw a roughly 60 percent chance of a 100 basis-point cut to 9.25 percent at the central bank's July meeting, with a 39 percent chance of a slower 75 basis-point reduction. Bets were evenly split on Thursday.      The Brazilian real strengthened 0.58 percent, in line with Latin American currencies such as Mexico's and Colombia's pesos.     Demand for emerging market assets rose after a report showed stubbornly sluggish U.S. wage growth in June despite stronger-than-expected jobs growth.     The report was the latest in a batch of mixed economic indicators that have left traders skeptical over the Federal Reserve's plan to increase rates once more this year and three times next year.     A slower pace of rate hikes would support the allure of emerging markets, which offer higher yields.

Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after. Uber denies it used any of Waymo's trade secrets. A trial is scheduled for October. Waymo and ride-hailing service Lyft, which is a competitor to Uber, announced a partnership to get self-driving vehicles on the roads earlier this year.  As part of its litigation defense, Uber requested documents and other information about the deal from both Waymo and Lyft. In a ruling on Friday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ordered Waymo to disclose due diligence documents over the deal, saying Uber could use them to assess Waymo's argument that it suffered monetary damages from Uber's actions. Corley said Lyft did not have to produce any documents. A Waymo spokesman did not have immediate comment on the ruling. Also on Friday, Waymo said it would dismiss three out of four patent claims it had filed against Uber, while maintaining one patent claim over a circuit for its laser technology. U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the case, had previously said Waymo's patent claims appeared meritless.

Signs of stabilizing prices in U.S. cash cattle markets after weeks of weaker prices buoyed live and feeder cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange even as wholesale beef prices continued to fall.     Most-active CME August live cattle        edged 0.175 cent lower to 114.775 cents per pound while most other contracts notched modest gains. The August contract shed 1.3 percent for the week and has lost ground in four out of the past five weeks.     CME August feeder cattle        were up 0.400 cent to 145.025 cents but declined nearly 2 percent for the week.     Cattle fetched mostly $117 to $118 per cwt in U.S. Plains cash cattle deals earlier this week, in sales marginally better than what some traders were anticipating. The cash trades helped futures recover from a two-month low on Thursday.     Still, demand for beef slows as consumers cook fewer steaks, chops and roasts in the peak heat of the summer, and the weaker meat prices often spill over into cattle prices.      I'm bearish on the cattle until I see some stability in the beef,  said independent livestock futures trader Dan Norcini.  There's not real strong demand for the beef at this time of year.      The U.S. Department of Agriculture said choice-grade wholesale beef was down $1.21 to $218.84 per cwt, lowest in more than two months.                     PORK BELLY PRICES NEAR RECORD HIGH     Wholesale pork prices were moving in the opposite direction, with the pork cutout up $1.12 to $104.96 per cwt, highest in more than two years, USDA data showed.     Prices for pork bellies used to make bacon surged $5.73 to $206.96 per cwt, near the record of $212.95 in April 2014.               The cutout, and belly cuts in particular, is what's supporting (hog) prices,  Norcini said.     Hog cash prices and futures have tracked gains in pork prices even as the U.S. hog herd was bigger than ever.

Waymo claimed in a lawsuit earlier this year that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, which Uber acquired soon after. Uber denies it used any of Waymo's trade secrets. A trial is scheduled for October. Waymo and ride-hailing service Lyft, which is a competitor to Uber, announced a partnership to get self-driving vehicles on the roads earlier this year.  As part of its litigation defense, Uber requested documents and other information about the deal from both Waymo and Lyft. In a ruling on Friday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ordered Waymo to disclose due diligence documents over the deal, saying Uber could use them to assess Waymo's argument that it suffered monetary damages from Uber's actions. Corley said Lyft did not have to produce any documents. A Waymo spokesman did not have immediate comment on the ruling. Also on Friday, Waymo said it would dismiss three out of four patent claims it had filed against Uber, while maintaining one patent claim over a circuit for its laser technology. U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who is overseeing the case, had previously said Waymo's patent claims appeared meritless.

The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency found that risks to banks lurk in competition from nonfinancial lenders and in the rapid evolution of money laundering and terrorism financing methods. The OCC pointed to heavy reliance on third-party servicers and vendors as a place where banks could be vulnerable to a variety of threats, as they rely on outside firms to carry out critical activities or provide cyber security.  Many banks have increasingly leveraged and become dependent on third-party service providers to support key operations within their banks.

It added that that can create  concentrated points of failure for certain lines of business or operational functions for a large segment of the banking industry.  Banks also could run the risk of falling afoul of multiple new or amended regulations in lending and real estate, because their vendors are not aware of regulatory changes, the OCC said.

Brent crude LCOc1 settled down $1.40, or 2.9 percent, at $46.71 a barrel, after falling to $46.28, its lowest in more than a week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 finished $1.29, or 2.8 percent, lower at $44.23 a barrel, after trading as low as $43.78.  Both benchmarks posted a sixth weekly decline in the past seven weeks with WTI down 3.9 percent on the week and Brent off 2.5 percent.  The stream of relentless supply continues,  said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata.  He said OPEC exports were 2 million barrels per day (bpd)higher in June than in 2016, despite of an extension of a 1.8 million bpd production cut deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  We've seen exports last month from OPEC much stronger than they were in April and May, seemingly indifferent to the OPEC production cut deal,  Smith said. Reuters oil data showed OPEC production is now at the highest level this year. A maze of crude oil pipes and valves is pictured during a tour by the Department of Energy at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Freeport, Texas, U.S. June 9, 2016.Richard CarsonRussia, which is cooperating with OPEC in a deal to stem production, said it was ready to consider revising parameters of the deal if needed. A group of oil-producing countries monitoring the deal will meet on July 24 in Russia, when they could recommend adjusting the pact. FILE PHOTO: Eighteen oil pumpjacks are seen on a Hess well pad near Tioga, North Dakota April 30, 2016.Andrew Cullen/File PhotoMeanwhile, U.S. producers seemed undeterred by lower prices with drillers adding seven oil rigs this week, according to energy services company Baker Hughes, bringing the total rig count up to 763, the most since April 2015. [RIG/U] On Thursday, U.S. government data showed that U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA rose 1 percent to 9.34 million bpd last week after a drop the previous week due to maintenance work and storm shutdowns.  It takes somewhat lower prices to slow down U.S. production,  said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.     Amidst rising U.S. production, the market largely ignored a 6.3 million-barrel slump in U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI last week to 502.9 million barrels, the lowest since January.           U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said it expected WTI prices to remain below $50 until mid-2018, adding that   if output cuts from the OPEC are not enough, U.S. shale production will need to slow down for a chance of a balanced market in 2018.  Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to July 3, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. The increase came after hedge funds and other money managers cut U.S. crude net longs to a nine-month low in the previous week.

The four - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain - said in a joint statement late on Thursday that Doha's refusal to accept their demands to end the diplomatic standoff was proof of its links to terrorist groups.   In their statement, the four said the initial list of 13 demands they had put to Qatar was now void and they pledged further political, economic and legal steps against the emirate. In its first reaction to the statement from the four, Qatar dismissed as  baseless  the renewed accusations that it was interfering in the affairs of other states and financing terrorism.  The State of Qatar's position on terrorism is consistent and known for its rejection and condemnation of all forms of terrorism, whatever the causes and motives,  the state news agency said, quoting a senior foreign ministry source. Qatar was ready to  cooperate and review all claims that do not contradict the sovereignty of the State of Qatar,  it added. Britain's foreign minister, Boris Johnson, meanwhile arrived in Saudi Arabia and was to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in a bid to ease tension in what has become the Gulf's deepest rift in years. Johnson will also travel to Qatar and Kuwait for talks with senior figures from both countries, Britain's foreign office said in a statement in London. It did not give a specific date. It said Johnson would urge all parties to support Kuwait's mediation efforts and  work towards de-escalation and Gulf unity for the sake of regional stability.   U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will travel to Kuwait on Monday on a similar mission. The four Arab states have cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, which they also accuse of allying with their regional arch-foe Iran. Doha denies that accusation too. Their original 13 demands presented to Qatar included shutting down the pan-Arab al-Jazeera TV channel and closing a Turkish military base in Doha. Qatari officials have repeatedly said the 13 demands are so strict that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead aimed at hobbling Doha's sovereignty. At the same time, they say Qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to 'any legitimate issues' of concern to fellow member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In their statement, the four Arab states said any additional measures would be aimed at the Qatari government and not its people. It did not say when the new steps would be announced or what they would entail. Foreign ministers from the four states convened in Cairo on Wednesday after the expiry of a 10-day deadline for their demands to be met. They condemned the tiny Gulf nation's response as  negative  and lacking in content.

A month of sanctions imposed on Qatar by Egypt and Arab neighbors that have cut ties and accused Doha of supporting militants has galvanized patriotic feelings among Qataris, who number 300,000, as well as fear about the possibility of military escalation. While Doha denies the charges and there are no signs the standoff will spiral into military confrontation, the crisis has bolstered nationalist support for the 37-year-old ruler of the world's wealthiest country per capita.  We will go to the streets and fight for him [Sheikh Tamim],  said Ahmed al-Kuwari, a 32-year-old engineer.  Local media say that hundreds of men are signing up for the military, as others deliver jibes at Arab rulers on social media and rail against  fake news  they say some Arab media outlets are spreading to divide them. After an announcement on Wednesday by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates that their boycott of the tiny Gulf Arab state would continue, playful Qataris shared on Twitter photoshopped images ridiculing officials from those countries.

The al-Thani tribal rulers of Qatar, a small peninsular country protruding into the Gulf with a population of 2.7 million, most of them foreign workers, have been rattled in the last few decades by internal palace coups or threatened intervention by Saudi Arabia.  But the discovery of vast liquefied natural gas reserves in the 1970s that crowned Doha with skyscrapers and ushered in cradle-to-grave welfare has brought stability and lured in foreign investors. For older Qataris who knew leaner years and witnessed wars in the Gulf including Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the feud is more troubling.  During the Kuwait invasion my relatives barricaded their windows and stayed inside. They are scared of that happening again,  said Haya, the Doha student. Others fear enmity between Gulf states could linger on.

Oil prices tumbled after a report showed U.S. crude production rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high, casting doubt on efforts to curb persistent oversupply. [O/R] U.S. Treasury debt yields and the dollar rose as investors analyzed how the mix of strong jobs and weak wage growth would influence the Fed's plans for an interest rate hike or balance-sheet reduction.  There is certainly no reason given the data we saw this morning to knock the Fed off the track of probably one more raise this year and maybe an announcement in September about reducing the bond purchase,  said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Omaha, Nebraska. Wall Street's S&P; 500 stock index .SPX closed higher after a selloff on Thursday as investors, while reassured by the strong jobs number, bet weak wage growth would limit the extent of Fed hawkishness.  The fears of rates rising too quickly have dissipated and market participants are looking for bargains,  said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York.   Maybe there was just enough bad news in a great jobs number to keep the Fed off the gas pedal,  he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 94.3 points, or 0.44 percent, to 21,414.34, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 15.43 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,425.18 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 63.62 points, or 1.04 percent, to 6,153.08. The U.S. dollar was up 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies .DXY. The greenback hit two-month highs against the yen JPY= and was on pace to post its biggest weekly percentage gain against Japan's currency since late April after the jobs data.            On balance, the labor market continues to be solid and despite the softer inflation data as of late, the solid employment data should keep the Fed on course for policy normalization,  said Charlie Ripley, investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis.  In Treasuries, longer dated yields briefly hit multi-week highs. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were last down 5/32 in price to yield 2.3874 percent, from 2.369 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.9289 percent, from 2.904 percent late on Thursday.  Bets that some of the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding ultra-loose monetary policies affected stocks this week as European Central Bank minutes showed policymakers are open to tightening. In Europe, German government bond yields had risen to 18-month highs, weighing on stocks there. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.12 percent but MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.19 percent.

Bryant Evans,John Praveen,Kim Forrest,Peter Tuz,NASDAQ Composite,US,USA,STOCKS,WEEKAHEAD,Performance / Results / Earnings,Major News,Graphics,Equities Markets,Market Reports,Reports,Corporate Events,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Technology shares surrendered their leadership in the U.S. stock market over the past month, but the fast-growing group may soon resume its outperformance and maneuver back into pole position. Upcoming earnings reports for the technology sector .SPLRCT, whose profits are expected to outpace the overall S&P; 500 .SPX for the 11th consecutive quarter, could lure back investors who have been concerned about expensive valuations and that too many people may have piled into the big names. The sector has slumped 4 percent since the first week of June, while financials .SPSY have climbed more than 5 percent and healthcare .SPXHC has gained 3 percent. This has prompted speculation that investors may have been cashing out their tech profits to move into those groups.  Technology has taken a rest, but it’s going to heat up again, and I see tech returning to favor the second half of the year,  said portfolio manager J. Bryant Evans of Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois. For the first five months of 2017, tech was the talk of the stock market, far outperforming the other 10 major S&P; 500 sectors and sparking the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC to its strongest first half since 2009.  I think of (tech's recent swoon) as profit-taking rather than driven by change in the fundamental factors,  said John Praveen, managing director of Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey.  The fundamentals are still positive for the sector.  On Friday, the tech sector ended a volatile week by rising 1.3 percent, topping all other sectors and a 0.6 percent rise for the S&P; 500. Analysts estimate tech's second-quarter earnings rose 11.2 percent, with semiconductor companies accounting for much of the gain, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The increase tops the estimated 7.9 percent rise for the overall S&P; 500 and is well above every sector except for energy .SPNY, whose performance will be skewed because of negative year-earlier results.  The tech sector has the highest growth expectations and only moderate uncertainty,  Morgan Stanley equity strategists said in a research note. Given tech's outsized position - 22 percent of the market value of the S&P; 500 - the sector's growth is critical to overall U.S. corporate profit gains.  For the second quarter, tech profit growth alone is expected to account for nearly 28 percent of the S&P; 500's overall increase in earnings, or nearly half if energy were excluded.  In an economy that still seems to have some growing pains, consistent growth is worth paying up for,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Tech's second-quarter revenue growth is projected at 7.2 percent, faster than 4.6 percent for S&P; 500 companies overall, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. There is  growth on the top line, which is more important at this point in the cycle, than in the bottom line only,  said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. This earnings season, she will focus on companies' comments about sales activity. Valuations for the sector also may not be so expensive. Tech is trading at 18.1 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, just above 17.8 times for the overall market. That difference is even smaller when compared with the premium tech has held over the past 15 years, following the dot-com bubble. Over that time, its average P/E has been 17.2 times versus 14.7 times for the S&P; 500. Another factor in tech's favor: The dollar's .DXY 6.1 percent decline this year against a basket of major currencies. S&P; 500 tech companies generate 60 percent of revenue from outside the United States, compared with 40 percent for companies in the entire index. A stronger dollar makes foreign sales less valuable when they are translated back into the U.S. currency for reporting purposes. Despite these positive factors, other sectors may end up besting tech. Healthcare's year-to-date performance has nearly kept pace, and a resolution of the legislation moving through Congress could draw investors who have been wary about political uncertainty hovering over the sector. A pickup in the economy and inflation could favor groups like industrials .SPLRCI, energy and financials, which tend to perform better in such times. Clues will come starting on July 14, when a big batch of bank reports kicks off the heart of the earnings season. In tech, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) report the following week, while Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) are among the companies that will follow later in the month.

Oil prices tumbled after a report showed U.S. crude production rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high, casting doubt on efforts to curb persistent oversupply. [O/R] U.S. Treasury debt yields and the dollar rose as investors analyzed how the mix of strong jobs and weak wage growth would influence the Fed's plans for an interest rate hike or balance-sheet reduction.  There is certainly no reason given the data we saw this morning to knock the Fed off the track of probably one more raise this year and maybe an announcement in September about reducing the bond purchase,  said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Omaha, Nebraska. Wall Street's S&P; 500 stock index .SPX closed higher after a selloff on Thursday as investors, while reassured by the strong jobs number, bet weak wage growth would limit the extent of Fed hawkishness.  The fears of rates rising too quickly have dissipated and market participants are looking for bargains,  said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York.   Maybe there was just enough bad news in a great jobs number to keep the Fed off the gas pedal,  he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 94.3 points, or 0.44 percent, to 21,414.34, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 15.43 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,425.18 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 63.62 points, or 1.04 percent, to 6,153.08. The U.S. dollar was up 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies .DXY. The greenback hit two-month highs against the yen JPY= and was on pace to post its biggest weekly percentage gain against Japan's currency since late April after the jobs data.            On balance, the labor market continues to be solid and despite the softer inflation data as of late, the solid employment data should keep the Fed on course for policy normalization,  said Charlie Ripley, investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis.  In Treasuries, longer dated yields briefly hit multi-week highs. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were last down 5/32 in price to yield 2.3874 percent, from 2.369 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.9289 percent, from 2.904 percent late on Thursday.  Bets that some of the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding ultra-loose monetary policies affected stocks this week as European Central Bank minutes showed policymakers are open to tightening. In Europe, German government bond yields had risen to 18-month highs, weighing on stocks there. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.12 percent but MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.19 percent. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 2.61 percent to $44.33 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $46.82, down 2.68 percent.

The Team Sky rider leads team mate and fellow Briton Geraint Thomas by 12 seconds with Fabio Aru, who made quite an impression when he prevailed in the first summit finish on Wednesday, in third place 14 seconds off the pace. But the first big rendezvous between the top guns is expected on Sunday, when the peloton goes up the Col de la Biche (10.5km at an average gradient of 9 percent), the Col du Grand Colombier (8.5km at 9.9 percent) and the Mont du Chat (8.7km at 10.3 percent) before a dangerous descent into Chambery.  It is going be an important block these next two days but Sunday's stage will be very decisive with a lot of climbing and we will see a lot of damage,  said Froome, who won the Tour in 2013, 2015 and 2016. Froome and all of his rivals -- with the notable exception of Nairo Quintana -- got a feel of the stage during last month's Criterium du Dauphine when the race went up and down the Mont du Chat.  If anything it was more of getting a feel of the climb to the Mont du Chat and the descent,  said Froome.  I'm certainly grateful that I have seen the climb. I know what I'm up against. But it is going to be much tougher than on the Dauphine because of the climbs that come before.

He's very close in the GC (general classification), I will need to pay attention to him. (Last year's runner-up Romain) Bardet knows the Mont du Chat descent very well, too,  he said. France's Bardet knows the area as his team is based near Chambery but Froome is confident his team can control the stage.  Thankfully we haven't had to do a lot of riding in the front because the sprinters' teams controlled several stages and BMC took it on in the only mountain stage,  he said, referring to Australian Richie Porte's team.  Relatively speaking the (Team Sky) guys are still fresh, that's a blessing for us.  Aru will not be the only man to watch, though.  Certainly Fabio Aru is threatening and looking at the GC he is my closest rival but at this point I would not say he is any more of a threat than Richie,  Froome said.  It's still very close in the top 10 but this weekend we will see where everyone is at.

Farmers, ranchers and residents in the Amazonian state of Para blocked the rugged BR-163 jungle road near the town of Novo Progresso.  The BR-163 road is completely blocked. There is already a large line of trucks backed up there,  Vanderlei Ataídes, head of the Para State's association of soy and corn producers, said by telephone.  The road is used to transport soy and corn from center-west Brazil to northern exporting ports. Top grains producer Mato Grosso State is at the peak of winter corn harvesting. Abiove, a Brazilian association representing commodities merchants and processors, said on Friday the blockage reduced the amount of grains flowing to northern ports to 25 percent of the normal volume. The protest turned violent late Thursday when a group set fire to semi-truck carrying eight new pickups to be used by government environmental agents to patrol the forest. Police were investigating the incident. The protesters are angered over a recent veto by President Michel Temer of a congressional bill that would have reduced the size of the Jamanxim National Forest. That bill would have opened up more land to farmers and ranchers. Temer's veto bill last month followed protests from environmental organizations who opposed the bill that would have reduced the protected reserve by over 480,000 hectares (1.18 million acres).

Canada's economy added 45,300 jobs last month, topping the  10,000 gain forecast by economists.                       It is a pretty solid report ... if you were leaning toward a hike in July this would do nothing to dissuade you,  said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.         Expectations of a rate increase have been rising since top Bank of Canada officials said in June that a pair of 2015 interest rate cuts had done their job in cushioning the economy from collapsing oil prices.                  Chances of a hike at next week's rate meeting rose to 93 percent from 86 percent before the jobs report, data from the overnight index swaps market showed. The market has fully priced in an increase by September and has implied an 80 percent chance of a second hike by December.                Strengthening of the domestic economy can convince investors that the central bank will not just raise rates next week but continue to raise them, said Brad Schruder, director of corporate sales and structuring at BMO Capital Markets.      That's why you are seeing the Canadian dollar outperform in the way it has.      At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2885 to the greenback, or 77.61 U.S. cents, up 0.7 percent.     The currency touched its strongest since Sept. 8 at C$1.2860, while it rose 0.6 percent for the week.     The loonie strengthened even as prices of oil       , one of Canada's major exports, fell 2.8 percent and the U.S. dollar        climbed.                  The greenback rose against a basket of major currencies after a report showed the U.S. economy also created more jobs than expected in June.                  Speculators cut bearish bets on the loonie for a sixth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 39,372 contracts as of July 3 from 49,495 a week earlier.     Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper yield curve. The 10-year             declined 43 Canadian cents to yield 1.884 percent.     The yield reached its highest intraday since June 2015 at 1.894 percent, while the gap between it and the U.S. equivalent narrowed by 3.3 basis points to -50.2 basis points.

Upcoming earnings reports for the technology sector .SPLRCT, whose profits are expected to outpace the overall S&P; 500 .SPX for the 11th consecutive quarter, could lure back investors who have been concerned about expensive valuations and that too many people may have piled into the big names. The sector has slumped 4 percent since the first week of June, while financials .SPSY have climbed more than 5 percent and healthcare .SPXHC has gained 3 percent. This has prompted speculation that investors may have been cashing out their tech profits to move into those groups.  Technology has taken a rest, but it’s going to heat up again, and I see tech returning to favor the second half of the year,  said portfolio manager J. Bryant Evans of Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois. For the first five months of 2017, tech was the talk of the stock market, far outperforming the other 10 major S&P; 500 sectors and sparking the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC to its strongest first half since 2009.  I think of (tech's recent swoon) as profit-taking rather than driven by change in the fundamental factors,  said John Praveen, managing director of Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey.  The fundamentals are still positive for the sector.  On Friday, the tech sector ended a volatile week by rising 1.3 percent, topping all other sectors and a 0.6 percent rise for the S&P; 500. Analysts estimate tech's second-quarter earnings rose 11.2 percent, with semiconductor companies accounting for much of the gain, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The increase tops the estimated 7.9 percent rise for the overall S&P; 500 and is well above every sector except for energy .SPNY, whose performance will be skewed because of negative year-earlier results.  The tech sector has the highest growth expectations and only moderate uncertainty,  Morgan Stanley equity strategists said in a research note. Given tech's outsized position - 22 percent of the market value of the S&P; 500 - the sector's growth is critical to overall U.S. corporate profit gains.  For the second quarter, tech profit growth alone is expected to account for nearly 28 percent of the S&P; 500's overall increase in earnings, or nearly half if energy were excluded.  In an economy that still seems to have some growing pains, consistent growth is worth paying up for,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Tech's second-quarter revenue growth is projected at 7.2 percent, faster than 4.6 percent for S&P; 500 companies overall, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. There is  growth on the top line, which is more important at this point in the cycle, than in the bottom line only,  said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. This earnings season, she will focus on companies' comments about sales activity. Valuations for the sector also may not be so expensive. Tech is trading at 18.1 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, just above 17.8 times for the overall market. That difference is even smaller when compared with the premium tech has held over the past 15 years, following the dot-com bubble. Over that time, its average P/E has been 17.2 times versus 14.7 times for the S&P; 500. Another factor in tech's favor: The dollar's .DXY 6.1 percent decline this year against a basket of major currencies. S&P; 500 tech companies generate 60 percent of revenue from outside the United States, compared with 40 percent for companies in the entire index. A stronger dollar makes foreign sales less valuable when they are translated back into the U.S. currency for reporting purposes. Despite these positive factors, other sectors may end up besting tech. Healthcare's year-to-date performance has nearly kept pace, and a resolution of the legislation moving through Congress could draw investors who have been wary about political uncertainty hovering over the sector. A pickup in the economy and inflation could favor groups like industrials .SPLRCI, energy and financials, which tend to perform better in such times. Clues will come starting on July 14, when a big batch of bank reports kicks off the heart of the earnings season. In tech, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) report the following week, while Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) are among the companies that will follow later in the month.

News of the attacks surfaced a week ago when Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a June 28 alert to industrial firms, warning them of hacking targeting the nuclear, power and critical infrastructure sectors.  DOE is working with our government and industry partners to mitigate any impact from a cyber intrusion affecting entities in the energy sector,  a Department of Energy representative said in an email to Reuters.  At this time, there has been no impact to systems controlling U.S. energy infrastructure. Any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks.  It was not clear who was responsible for the hacks. The joint report by the DHS and the FBI did not identify the attackers, though it described the hacks as  an advanced persistent threat,  a term that U.S. officials typically but not always use to describe attacks by culprits. The DOE discussed its response to the attacks after Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas was among at least a dozen U.S. power firms breached in the attack, citing current and former U.S. officials who were not named. A representative with the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp declined to say if the plant was hacked, but said it continued to operate safely.  There has been absolutely no operational impact to Wolf Creek. The reason that is true is because the operational computer systems are completely separate from the corporate network,  company spokeswoman Jenny Hageman said via email. A separate Homeland Security technical bulletin issued on June 28 included details of code used in a hacking tool that suggest the hackers sought to use the password of a Wolf Creek employee to access the network. Hageman declined to say if hackers had gained access to that employee's account. The employee could not be reached for comment. The June 28 alert said that hackers have been observed using tainted emails to harvest credentials to gain access to networks of their targets.  Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,  the report said. David Lochbaum, a nuclear expert at the nonprofit group Union of Concerned Scientists, said reactors have a certain amount of immunity from cyber attacks because their operation systems are separate from digital business networks. But over time it would not be impossible for hackers to potentially do harm.  Perhaps the biggest vulnerability nuclear plants face from hackers would be their getting information on plant designs and work schedules with which to conduct a physical attack,  Lochbaum said. The DOE said it has shared information about this incident with industry, including technical details on the attack and mitigation suggestions.  Security professionals from government and industry are working closely to share information so energy system operators can defend their systems,  the agency representative said. Earlier, the FBI and DHS issued a joint statement saying  There is no indication of a threat to public safety  because the impact appears limited to administrative and business networks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not received any notifications of a cyber event that has affected critical systems at a nuclear plant, said spokesman Scott Burnell. A nuclear industry spokesman told Reuters last Saturday that hackers have never gained access to a nuclear plant.

Speculators in four major New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) markets added to their bullish bets by 10,205 contracts to 282,521 in the week to July 3, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday. That is the highest speculative net longs since early June. It compares with a five-year (2012-2016) average speculative net long position of around 127,300. The biggest net long position was 456,475 in April 2013, while the biggest net short position was 166,165 in November 2015, according to Reuters data. Gas futures on the NYMEX averaged $3.02 per million British thermal units during the four trading days ended July 3 versus $2.96 during the five trading days ended June 27. Over the summer, analysts forecast utilities will add just 1.6 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas into storage during the April-October injection season, much less than the 2.1 tcf seen on average over the past five years.  If correct, that would leave stockpiles at the end of October at just 3.7 tcf versus a record high of 4.0 tcf on Oct. 31 last year and a five-year average (2012-2016) of 3.9 tcf. [NGAS/POLL] The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in June forecast pipeline and liquefied natural gas exports would rise from an average of 6.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2016 to 8.7 bcfd in 2017 and 10 bcfd in 2018. That puts the United States on track to transition from a net importer of gas to a net exporter of the fuel on an annual basis in 2017. The United States was last a net exporter of gas on an annual basis in 1957. U.S. gas output averaged 71.5 bcfd during the past 30 days, topping the 70.8 bcfd produced during the same period in 2016. That, however, falls well short of the 73.4 bcfd during the same time in 2015, when production was at a record high, according to Reuters data.

The drop in bullish bets followed perceived hawkish rhetoric from foreign central banks as they signaled they might consider reducing monetary stimulus later this year if their economies improve further.     Global bond yields including those in the United States climbed for a second straight week.     Upbeat U.S. data including a payrolls report that showed a stronger-than-forecast rise in hiring in June spurred further selling in Treasuries this week. The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield hit an eight-week high at 2.398 percent on Friday, Reuters data showed.     The amount of speculators' bullish, or long, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bearish, or short, positions by 262,962 contracts on July 3, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data.     A week earlier, speculators held 302,098 net long positions in 10-year T-note futures.     Among major investors, asset managers reduced their net longs in 10-year T-notes by 58,636 contracts to 139,344 on Monday, while bond dealers pared their 10-year T-note net shorts by 29,866 to 78,616, the latest CFTC data showed.

Professors Jennifer Glass, Lisa Moore and Mia Carter had argued in a federal district court in Austin that academic freedom and classroom debate could be chilled under the so-called  campus carry  law backed by the state's Republican political leaders. The law allows concealed handgun license holders aged 21 and older to bring handguns into classrooms and other university facilities, including the University of Texas system, one of the nation's largest with more than 221,000 students.  Plaintiffs present no concrete evidence to substantiate their fear,  U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel wrote in his decision dismissing the professors' complaint. Defendants included Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, University President Gregory Fenves and the university's Board of Regents. Paxton, who backed the law, praised the decision.  The fact that a small group of professors dislike a law and speculate about a ‘chilling effect’ is hardly a valid basis to set the law aside,  he said in a statement. University of Texas professors had lobbied unsuccessfully to prevent the law, arguing the combination of youth, firearms and college life could make for a deadly situation. Fenves reluctantly allowed campus carry, saying last year he was compelled to do so under state law. Republican lawmakers said campus carry could help prevent a mass shooting. A lawyer for the professors said the ruling was narrow and did not address the plaintiffs' constitutional concerns.  The order accompanying the dismissal doesn’t reach the merits of either the professors’ substantive First Amendment claims or any aspect of their Second Amendment and Equal Protection claims,  attorney Renea Hicks said in an email. As of the start of May, 10 states had provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public college campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state laws.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/texas-guns-idUSL1N1JY1MS"},

Imagination Chief Executive Officer Andrew Heath said Apple told Imagination  at the end of March  that it would no longer need its technology, according to an investor call on Tuesday. But Apple said it told Imagination about its plans on Feb. 9. Imagination ultimately notified shareholders of Apple's decision on April 3, which sent its shares down 70 percent and eventually forced it to put itself up for sale. Apple's claims that Imagination sat on the news for weeks without telling shareholders heaps more trouble on the company and could spur regulators to examine whether Imagination improperly withheld information from shareholders, according to one legal expert.  Imagination's Heath told investors that Apple told Imagination at the end of March that Apple's new products  at some point in 2018 or early 2019 would not contain our IP and therefore, they were not required to pay us royalties on it.  Apple contested that timeline and said it warned Imagination that it would  stop accepting new IP from them  as early as 2015 and gave a final warning a month before Imagination's CEO claims.  After lengthy discussions, we advised them on February 9 that we expected to wind down our licensing agreement since we need unique and differentiating IP for our products,  Apple said in the statement.  Imagination did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal UK business hours. Heath has said he does not believe Apple can replace Imagination's technology without using some of Imagination's patents that would require royalties. Jonathan Parry, an attorney with UK law firm White & Case who is not involved in the dispute, said European financial regulators were likely to examine the timing of Apple's discussions with Imagination to see whether Imagination's leaders failed to disclose material information to shareholders. Regulators would likely focus on when Imagination's leaders decided it was  likely  that Apple would draw down its business with the company, which Imagination would then be required to disclose to shareholders. The legal bar for  likely  is different from the word's common usage, he said.  The wording used in judgments is 'a realistic prospect' that something might happen,  Parry said.  The judge did not assign a percentage, but he made it clear that something doesn't have to be 'more likely than not'  to trigger public disclosure requirements.

Professors Jennifer Glass, Lisa Moore and Mia Carter had argued in a federal district court in Austin that academic freedom and classroom debate could be chilled under the so-called  campus carry  law backed by the state's Republican political leaders.  The law allows concealed handgun license holders aged 21 and older to bring handguns into classrooms and other university facilities, including the University of Texas system, one of the nation's largest with more than 221,000 students.  Plaintiffs present no concrete evidence to substantiate their fear,  U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel wrote in his decision dismissing the professors' complaint. Defendants included Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, University President Gregory Fenves and the university's Board of Regents. Paxton, who backed the law, praised the decision.  The fact that a small group of professors dislike a law and speculate about a ‘chilling effect’ is hardly a valid basis to set the law aside,  he said in a statement.   University of Texas professors had lobbied unsuccessfully to prevent the law, arguing the combination of youth, firearms and college life could make for a deadly situation. Fenves reluctantly allowed campus carry, saying last year he was compelled to do so under state law. Republican lawmakers said campus carry could help prevent a mass shooting. A lawyer for the professors said the ruling was narrow and did not address the plaintiffs' constitutional concerns.  The order accompanying the dismissal doesn’t reach the merits of either the professors’ substantive First Amendment claims or any aspect of their Second Amendment and Equal Protection claims,  attorney Renea Hicks said in an email. As of the start of May, 10 states had provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public college campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state laws.

The world number four had opened with a 72 on Thursday. His  halfway total of one over par was well short of the cut, on a day when first-round leaders Benjamin Hebert from France and American Daniel Im stayed ahead of the field. Each posted a 67 to end on 13 under par.  Spain's Jon Rahm also shot 67 to stay one shot behind, on 12 under. A cluster of others, including Japan's Hideto Matsuyama, remain in touch with the leaders. For McIlroy, it was another disappointing tournament to add to many more in an injury-affected season.  I felt like I was battling well, two under through 13 and with another par five coming up, and to bogey the sixth took the wind out of my sails,   said the Ulsterman, who showed his frustration by slamming his driver to the ground after a poor drive at the 16th.  My short game, in general, it's just silly mistakes,  he said.  I'm just not being very efficient with my scoring and that's why I'm making it difficult for myself. Just need to tidy up the short game a little bit; I feel like the long game is there.  McIlroy will compete in next week's Scottish Open before heading down to Royal Birkdale for the British Open.  Obviously, I might have a few commitments here this weekend, but I need to practice,  he said.  I need to get sharp and get ready for next week and ultimately for The Open in a couple week's time.

Under terms of a bid originally submitted on Monday, Brookfield would buy out the stake that Light SA (LIGT3.SA) has in Renova at an equivalent of 9 reais per unit. The same offer was extended to stakeholder Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA (CMIG4.SA) and founding partner RR Participações SA, the people said. Canada's Brookfield, which has made a number of high-profile infrastructure and energy acquisitions in Brazil over the past year, would pay Renova's controlling bloc about 810 million reais ($247 million) for their stakes and pump about 800 million reais worth of fresh capital into the company, the same person said. Belo Horizonte, Brazil-based Cemig and Light declined to comment, while calls to a Brookfield spokesman in São Paulo were not immediately answered. Representatives of RR could not be immediately reached for comment. Renova units (RNEW11.SA), the company's most widely traded class of stock, reversed losses on the news, adding up to 2.7 percent to 7.88 reais late Friday afternoon. The stock has gained almost 30 percent since January 2 when Reuters first reported that the company could be taken over.  Newfound interest in Renova underscores a view among foreign investors that the outlook for Brazil's renewable power industry remains resilient even as consumption suffers with the country's worst recession ever. For Cemig, exiting Renova allows Brazil's No. 3 power utility to accelerate efforts to refinance almost 5 billion reais of debt maturing this year. Final Accord Board members at the utility known as Cemig, which has a 44 percent voting stake in Renova, will formalize their support to the improved Brookfield bid on Wednesday, one of the people said. An accord between Cemig, Light, RR and Brookfield could be signed as early as July 14, the same person added. Buying out the entire controlling bloc would give Brookfield an 82.2 percent voting stake in Renova. One of the people said Brookfield's sweetened bid should trump a proposal by Oaktree Capital Management LP to refinance debt and inject fresh capital into Renova, which Reuters reported on July 5. At 9 reais, Brookfield would be paying a 28 percent premium per unit of Renova (RNEW11.SA), based on their June 30 close - the last business day before Reuters reported the bid. Each Renova unit is comprised of one common and two preferred shares. Brookfield's bid would also give equal treatment to minority shareholders, the people said. The so-called tag along will be based on the proportion of common and preferred shares contained in Renova's units, they added. Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc (SUNEQ.PK) collapsed weeks before the latter filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.

Fitch has also affirmed the Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F3'. The ratings on the senior unsecured outstanding bonds have been affirmed at 'BBB-'. The affirmation reflects the unchanged 'BBB-' Support Rating Floor being applied to Spanish autonomous communities, including CLM. This supports CLM's 'BBB-' rating, which is stronger than the region's intrinsic credit profile. Fitch will monitor the ongoing debate regarding liquidity support from the central government to Spanish regions. KEY RATING DRIVERS Central Government Support The rating floor is based on a number of supporting factors that mitigate a region's liquidity risk, reducing the likelihood of default. These include the absolute priority of debt servicing by law as per article 135 of the Spanish Constitution; access to state liquidity mechanisms such as the Regional Liquidity Fund (FLA) and the Financial Facility Fund, as well as the budgetary stability law, which enforces fiscal discipline on local and regional governments. The region had around EUR10 billion debt from state liquidity mechanisms at end-2016, which represented approximately 70% of its total debt, illustrating strong support from the central government. This includes the FLA, which was established in 2012 by the central government to support Spanish regions facing difficulties in accessing capital markets, and the Supplier's Fund (FFPP), a mechanism that helps regions pay their arrears to suppliers. Debt contracted under these mechanisms is repaid evenly over 10 years. Debt Redemption Backed-Up In Fitch's view, CLM's access to state support will continue to ensure timely debt servicing, as the region faces high redemptions over the next three years, which exceeded 25% of outstanding debt as of end-2016. State liquidity mechanisms in 2017 are expected to distribute at least EUR18.2 billion to support debt amortisation of the Spanish regions that have requested it, although the 2017 state budget has estimated allocations of up to EUR25 billion in support. The Ministry of Finance and Civil Service (MinHap) coordinates with the participating regions to service debt principal and interest, and Fitch does not expect a major change to this scheme over the medium term. However, a potential change in the regional financial system as expected for 2018 may result in a progressive phase-out of the liquidity support mechanism. This is not included under Fitch?s base case scenario. Under Fitch's base case scenario, CLM's funding needs of EUR1.8 billion in 2017 will rely on the FLA, increasing the share of state liquidity support in the region?s total debt to close to 80% at end-2017, from 75% in 2016. However, CLM is willing to diversify its funding sources and to tap capital markets, all within the region's prudential policy limits. Fiscal performance is likely to continue improving so that debt increase will slow, and expected higher operating revenue may result in a stabilisation of the debt-to-current revenue ratio over the medium term to around 265%-270%, after peaking at 273% in 2015. Current Balance Still Negative Negative current balances since 2008 and a high debt burden mean that the standalone credit metrics of CLM are weaker than its ratings indicate. Budgetary performance improved in 2016, mainly driven an additional EUR260 million inflow stemming from higher allocations from the funding system as well as a lower debt burden and, to a lesser extent, minor tax reforms. Overall, the negative current balance narrowed to about 9% in 2016 from 13.58% in 2015. Slight Fiscal Improvement Ahead Fitch expects further improvement in 2017, due to an extra EUR160 million revenue allocation from the financial system and expenditure constraint after the regional government failed to agree its budget for 2017, thus limiting spending to 2016's levels. Nevertheless, CLM is still far from fully rebalancing its budget to allow deleveraging, which Fitch believes will remain the case under the present regional financial system. According to its base case scenario, Fitch expects CLM to post a negative current balance above 5% over the medium term. Regional Economy in Recovery With a GDP of EUR38 billion, CLM has a weaker economic profile than Spain, with a GDP per capita equivalent to 78% of the national average in 2016. Fitch expects nominal GDP to grow around 3% in 2017, slightly below the national rate, and for this trend to continue. The labour market has also improved as unemployment decreased to 23.6% in 2016 (Spain 19.6%), from 26.3% in 2015. Exports saw a record 7.5% yoy growth as of end-October 2016, although the region still suffers from a trade deficit. RATING SENSITIVITIES As CLM's IDRs are supported by the 'BBB-' Support Rating Floor for Spanish autonomous communities, they would likely be downgraded if the floor is removed KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that the state will continue providing support to the Spanish regions over the medium term. Moreover, Fitch will review the rating floor if state support measures are withdrawn or if the central government's ability and willingness to continue providing extraordinary support to the regions weakens. Discussion on the regional financial system is ongoing in Spain, and changes are likely over the medium term. Nevertheless, Fitch believes the revenue of CLM is unlikely to decrease as a result.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent extremist attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. A Honolulu judge on Thursday rejected a request by Hawaii to narrow the government's implementation of the ban, saying the state should directly ask the Supreme Court to clarify its ruling. Instead, Hawaii appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying in a court filing on Friday that the appeals court has the power to narrow the travel ban while it decides how to interpret the Supreme Court's ruling.  Every day that passes is a day when our government is turning away human beings — from newborn children to elderly grandparents...,  Hawaii wrote in its court filing. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Hawaii's request. After the judge's ruling on Thursday, the department had said that it was  confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will again vindicate the president.  Justice Department lawyers have argued that its definition of close family  hews closely  to language found in U.S. immigration law, while Hawaii's attorney general's office said other parts of immigration law include grandparents in that group. The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JY1C7"},

Further, Fitch has affirmed Istanbul's Long Term Local Currency IDR at 'BBB-' and National Long-Term Rating at 'AAA (tur)'. The Outlooks are Stable. The affirmation of the ratings reflects Istanbul's continuing solid operating performance in line with our unchanged base case scenario and expected increase in debt stemming from large capex realisation. Debt servicing would be supported by a healthy operating balance, keeping debt-to-current balance at just below two years. The ratings further take into account the large unhedged FX liabilities of the city and therefore the devaluation risk the city is exposed to. This is partly mitigated by the amortising nature and lengthy maturity of its debt and its predictable non-seasonal monthly cash flows. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fiscal Performance (Strength/ Stable): Fitch projects Istanbul to post strong, albeit declining, operating margins in the high 40s in 2017-2019 (2016: 47%). We expect operating margins to fall on the back of higher operating expenditure ahead of the local elections in 2019. According to 1Q17 interim budgetary results Istanbul had already achieved 27% of the budgeted tax revenue income, including shared tax revenues and transfers received, reflecting continued robust local economic growth. Such tax revenues constitute up to 70% of the city's total income. The city also achieved 13% of its budgeted non-tax revenue, including fees, fines and rental income, due to the seasonality of these items. Total income realisation at end-1Q17 was 22%. Debt (Neutral/ Negative): Debt funding is expected to increase due to significant capex realisation. This is likely to drive debt-to-current balance higher to about two years from a strong one year. In line with our expectations, direct debt-to-current revenue is forecast to increase to about 80% in 2017 from 60% at end-2016. However, the operating balance should remain healthy and support debt-to-current balance at just below two years. Istanbul faces significant foreign exchange risk in times of elevated financial volatility as 98% of its debt at end-2016 was foreign currency-denominated and unhedged, up from 97% in 2015. By currency, euro-denominated loans constitute 91% of the city's foreign-currency debt, with the remainder being US dollar-denominated loans. The weighted maturity of its FX debt was nine years at end-2016, well above Istanbul's expected debt payback (direct debt-to-current balance) ratio of two years. This, together with the city's predictable and non-seasonal monthly cash flows, plus several credit lines with state-owned and commercial banks, mitigates short-term refinancing risk and extends the debt servicing of FX loans. In line with our expectation Istanbul continued to increase intercompany borrowing at zero cost from its water management affiliate ISKI to TRY5.2 billion at end-1Q17, from TRY4billion at end-2016, for which no repayment has been made to date. The city will continue to borrow from its affiliate and increase borrowing to about TRY7 billion at end-2019. We expect this debt will be netted against the transfer of assets that belong to Istanbul and we classify this debt as direct risk. ISKI is one of the most profitable companies of Istanbul and its debt is negligible with debt-to-current revenue below 1%. Contingent liabilities of the city are low, as most of its companies are self-funding. Their debt accounted for 2.4% of city's operating revenue in 2016. Economy (Strength / Stable): Istanbul is Turkey's main economic hub, contributing on average 30.5% of the country's gross value added in 2006-2014 (latest available statistics), with wealth levels far above the country's average. This helps sustain Istanbul's fiscal strength and allows the city to readily access financial markets. Rapid urbanisation and continued immigration flows challenge the city with a continued need for infrastructure investments. In 2016, the population grew 1.7% yoy to 14.8 million. Management (Neutral/ Negative): Istanbul has a track record of disciplined expenditure policy, with spending in 2016 being fully on budget. Nevertheless, significant increases in capex realisation ahead of the local elections will drive debt funding higher, putting pressure on budgetary performance. Also the lack of an explicit strategy regarding the repayment of intercompany loans from ISKI makes the city's contingent liabilities less than transparent. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating of Istanbul is at the sovereign rating level. A reduction of city's debt-to-current revenue below 60% on a sustained basis, coupled with continued financial strength and consistent management policies, could trigger a positive rating action, provided the sovereign rating is also upgraded. A negative rating action on Turkey would be mirrored on Istanbul's ratings. A sharp increase in Istanbul's direct debt-to-current revenue above 100%, driven by a high materialisation rate of capex and local currency devaluation, could also lead to a downgrade of the Long-Term IDRs.

Fitch has also affirmed the Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F2'. The ratings on the senior unsecured outstanding bonds have been affirmed at 'BBB'. The affirmation reflects Madrid's still weak but improved fiscal performance in 2016, high direct debt, but also a strong economy that is supportive of the ratings. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations that the region's fiscal performance will gradually improve and that the regional economy will remain strong, despite an expected moderate rise in direct debt to 180%-183% of current revenue by 2017. KEY RATING DRIVERS Better-than-Expected Budgetary Performance According to Fitch's base case scenario, the region's operating margin will continue to improve to above 2% over the medium term, from 0.65% at end-2016. This is based on expected average operating revenue growth of 2%-4%, stemming from the recovery of the national economy. The regional government approved the 2017 draft budget in March, but this is subject to EUR296 million of additional revenue from the funding system from the initial allocation estimated in the draft budget. Operating expenditure is forecast to increase by a lower 2%-3% in the same period compared with 6.5% in 2016. According to 2016 preliminary accounts, the region achieved a positive operating margin after two consecutive years of negative operating balances (2015: negative 1.1% of current revenue; 2014: negative 3.5%). This was boosted by larger revenue of EUR894 million from the funding system and by interest savings. Madrid posted a smaller-than-expected fiscal deficit equivalent to 10% of total revenue (17% in 2015), excluding new borrowings, due to a significant reduction of financial investments by EUR591 million. Fitch's base case scenario forecasts that the operating balance will be positive over the medium term, after having been negative in four years during the 2010-2015 period. Madrid's current weak fiscal performance is attributed to the current funding system to which the region is a net contributor. This resulted in its funding per capita being 10% below the average of the other 14 regions under the common regime in 2014. Regional Economy in Recovery Madrid has a strong economic profile, with a GDP per capita that was 36.5% above Spain's average in 2016. It is the main political, administrative and economic centre of Spain (BBB+/F2/Stable). Its strong economy is also illustrated by a higher-than-average employment rate of 53.6% in 2016 versus 47.6% nationally. Madrid's economy is recovering as illustrated by a 3.9% GDP growth,  yoy in 2016 to an estimated nominal EUR210.8 billion. It was one of six autonomous communities with faster nominal GDP growth from 2015. Madrid created 10.5% more jobs between December 2013 and December 2016, after having shed 9.4% jobs between December 2008 and December 2013, reflecting the economic recovery under way in the region. High and Rising Direct Debt Madrid's estimated direct debt grew to EUR28.6 billion in 2016 (EUR26.9 billion in 2015), although the improvement in current revenue drove direct-debt-to-current revenue ratio lower to 175.3% (180.1% in 2015). Fitch estimates debt will continue rising in 2017 to EUR29 billion-EUR31 billion, or 180%-183% of current revenue. Debt servicing-to-current revenue also declined in 2016 to 15.9% (26% in 2015) but should increase to 18%-19% in 2017. Overall debt repayments for the next three years will total EUR6.5 billion, or 23% of estimated outstanding direct debt at end-2016. However, this is mitigated by Madrid's strong access to external liquidity. Strong Access to External Liquidity Madrid has strong access to capital markets and banks to fund its annual deficit, even during adverse periods. Consequently, it is one of the few Spanish regional governments rated by Fitch that has not utilised the Regional Liquidity Fund state support mechanism. The central government's introduction of Fondo de Facilidad Financiera (FFF) zero interest rate loans to regional governments that complied with stability goals helped to partly ease Madrid's commercial debt financing in 2015. Nevertheless, Madrid in 2016 funded its annual deficit and debt redemption through capital market debt and bank loans with moderate interest rates averaging 1.54% and a long amortisation period. Madrid's debt redemption and budgetary needs in 2017 will continue to be funded by capital markets and banks. RATING SENSITIVITIES A negative operating balance would automatically result in a negative rating action. Direct debt structurally exceeding 200% of current revenue could also trigger a negative rating action. The ratings could be upgraded if the regional government reports a consistently positive current balance and if direct debt-to-current revenue declines on a sustained basis. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that the state will continue providing support to Spanish autonomous communities over the medium term, in particular, through the liquidity mechanism. Discussion on the regional financial system is ongoing in Spain, and changes are in prospect over the medium term. However, Fitch does not factor such changes into Madrid's IDRs but believes revenue is unlikely to decrease as a result of the reform.

Temer, whose center government's approval rating is languishing in single digits, is clinging to power after being charged with arranging to take millions of dollars in bribes, the first sitting Brazilian president to face such criminal proceedings.  The charge has increased tensions in an already chaotic political scenario in Latin America's biggest country and have led investors to question whether the government will be able to push through a business-friendly agenda of social security and labor reforms.  Key to Temer's survival is whether the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), Brazil's third largest, will stick with his coalition despite deep divisions in its ranks. If it abandons Temer, many smaller parties are expected to follow suit.      PSDB deputy Caio Narcio, who has supported Temer and has cautioned his party against leaving the coalition, said on Friday the president's situation was deteriorating.  Temer's government is being hollowed out. It is encountering weekly defeats,  Narcio said.  Many in the PSDB are wary of backing Temer for too long as the party plans to run its own presidential candidate next year.  Some of its legislators are also keen to distance themselves from Temer to improve their own electoral prospects.  Several lawmakers, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said support was growing for lower house speaker Rodrigo Maia, the first in the line of succession. If the house votes to put Temer on trial in the Supreme Court, Maia would take office for 180 days.  Rodrigo is now seen as a way out of the crisis, when before he was not,  Narcio said. Maia taking power would not slow efforts to pass economic reforms, lawmakers said. It might even help accelerate them as the president would no longer be embroiled in corruption charges. Centre Progressive Party deputy Jerônimo Goergen said Maia called him to say that, although he was not presenting himself as a candidate, he would keep the economic policy unchanged if he were to replace Temer. Temer's press office did not respond to requests for comment. Maia's office could not immediately be reached for comment. General Prosecutor Rodrigo Janot charged Temer last week in a graft scheme involving the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA. Executives said the president took bribes for resolving tax matters and facilitating loans from state-run banks. Janot said Temer made deals under which JBS would have paid him 38 million reais ($11.57 million) over the next nine months. Temer has repeatedly denied the accusation.  Under Brazilian law, two-thirds of the lower house of congress must vote to put a sitting president on trial. Although the vote is expected as soon as next week, it could be delayed to early August after a congressional recess.  Temer is expected by most to survive the lower house vote on the first charge against him.  But Janot piled on pressure last week by saying he will likely charge Temer with racketeering and obstruction of justice in the coming weeks. Brazilian media also reported that two former top aides, including jailed ex-house speaker Eduardo Cunha, are close to signing plea-bargain deals that could provide evidence of wrongdoing by the president. There is a growing consensus among lawmakers and political experts that any votes on new charges would see Temer's support rapidly evaporate. Lucas de Aragao, a political analyst with Arko Advice in Brasilia, told Reuters it was premature to envisage a Maia presidency.

Under terms of a bid originally submitted on Monday, Brookfield would buy out the stake that Light SA (LIGT3.SA) has in Renova at an equivalent of 9 reais per unit. The same offer was extended to stakeholder Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA (CMIG4.SA) and founding partner RR Participações SA, the people said. Canada's Brookfield, which has made a number of high-profile infrastructure and energy acquisitions in Brazil over the past year, would pay Renova's controlling bloc about 810 million reais ($247 million) for their stakes and pump about 800 million reais worth of fresh capital into the company, the same person said. Belo Horizonte, Brazil-based Cemig and Light declined to comment, while calls to a Brookfield spokesman in São Paulo were not immediately answered. Representatives of RR could not be immediately reached for comment. Renova units (RNEW11.SA), the company's most widely traded class of stock, reversed losses on the news, adding up to 2.7 percent to 7.88 reais late Friday afternoon. The stock has gained almost 30 percent since January 2 when Reuters first reported that the company could be taken over.  Newfound interest in Renova underscores a view among foreign investors that the outlook for Brazil's renewable power industry remains resilient even as consumption suffers with the country's worst recession ever. For Cemig, exiting Renova allows Brazil's No. 3 power utility to accelerate efforts to refinance almost 5 billion reais of debt maturing this year. Final Accord Board members at the utility known as Cemig, which has a 44 percent voting stake in Renova, will formalize their support to the improved Brookfield bid on Wednesday, one of the people said. An accord between Cemig, Light, RR and Brookfield could be signed as early as July 14, the same person added. Buying out the entire controlling bloc would give Brookfield an 82.2 percent voting stake in Renova. One of the people said Brookfield's sweetened bid should trump a proposal by Oaktree Capital Management LP to refinance debt and inject fresh capital into Renova, which Reuters reported on July 5. At 9 reais, Brookfield would be paying a 28 percent premium per unit of Renova (RNEW11.SA), based on their June 30 close - the last business day before Reuters reported the bid. Each Renova unit is comprised of one common and two preferred shares. Brookfield's bid would also give equal treatment to minority shareholders, the people said. The so-called tag along will be based on the proportion of common and preferred shares contained in Renova's units, they added. Renova has struggled with a severe cash crunch over the past couple of years. Financing conditions for Renova, which was founded in 2001, worsened significantly when a partnership with SunEdison Inc (SUNEQ.PK) collapsed weeks before the latter filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.

The FTC, which shares the work of antitrust enforcement with the Justice Department and pursues companies accused of deceptive advertising, is currently headed by acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who was named on Jan. 25. Even without a permanent chair and missing key staff, in the past month, the FTC has forced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) to scrap a plan to buy Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), sued to stop daily fantasy sports companies DraftKings and FanDuel from merging and filed a complaint aimed at stopping a North Dakota hospital system from buying clinics. The Trump administration has not named a permanent chair. For the past several weeks, Ohlhausen, a Republican, has been the leading candidate, according to a person familiar with her candidacy. Also under consideration are Joe Simons of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, according to the trade publication MLEX; and Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, according to a source close to the situation. Both Ohlhausen and Simons would be traditional Republican enforcers, meaning that few enforcement decisions would change and the pro-business approach with a slant toward approving big mergers would likely continue. That said, as a commissioner, Ohlhausen dissented on an FTC decision to sue Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) for allegedly using its market power to maintain a monopoly on key semiconductors. Depending on who is named to the agency, this lawsuit could potentially be dropped. Google's critics in Silicon Valley tend to support Reyes, who has little background in antitrust issues, since he and the District of Columbia attorney general wrote a letter in 2016 urging the FTC to consider re-opening a probe of Google (GOOGL.O) that the agency had closed in early 2013. The wide-ranging probe had touched on everything from search bias to Google's practice of scraping third-party content for its sites to the licensing of standard essential patents. Because Ohlhausen is only acting as FTC head, she cannot hire a permanent head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition or fill other key posts.  The chair sets the priorities. It's important to have that person in to set the direction and pursue initiatives,  said Deborah Garza, who served in the Bush administration and is at the law firm Covington and Burling LLP.  Nominations for the FTC will come sometime this summer because potential nominees are in the process of being cleared, according to a White House official, asked about the delay.  The Trump administration has identified who the individuals will be for certain positions,  said the official, who asked not to be identified. Lots of Empty Offices Beyond lacking a permanent chair, the agency is thin at the top. Rather than four commissioners working with Ohlhausen, she has just one, Democrat Terrell McSweeny. This means that Trump may name two Republicans but the third person must be a Democrat or independent since by law no more than three commissioners can be from the same political party.  Leading candidates for the two Republican seats are Bilal Sayyed of the law firm McDermott Will & Emery and Noah Phillips, an aide to Senator John Cornyn, according to the person familiar with the nomination process. For the open Democratic commission seat, Senator Chuck Schumer has backed consumer advocate Rohit Chopra but the White House has also spoken with others, including agriculture expert Lillian Salerno. The agency has plenty of work on its plate including the merger of Linde (LING.DE) and Praxair (PX.N), which would create a $73 billion global industrial gases leader in a highly consolidated market. A second is Canada's Potash Corp's (POT.TO) purchase of Agrium Inc (AGU.TO) in the consolidated fertilizer sector.  The president has his hands full with a lot of different issues. The FTC is a major fill for any administration, and he needs to get to that,  said Carl Hittinger, an antitrust expert with the law firm Baker and Hostetler LLP. Once a commissioner is named to the independent FTC the president has no say in what decisions are made, so commissioners must be chosen carefully, added Hittinger.

The issue ratings on Ireland's senior unsecured bonds have also been affirmed at 'A'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'AAA' and the Short-Term Foreign-Currency and Local-Currency IDRs at 'F1'. The issue ratings on short-term foreign-currency and local-currency debt have been affirmed at 'F1', and the rating of National Asset Management Ltd's (NAMA) guaranteed issuance has also been affirmed at 'F1', in line with the sovereign rating. KEY RATING DRIVERS Ireland's sovereign ratings are supported by strong institutions and a wealthy, flexible economy, with among the highest per capita income in the 'A' category. Moreover, economic growth has outpaced peers in the last three years and the sovereign balance sheet is improving rapidly. These factors are balanced by still elevated levels of public and private sector debt, external vulnerabilities and downside risks, primarily related to external developments such as the potential impact of Brexit and shifts in global policies on corporate taxation. Headline GDP and expenditure national accounts have been distorted since 2015 by the impact of the activities of multinational enterprises (MNEs), with the level of GDP boosted substantially by activities often unrelated to economic activity in Ireland (for example, the relocation of intangible assets by foreign firms and increases in contract manufacturing). This has the effect of flattering various credit indicators such as debt/GDP and GDP per capita. At the same time, the underlying picture is one of robust growth in economic activity, which is expected to persist in the medium term. Real GDP growth in 2016 was 5.2%. While investment and trade data are distorted by MNEs' activities, private consumption rose by 3.0% last year, and labour market dynamics corroborate the picture of strong real activity in the Irish economy. Employment growth averaged almost 3.0% on an annual basis in 2016, with unemployment falling sharply from 8.9% at end-2015, to 6.9% at end-2016, and 6.3% in June this year. Fitch expects real GDP growth to be 3.5% this year, before slowing down to 3.0% next year and in 2019. We expect unemployment to average 6.2% this year, before falling further to 5.6% by 2019. Brexit represents a clear downside risk to Irish economic prospects. In the short term, the depreciation of the pound has had an impact on demand for Irish goods and services, even though this has been mitigated by the boost to real incomes from lower inflation. The main risk to the medium to long-term growth outlook concerns the uncertainty surrounding the trade negotiations between the UK and EU and the future trade relationship between the UK and EU. The UK accounts for around 16% of Irish exports, and there are strong financial and investment links between the two countries. Estimates by the Department of Finance suggest that in case of trade between the UK and EU shifting to WTO rules, the level of output in Ireland would be 4% lower than in the counter-factual of no Brexit over the long run. Another downside risk is related to potential changes in corporate tax policies, especially in the US. Ireland has been a favoured destination of foreign direct investment by MNEs over the past 20 years but there is a risk of smaller flows or reversals if corporate tax incentives were to change radically. At end-2015, the stock of US FDI in Ireland was EUR581 billion, more than 2x GDP. The general government deficit was 0.6% of GDP in 2016, down from 2.0% in 2015. This improvement was driven by a lower spending share (of which 0.4pp accounted for by lower interest payments). We expect a broadly unchanged deficit this year, a decline in the deficit to 0.2% in 2018, and a balanced budget in 2019. General government debt was 75.4% of GDP at end-2016, down from 78.7% in 2015. Our public finance projections would be consistent with the debt to GDP ratio falling to just under 69% by 2019. The government debt ratio is substantially higher than both the 'A' and the 'AA' medians (51% and 39% respectively), despite the improvement in debt dynamics. Importantly, government debt as a share of revenues is also substantially higher than peer medians (275% compared with the 'A' and 'AA' medians of 145% and 167%). Private sector indebtedness remains high. Corporate debt was around 240% of GDP at end-2016, although this estimate is inflated by the activities of MNEs. Household debt as a share of disposable income was 142% at end-2016 (the fourth-highest in the EU). Annual growth in credit to the private sector is still negative, despite strong growth in the real economy, suggesting that the private sector's deleveraging process is continuing. The Banking System Indicator for Irish banks is 'bb', weaker than most peer countries. At 3Q16, non-performing loans (NPLs) were 14.6% of total loans. MNEs' activities have brought about a high degree of volatility in the current account. The current account surplus was 4.7% of GDP in 2016 (down by more than 5% on the previous year). We expect the current account surplus to average 7% of GDP over the next three years. Net external debt (excluding internationally-traded financial service activities) remains higher than peers (an estimate of 56% compared with the 'A' median of -11% in 2016), and the net international investment position is strongly negative (an estimate of -176% of GDP at end-16). Taoiseach Enda Kenny resigned in May and Leo Varadkar, the social protection minister, was elected leader of the governing Fine Gael party and subsequently nominated premier by the Dail, on the basis of a continuation of the coalition between Fine Gael and various independent parliamentarians, aided by a confidence and supply agreement with Fianna Fail. Fitch does not expect a substantial change in policy direction by the new government. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Ireland a score equivalent to a rating of 'AA' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Public Finances: -1 notch, to reflect still high levels of government indebtedness. MNE activities flatter the level of GDP and therefore fiscal and other credit metrics such as the government debt to GDP ratio. Government debt as a share of revenues is much higher than the peer median. - External Finances: -1 notch. The model gives a 2-notch enhancement for reserve currency but a 1-notch uplift is more appropriate for Ireland given the country's recent financial crisis and need of an IMF programme. Stocks of external debt are high. - Structural Factors: -1 notch, to reflect weakness in the banking system for which the average viability rating is two categories below the sovereign rating. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may, individually or collectively, result in positive rating action: -A continued reduction in government indebtedness -Reduction in external vulnerabilities, including evidence that the economy is resilient to Brexit and shifts in international corporate taxation rules The following factors may, individually or collectively, result in negative rating action: -Reversal of the downward trend in government indebtedness -Weaker economic performance, e.g. triggered by external shocks -A substantial deterioration of banks' asset quality KEY ASSUMPTIONS In its debt sensitivity analysis, Fitch assumes on average, over the next 10 years, a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP, real GDP growth of 2.6%, an effective interest rate of 2.4%, and GDP deflator inflation rate of 2.0%. On the basis of these assumptions, the government debt to GDP ratio is expected to fall to 50% by 2026.

The economy added 222,000 jobs last month, Labor Department data showed, exceeding expectations of a 179,000 gain, putting the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates once more this year. However, muted wage growth may give the Fed room to pause if need be.  The fears of rates rising too quickly have dissipated and market participants are looking for bargains in stocks that have sold off recently,  said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York.  Maybe there was just enough bad news in a great jobs number to keep the Fed off the gas pedal.  Perceived chances of a rate hike at the U.S. central bank's December meeting stood at 48.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Policymakers have taken opposing views on inflation after it retreated further below the Fed's 2 percent target in May, creating uncertainty over the future path of rate hikes.

There were growing fears for civilians caught up in fighting, the U.N.'s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. The loss of Pagak in the northeastern Upper Nile region would be a major blow to the cash-strapped rebels, whose leader Riek Machar is being held under house arrest in South Africa.  Pagak has been the main rebel base since 2014. It is located deep in the heartland of the Nuer people, pressed against the Ethiopian border. South Sudan's civil war began in December 2013, when President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy, Machar, a Nuer. Since then, the conflict has displaced a quarter of the 12 million-strong population and plunged parts of the country into famine briefly earlier this year.  The U.N. has said the ethnic violence in the oil-rich nation could set the stage for genocide. Rights groups say soldiers and allied militias have raped, tortured and killed civilians. The rebels have also been accused of major human rights violations.  The government launched an attack towards Pagak for about a week now,  rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told Reuters via Whatsapp message.  Gabriel said  many  civilians lost their lives while others fled to swamps or crossed to Ethiopia. But a military spokesman denied there was any fighting because the government was observing a unilateral ceasefire.   There is nothing like that so far, we had a briefing this morning and there is no fighting at Pagak,  said Colonel Santo Domic Chol.  Pagak is the headquarters of the IO (rebels) where they have their ammunition and everything and of course it is not easy for SPLA (the military) to access such the area unless it had gone for major operations.    The military is known as the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the rebels as the Sudan People's Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO). At least 25 aid workers were evacuated from Pagak on Thursday and Friday, and fighting in the nearby Mathiang area forced thousands of civilians to flee, the U.N.'s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement.  OCHA said the fighting began last week.  Humanitarians are deeply concerned regarding the plight of civilians in areas affected by the clashes,  the statement read. An internationally-backed peace deal between Kiir and Machar collapsed last year. Since then, the government has made steady gains across the Upper Nile region and the rebels have shifted their focus to the country's south and taken control of areas there.

Imagination Chief Executive Officer Andrew Heath said Apple told Imagination  at the end of March  that it would no longer need its technology, according to an investor call on Tuesday. But Apple said it told Imagination about its plans on Feb. 9. Imagination ultimately notified shareholders of Apple's decision on April 3, which sent its shares down 70 percent and eventually forced it to put itself up for sale. Apple's claims that Imagination sat on the news for weeks without telling shareholders heaps more trouble on the company and could spur regulators to examine whether Imagination improperly withheld information from shareholders, according to one legal expert.  Imagination's Heath told investors that Apple told Imagination at the end of March that Apple's new products  at some point in 2018 or early 2019 would not contain our IP and therefore, they were not required to pay us royalties on it.  Apple contested that timeline and said it warned Imagination that it would  stop accepting new IP from them  as early as 2015 and gave a final warning a month before Imagination's CEO claims.  After lengthy discussions, we advised them on February 9 that we expected to wind down our licensing agreement since we need unique and differentiating IP for our products,  Apple said in the statement.  Imagination did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal UK business hours. Heath has said he does not believe Apple can replace Imagination's technology without using some of Imagination's patents that would require royalties. Jonathan Parry, an attorney with UK law firm White & Case who is not involved in the dispute, said European financial regulators were likely to examine the timing of Apple's discussions with Imagination to see whether Imagination's leaders failed to disclose material information to shareholders. Regulators would likely focus on when Imagination's leaders decided it was  likely  that Apple would draw down its business with the company, which Imagination would then be required to disclose to shareholders. The legal bar for  likely  is different from the word's common usage, he said.  The wording used in judgments is 'a realistic prospect' that something might happen,  Parry said.  The judge did not assign a percentage, but he made it clear that something doesn't have to be 'more likely than not'  to trigger public disclosure requirements.

The issue ratings on Poland's senior unsecured foreign and local currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'A-'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'AA-' and the Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR and Local-Currency IDR at 'F2' and 'F1', respectively. KEY RATING DRIVERS Poland's 'A-' ratings reflect its solid macro fundamentals, supported by a sound monetary framework and healthy banking sector. The ratings are constrained by a weak level of GDP per capita relative to the peer median and high net external debt (34% of GDP in 2016 vs. -3% for the 'A' median). Government debt, at 54.4% of GDP at end-2016, is in line with the peer median. Fitch forecasts GDP growth will rise to 3.3% in 2017 from 2.7% in 2016. Household revenues are benefiting from a decline in unemployment (to a historical low of 4.8% in May) and increased transfers under the Family 500plus programme. The ramp up in disbursements of EU funds from 2017 will support investment, and Poland is benefiting from stronger growth in EU trading partners. GDP growth is set to decelerate slightly after 2017, to 3.2% in 2018 and 2019, in part reflecting the expected monetary policy tightening from 2018 and a slowdown in growth in the EU. Potential weaker than expected external demand is the main downside risk to the outlook. Higher than expected recovery in investment is the main upside risk. Monetary policy has remained accommodative in recent years as inflation was well below the central bank's 2.5% target. Inflation has accelerated to 1.5% y/y in May (based on Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices data) from -0.2% on average in 2016. The agency expects it will increase to 2.5% by end-2019 as the rise in domestic demand and lower unemployment translate into upward pressures on wages and prices. Fitch expects that higher inflation will lead to a gradual increase in the policy rate from 2018. Fitch expects the general government deficit will be 2.6% of GDP in 2017, up from 2.4% in 2016. The cost of increased transfers to families (+0.3% of GDP in 2017) and implementation of an earlier retirement age from October 2017 (+0.1% in 2017 and 0.5% in 2018) will largely be offset by a strong increase in revenue, reflecting the stronger economy and improved tax compliance (+30% y/y for VAT collection in the first five months of 2017). From 2018, the agency expects that the fiscal stance will remain accommodative with a deficit at 2.5% of GDP in 2018 and 2019. The agency expects that government debt, at 54.4% in 2016, should remain stable in 2017 and gradually decline thereafter, assuming some fiscal tightening, real GDP growth slightly higher than 3%, a recovery in inflation towards 2.5% and a gradual increase in interest rates. Given the high share of debt in foreign currency (32% of total state treasury debt in April 2017), a key risk to the debt dynamics is currency depreciation. The authorities aim to reduce the share of foreign debt to below 30% of the total by 2020. Tensions with the EU have moderated relative to 2016. The escalation of the  rule of law  procedure, launched by the European Commission in early 2016, seems to have halted in recent months. Potential tensions with the EU and the departure of the UK from the bloc could affect the discussion on the EU budget and the country's allocations for the next EU financial perspective (2021-2027). This would possibly reduce inflows to Poland, the current largest recipient of EU funds, over the medium term. Local elections at end-2018 will be a test for the ruling party, which has led in the polls since its electoral victory in 2015. The next general election is due in 2019. The banking system is well capitalised (17.7% as of end-2016), liquid and profitable. Various policies are under discussion to support CHF mortgage borrowers (18% of total loans to households, 6% of GDP). Fitch believes potential costs for the banks would be limited and manageable. Policies considered include compensation for the exchange rate spread, incentives for voluntary restructurings including higher capital requirements for CHF loans, and relaxing eligibility criteria to an existing fund financed by banks to support distressed borrowers. The current account deficit reduced to 0.2% of GDP in 2016 from 0.6% in 2015, reflecting strong growth in exports and low domestic investment in 2016. The agency expects that the current account deficit will increase from 2017 as domestic demand ramps up. Combined with capital inflows, including continuing grants from the EU, this should remain consistent with a gradual decline in net external debt, to 27% of GDP by 2019 from 34% in 2016. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Poland a score equivalent to a rating of 'A' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - External finances: -1 notch, to reflect the high net external debt relative to the peers. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's assessment that upside and downside risks to the rating are currently balanced. Nonetheless, the following risk factors could, individually or collectively, trigger negative rating action: - Any sign that the relevance of the 3% of GDP EU deficit criteria weakens as a fiscal anchor, or failure to tighten fiscal policy in order to stabilise the debt-GDP ratio in the medium term. - Weaker macro-economic policy framework potentially resulting in deterioration in the investment climate, macro instability and lower GDP growth. The following risk factors could, individually or collectively, trigger positive rating action: - Continued high GDP growth that supports income convergence towards the 'A' category median. - Continued reduction in external debt ratio supported by stronger current account balances and non-debt capital inflows. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes that economies in the eurozone, Poland's main economic partners, will grow 2.0% in 2017, 1.8% in 2018 and 1.4% in 2019 from 1.6% in 2016.

Clijsters, commentating on the match for the BBC, made the observation after spotting some gestures made by Azarenka's coach Michael Joyce during the 3-6 6-1 6-4 victory. An indignant Azarenka laughed sarcastically before declaring:  I honestly don't know what people are talking about, because I'm one of the players who rarely looks at the box. If that was coaching, I guess I missed it.   I just feel that it's sometimes an unfair comment because we see a lot of players -- I'm not going to name who -- having conversations with their boxes,  added the Belarussian who is on a comeback trail after giving birth to her son Leo last December.  So if my coach did something or did not, obviously I missed it, which is too bad.  I mean illegal coaching sounds like he's done something criminal. It's, like, come on.  Watson did not notice anything untoward during the two-hour thriller but both she and Azarenka agreed that the WTA Tour should do away with the policy of allowing on-court coaching on the women's circuit. Jul 7, 2017; London, United Kingdom; Heather Watson (GBR) reacts during her match against Victoria Azarenka (BLR) on day five at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsUnlike the grand slams tournaments or the men's ATP Tour, WTA tournaments allow players to request their coach to come on court during a match for a limited number of times if they feel they need some guidance.   It's weird because we are allowed to have coaching in WTA (events) and not here. I don't really care so much,  said Azarenka, who will next take on Romanian second seed Simona Halep.  Even on the WTA events I rarely call my coach. I still feel you should figure it out yourself.  Watson shared that sentiment.  I actually would prefer that we didn't have the coaching on court rule. I think it's better if we figure it out ourselves, plus the men don't have it. I don't know why we should,  said the 102nd ranked Briton. While she could have done without all the chatter about illegal coaching, Azarenka admitted she is getting rather impatient to hear her son - who is named after her star sign -  speak for the first time.  My son is teething right now, and he's a little bit fussy at the moment. It's a little bit tough,  said Azarenka, who is bidding to become the first mother to win Wimbledon since Australian Evonne Goolagong in 1980.   All those moments, all those stages, I really enjoy. I can't wait to hear him talk for the first time. It still doesn't really register in my mind quite yet, but I'm really looking forward to it.

The Outlooks are Positive. The issue ratings on Iceland's senior unsecured foreign- and local-currency bonds have been upgraded to 'A-' from 'BBB+'. The Country Ceiling has been revised up to 'A-' from 'BBB+'. The Short-Term Local-Currency Rating has been upgraded to 'F1' and the Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR has been affirmed at 'F2'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of Iceland's IDRs reflects the following key rating drivers and their relative weights: MEDIUM The Icelandic economy's external vulnerability has reduced considerably. Strong current account surpluses and capital inflows since 2013 have strengthened external finances. The krona has been strengthening, despite the virtually complete liberalisation of capital controls between October 2016 and March 2017, appreciating by 20.1% yoy against the USD, and 17.3% against the EUR at end-June 2017, allowing for a build-up of FX reserves to 8.8 months of current external payments at end-2016. The current account surplus rose to 7.9% of GDP in 2016 (revised up from our previous estimate of 4.5% of GDP), due to a stronger than expected development in tourism receipts. We expect robust tourism activity to persist in the forecast horizon, supporting a large current account surplus, moderating to 6.5% of GDP by 2019. Net external debt decreased further to 28% of GDP at end-2016, down from 41% of GDP in 2015, and we expect Iceland to have a negative net external debt position by 2018 and in line with the 'A' median. Liberalisation of capital controls has not resulted in strong outflows of capital and downward pressure on the exchange rate, which led to strong inflationary pressures and a sharp deterioration in private sector balance sheets during and after the 2008-2009 crisis. The government has paid down debt at a fast pace, resulting in gross general government debt/GDP falling to 53.4% of GDP at end-2016 from 68.0% at end-2015, and 95.1% at its peak in 2011. Government debt/GDP is forecast to be 47.6% in 2017, lower than the 'A' median of 51.4%, and consistent with the 'BBB' median of 40.7%. Fitch forecasts Iceland's government debt/GDP to fall below the medians to 41.0% by 2019, driven by strong economic growth and in line with the government's strategy in its five-year fiscal policy statement. Robust economic growth has supported the improvements in public indebtedness and external finances. Real GDP growth in 2016 was strong at 7.2% driven by solid growth in tourism, private investment and private consumption. Private investment growth was mainly driven by renewed growth in construction to meet the strong increase in tourism demand, while private consumption was supported by the strong wage increases (11% yoy) in 2016, lower unemployment (3.0% average in 2016), appreciating krona and a rise in house prices. Fitch has revised its growth forecast for 2017 up to 5.6%, but expects growth to moderate to 3.7% by 2019. However, domestic cost pressures resulting from the above-trend growth and wage rises, coupled with the appreciating real exchange rate could lead to overheating and exposes the economy to the risk of a contraction in tourism activity. Iceland's IDRs also reflect the following key rating drivers: Iceland has a very high income per capita, forecast to be USD68,899 in 2017, making it more aligned with the 'AAA' median of USD51,977. The country's performance on the measures of governance, human development and ease of doing business are also consistent with that of the 'AAA' and 'AA' rated countries. The new coalition government consists of the Independence, Reform and Bright Future parties, with a slim majority in parliament of just one seat. It is led by the Independence party, which continues the commitment to debt reduction in the medium-term fiscal plans from the previous government coalition. Fitch forecasts the fiscal surplus to fall to 0.2% of GDP in 2017 from 12.9% in 2016, reflecting extraordinary stability contributions that were made by the old banks' estates in 2016. The new government plans a mild fiscal tightening by raising VAT on tourism-related activities, broadening the scope of the VAT standard rate, while reducing the VAT rate to 22.5% from 24% in the next two years. Along with a higher carbon tax, the measures are expected to raise tax revenues by 0.6% of GDP in 2018 and 0.1% of GDP in 2019. Since October 2016, the authorities took steps to lift capital controls on residents set in place during the crisis. In March 2017, remaining capital controls on residents were lifted. At the same time the central bank invited offers for the purchase of offshore krona assets held in restricted accounts at an exchange rate of 137.5EUR/ISK. The central bank agreed a purchase of ISK 112.4 billion (4.2% of GDP) from March to June 2017, leaving a remaining ISK88 billion (3.3% of GDP) in the stock of offshore krona assets that are restricted from free convertibility into foreign currency. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Iceland a score equivalent to a rating of 'AA-' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale. In accordance with its rating criteria, Fitch's sovereign rating committee decided not to adopt the score indicated by the SRM as the starting point for its analysis because the SRM output has migrated to 'AA-', but in our view this is a temporary improvement due to the impact of the extraordinarily large fiscal surplus in 2016 on the SRM output. The committee has hence used a rating of 'A+' on the Long-Term FC IDR scale as the starting point for its analysis. Assuming an SRM output of 'A+', Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final LT FC IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - External finances: -1 notch, to reflect the fact that the small size of the economy makes it vulnerable to external shocks and balance of payments risks. - Structural: -1 notch, to reflect the recent presence of capital controls on both residents and non-residents. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to an upgrade are: - Resilience of the economy to external shocks, in the context of a more open capital account. - Continued economic growth without excessive macroeconomic imbalances. - Continued falls in the public debt ratio, supported by prudent fiscal policy. The Outlook is Positive. Consequently, Fitch does not currently anticipate developments with a high likelihood of leading to a downgrade. However, future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Evidence of overheating in the domestic economy, for example through wage-price spirals, inflation overshoots, and adverse effects on household and corporate balance sheets. - A weakened commitment to fiscal consolidation in the medium term. - Excessive capital outflows leading to external imbalances and pressures on the exchange rate. KEY ASSUMPTIONS The ratings and Outlooks are subject to the following assumption. In its debt sensitivity analysis, Fitch assumes medium term nominal GDP growth will moderate to an annual average of 4.5%, government primary balance of 2.0% of GDP, and a nominal effective interest rate gradually rising to 7.0% by 2026. Under these assumptions, Fitch projects that government debt as a share of GDP will decline to 27.2% by 2026.

Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. Diplomats said the United States would informally keep Britain and France in the loop, while China was likely talking to Russia. The United States, China, Russia, Britain and France are the Security Council's permanent veto-wielding powers. The United States, Japan and South Korea agreed on Friday to push for a quick Security Council resolution. On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said she would propose new sanctions to the 15-member council in coming days, though Russia has said further sanctions would not resolve the issue. A senior Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, was skeptical that the draft resolution would be put to a vote quickly.   I'm sure it will be weeks, not a week, but I'm also sure it won't be three months. I don't think this administration spends three months doing anything,  said the senior diplomat.   Following a nuclear weapons test by North Korea in September, while U.S. President Barack Obama was still in office, it took the U.N. Security Council three months to agree to strengthened sanctions.   What (the U.S.) are signaling at the moment is they will push it to a veto if that's what it takes. Obviously that is a game of bluff,  the senior diplomat said.  North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear tests and two long-range missile launches.  Haley on Wednesday said some of the options available were restricting the flow of oil to North Korea's military and weapons programs, increasing air and maritime restrictions and imposing targeted sanctions on senior officials.   I don't have the impression that it will go on for months,  said a second Security Council diplomat, adding that the rhetoric from some council members was just negotiating tactics.  I think that politically there is a strong willingness from the council to act.   On Thursday, Russia objected to a Security Council condemnation of North Korea's missile launch because the U.S.-drafted statement labeled it an ICBM, a designation Moscow disagrees with. Diplomats said on Friday that negotiations on the statement had stalled.

Temer, whose center government's approval rating is languishing in single digits, is clinging to power after being charged with arranging to take millions of dollars in bribes, the first sitting Brazilian president to face such criminal proceedings.  The charge has increased tensions in an already chaotic political scenario in Latin America's biggest country and have led investors to question whether the government will be able to push through a business-friendly agenda of social security and labor reforms.  Key to Temer's survival is whether the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), Brazil's third largest, will stick with his coalition despite deep divisions in its ranks. If it abandons Temer, many smaller parties are expected to follow suit.      PSDB deputy Caio Narcio, who has supported Temer and has cautioned his party against leaving the coalition, said on Friday the president's situation was deteriorating.  Temer's government is being hollowed out. It is encountering weekly defeats,  Narcio said.  Many in the PSDB are wary of backing Temer for too long as the party plans to run its own presidential candidate next year.  Some of its legislators are also keen to distance themselves from Temer to improve their own electoral prospects.  Several lawmakers, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said support was growing for lower house speaker Rodrigo Maia, the first in the line of succession. If the house votes to put Temer on trial in the Supreme Court, Maia would take office for 180 days.  Rodrigo is now seen as a way out of the crisis, when before he was not,  Narcio said. Maia taking power would not slow efforts to pass economic reforms, lawmakers said. It might even help accelerate them as the president would no longer be embroiled in corruption charges. Centre Progressive Party deputy Jerônimo Goergen said Maia called him to say that, although he was not presenting himself as a candidate, he would keep the economic policy unchanged if he were to replace Temer. Temer's press office did not respond to requests for comment. Maia's office could not immediately be reached for comment. General Prosecutor Rodrigo Janot charged Temer last week in a graft scheme involving the world's largest meatpacker, JBS SA. Executives said the president took bribes for resolving tax matters and facilitating loans from state-run banks. Janot said Temer made deals under which JBS would have paid him 38 million reais ($11.57 million) over the next nine months. Temer has repeatedly denied the accusation.  Under Brazilian law, two-thirds of the lower house of congress must vote to put a sitting president on trial. Although the vote is expected as soon as next week, it could be delayed to early August after a congressional recess.  Temer is expected by most to survive the lower house vote on the first charge against him.  But Janot piled on pressure last week by saying he will likely charge Temer with racketeering and obstruction of justice in the coming weeks. Brazilian media also reported that two former top aides, including jailed ex-house speaker Eduardo Cunha, are close to signing plea-bargain deals that could provide evidence of wrongdoing by the president. There is a growing consensus among lawmakers and political experts that any votes on new charges would see Temer's support rapidly evaporate. Lucas de Aragao, a political analyst with Arko Advice in Brasilia, told Reuters it was premature to envisage a Maia presidency.  But obviously there is a movement in that direction, it is in the interests of many distinct factions within congress,  Aragao said.

It was by no means easy though for five-times Wimbledon winner Williams to turn that 20 years of experience on the grass at SW19 into a win against the 59th ranked 19-year-old. The 7-6(3) 6-4 result does not truly reflect the powerful attacking and spectacular winners from Osaka, who did enough in this encounter to suggest that longer runs at Wimbledon could be in her future. Indeed, despite her tender age, Osaka, whose mother is Japanese and father Haitian, has reached the third round in each of the Grand Slams. The 19-year-old, who moved to the United States as a young child, has made no secret of being a fan of the Williams sisters, but she was far from over-awed by the occasion or her opponent.  I think I started tennis because of them ... (but) going into the match, I tried not to think of her that much of how I normally do. I tried to think of her as a normal opponent so that I didn't hold her on that high of a pedestal, that would make me too nervous, I think, to play her,  she said. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 7, 2017   Japan’s Naomi Osaka in action during her third round match against USA’s Venus WilliamsStefan WermuthAfter fighting back from 4-1 down in the opening set, Osaka could easily have won it - she was 3-0 up in the tie-break before Venus, showing her characteristic grit and calm, took the next seven points. It was tight in the second until Venus took advantage of some wayward shots from Osaka to grab a break in the seventh and she held firm to secure a place against Croatian Ana Konjuh in the fourth round. Slideshow (4 Images) She played an amazing match today,  said Williams,  She really played a match that was worth - she deserved to win. But these sort of matches are always so close.  The first set I had a break. She played some great tennis. She had some luck and some great tennis. Also the second was just about trying to get a break or two, if possible. I wasn't successful in the two, but one thankfully was enough,  she added. Osaka reacted like a teenage fan when told of Williams' praise, smiling without restraint, but she showed enough maturity to know where she had fallen short.  Game-wise I feel like I'm, like, as good as anyone else. But I just feel like maybe mentality-wise there's certain things to do in certain situations that I'm not that aware of,  she said.

News of the attacks surfaced a week ago when Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a June 28 alert to industrial firms, warning them of hacking targeting the nuclear, power and critical infrastructure sectors.  DOE is working with our government and industry partners to mitigate any impact from a cyber intrusion affecting entities in the energy sector,  a Department of Energy representative said in an email to Reuters.  At this time, there has been no impact to systems controlling U.S. energy infrastructure. Any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks.  It was not clear who was responsible for the hacks. The joint report by the DHS and the FBI did not identify the attackers, though it described the hacks as  an advanced persistent threat,  a term that U.S. officials typically but not always use to describe attacks by culprits. The DOE discussed its response to the attacks after Bloomberg News reported on Friday that the Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas was among at least a dozen U.S. power firms breached in the attack, citing current and former U.S. officials who were not named.  A representative with the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp declined to say if the plant was hacked, but said it continued to operate safely.   There has been absolutely no operational impact to Wolf Creek. The reason that is true is because the operational computer systems are completely separate from the corporate network,  company spokeswoman Jenny Hageman said via email. A separate Homeland Security technical bulletin issued on June 28 included details of code used in a hacking tool that suggest the hackers sought to use the password of a Wolf Creek employee to access the network. Hageman declined to say if hackers had gained access to that employee's account. The employee could not be reached for comment. FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in front of the displayed cyber code in this illustration picture taken on March 1,  2017.Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File PhotoThe June 28 alert said that hackers have been observed using tainted emails to harvest credentials to gain access to networks of their targets.  Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,  the report said. David Lochbaum, a nuclear expert at the nonprofit group Union of Concerned Scientists, said reactors have a certain amount of immunity from cyber attacks because their operation systems are separate from digital business networks. But over time it would not be impossible for hackers to potentially do harm.  Perhaps the biggest vulnerability nuclear plants face from hackers would be their getting information on plant designs and work schedules with which to conduct a physical attack,  Lochbaum said.   The DOE said it has shared information about this incident with industry, including technical details on the attack and mitigation suggestions.   Security professionals from government and industry are working closely to share information so energy system operators can defend their systems,  the agency representative said.  Earlier, the FBI and DHS issued a joint statement saying  There is no indication of a threat to public safety  because the impact appears limited to administrative and business networks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not received any notifications of a cyber event that has affected critical systems at a nuclear plant, said spokesman Scott Burnell.  A nuclear industry spokesman told Reuters last Saturday that hackers have never gained access to a nuclear plant.

Trading was choppy after the U.S. June employment report. Treasury yields initially tumbled, then quickly reversed course. Longer- and medium-dated yields were last higher on the day, while shorter-dated yields were stable to slightly lower but remained high on a historical basis.      Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs, the U.S. Labor Department said, beating economists' expectations for a gain of 179,000. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent, that was because more people were looking for work.     While sluggish wage growth put a wrinkle in the otherwise upbeat report, analysts said it did not alter expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again this year and begin unwinding its balance sheet.      Most yields resumed the uptrend they began last week on anticipation that the Fed would tighten monetary policy roughly in unison with the European Central Bank and Bank of England, whose chiefs made suggestions last week that they were shifting toward less accommodative policy.       (The U.S. bond market) is not massively altering its course based on this report,  said Shyam Rajan, head of U.S. Rates Strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.  I do think strongly that we’ll go back to being driven by Europe.”     Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields hit a more than eight-week high of 2.398 percent and 30-year yields hit a more than six-week high of 2.943 percent.      Yields were also rising in Europe, with 10-year Bund yields  hitting an 18-month high on Friday of 0.58 percent.      U.S. 10-year yields were on track for their steepest two-week increase in nearly four months. U.S. 30-year yields were on course for their biggest two-week rise since just after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.      Analysts said shorter-dated yields were stable to slightly lower due to disappointing aspects of the jobs report.       The initial dip in rates was a function of the small increase in the earnings number and the uptick in the unemployment rate,  said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.

We have not given up hope,  Tillerson told reporters after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on the sidelines of a G20 summit, just days after North Korea conducted what it said was its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Tillerson said the U.S. approach of stepping up pressure on North Korea through sanctions required patience.  I call it the peaceful pressure campaign ... This is a campaign to lead us to a peaceful resolution because if this fails, we don't have very many good options left,  he said.  It's one that requires calculated increases in pressure, allow the regime to respond to that pressure, and it takes a little time to let these things happen.  The United States, Japan and South Korea agreed on Friday to push for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution to apply new sanctions on North Korea. U.N. diplomats said the United States had given China a draft sanctions resolution. But Washington faces an uphill struggle to convince Russia and China to give quick backing to new U.N. sanctions. Experts say North Korea's ICBM launch on Tuesday was a major step forward in its declared intent to create nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States. Some U.S. experts say the missile appeared to have the range to hit Alaska, Hawaii and parts of the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Washington has warned it is ready to use force if need be to stop North Korea's weapons programs but the consequences of that could be catastrophic and it prefers global diplomatic action.

N.Korea sanctions resolution: diplomatsRussia has said further sanctions will not resolve the issue and on Thursday objected to a U.N. Security Council condemnation of North Korea's launch because the U.S.-drafted statement labeled it an ICBM, a designation Moscow disagrees with. Diplomats said on Friday that negotiations on the statement had stalled. Tillerson said Trump and Putin held differing views on how to deal with North Korea but that Washington would continue to press Moscow to help.  We're going to continue those discussions and ask them to do more. Russia does have economic activity with North Korea,  he said.

Trump has warned Beijing it could face U.S. economic and trade pressure unless it does more to rein in North Korea. Tillerson said China's responses to U.S. calls for it step up pressure on North Korea had been uneven.  China has taken significant action and then I think for a lot of different reasons, they’ve paused and didn’t take additional action,  he said. Referring to a U.S. decision last week to impose unilateral sanctions on two Chinese individuals and a shipping firm and to  accuse a Chinese bank of money laundering, he said:  Slideshow (3 Images) We've continued to make that clear to China that we would prefer they take the action themselves and we're still calling upon them to do that.  Tillerson said a Chinese and Russian proposal for the United States and South Korea to suspend joint military exercises in return for a freeze in North Korean weapons testing was unacceptable as it would freeze North Korea's programs at too high a level of capability.  We're asking North Korea to be prepared to come to the table with an understanding that these talks are going to be about how do we help you chart a course to cease and roll back your nuclear program. That's what we want to talk about.   We're not interested in talking about how do we have you stop where you are today.  North Korea on Friday described Tuesday's missile test as a  gift package  and vowed to deliver more.  “The U.S. will receive more ‘gift packages’ of different sizes from the DPRK (North Korea) in endless succession, as it tries harder to destroy, by means of sanctions and pressure, the overall national power and strategic position of the DPRK which have been drastically boosted,” the official KCNA news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said on Wednesday she would propose new sanctions to the 15-member U.N. Security Council in coming days. Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members.

The lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Louisiana named DeRay McKesson and four other Black Lives Matter leaders as defendants and sought at least $75,000 in damages. It came on the one-year anniversary of one of the deadliest days in modern U.S. history for law enforcement. On July 7, 2016, a black man angered by what he saw as deadly racial bias in U.S. policing launched a downtown Dallas sniper attack, killing five officers deployed at a protest decrying police shootings of black men. McKesson was not immediately available for comment and Black Lives Matter leaders have denied accusations that their movement promotes violence against police. About 10 days after the Dallas shooting, a decorated ex-U.S. Marine sergeant opened fire on police in Baton Rouge, killing three officers. Baton Rouge had been hit by waves of protests after two police officers earlier that month killed a black man, Alton Sterling, under questionable circumstances. The incident was caught on video and sparked national debate.  The officer wounded in Baton Rouge, who was not named in the lawsuit, was shot by  a person violently protesting against police, and which violence was caused or contributed to by the leaders of and by 'BLACK LIVES MATTER',  the filing said. Gavin Long, the black gunman who killed the Baton Rouge officers and was later shot dead, identified himself as a member of an African-American offshoot of the anti-government, mostly white Sovereign Citizen Movement, documents showed. Last year, McKesson and two other activists sued the Baton Rouge police department and other officials over the arrests of nearly 200 demonstrators during mostly peaceful protests over police killings.

According to the FlightRadar24 website, a Russian government jet flying from Moscow to Hamburg on Thursday deviated from the direct route over Belarus and Poland - which was once a Soviet bloc state but joined the Western military alliance after the fall of communism. Instead the Ilyushin with the registration number RA-96022 flew over the Baltic Sea, crossing on its way territory of neutral Finland and Sweden before entering the airspace of Denmark and Germany, both NATO members. Russian television later showed Putin emerging from a plane with same registration in Hamburg as he arrived for the summit, where he had his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday. Putin has flown over eastern NATO states on a number of recent occasions. It was not clear why this time his jet took a longer route, which also avoided crossing the Baltic states - former Soviet republics which, like Poland, are members of NATO and the European Union. A NATO F-16 fighter jet buzzed a plane carrying Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as it flew over the Baltic Sea on June 21, but was seen off by a Russian Sukhoi-27 military jet, Moscow said in an account partly disputed by NATO. Poland and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have been particularly vocal in their criticism of Moscow since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The region is a flashpoint for tensions between Russia and the Western allies, hosting U.S. and NATO troops, to Moscow's displeasure. U.S.-led war games were held there this year, rehearsing a scenario in which Russia might try to sever the states from the rest of the Western alliance. In a speech in Warsaw on Thursday, Trump committed to NATO's guarantee that alliance members will defend each other. Planes carrying Putin over the past 12 months always took direct routes when flying over EU countries, according to data on FlightRadar24. They did not fly over Ukraine, which has closed off its airspace to flights by Russian airlines. Putin repeatedly flew over Poland during the period, including for his previous European visit in May, and passed over the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius last October.

This year, the event will showcase Lebanon's younger generation of pop stars, including Ramy Ayach, Aline Lahoud and Brigitte Yaghi, performing classic Lebanese hits as well as their modern repertoires.  The internationally renowned Baalbek music festival will host a wide array of Lebanese and global artists for six nights at its historic venue among Roman ruins in the Bekaa Valley.

Government data on Friday showed that average hourly earnings in June rose just 2.5 percent on the year and have slowed in the past two quarters rather than accelerating even as workers become scarce due to continued economic strength. The lack of wage growth is mirrored across the developed world, most of which has staged a slower recovery than the United States.  For decades, higher wages had been driven by gains in worker productivity, but there are few signs now of an investment boom or of innovations fundamentally changing the way work is done. Productivity growth in the U.S. has averaged just one percent since 2005, half the level of 1990-2004; in the past five years the annual growth rate has been a dismal 0.5 percent.    There is no shortage of explanation as to why wage growth remains tepid – shadow slack, reduced bargaining power due to globalisation, de-unionization, automation, etc. – but what is puzzling is that wage growth, at least according to the average hourly earnings measure, was clearly accelerating in 2015 and 2016,  JPMorgan Economist Michael Feroli wrote after the data release.  Why it would slow only in the last two quarters is a mystery.  While most economists say the jobs numbers alone are enough to keep the Federal Reserve on a path to hike rates again this year, the slow wages growth implies limits to how high the Fed can push rates and raises questions about the longer-term health of the U.S. economy, which depends on consumer spending for 70 percent of its activity. International Monetary Fund data shows that across the developed world, the share of national income paid out to workers had fallen to less than 40 percent by 2015 from close to 55 percent in 1970, driven largely by technological change and globalisation.  You can’t continue to get all this job growth but there is no wage pressure. So something is not adding up at all,  said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. In March 2014 Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she believed that  perhaps 3 and 4 percent wage inflation would be normal.  Now the level appears to be stuck lower.

Haraguchi, who emigrated from Japan to the United States in 2007, purchases his fish locally and uses the meat at his walk-in only restaurant, Okonomi, for breakfast and lunch.  After working in the fish industry for so many years, I just realized that there are so many parts of fish that are not being utilized, which is the heads and the bones, mostly,  said Haraguchi, who opened the 12-seat restaurant in New York City's borough of Brooklyn in May 2014.  I was seeing it every day, and I wanted to find a way to utilize those underutilized parts of the fish and also the underutilized species of fish.  At Okonomi, chefs simmer the head and bones of the fish for ramen stock, which they serve at dinner when the eatery transforms into Yuji Ramen with an a la carte menu of seafood-rich ramen. After serving 69 breakfast meals and 59 bowls of ramen to roughly 130 people on a recent day, a staffer tossed out a single garbage bag when he closed the restaurant, according to Haraguchi. Less than one-tenth of the food at Okonomi/Yuji Ramen is thrown away, according to Haraguchi. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says more food fills incinerators and landfills than any other material. Food makes up a fifth of the waste stream in the United States.  Whatever comes in, we try to serve it,  Haraguchi said, adding that he avoids stockpiling food and mixes up the menu regularly to keep customers satisfied.  The food is obviously amazing, fresh, and impeccable,  said Brigitte Hamadey, a regular at the restaurant.  But also the philosophy that they use all the food... during the brunch they prepare excellent fish and then they use the same fish bones to make the ramen for the evening meals.  Brooklyn resident Dmitry Toubolets said he appreciates the restaurant's ability to be sustainable and of the utmost quality.  It doesn't make the taste weird in any way,  Toubolets said after finishing up his meal.  There's no negative impact in my view of anything they're trying to force into that kind of a niche or category.

Farmers, ranchers and residents in the Amazonian state of Para blocked the rugged BR-163 jungle road near the town of Novo Progresso.  The BR-163 road is completely blocked. There is already a large line of trucks backed up there,  Vanderlei Ataídes, head of the Para State's association of soy and corn producers, said by telephone.  The road is used to transport soy and corn from center-west Brazil to northern exporting ports. Top grains producer Mato Grosso State is at the peak of winter corn harvesting. Abiove, a Brazilian association representing commodities merchants and processors, said on Friday the blockage reduced the amount of grains flowing to northern ports to 25 percent of the normal volume. The protest turned violent late Thursday when a group set fire to semi-truck carrying eight new pickups to be used by government environmental agents to patrol the forest. Police were investigating the incident. The protesters are angered over a recent veto by President Michel Temer of a congressional bill that would have reduced the size of the Jamanxim National Forest. That bill would have opened up more land to farmers and ranchers. Temer's veto bill last month followed protests from environmental organizations who opposed the bill that would have reduced the protected reserve by over 480,000 hectares (1.18 million acres).

Even without a break, she wasn’t finished with her studies until she was 34 years old – at the beginning of the end of most women’s reproductive years. She gave birth to her first child during her surgical training and her second at the start of her practice, challenging times in both cases, and wondered when the optimal time might be for doctors, particularly those in the most demanding medical specialties, to become mothers. So Davids, a professor at the University of Massachusetts in Worcester, conducted a survey. The responses she got from physician moms showed that there might not be an ideal time for a woman doctor to have a child. “We didn’t find a great window where everything would seamlessly fall into place,” Davids said in a phone interview. “There is no perfect time.” But her study did find that physician mothers seemed happier with their careers when they picked specialties requiring fewer years of training and allowing more flexible schedules.  Surgeons, anesthesiologists, gastroenterologists and obstetricians were more likely to wish they’d chosen less demanding specialties than physician mothers in primary care and other generally less demanding specialties, according to the report in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.  Davids and her colleagues recruited 738 physician mothers who had children during their post-graduate clinical medical training through Facebook’s Physician Moms Group in the spring of 2015. They compared the mothers in surgery and other so-called “procedural” specialties, who made up 30 percent of respondents, to other physician mothers who spent less time training for their specialties.  Participants were nearly all married and lived in almost every state in the U.S., the study found. Women in procedural fields were more likely to use assisted reproduction to become pregnant and to take shorter maternity leaves. Procedural trainees were also more likely to have to make arrangements for their own substitutes when they missed work, as opposed to having their chief residents or department chairs find substitutes.  The physicians in procedural fields were less likely to have chosen their field based on considerations around pregnancy and childcare, and they were nearly twice as likely to report they wished they were in a less demanding specialty.  The findings point to a need for possible changes in training for procedural specialties, said Davids and her co-author, Dr. Nelya Melnitchouk, a colorectal surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.  More flexibility and competency-based training models, as opposed to those that require trainees to perform a certain number of procedures, might ease the difficulties procedural trainees encountered in becoming mothers, Melnitchouk said in an email. “There are some unique challenges of women in procedural specialties,” Davids said. “There needs to be flexibility and support so we can be there for our patients while also being there for our families.” Dr. Shanda Blackmon, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, believes inappropriate expectations can lead to career dissatisfaction. Blackmon, who was not involved in the new study, stressed the need for a circle of support. “If you survey who has a husband that stays at home and supports the family,” she said in an email, “the results may be different.” “Those without a village of support will get out of the specialty to save their families,” she said. In-hospital childcare and childcare that begins as early as 4 a.m., when trainees are expected to report to the hospital, might help, Blackmon said. Women comprised just 7 percent of U.S. medical school graduates in 1965, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Today that rate hovers near 50 percent. A majority of surgical residents, however, continue to be male. Previous studies have shown that women in surgical specialties are less satisfied with their careers than their male counterparts. But Davids has no regrets. “I certainly wouldn’t change my specialty or my job,” she said. “What I do is my passion. My advice to others would be, ‘make sure you’re proactive in seeking the support you need to accomplish your goals.’ ” SOURCE: bit.ly/2s3pcsr Journal of the American College of Surgeons, June 13, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-moms-surgery-career-idUSKBN19S2SS"},

The lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Louisiana named DeRay McKesson and four other Black Lives Matter leaders as defendants and sought at least $75,000 in damages. It came on the one-year anniversary of one of the deadliest days in modern U.S. history for law enforcement. On July 7, 2016, a black man angered by what he saw as deadly racial bias in U.S. policing launched a downtown Dallas sniper attack, killing five officers deployed at a protest decrying police shootings of black men. McKesson was not immediately available for comment and Black Lives Matter leaders have denied accusations that their movement promotes violence against police. About 10 days after the Dallas shooting, a decorated ex-U.S. Marine sergeant opened fire on police in Baton Rouge, killing three officers. Baton Rouge had been hit by waves of protests after two police officers earlier that month killed a black man, Alton Sterling, under questionable circumstances. The incident was caught on video and sparked national debate. The officer wounded in Baton Rouge, who was not named in the lawsuit, was shot by  a person violently protesting against police, and which violence was caused or contributed to by the leaders of and by 'BLACK LIVES MATTER',  the filing said. Gavin Long, the black gunman who killed the Baton Rouge officers and was later shot dead, identified himself as a member of an African-American offshoot of the anti-government, mostly white Sovereign Citizen Movement, documents showed. Last year, McKesson and two other activists sued the Baton Rouge police department and other officials over the arrests of nearly 200 demonstrators during mostly peaceful protests over police killings.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/louisiana-police-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JY1H2"},

Following the report, the dollar rose to two-month highs against the yen, in its largest weekly percentage gain since late April. The greenback also climbed to a more than one-week peak against sterling.  Friday's data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 222,000  last month, beating economists' expectations of a 179,000 gain. Data for April and May was revised to show 47,000 more jobs created than previously reported.  The above-consensus payroll figure ... will augment the Fed's decision to begin balance sheet reduction sooner than later,  said Charlie Ripley, investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis.  On balance, the labour market continues to be solid and despite the softer inflation data as of late, the solid employment data should keep the Fed on course for policy normalization,  he said.  While the employment headline number was strong, inflation pressure remained tame. Average hourly earnings, which currency traders monitor closely, increased 0.2 percent in June, short of the 0.3 percent expected. Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston, pointed out that hourly earnings' 2.5 percent gain from a year earlier were  disappointing,  with growth slower than at the start of the year and mostly stagnant over the past several months.

In 2011, 2.3 million caregivers tended to the needs of an estimated 905,000 older Americans in their final year of life, the report in Health Affairs found.  Nearly 9 in 10 of the caregivers were unpaid, and only 9 percent of dying older adults received money for caregiving from government or private insurance.  “Supporting caregivers is an urgent public health issue,” said lead author Dr. Katherine Ornstein, a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “We have a huge reliance on families throughout the course of serious illness, but especially at the end of life. It’s the most complex and challenging time, and it’s really the families who are involved,” she said in a phone interview. Ornstein and her team used two previous national studies to estimate the number of people tending to the basic needs of Medicare beneficiaries who were 65 and older and in the last year of their lives. Only 14 percent of the caregivers were spouses, and nearly two-thirds of the spouses reported receiving no help from other relatives or friends.  Caregiving includes assistance with basic activities, such as eating and bathing.  The spouses reported caring for their husbands and wives for an average of 10 years and an average of 44 hours a week and were more than twice as likely as other end-of-life caregivers to feel depressed. The children of dying elders, especially the daughters, carried the biggest burden, the study showed. Daughters provided more than 38 percent of caregiving to their parents, while sons provided 22 percent. “We’ve known that families are involved,” Ornstein said. “But here’s proof. They’re especially involved at the end of life. What can we do to make it easier so they can do their jobs?” “We have to think more about policies that will support caregivers at the end of life,” she said. The researchers identified 2,423 community-dwelling older adults receiving help in 2011. Based on the fact that 264 of them died within the year, the researchers estimated that 905,000 elderly community-dwelling older adults received help from an estimated 2 million unpaid caregivers in their final year. “This article is a call for attention for the important role of caregivers in caring for an aging population and for Congress to start thinking about how to restructure Medicare for an aging society in which people are having multiple chronic illnesses and need assistance with daily living at the close of life,” said Dr. Joan Teno, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle. She was not involved with the new study. “We have a healthcare system that’s built around the needs of the healthcare system and not the needs of the family,” she said in a phone interview. “We have an aging society, and we have little time to deal with the silver tsunami we’re not ready for.” Medicare was designed in the 1960s for a different population, Teno said. Today’s older adults more frequently face death at home after being sent home from hospitals sicker and with more complicated needs, she said. Many of the caregivers are members of the so-called sandwich generation, children of the elderly who are at the same time still caring for their own children, Teno said.  Ornstein was surprised to see that end-of-life caregivers were not more depressed, anxious or stressed about money than caregivers ministering to people with longer than a year to live, she said. “It really speaks to the fact that the challenging job of a caregiver is not necessarily restricted to a few months before one dies,” she said. “Certainly individuals are more vulnerable at the end of life. Support for caregivers may be more urgent at the end of life but important through critical illness.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sJlIhy Health Affairs, online July 5, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-eldercare-family-idUSKBN19S2SN"},

On a grand tour, points are awarded at the end of each stage - 50 for the winner of a flat stage, 20 for the winner of a mountain stage - and at the end of the intermediate sprint at some point during a stage. Because Sagan could manage decent results in both flat-stage sprints and in the hilly stages, unlike the pure sprinters, he had won the last five green jerseys. But the world champion was kicked out of the race for sending Mark Cavendish crashing on Tuesday, leaving the race for the green jersey wide open. That is not the only reason, though.  For the last few years the green jersey was no longer for a sprinter, but this year is different, because there are no semi-hilly stages (where Sagan would pick up most of the points) and even Sagan would have struggled,  LeMond, on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in a daily chat with Reuters on Friday.  There are also more purely flat stages decided in a bunch sprint, and German Marcel Kittel has already won three of them. He leads French champion Arnaud Demare by 15 points.  I think Marcel will start to really believe he can get it,  said LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 89 and 90. The Tour gets to the mountains on Saturday and Sunday before the sprinters take centre stage again. While Demare is likely to best Kittel in a slightly uphill bunch sprint finish, Kittel has been too powerful on the flat, straight sprints. LeMond believes the German has an advantage.  More stages to come are for Marcel,  he said. Demare's hope would be to get in a breakaway in the mountain stages and pick up the intermediate sprint points.  Marcel won't stay in the climbs, maybe Demare can but I'm not sure,  said LeMond.

Trading was choppy in the Treasury market after the U.S. jobs data, with yields initially tumbling and then quickly reversing course. Longer- and medium-dated yields were last higher on the day, while shorter-dated yields were stable to slightly lower but remained high on a historical basis.      Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs, the U.S. Labor Department said, beating economists' expectations for a gain of 179,000. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent in May, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.     While sluggish wage growth put a wrinkle in the otherwise upbeat report and signaled lagging inflation, analysts said the report did not alter expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again later this year and begin unwinding its balance sheet.      With a hawkish Fed still in place, most yields resumed the uptrend they began last week on anticipation that the Fed would tighten monetary policy roughly in unison with the European Central Bank and Bank of England, whose chiefs made suggestions last week that they were shifting toward less accommodative policy.       (The U.S. bond market) is not massively altering its course based on this report,  said Shyam Rajan, head of U.S. Rates Strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

Treasury yields were moving in tandem with rising yields in Europe, with 10-year Bund yields hitting an 18-month high on Friday of 0.58 percent.      Analysts attributed the stable to slightly lower status of shorter-dated yields to the disappointing aspects of the U.S. jobs report.

The Spanish fourth seed scorched his way through the first set, threatening to sizzle the parched Center Court grass with the pace of some of his shots. He committed only four unforced errors in that set and visibly berated himself when he dropped even a point. So rare were his slip-ups, that the crowd greeted them with gasps.

The 30th-seeded Russian put it more bluntly:  At the beginning he started really fast. He was destroying me.  Khachanov, 21, regrouped in the second set as Nadal's level dipped from ferocious to merely fearsome.

Banks stepped in to sell dollars after the peso fell as low as 17.38 per U.S. dollar on Thursday, traders said, taking profits after the currency weakened 7.0 percent during nine straight losing sessions beginning on June 23, the longest such streak since February 2016. The peso closed 0.71 percent stronger on Friday at 16.98 to the greenback. During the week the Argentine currency weakened 2.06 percent. Macri let the exchange rate float shortly after taking office in December 2015, prompting a sharp depreciation against the dollar after years of currency controls put in place by former populist President Cristina Fernandez had kept the peso artificially strong. The decline in recent weeks came as a flood of foreign currency that entered the country thanks to debt sales eased up along with inflows from a tax amnesty program. Investors also hedged their bets by buying dollars as the elections approach, in which Fernandez could win a Senate seat. While the drop has prompted calls for central bank action amid concern it could worsen inflation seen above 20 percent this year, analysts said the currency had been stronger than expected in the first half of the year and remained far from official expectations for an average of 17.92 in 2017.  With the dollar in the neighborhood of 17 pesos, there is only a partial correction of that lag,  said Jorge Vasconcelos, an economist at the Fundacion Mediterranea think tank. Officials have repeatedly played down concerns about the dollar exchange rate, noting that a floating exchange rate can protect the economy from external shocks and that the peso's sharp moves against the dollar contrast with more modest moves against other currencies.  There's no reason to worry when the dollar moves,  Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne told reporters on Friday at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, according to local newspaper La Nacion.  The exchange rate will have less and less impact on price formation.

NJ Transit spokesman Jim Smith called it a  minor derailment,  and said the cause was under investigation. The  incident caused delays that stretched until 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT) on Friday, when service returned to normal for the morning rush hour. The nine-car North Jersey Coast Line commuter train, which originated in Long Branch, New Jersey, derailed at 9:10 p.m. on the New York side of a tunnel under the Hudson River, Smith said. A rescue train was sent to transport all aboard to Penn Station, arriving at 11 p.m., he said. The commuter train had been scheduled to arrive at 8:53 p.m.  The derailment was the latest in a series of derailments at Penn Station, where extensive track repairs intended to prevent such problems are scheduled to begin Monday and run through Sept. 1. Some commuters aired their frustration.  Another derailment tonight. Are you kidding me with this,  Bernadette Aulesta of South Orange, New Jersey, commented on a Facebook page for a group called NJT Riders Revolt.  As I'm sitting on my train ride home after having to take the PATH and then the train at Hoboken thanks to yet another NJT derailment, I am comforted by scrolling through the past month of angry NJT riders and remembering that I'm not alone,  Regine Labossiere posted on the page. Roughly 600,000 commuters, mostly from New Jersey and Long Island, use the station each day. They ride Amtrak, the national rail corporation and owner of the tracks, and NJ Transit and Long Island Rail Road, which rent tracks and platforms from Amtrak. Starting Monday, commuters face eight weeks of rerouted, canceled and delayed trains on all three railways. Even once the repairs are completed, service may not always be on time, Amtrak Chief Operating Officer Scot Naparstek said on Friday.   We have delivered consistently for years, plus-90 percent on-time performance. I don’t want to fool people that we’re going to do 100 percent on-time performance. We are not bringing a new station to Penn Station, we are not replacing all the infrastructure,  Naparstek told reporters at the station. New Jersey governor Chris Christie called on Friday for a full investigation into the potential causes of the incident. Derailments and other transit problems at Penn Station have prompted renewed criticism by some of Christie over his decision in 2010 to withdraw $2.7 billion in state funding for a new train tunnel under the Hudson. It would have been America's largest public-works project and Christie axed the project because he said cash-strapped New Jersey could not afford billions of dollars in likely cost overruns.

The work at Pennsylvania Station is due to begin Monday and run through Sept. 1, leaving the roughly 600,000 commuters who arrive there each morning from New Jersey and Long Island scrambling for alternate ways into the city. Ferry operators, bus services and even parking lots are looking to capitalize on the disruption, which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said will likely mean a  summer of hell  for those who rely on the New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road systems that will be disrupted as Amtrak undertakes $40 million in track repairs.  This is going to be a tough couple of months,  said Ronnie Hakim, interim executive director for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the LIRR, the Metro-North Railroad and New York City subways and buses.  Hakim advised commuters to travel outside of peak periods if possible, spread out along platforms to avoid overcrowding and purchase tickets ahead of time.   Consider trying to do things a little differently,  she said.  Related CoverageNew York-bound train derails just days ahead of planned track repairsCommuters waylaid by a series of recent derailments got yet another taste of travel disruptions to come on Thursday night, when a NJ Transit train carrying 180 customers and crew derailed near Penn Station. One option officials are warning against is trying to drive into the already congested city, even as parking lots near the midtown transit hub urge riders in billboards and advertisements to do just that.  Anyone who works in the city understands the gridlock that characterizes downtown and midtown Manhattan during business hours. It's why they chose mass transit to begin with,  said New Jersey state Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who chairs the chamber's transportation committee. Commuters walk through Penn Station during the morning commute in New York City, NY, U.S. July 7, 2017.Brendan McDermidWisniewski urged riders to consider ferries and buses as alternatives, with 97,000 cars per day already crossing from New Jersey to New York City, according to city data.  The delays will take a toll on the city's economy, with Manhattan employers expected to lose an estimated $14.5 million for every hour that train commuters from New Jersey and Long Island are delayed, according to an estimate by the Partnership for New York City.  Silver Lining? Slideshow (3 Images)Some regular train riders are trying to find silver linings to the change in routine. Among them are commuters taking New Jersey Transit up on its offer to honor some train tickets on ferries that carry travelers across the Hudson River, a journey that normally costs $9 each way.  Riding the ferry is definitely way less stressful than having to run into a tunnel and hope the train gets you there,  Tim Dedman, 43, of West Orange, New Jersey, an information technology manager who works in lower Manhattan.  The view is great. All these gleaming towers rising out of the fog.    Others are using the transit trauma to nurture a creative streak.  Who knew my disgust, Could be expressed artfully? Now get me to Penn,  wrote Joey Neri, an advertising copywriter, in a haiku posted on the Facebook group NJ Transit Riders Revolt. Neri, 30, said in an email that he moved to Edison, New Jersey, because of the direct train service to Penn Station just months before the repairs were announced. He said he had not written a haiku since high school but now so regularly posts 17-syllable poems that he has picked up the nickname  the Bard of Penn Station.  His planned Monday missive?

These possible threats to the bond market seem remote though as the Fed assessed that vulnerabilities in the financial system  remain moderate on balance  in its semiannual report on Congress. U.S. Treasury debt term premiums, or what investors demand in yield to hold a longer-term bond after adjusting for inflation, have been running at historic lows due to strong investor demand and to the Fed's ongoing purchases of U.S. government debt. If term premiums were to revert to higher levels, there could be repercussion beyond the Treasury market, the Fed said.  A sudden rise in term premiums to more normal levels poses a downside risk to long-maturity Treasury prices, which could in turn affect the prices of other assets,  it said. A pickup in term premiums raises the appeal of long-dated Treasury debt rather owning stocks and other riskier assets. On Friday, the yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), a gauge of longer-term U.S. term premium, was 0.63 percent. This was above the minus 0.84 percent in December 2012 but well below the 2.65 percent seen prior to the onset of the 2007-09 global financial crisis. The central bank also said it was keeping an eye on the $2.6 trillion money market fund sector, which fully implemented a reform designed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2016. The tighter SEC regulations are aimed at averting  run risk  seen when the share price of the Reserve Primary Fund fell below $1 or  broke the buck  following the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008. Investors rushed to pull their money from the fund due to its heavy holdings of Lehman's debt. In 2016, money funds shifted $1.2 trillion of assets into Treasury bills and short-term debt issued by mortgage finance agencies as many of them converted into  government-only  funds from prime funds that can hold riskier securities. This move into safer securities has reduced the run risk for money funds, but if a reverse back into  more opaque and fragile alternative vehicles  were to occur, run risk could go up again, the Fed said.  Thus, continued monitoring of this sector is important.  it said in the report. (Reporting by Richard Leong)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-report-bonds-idUSL1N1JY191"},

Less than a month after turning women's tennis upside down with an audacious run to the French Open title, she is at it again on the lawns of the All England Club. Her 7-5 7-5 victory over Italy's Camila Giorgi means the feisty 20-year-old is only four wins away from completing what would be astonishing French Open/Wimbledon double. That would put her in the same company as Serena Williams and Steffi Graf, the only two players to achieve one of the toughest tasks in tennis in the last 20 years. Her mother, and coach, also Jelena, said it might finally sink in that her daughter is a grand slam champion if she wins another one - and with the women's draw wide open it would be dangerous to bet against the Latvian livewire.  I'm just trying to play free, not to think too much,  Ostapenko said.  After French I'm more confident, so I'm playing every match better and better. I think I play aggressive. I control the matches. I feel pretty consistent.  Her game still veers between rasping winners - a relatively conservative, by her standards, 24 against Giorgi - and unforced errors which would not look out of place at a local club. That explains why her last eight matches, including her French Open final win against world number two Simona Halep, went to three sets. Two sets sufficed on Friday, although Giorgi will be wondering how she did not at least take a set. The Italian, ranked at 86 after reaching 30 two years ago, served for the first set at 5-3 but a double-fault and a backhand error allowed Ostapenko back in and she exacted full punishment by breaking again to win the set. Ostapenko lost her cool at times and scowled across to Giorgi's box where she later said someone was coughing at vital moments.  It was just before my serve, somebody started to cough. I think it's a little bit unsportsmanlike,  she said.  You're in such a high level, and the tournament like Wimbledon, a grand slam, I think people have to understand where they are.  There is no lack of passion from Ostapenko and she also let rip at her coaching team, including Spanish WTA player Anabel Medina Garrigues, as she fell 5-2 behind in the second set after a Giorgi ace, according to Hawkeye, had kissed a line. Ostapenko steadied herself though to hold the next game and left Giorgi in familiar territory, serving for the set at 5-3. But in a mirror image of the first set the Italian fired another double-fault and Ostapenko pounced to snatch back the break with a clubbing backhand winner. There was no stopping Ostapenko after that as she allowed her opponent only three more points - roaring with delight and pumping her fists as Giorgi netted a backhand to lose the match.

Oil prices erased the previous day's gains after a report showed U.S. production rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high, casting doubt on efforts to curb persistent oversupply. U.S. Treasury debt yields and the dollar rose after falling after the data was released as investors tried to figure out how the mix of strong jobs and weak wage growth would influence the Federal Reserve's plans for an interest rate hike or balance-sheet reduction. “The bond market has already priced in an extremely slow Fed ... It’s not massively altering its course based on this report because it’s kind of a mixed-bag report,  said Shyam Rajan, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. Wall Street's S&P; 500 stock index rose after a sell-off on Thursday as investors were reassured by the strong jobs number but bet that weak wage growth would limit Fed hawkishness.  The fears of rates rising too quickly have dissipated and market participants are looking for bargains,  said Andrew Frankel, co-president of Stuart Frankel & Co in New York.  Maybe there was just enough bad news in a great jobs number to keep the Fed off the gas pedal,  he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 97.66 points, or 0.46 percent, to 21,417.7, the S&P; 500 gained 15.72 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,425.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 64.63 points, or 1.06 percent, to 6,154.09. The U.S. dollar was up 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies and on pace to post its largest weekly percentage gain since early June. The greenback rose to two-month highs against the yen after the Bank of Japan increased its bond buying, expanding monetary policy when other central banks are moving to tighten.  We view today's report as supportive of the Fed view that they can hike an additional time later this year, while starting to reduce the balance sheet in the fall,  said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston. U.S. Treasuries were up after the release of a Fed monetary policy report to Congress. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 7/32 in price to yield 2.3945 percent, from 2.369 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond was off 21/32 in price to yield 2.9367 percent, from 2.904 percent late on Thursday. Bets that some of the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding ultra-loose monetary policies have roiled markets this week as European Central Bank minutes showed policymakers are open to tightening. In Europe, German government bond yields had risen to 18-month highs, lifting the euro but weighing on stocks. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.12 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.17 percent.. U.S. crude fell 2.81 percent to $44.24 per barrel and Brent was last at $46.73, down 2.87 percent.

For Reuters' monthly 'First Jobs' series, we chatted with a few leading scientists about how they got their starts. Jane Goodall Founder, Jane Goodall Institute; UN Messenger of Peace First job: Secretary  When I left school, we had no money for university, but just enough for a boring secretarial course. Before getting a 'proper' job, I had a part-time job working for my aunt who ran the children's orthopedic clinic. Twice a week the orthopedic surgeon came to examine patients, and my job was to take down his notes shorthand, and then type them out. This gave me a profound understanding and empathy for those with physical disabilities (there was much polio, club feet - and even rickets - back then).  My next job was a secretarial job involving a lot of filing at the Registry Office at Oxford University. And then came transfer to London to work at Stanley Schofield Productions on Bond Street. We made advertising films, and my job was to choose the music. But I also learned makeup. My masterpiece was to paint the seam of a non-existent stocking on the bare leg of an actress!  When invited to Africa, I earned money by being a waitress in a hotel around the corner from my home in Bournemouth - very hard work indeed. And the last job prior to my career was to be secretary for Louis Leakey at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. So the boring secretarial course was certainly worth it in the end!  Carolyn Porco Planetary scientist; visiting scholar, UC Berkeley First job: Library page  I was around 13, and after school I would go to the Westchester Square library in the Bronx. My job was to shelve books, so I got very familiar with authors of great literature.   I remember one time I was waiting for the bus after my shift, at around 6 at night, and saw a bright star in the sky.   It got me wondering about our place in the cosmos. At that age I had already started thinking about existential questions like the meaning of life. But now, instead of wondering, 'What are we doing here?' I started thinking about 'Okay, so where is here?' That was one of the very first steps on my journey to where I am today.  Michio Kaku Theoretical physicist, City College of New York  First job: Gardener  During World War Two, my father was in a relocation camp for four years. After the camp opened up, there weren't many jobs for Japanese-Americans. But there were some gardening jobs opening up, because the suburbs were spreading. So he would take me along, and I would mow lawns and water plants and carry fertilizer.  As a child I basically had a choice of two paths: One, my father wanted me to take over the gardening business. And two, I wanted to become a physicist. After that gardening job, I decided I would much rather work with my mind. James Hansen Climate scientist, Columbia University First job: Newspaper delivery boy  When I was in the third grade, one of my sisters gave me about 10 of her customers on her paper route. After school I would deliver the Omaha World Herald to them.   The World Herald cost 25 cents for the six weekdays, plus 15 cents for Sunday. I made 5/6 of a cent per day per customer, and three cents on Sunday - provided that I collected.   When my earning reached a dollar, I would convert it to a silver dollar (there were still a lot in circulation in 1950) and put it in a tall can. I saved most of the money, but did buy a Radio Flyer red wagon for $9, and later a bicycle.  By the time I graduated from high school I had saved $1,900. That helped me graduate from college with no student debt.

Critics accused Renzi of adopting the language of rightist opponents less than a year before national elections, where the growing migration crisis is likely to dominate campaigning.  We need to free ourselves from a sense of guilt. We do not have the moral duty to welcome into Italy people who are worse off than ourselves,  Renzi wrote in new book, excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on the PD website.  There has to be a fixed number of arrivals,  he said, adding that Italy should help migrants in their home countries. Underscoring the sensitivity of the issue, the comments were swiftly removed from the website, but not before they had generated a backlash among some PD supporters, and glee in the right-wing camp. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League party, posted the deleted text on his own Twitter account.  Thanks for all the work. We will take it,  Salvini wrote.  They (the PD) chatter and get embarrassed about it, while we can't wait to actually do it.   Rising Numbers More than 600,000 migrants have reached Italy over the past four years, the vast majority arriving by boat from Libya. About 85,000 have come ashore this year alone, roughly 20 percent up on the same period in 2016. The upsurge in new arrivals, most of them from sub-Saharan Africa, has unsettled the Italian government, which has urged greater help from European allies in resettling the refugees. Its requests have fallen largely on deaf ears and Renzi warned on Friday that Rome would look to curb funding to EU nations that had refused to offer help.  They are shutting their doors. We will block their funds,  he said. Renzi's PD party fared badly in local elections last month, losing control of 30 municipalities, including the traditional leftist stronghold of Genoa in northern Italy, with the migrant crisis increasingly weighing on the government. Former European Commissioner for humanitarian affairs, Emma Bonino, caused embarrassment in PD ranks this week when she said that Renzi's government had requested in 2014 that all the migrants leaving Libya be brought to Italy.   At the beginning, we didn't realize that this was a structural problem and not a passing phase. We shot ourselves in the foot,  said Bonino, a former Italian foreign minister. Renzi denied her assertion on Friday, but said that in future, Italy should do more to encourage migrants to stay at home and develop their own economies.

Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, driven by hefty gains in healthcare, government, restaurants and the professional and business services sectors, the Labor Department said on Friday. It was the second biggest payrolls increase this year and beat economists' expectations for a 179,000 rise. “It’s a good run-of-the-mill jobs report,” Gundlach said in a telephone interview. Gundlach, known on Wall Street as the  Bond King,  said the payrolls report will keep the U.S. central bank in a tightening mode. “It’s not ‘old school’ sequential tightening when the Fed hiked at every meeting until something breaks,” such as a U.S. recession, Gundlach said. “What we have now is the ‘new old school’ sequential tightening.” Gundlach, who oversees more than $109 billion in assets under management at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine, said it appears as though the Federal Reserve has been paying attention to record stock prices. “I think the Fed is emboldened to hike when the stock market is pushing near highs and when there is a sense or whiff of panic in the air, they start to talk cautiously.” Friday, the Fed said in its semiannual report to Congress that vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system  remained, on balance, moderate.  Gundlach said the Fed was  getting awfully specific  on asset prices in its semiannual report.  It almost sounds like they are saying, 'I warned you and don't blame us.' I told you we were going to do this (hike rates) and asset prices are going down. If stocks go down 10 percent in October, don’t blame us.    The Fed's report stated that forward equity price-to-earnings ratios rose a bit further and are now at their highest levels since the early 2000s, while a measure of the risk premium embedded in high-yield corporate bond spreads declined a touch from an already low level, implying high asset valuations in the market as well.

The sales slump came even as corn prices dropped to a seven-week low in the reporting period, suggesting global buyers feel little urgency to lock in import purchases amid record-large global supplies, traders and analysts said. Importers booked a net 140,275 tonnes of the grain for shipment by the end of August in the week ending June 29, the lowest yet for the 2016-17 marketing year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Combined sales, including 74,516 tonnes booked for shipment in the upcoming marketing year, were the lowest since June 2014, according to USDA data.  Brazil is starting to steal some business from the U.S.,  said Terry Reilly, senior commodities analyst with Futures International.  It all goes back to the record safrinha crop,  he said, referring to the country's second corn harvest which was Brazil's largest on record this year. Corn exports from Brazil, the world's No. 2 supplier, jumped to 563,206 tonnes in June, up from 309,986 tonnes in May and 19,266 tonnes in June 2016, Brazil's Trade Ministry said this week. Meanwhile, a flood of Argentine corn is poised to enter the marketplace this month as late planting and wet weather delayed the harvest. Spot corn shipments from Brazil's Paranagua port are priced around $163.60 per tonne on a free-on-board basis, compared with U.S. Gulf spot shipments around $161.50 per tonne, according to Reuters data.  South America is starting to get their corn boats lined up now. It's going to be a battle from here on out because they've got so much grain to move down there,  said a U.S. corn export trader who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. The USDA is due to update its global supply and demand estimates next Wednesday and some analysts are expecting the agency to trim its U.S. corn export forecast given the heightened competition from Brazil and Argentina. The USDA is expected to increase world corn ending stocks to a record 225.72 million tonnes, up 1.13 million from its June estimate, according to analysts polled by Reuters.

However, his team said later in the day he would collect a five-place penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change - something they had known but kept quiet about since Tuesday at least. Hamilton is on 66 poles, meaning another in Spielberg on Saturday would have set him up to equal the record at Silverstone, his home British Grand Prix, next week.

But it's still going to be a tough race on Sunday for sure.  Hamilton, winner in Austria last year, is 14 points behind Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel after eight races but still has a good chance of going into the August summer break in the lead. Vettel, who like Hamilton has won three times so far this year, was only 0.147 seconds slower than his rival on Friday and Ferrari have a habit of closing the gap by the time Sunday comes around.

U.S. non farm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said, beating expectations of a 179,000 gain.                   We have a stellar U.S. jobs number,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets.      The data has brought negative news for gold traders as there isn't really anything in this number which is going to put the brakes on an interest rate hike.       Spot gold        was down 1.2 percent at $1,209.90 an ounce by 2:21 p.m. EDT (1821 GMT), after touching $1,207.15, the weakest since March 15. It has dropped about 2.5 percent this week and is set for its biggest weekly fall since the week of May 5.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery settled down 1.1 percent at $1,209.70.     Gold has shed about 6 percent since touching a seven-month peak of $1,295.97 on June 6.

Traders said the move appeared to have been driven by an accidental order. The metal was on track to close the week down more than 6 percent.     Palladium        fell 0.4 percent to $837.75 per ounce after hitting its lowest since June 2 earlier in the session.     Analyst Carsten Menke at Julius Baer in Zurich said palladium is likely to be pressured due to struggling car sales in the United States and China, the world's two biggest markets.

The FTC, which shares the work of antitrust enforcement with the Justice Department and pursues companies accused of deceptive advertising, is currently headed by acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who was named on Jan. 25. Even without a permanent chair and missing key staff, in the past month, the FTC has forced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc to scrap a plan to buy Rite Aid Corp, sued to stop daily fantasy sports companies DraftKings and FanDuel from merging and filed a complaint aimed at stopping a North Dakota hospital system from buying clinics. The Trump administration has not named a permanent chair. For the past several weeks, Ohlhausen, a Republican, has been the leading candidate, according to a person familiar with her candidacy. Also under consideration are Joe Simons of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, according to the trade publication MLEX; and Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, according to a source close to the situation. Both Ohlhausen and Simons would be traditional Republican enforcers, meaning that few enforcement decisions would change and the pro-business approach with a slant toward approving big mergers would likely continue. That said, as a commissioner, Ohlhausen dissented on an FTC decision to sue Qualcomm Inc for allegedly using its market power to maintain a monopoly on key semiconductors. Depending on who is named to the agency, this lawsuit could potentially be dropped. Google's critics in Silicon Valley tend to support Reyes, who has little background in antitrust issues, since he and the District of Columbia attorney general wrote a letter in 2016 urging the FTC to consider re-opening a probe of Google that the agency had closed in early 2013. The wide-ranging probe had touched on everything from search bias to Google's practice of scraping third-party content for its sites to the licensing of standard essential patents. Because Ohlhausen is only acting as FTC head, she cannot hire a permanent head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition or fill other key posts.  The chair sets the priorities. It's important to have that person in to set the direction and pursue initiatives,  said Deborah Garza, who served in the Bush administration and is at the law firm Covington and Burling LLP. Nominations for the FTC will come sometime this summer because potential nominees are in the process of being cleared, according to a White House official, asked about the delay.  The Trump administration has identified who the individuals will be for certain positions,  said the official, who asked not to be identified. Lots of Empty Offices Beyond lacking a permanent chair, the agency is thin at the top. Rather than four commissioners working with Ohlhausen, she has just one, Democrat Terrell McSweeny. This means that Trump may name two Republicans but the third person must be a Democrat or independent since by law no more than three commissioners can be from the same political party. Leading candidates for the two Republican seats are Bilal Sayyed of the law firm McDermott Will & Emery and Noah Phillips, an aide to Senator John Cornyn, according to the person familiar with the nomination process. For the open Democratic commission seat, Senator Chuck Schumer has backed consumer advocate Rohit Chopra but the White House has also spoken with others, including agriculture expert Lillian Salerno. The agency has plenty of work on its plate including the merger of Linde and Praxair, which would create a $73 billion global industrial gases leader in a highly consolidated market. A second is Canada's Potash Corp's purchase of Agrium Inc in the consolidated fertilizer sector.  The president has his hands full with a lot of different issues. The FTC is a major fill for any administration, and he needs to get to that,  said Carl Hittinger, an antitrust expert with the law firm Baker and Hostetler LLP. Once a commissioner is named to the independent FTC the president has no say in what decisions are made, so commissioners must be chosen carefully, added Hittinger.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 222,000 jobs last month, data from the Labor Department showed, topping economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in June after gaining 0.1 percent in May, but fell short of the estimated 0.3 percent increase. While the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 percent from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market. The jobs report relieved investors who have paid close attention to wage growth and whether inflation will climb enough to justify the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates once more this year.

Perceived chances of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting stood at 51.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Policymakers have taken opposing views on inflation after it retreated further below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target in May, creating uncertainty over the future path of rate hikes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.64 points, or 0.48 percent, to 21,422.68, the S&P; 500 gained 16.69 points, or 0.69 percent, to 2,426.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 69.40 points, or 1.14 percent, to 6,158.86. The technology sector, up 1.45 percent, led the charge higher, buoyed by gains of more than 1.6 percent in market cap heavyweights Apple, Microsoft and Facebook. Despite slumping nearly 3 percent last week, the tech sector is up more than 17 percent on the year, tops among the 11 major S&P; groups.  They had a pretty good quarter of earnings last quarter and investors might be positioning themselves ahead of the next quarter of reporting and guidance that we see from some of the big tech companies,  said Lynch.  That weakness that we saw the past couple of weeks has given people an opportunity to jump back into some of these names.  With the Fed now expected to remain on track for a rate hike later this year, financials also advanced, up 0.68 percent. Tesla rose 1 percent after the luxury electric carmaker said about 3,500 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the second quarter and they would be counted as deliveries in the third quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.26-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

For Reuters' monthly 'First Jobs' series, we chatted with a few leading scientists about how they got their starts. Jane Goodall Founder, Jane Goodall Institute; UN Messenger of Peace First job: Secretary  When I left school, we had no money for university, but just enough for a boring secretarial course. Before getting a 'proper' job, I had a part-time job working for my aunt who ran the children's orthopedic clinic. Twice a week the orthopedic surgeon came to examine patients, and my job was to take down his notes shorthand, and then type them out. This gave me a profound understanding and empathy for those with physical disabilities (there was much polio, club feet - and even rickets - back then).  My next job was a secretarial job involving a lot of filing at the Registry Office at Oxford University. And then came transfer to London to work at Stanley Schofield Productions on Bond Street. We made advertising films, and my job was to choose the music. But I also learned makeup. My masterpiece was to paint the seam of a non-existent stocking on the bare leg of an actress!  When invited to Africa, I earned money by being a waitress in a hotel around the corner from my home in Bournemouth - very hard work indeed. And the last job prior to my career was to be secretary for Louis Leakey at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. So the boring secretarial course was certainly worth it in the end!  Carolyn Porco Planetary scientist; visiting scholar, UC Berkeley First job: Library page  I was around 13, and after school I would go to the Westchester Square library in the Bronx. My job was to shelve books, so I got very familiar with authors of great literature.   I remember one time I was waiting for the bus after my shift, at around 6 at night, and saw a bright star in the sky.   It got me wondering about our place in the cosmos. At that age I had already started thinking about existential questions like the meaning of life. But now, instead of wondering, 'What are we doing here?' I started thinking about 'Okay, so where is here?' That was one of the very first steps on my journey to where I am today.  Michio Kaku Theoretical physicist, City College of New York  First job: Gardener  During World War Two, my father was in a relocation camp for four years. After the camp opened up, there weren't many jobs for Japanese-Americans. But there were some gardening jobs opening up, because the suburbs were spreading. So he would take me along, and I would mow lawns and water plants and carry fertilizer.  As a child I basically had a choice of two paths: One, my father wanted me to take over the gardening business. And two, I wanted to become a physicist. After that gardening job, I decided I would much rather work with my mind. James Hansen Climate scientist, Columbia University First job: Newspaper delivery boy  When I was in the third grade, one of my sisters gave me about 10 of her customers on her paper route. After school I would deliver the Omaha World Herald to them.   The World Herald cost 25 cents for the six weekdays, plus 15 cents for Sunday. I made 5/6 of a cent per day per customer, and three cents on Sunday - provided that I collected.   When my earning reached a dollar, I would convert it to a silver dollar (there were still a lot in circulation in 1950) and put it in a tall can. I saved most of the money, but did buy a Radio Flyer red wagon for $9, and later a bicycle.  By the time I graduated from high school I had saved $1,900. That helped me graduate from college with no student debt.

The meeting, which may take place on July 17, is part of Brazil's efforts to regain access to the U.S. market after a ban imposed in June. The U.S. claimed shipments failed sanitary inspections. The minister confirmed Brazilian officials will start the mission to discuss the ban in the United States on July 13. The Brazilian government is conducting an investigation into vaccines used against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) after they were linked to abscesses on carcasses. Brazil, the world's largest beef exporter, is the only FMD-free country, with vaccination, which is authorized to sell to the United States.  The abscesses on carcasses, which Brazilian ranchers blame on the government mandating that they inject cattle with vaccines, may also be linked to certain substances in the vaccines.

She reached the last 16 on Friday with a determined 6-4 7-6(7) victory over experienced campaigner Peng Shuai out on Court Two at the southern boundary of the All England Club. The win kept the 25-year-old Romanian on course for the number one spot in the rankings and put some order back in the women's draw after recent upsets, but it was all done under the radar - no fuss.  It's open always when I go on court. Anyone can win the match from both of us. So I'm just trying to stay focused, to do my job as good as I can, and just trying to win,  she said.  Even her post-match news conference was almost as much about her next opponent Victoria Azarenka and the Belarussian's comeback after having a baby as about her own progress, though she could become the world's top player if she reaches the semi-finals here. She made the final of the French Open for the second time only last month, going a set and 3-0 up before losing to Jelena Ostapenko, but says, with cheerful briskness, that she has put the disappointment behind her.  I was sad, of course. But I was realistic after the match. I saw what I've done less good and what I've done good,  she said. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 7, 2017   Romania’s Simona Halep shakes hands with China’s Shuai Peng after winning their third round matchTony O'Brien That upset from the final cannot bring me down.  On Friday, Halep wore down her 31-year-old opponent with heavy groundstrokes from the baseline, clipping the lines with her penetrating forehands. But it was not an easy ride. Peng, ranked 37 and no slouch on grass after winning the doubles title here in 2013, broke back to force the tiebreak when Halep looked to be cruising home in the second set. The pair slugged it out until Halep served an ace for a second match point and Peng sent a ball long to concede the match. Slideshow (2 Images)Halep, brought up playing on clay rather than grass, said she had one or two nervous moments when she slipped in the baked dust on the baseline but - again taking the positives - said her legs felt strong and she was running well, so  I have no problems .   It's normal and the conditions are the same for everyone,  she said, refusing to get involved in criticisms from some of her fellow competitors, who said the courts were dangerous. Third seed Karolina Pliskova and 12th seed Kristina Mladenovic lost on Thursday, opening up the women's competition, that was already missing seven times champion Serena Williams.   And Azarenka, a former world number one, has a 2-1 advantage over Halep in head-to-heads.  Every ball, it matters when I play against her. So I have just to be ready, to be fit, to be 100 percent, to go there and believe that I have my chance,  Halep said.

The FTC, which shares the work of antitrust enforcement with the Justice Department and pursues companies accused of deceptive advertising, is currently headed by acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who was named on Jan. 25. Even without a permanent chair and missing key staff, in the past month, the FTC has forced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) to scrap a plan to buy Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), sued to stop daily fantasy sports companies DraftKings and FanDuel from merging and filed a complaint aimed at stopping a North Dakota hospital system from buying clinics. The Trump administration has not named a permanent chair. For the past several weeks, Ohlhausen, a Republican, has been the leading candidate, according to a person familiar with her candidacy. Also under consideration are Joe Simons of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, according to the trade publication MLEX; and Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, according to a source close to the situation. Both Ohlhausen and Simons would be traditional Republican enforcers, meaning that few enforcement decisions would change and the pro-business approach with a slant toward approving big mergers would likely continue. That said, as a commissioner, Ohlhausen dissented on an FTC decision to sue Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) for allegedly using its market power to maintain a monopoly on key semiconductors. Depending on who is named to the agency, this lawsuit could potentially be dropped. Google's critics in Silicon Valley tend to support Reyes, who has little background in antitrust issues, since he and the District of Columbia attorney general wrote a letter in 2016 urging the FTC to consider re-opening a probe of Google (GOOGL.O) that the agency had closed in early 2013. The wide-ranging probe had touched on everything from search bias to Google's practice of scraping third-party content for its sites to the licensing of standard essential patents. Because Ohlhausen is only acting as FTC head, she cannot hire a permanent head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition or fill other key posts.  The chair sets the priorities. It's important to have that person in to set the direction and pursue initiatives,  said Deborah Garza, who served in the Bush administration and is at the law firm Covington and Burling LLP.  Nominations for the FTC will come sometime this summer because potential nominees are in the process of being cleared, according to a White House official, asked about the delay.  The Trump administration has identified who the individuals will be for certain positions,  said the official, who asked not to be identified. Lots of Empty Offices Beyond lacking a permanent chair, the agency is thin at the top. Rather than four commissioners working with Ohlhausen, she has just one, Democrat Terrell McSweeny. This means that Trump may name two Republicans but the third person must be a Democrat or independent since by law no more than three commissioners can be from the same political party.  Leading candidates for the two Republican seats are Bilal Sayyed of the law firm McDermott Will & Emery and Noah Phillips, an aide to Senator John Cornyn, according to the person familiar with the nomination process. For the open Democratic commission seat, Senator Chuck Schumer has backed consumer advocate Rohit Chopra but the White House has also spoken with others, including agriculture expert Lillian Salerno. The agency has plenty of work on its plate including the merger of Linde (LING.DE) and Praxair (PX.N), which would create a $73 billion global industrial gases leader in a highly consolidated market. A second is Canada's Potash Corp's (POT.TO) purchase of Agrium Inc (AGU.TO) in the consolidated fertilizer sector.  The president has his hands full with a lot of different issues. The FTC is a major fill for any administration, and he needs to get to that,  said Carl Hittinger, an antitrust expert with the law firm Baker and Hostetler LLP. Once a commissioner is named to the independent FTC the president has no say in what decisions are made, so commissioners must be chosen carefully, added Hittinger.

Team manager Beat Zehnder, who oversees day-to-day operations at the track, told reporters at the Austrian Grand Prix on Friday that he did not know when a decision would be made but in the meantime it was business as usual.  As soon as we have something to announce, we will. We have to be realistic. It's only two weeks since Monisha was not with us anymore. Still, everything is under control,  he said.  It's not a big deal for the moment, really. There is not an immediate decision that has to be taken.

The four - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain - said in a joint statement late on Thursday that Doha's refusal to accept their demands to end the diplomatic standoff was proof of its links to terrorist groups.   In their statement, the four said the initial list of 13 demands they had put to Qatar was now void and they pledged further political, economic and legal steps against the emirate. In its first reaction to the statement from the four, Qatar dismissed as  baseless  the renewed accusations that it was interfering in the affairs of other states and financing terrorism.  The State of Qatar's position on terrorism is consistent and known for its rejection and condemnation of all forms of terrorism, whatever the causes and motives,  the state news agency said, quoting a senior foreign ministry source. Qatar was ready to  cooperate and review all claims that do not contradict the sovereignty of the State of Qatar,  it added. Britain's foreign minister, Boris Johnson, meanwhile arrived in Saudi Arabia and was to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in a bid to ease tension in what has become the Gulf's deepest rift in years. Johnson will also travel to Qatar and Kuwait for talks with senior figures from both countries, Britain's foreign office said in a statement in London. It did not give a specific date. It said Johnson would urge all parties to support Kuwait's mediation efforts and  work towards de-escalation and Gulf unity for the sake of regional stability.   U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will travel to Kuwait on Monday on a similar mission. The four Arab states have cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, which they also accuse of allying with their regional arch-foe Iran. Doha denies that accusation too. Their original 13 demands presented to Qatar included shutting down the pan-Arab al-Jazeera TV channel and closing a Turkish military base in Doha. Qatari officials have repeatedly said the 13 demands are so strict that they suspect the four countries never seriously intended to negotiate them, and were instead aimed at hobbling Doha's sovereignty. At the same time, they say Qatar is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to 'any legitimate issues' of concern to fellow member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In their statement, the four Arab states said any additional measures would be aimed at the Qatari government and not its people. It did not say when the new steps would be announced or what they would entail. Foreign ministers from the four states convened in Cairo on Wednesday after the expiry of a 10-day deadline for their demands to be met. They condemned the tiny Gulf nation's response as  negative  and lacking in content.

Bryant Evans,John Praveen,Kim Forrest,Peter Tuz,NASDAQ Composite,USA,STOCKS/WEEKAHEAD (SCHEDULED COLUMN),Performance / Results / Earnings,Americas,Major News,Equities Markets,Corporate Events,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Technology shares surrendered their leadership in the U.S. stock market over the past month, but the fast-growing group may soon resume its outperformance and maneuver back into pole position. Upcoming earnings reports for the technology sector , whose profits are expected to outpace the overall S&P; 500 for the 11th consecutive quarter, could lure back investors who have been concerned about expensive valuations and that too many people may have piled into the big names. The sector has slumped 4 percent since the first week of June, while financials have climbed more than 5 percent and healthcare has gained 3 percent. This has prompted speculation that investors may have been cashing out their tech profits to move into those groups.  Technology has taken a rest, but it’s going to heat up again, and I see tech returning to favor the second half of the year,  said portfolio manager J. Bryant Evans of Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois. For the first five months of 2017, tech was the talk of the stock market, far outperforming the other 10 major S&P; 500 sectors and sparking the Nasdaq Composite to its strongest first half since 2009.  I think of (tech's recent swoon) as profit-taking rather than driven by change in the fundamental factors,  said John Praveen, managing director of Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey.  The fundamentals are still positive for the sector.  Analysts estimate tech's second-quarter earnings rose 11.2 percent, with semiconductor companies accounting for much of the gain, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The increase tops the estimated 7.9 percent rise for the overall S&P; 500 and is well above every sector except for energy, whose performance will be skewed because of negative year-earlier results.  The tech sector has the highest growth expectations and only moderate uncertainty,  Morgan Stanley equity strategists said in a research note. Given tech's outsized position - 22 percent of the market value of the S&P; 500 - the sector's growth is critical to overall U.S. corporate profit gains. For the second quarter, tech profit growth alone is expected to account for nearly 28 percent of the S&P; 500's overall increase in earnings, or nearly half if energy were excluded.  In an economy that still seems to have some growing pains, consistent growth is worth paying up for,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Tech's second-quarter revenue growth is projected at 7.2 percent, faster than 4.6 percent for S&P; 500 companies overall, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. There is  growth on the top line, which is more important at this point in the cycle, than in the bottom line only,  said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. This earnings season, she will focus on companies' comments about sales activity. Valuations for the sector also may not be so expensive. Tech is trading at 18.1 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, just above 17.8 times for the overall market. That difference is even smaller when compared with the premium tech has held over the past 15 years, following the dot-com bubble. Over that time, its average P/E has been 17.2 times versus 14.7 times for the S&P; 500. Another factor in tech's favor: The dollar's 6.1 percent decline this year against a basket of major currencies. S&P; 500 tech companies generate 60 percent of revenue from outside the United States, compared with 40 percent for companies in the entire index. A stronger dollar makes foreign sales less valuable when they are translated back into the U.S. currency for reporting purposes. Despite these positive factors, other sectors may end up besting tech. Healthcare's year-to-date performance has nearly kept pace, and a resolution of the legislation moving through Congress could draw investors who have been wary about political uncertainty hovering over the sector. A pickup in the economy and inflation could favor groups like industrials, energy and financials, which tend to perform better in such times. Clues will come starting on July 14, when a big batch of bank reports kicks off the heart of the earnings season. In tech, Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp report the following week, while Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp are among the companies that will follow later in the month.

Underscoring U.S. concerns about a crisis involving key allies in the Middle East, the department said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to visit Kuwait, which is mediating in the dispute, on Monday. In the latest top-level U.S. contact with officials of the countries involved in the dispute, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis discussed the importance of easing tensions in a phone call with Qatari Minister of State for Defense Affairs Khalid al-Attiyah on Thursday. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain broke diplomatic relations with Qatar last month and launched a drive to boycott the gas-producing state, which they accuse of supporting terrorism and allying with regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the charges and has accused the four countries of  clear aggression.   We remain very concerned about that ongoing situation between Qatar and GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing.  We've become increasingly concerned that dispute is at an impasse at this point. We believe that this could potentially drag on for weeks. It could drag on for months. It could possibly even intensify,  she said. Mattis discussed the state of relations among Gulf Arab states and  the importance of de-escalating tensions  in his call with Attiyah, the Pentagon said in a statement. The two officials  affirmed the strategic security partnership  of their countries and Mattis emphasized the importance of Qatar's contributions to the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, it added. Qatar hosts the largest U.S. Air Force base in the region. Saudi Arabia has been a close U.S. ally for decades, and U.S. President Donald Trump sealed a $110 billion arms deal with the kingdom during a visit in May. The rift opened days after Trump met Arab leaders in Riyadh in May and called for unity against Iran and hardline Islamist militant groups. Trump discussed the crisis in phone calls with leaders of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, on Sunday, reiterating the importance of  stopping terrorist financing and discrediting extremist ideology,  according to the White House.

Rwanda has the most women in parliament of anywhere in the world - nearly two-thirds of lawmakers are female - but a woman has never been president.  According to the final list, President Paul Kagame will run for a third term on Aug. 4 against Frank Habineza, nominated by the opposition Democratic Green Party, and Philippe Mpayimana. Diane Shima Rwigara, a 35-year-old accountant, was one of three candidates left off the list, and the only woman. Kagame is widely admired for restoring stability after Rwanda's 1994 genocide, presiding over rapid economic growth and a relatively corruption-free government. But activists say that came at the expense of civil liberties and media freedoms. Some of Kagame's political opponents were killed after they fled abroad, in cases that remain unsolved. The government denies any involvement.  Rwigara's father died in a car accident in 2015 that her family maintains was politically motivated. She has spoken out against what she describes as repression by the government.  The commission said she only submitted 572 valid signatures, below the required 600. She says she submitted 985 signatures, and an additional 120 after many were disqualified.     Kalisa Mbanda, the president of the National Election Commission, told Reuters on Friday  among the signature of her supporters, there are some who are dead.  After the first batch of signatures was rejected this week, Michael Ryan, the European Union representative in Rwanda, tweeted a picture of himself with Rwigara and  important 4 credibility @RwandaElections to quickly clarify why so many signatures rejected , prompting a public rebuke from Kagame on national television for meddling.  Constitutional changes, which technically allow Kagame to stay until 2034, were approved in a 2015 referendum by a 98 percent majority that the opposition and Western diplomats said was suspiciously high.

What I did was I look at this as a business innovation as much as a technical innovation and thought: 'if 70 percent of the cost of production is coming from the raw materials – why not tackle that end of it?'  he told Reuters by telephone on Friday. Tangney showed the new fuel's efficiency by driving a rental car filled with the mixture around the university's car park this week. Bourbon whiskey barrels in St. Philip, Barbados December 2, 2016. Picture taken December 2, 2016.Adrees LatifTangney said that Celtic would get inexpensive or free raw materials from the distillery it works with, who were keen to cut the 300,000 pounds ($386,370.00) a year it costs to dispose of the whisky waste residues. Biobutanol also has an advantage over other biofuels. More of it can be included in consumer petrol - as much as 15 percent - without requiring engine modifications. With the assistance of 9 million pounds of funding support from the Scottish government and other investors, the company plans to open a factory in 2018 that can produce 500,000 liters of the fuel annually.  With the raw material available throughout Scotland, Tangney estimates it could eventually produce 50 million liters of biofuel each year.  The whisky industry will now have a sustainable and reliable way of disposing of their residue , Tangney said.  Plus we’ll create a brand new industry out of something that has no value whatsoever.

The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is taking a second stab at the Texas electricity provider and its parent company, Energy Future, six years after a $2 billion investment led to hefty losses. Two other suitors previously failed to reach accord with regulators, however. Creditors, too, may require some sweet talk. Back when it was known as TXU, the company became the apex of leveraged-buyout excess and Buffett got swept up in it. After KKR, TPG and a Goldman Sachs fund bought TXU for $44 billion, Berkshire Hathaway put money into the debt. Even before already-low natural-gas prices went lower and sent TXU spiraling into bankruptcy, Buffett told his shareholders he wished he'd never heard of Energy Future. Berkshire lost nearly $900 million, pre-tax, on the deal. The utility, Oncor, became the coveted piece of the operation after Energy Future sought protection from creditors in 2014. Hunt Consolidated bid for it a year later and endured an arduous regulatory process, only to walk away after it couldn’t agree on a structure with the Lone Star State. NextEra Energy came around last year and encountered similar troubles, mainly because regulators wanted extra safeguards the Florida company was unwilling to implement. In both proposals, cash payouts were a sticking point. In that way, Buffett's deal is notably different. Berkshire Hathaway Energy doesn't pay dividends, and explicitly boasts about reinvesting cash in the business. It also appears to be buying all of Energy Future for an enterprise value of about $18 billion rather than just the transmission group. This should provide a seamless way to exit bankruptcy without breaking it up. The Texas Public Utility Commission's statement on Friday struck a positive tone. Complications remain, though. For one, Berkshire Hathaway is paying $9 billion in cash while the equity value of Oncor alone is $11.3 billion, according to the company's otherwise sparse press release. The process also requires approval from the bankruptcy court where creditors including pushy hedge fund Elliott Management have a say. And regulators could spend as long as six months running over the fine print. With so many constituencies to appease and the history of collapsed offers for Oncor, Buffett will have to call on all his negotiating savvy and homespun wisdom to pull this one off.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Philip Hammond welcomed corporate input into the discussion on managing Brexit, a day after the CBI employers group said Britain should stay in the EU's single market as it works out new ties with the bloc after Brexit in 2019.  I'm glad that the business community is exercising a voice in this discussion. I think that is helpful,  he said, adding:  I do not believe it is either legally or politically possible to say in the customs union and in the single market. .  Hammond, speaking on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Hamburg, said his preference was for Britain to negotiate a  transitional structure  that takes it out of the single market and customs union  but in the transition phase replicates as much as possible of the existing arrangements . The aim would be to minimize the shock to business. Britain could negotiate new trade agreements with countries outside the EU, but this would involve implementation periods over time. In the near term, London needed to work out a transitional deal with the EU.  To people who are looking to us to protect jobs, economic growth, living standards, they won't thank us if we deliver them an instant hit with only a longer term, slowly building benefit to compensate for it,  Hammond said. British employers have started to push harder for a Brexit deal that causes as little disruption as possible after voters failed to back Prime Minister Theresa May's tough approach to divorce negotiations with the EU in an election last month. The result, which cost May her majority in parliament, has reopened the debate about how Britain should leave the EU. Hammond called for an agreement with the EU that  keeps trade flowing in both directions across the UK-EU border but at the same time allows us as much leeway as we can get to open up new markets for UK goods and services . In the long term, he said Britain wanted an agreement that is  very business friendly ... giving as full as possible reciprocal access to markets and as frictionless a border for our goods traffic as we possibly can achieve . Asked if there was any chance of Britain not going through with Brexit, Hammond replied:  No, I think the British people have made up their minds.  The EU was on a long-term path to deeper political integration and the British people were not comfortable with that idea, he said, pointing to Britain's relationship with the United States as a possible model for future ties with the EU.  We're not in a political union with them,  he said of the United States.  Yet we have the closest possible partnership and collaboration and I hope in future we will a similarly easy and comfortable relationship with our European Union neighbors.

Aside from Mosul, across the border in Syria a battle is raging to dislodge IS from Raqqa, the second capital of its self-declared caliphate. Fighting will push down the Euphrates  valley to Deir al-Zour, the jihadis’ last big urban stronghold. But the fall of Mosul also exposes ethnic and sectarian fractures that have plagued Iraq for more than a decade. The victory risks triggering new violence between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories or between Sunnis and Shi’ites over claims to power, egged on by outside powers that have shaped Iraq’s future since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein’s Sunni minority-rule and brought the Iran-backed Shi’ite majority to power. For Iraq, stunned by the blitz on Mosul by Islamic State in 2014 and the collapse of its army, victory could thus turn out to be as big a problem as defeat. The federal model devised under the Anglo-American occupation and built on a power-sharing agreement between Sunnis, Shi’ites and Kurds collapsed into ethno-sectarian carnage spawned by the al Qaeda precursors of Islamic State. In the three years since the jihadis swept across the border from Syria where they had regrouped in the chaos of the rebellion against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s rule, IS was the rallying point uniting a fractured Iraq. But now that the group faces military defeat, the unity that held Iraq together is starting to come apart. No Post-Battle Plan One challenge is the future of Mosul itself, a city traumatized by Islamic State's brutal rule and shattered by the latest U.S.-backed offensive, with thousands dead and nearly one million people displaced. Western, Iraqi and Kurdish officials say they are astonished that Iraqi authorities neglected to prepare a post-battle plan for governance and security. A high-level committee formed by the Kurdish region, the Baghdad government and a U.S.-led military coalition to help Mosul leaders rebuild the city had never convened, they said.  Prime Minister (Haider) al-Abadi kept dragging his heels. Every time we raised this issue with him, he said, 'Let’s wait until military operations are over',  said Hoshyar Zebari, an internationally respected former finance and foreign minister.  A whole city is being decimated. Look how much the government is contributing, as if they don’t care.  The first indication of possible future conflict came when Masoud Barzani, president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, announced a Sept. 25 referendum for an independent state. Another omen was a push by Iran-backed Shi'ite militias, grouped under the government-run Hashid Shaabi, to deploy alongside Kurdish areas and advance towards the Syrian border, motivated by Iran's desire to join Iraq and Syria and establish a corridor from Tehran to Beirut.  Today the highway of resistance starts in Tehran and reaches Mosul, Damascus and Beirut,  Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader, said last week. Jihadi Fighters All this comes against a backdrop of simmering rivalries between regional powers Iran and Turkey, and above all declining U.S. influence and Iran’s vigorous attempts to consolidate its control in Iraq. While the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump regards Syria and Iraq purely in terms of the military campaign to destroy IS, local jihadi fighters will simply melt back into the population, and could regroup in a new insurgency. Armed Emergency Response Division members watch during fighting between Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 7, 2017.Ahmed SaadSunni and Kurdish leaders in and around Mosul largely agree with this grim prognosis, alarmed that Abadi has refused even to discuss the future governance of Mosul, and suspecting that Iran is calling the shots. The disputed territories stretch along an ethnically mixed ribbon of land dividing the autonomous Kurdish area in the north of Iraq from the Arab-majority part in the south - more a minefield than a mosaic - at a time when both the Kurds and Sunni Arabs are giving up on Shi’ite rule in Baghdad. Atheel al-Nujaifi, who was Nineveh governor when the provincial capital Mosul was captured in 2014, says: “We are back to where we were before Mosul fell, (because) there is an idea among the hardline Shi’ite leadership to keep the liberated areas as loose areas, with no (local) political leadership, or security organizations, so they can control them”. Moderate Shi’ite leaders, among whom he counts Abadi, are wary of a winner-take-all logic of victory, fearing this “could lead to the creation of radicalism again and they know this would destroy not only Iraq but the Shi’ites”.  The problem, he believes, is that Iraqi Shi’ism is badly fractured, helping Iran control almost all its factions. The former governor, a Sunni who now has at his command an armed force trained by Turkey, says he is bowing out of office but not politics. He acknowledges there is a lack of mainstream Sunni leaders, but blames Baghdad for making sure none emerges. Slideshow (2 Images)Whither the Sunnis? Talk of Kurdish secession has sparked discussion of whether Sunni Arabs should set up a separate state, though most officials say this is not practical, because: Sunni territory lacks the oil base the Shi’ites and Kurds have; the experience of Islamic State would hover like a specter over any new entity; and Sunnis are too intermingled across Iraq. Some Sunni and Kurdish leaders believe one solution is to make Mosul a self-governing region like Kurdistan, with smaller units of self-rule to accommodate the plethora of minorities, which they say is permitted by the constitution. “Before, the Sunnis were very sensitive to believing (devolution) would lead to secession, to the breakup of Iraq but now they’re coming to terms with it,” says Zebari. The Sunnis are not the only ones who repudiate Baghdad's Shi’ite-dominated government. The northern Kurdish region has called a referendum to move from autonomous self-rule to an independent state. Kurdish leader Barzani told Reuters timing for independence after the vote was “flexible but not open-ended”. Yet there is growing concern the real purpose of the referendum is not immediate secession, but to strengthen Kurdish claims over the disputed territories, such as the oil-rich region and city of Kirkuk, whose future has been in play for over a decade.  We Lost Hope and Faith  Zebari, a senior official in Barzani’s Kurdish Democratic Party who devoted over a decade in Baghdad trying to make power-sharing work, said the time was ripe for independence.   “We lost hope and faith in the new Iraq that we had built. The government has failed us on each and every constitutional provision and article to establish a new country with equal citizenship, with no discrimination, with partnership. All those dreams have evaporated,” he told Reuters. The problem, he says, is that senior Iranian officials have left no doubt their priority – a corridor for Shi’ite forces carved through the north and policed by Shi'ite recruits – trumps everything else.  They are breathing down our neck all along the Kurdish frontline from Sinjar to Khanaqin,  he said.  So far we have been accommodating, patient, coordinating to prevent skirmishes or flashes but this is building up.

If the all-cash purchase wins approval from federal and state regulators and a bankruptcy judge, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit will assume control of one of the largest U.S. electricity transmission companies.  Buffett views infrastructure bets as a good long-term investment,  said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California, which invests $300 million of the $1.4 billion it oversees in Berkshire.  With the relatively limited opportunities available to a company of Berkshire's size, investments such as Oncor that are likely to yield 8 to 10 percent annually are acceptable,  Check added. The acquisition also highlights the growing prominence of Greg Abel, 55, Berkshire Hathaway Energy's chief executive. Investors consider him a top candidate to succeed Buffett, 86, at the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent company's helm. Abel and other Berkshire Hathaway Energy executives were not available on Friday for interviews. Buffett's office did not respond to separate interview requests. 'Recession Resistant' Dallas-based Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines. It is 80 percent owned by Energy Future Holdings Corp, the company Berkshire has agreed to buy out of bankruptcy. Oncor posted $431 million of profit in 2016, and similar sums in the prior three years. Buffett values such consistency, telling Berkshire shareholders in February that utilities generate  recession-resistant  earnings because they offer an  essential service  that generates  remarkably steady  demand. Meanwhile, Abel said in a statement the companies  share a common goal of providing exceptional customer service and a commitment to invest in critical infrastructure.  Abel has also been deepening his commitment to renewable energy, including wind, generating tax credits that bolster Berkshire's balance sheet. His unit also owns HomeServices of America, a big residential real estate brokerage. Berkshire Hathaway Energy typically generates nearly 10 percent of its parent's profit, contributing $2.29 billion to an overall $24.07 billion in 2016.  Buffett has always had a lot of confidence in Greg Abel, and wouldn't mind putting a nearly unlimited number of businesses under his watch,  Check said. Texas Regulator The Oncor purchase requires approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), which in 2016 and 2017 scuttled takeover bids by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc and NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N). Regulators had asked for Oncor to be  ringfenced  so it would not assume excess debt from any acquirer, and also not pay out too much cash as dividends. Unlike NextEra,  Berkshire might be more willing to leave the ringfence in place and allow restriction on dividends, making the approval process  a little less cumbersome,  Cowen & Co analyst Amer Tiwana wrote in a research report. The PUCT is required by law to rule on Berkshire's bid within six months of receiving an application. A spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire's prospects. But Buffett wrote last year that regulators like Berkshire Hathaway Energy because it operates safely and efficiently and has  unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense,  without the need to pay dividends to its parent.  Berkshire expects to complete the Oncor purchase in the fourth quarter. It said the transaction implies an equity value of about $11.25 billion for Oncor. Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm representing Energy Future, said the transaction's enterprise value was about $18.1 billion. Energy Future was created from the $45 billion leveraged buyout in 2007 of the former TXU Corp by KKR & Co, TPG Capital Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity arm. The buyout was a bet that natural gas prices would rise, allowing for higher electricity prices. Natural gas prices plunged instead, and Energy Future went bankrupt in 2014. Undoing an 'Unforced Error' Buffett had invested with Energy Future a decade ago, buying $2 billion of high-yield bonds. But he threw in the towel six years later, with an $873 million pre-tax loss. He has called that investment  a major unforced error.  Buffett entered the energy sector in 2000 when he led a group that bought Des Moines, Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, later renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy. He has since expanded in the central and western United States, such as with the Oregon-based PacifiCorp and Nevada-based NV Energy utilities. Berkshire has also forayed outside the United States, now owning the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, Canada and Northern Powergrid in Newcastle upon Tyne in England. Such bets have enabled Buffett to diversify Berkshire away from its traditional focus on insurance and stock-picking. Berkshire now owns more than 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Lubrizol chemicals and Dairy Queen ice cream. Assuming the Oncor transaction closes, Oncor CEO Bob Shapard would become executive chairman and be replaced by general counsel Allen Nye, under a previously announced plan.

Atheel al-Nujaifi, who was Nineveh governor when the provincial capital Mosul was captured in 2014, says: “We are back to where we were before Mosul fell, (because) there is an idea among the hardline Shi’ite leadership to keep the liberated areas as loose areas, with no (local) political leadership, or security organizations, so they can control them”. Moderate Shi’ite leaders, among whom he counts Abadi, are wary of a winner-take-all logic of victory, fearing this “could lead to the creation of radicalism again and they know this would destroy not only Iraq but the Shi’ites”.  The problem, he believes, is that Iraqi Shi’ism is badly fractured, helping Iran control almost all its factions. The former governor, a Sunni who now has at his command an armed force trained by Turkey, says he is bowing out of office but not politics. He acknowledges there is a lack of mainstream Sunni leaders, but blames Baghdad for making sure none emerges. Slideshow (2 Images)Whither the Sunnis? Talk of Kurdish secession has sparked discussion of whether Sunni Arabs should set up a separate state, though most officials say this is not practical, because: Sunni territory lacks the oil base the Shi’ites and Kurds have; the experience of Islamic State would hover like a specter over any new entity; and Sunnis are too intermingled across Iraq. Some Sunni and Kurdish leaders believe one solution is to make Mosul a self-governing region like Kurdistan, with smaller units of self-rule to accommodate the plethora of minorities, which they say is permitted by the constitution. “Before, the Sunnis were very sensitive to believing (devolution) would lead to secession, to the breakup of Iraq but now they’re coming to terms with it,” says Zebari. The Sunnis are not the only ones who repudiate Baghdad's Shi’ite-dominated government. The northern Kurdish region has called a referendum to move from autonomous self-rule to an independent state. Kurdish leader Barzani told Reuters timing for independence after the vote was “flexible but not open-ended”. Yet there is growing concern the real purpose of the referendum is not immediate secession, but to strengthen Kurdish claims over the disputed territories, such as the oil-rich region and city of Kirkuk, whose future has been in play for over a decade.  We Lost Hope and Faith  Zebari, a senior official in Barzani’s Kurdish Democratic Party who devoted over a decade in Baghdad trying to make power-sharing work, said the time was ripe for independence.   “We lost hope and faith in the new Iraq that we had built. The government has failed us on each and every constitutional provision and article to establish a new country with equal citizenship, with no discrimination, with partnership. All those dreams have evaporated,” he told Reuters. The problem, he says, is that senior Iranian officials have left no doubt their priority – a corridor for Shi’ite forces carved through the north and policed by Shi'ite recruits – trumps everything else.  They are breathing down our neck all along the Kurdish frontline from Sinjar to Khanaqin,  he said.  So far we have been accommodating, patient, coordinating to prevent skirmishes or flashes but this is building up.

If the all-cash purchase wins approval from federal and state regulators and a bankruptcy judge, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit will assume control of one of the largest U.S. electricity transmission companies.  Buffett views infrastructure bets as a good long-term investment,  said Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management Inc in Costa Mesa, California, which invests $300 million of the $1.4 billion it oversees in Berkshire.  With the relatively limited opportunities available to a company of Berkshire's size, investments such as Oncor that are likely to yield 8 to 10 percent annually are acceptable,  Check added. The acquisition also highlights the growing prominence of Greg Abel, 55, Berkshire Hathaway Energy's chief executive. Investors consider him a top candidate to succeed Buffett, 86, at the Omaha, Nebraska-based parent company's helm. Abel and other Berkshire Hathaway Energy executives were not available on Friday for interviews. Buffett's office did not respond to separate interview requests. 'Recession Resistant' Dallas-based Oncor delivers power to more than 3.4 million homes and businesses through roughly 122,000 miles (196,000 km) of transmission and distribution lines. It is 80 percent owned by Energy Future Holdings Corp, the company Berkshire has agreed to buy out of bankruptcy. Oncor posted $431 million of profit in 2016, and similar sums in the prior three years. Buffett values such consistency, telling Berkshire shareholders in February that utilities generate  recession-resistant  earnings because they offer an  essential service  that generates  remarkably steady  demand. Meanwhile, Abel said in a statement the companies  share a common goal of providing exceptional customer service and a commitment to invest in critical infrastructure.  Abel has also been deepening his commitment to renewable energy, including wind, generating tax credits that bolster Berkshire's balance sheet. His unit also owns HomeServices of America, a big residential real estate brokerage. Berkshire Hathaway Energy typically generates nearly 10 percent of its parent's profit, contributing $2.29 billion to an overall $24.07 billion in 2016.  Buffett has always had a lot of confidence in Greg Abel, and wouldn't mind putting a nearly unlimited number of businesses under his watch,  Check said. Texas Regulator The Oncor purchase requires approval by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), which in 2016 and 2017 scuttled takeover bids by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc and NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N). Regulators had asked for Oncor to be  ringfenced  so it would not assume excess debt from any acquirer, and also not pay out too much cash as dividends. Unlike NextEra,  Berkshire might be more willing to leave the ringfence in place and allow restriction on dividends, making the approval process  a little less cumbersome,  Cowen & Co analyst Amer Tiwana wrote in a research report. The PUCT is required by law to rule on Berkshire's bid within six months of receiving an application. A spokesman declined to comment on Berkshire's prospects. But Buffett wrote last year that regulators like Berkshire Hathaway Energy because it operates safely and efficiently and has  unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense,  without the need to pay dividends to its parent.  Berkshire expects to complete the Oncor purchase in the fourth quarter. It said the transaction implies an equity value of about $11.25 billion for Oncor. Kirkland & Ellis, a law firm representing Energy Future, said the transaction's enterprise value was about $18.1 billion. Energy Future was created from the $45 billion leveraged buyout in 2007 of the former TXU Corp by KKR & Co, TPG Capital Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity arm. The buyout was a bet that natural gas prices would rise, allowing for higher electricity prices. Natural gas prices plunged instead, and Energy Future went bankrupt in 2014. Undoing an 'Unforced Error' Buffett had invested with Energy Future a decade ago, buying $2 billion of high-yield bonds. But he threw in the towel six years later, with an $873 million pre-tax loss. He has called that investment  a major unforced error.  Buffett entered the energy sector in 2000 when he led a group that bought Des Moines, Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co, later renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy. He has since expanded in the central and western United States, such as with the Oregon-based PacifiCorp and Nevada-based NV Energy utilities. Berkshire has also forayed outside the United States, now owning the AltaLink electricity transmission company in Alberta, Canada and Northern Powergrid in Newcastle upon Tyne in England. Such bets have enabled Buffett to diversify Berkshire away from its traditional focus on insurance and stock-picking. Berkshire now owns more than 90 businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, Lubrizol chemicals and Dairy Queen ice cream. Assuming the Oncor transaction closes, Oncor CEO Bob Shapard would become executive chairman and be replaced by general counsel Allen Nye, under a previously announced plan.

With stock markets near record levels, and interest rates and credit conditions still loose, the report gave detailed attention to whether the financial system and bond markets posed any particular threat to the country's eight-year economic expansion.  The answer so far is no, said the Fed, noting that there is little evidence of a liquidity crunch in the corporate or other bond markets, and no evidence that rising asset values pose a problem. The structure of the corporate bond market is changing with new regulations, the Fed said, but by traditional measures shows only minimal strain in adapting. Related CoverageAnalyst View: Fed sees steady economy, only 'moderate' financial vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system remained, on balance, moderate,  concluded the report, submitted to Congress on behalf of the Fed's Washington-based Board of Governors.  Valuation pressures across a range of assets and several indicators of investor risk appetite have increased further...However, these developments in asset markets have not been accompanied by increased leverage.  The combination of rising asset values and rising leverage is considered particularly toxic, indicating that investments are being made with borrowed money and leaving investors unable to repay those debts if the value of the underlying assets decline. U.S. Treasury yields rose after the report, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note near a more than eight-week high. U.S. stocks edged higher. The release of the report on Friday comes ahead of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's appearance next Wednesday and Thursday before the House and Senate committees that oversee the central bank and related issues. The roughly 60-page document is largely a review of economic and policy developments since the last report, in February. In this instance the document took on a steady-as-she-goes quality. Growth in the first quarter was slow at about 1-1/2  percent on an annualized basis, and inflation took a step backward. But consumer confidence remained strong, and  business investment has turned up....The housing market continues its gradual recovery. Economic growth has also been supported by recent strength in foreign activity.   The government on Friday said non-farm payrolls surged by 222,000 in June and workers put in more hours but average hourly earnings grew a modest 0.2 percent. [L1N1JX1IB]            Along with the discussion of financial conditions, however, the Fed did highlight some long-term problems. The central bank noted that weak productivity growth may become entrenched as a  new normal,  and could be one reason wage growth remains weak.  It also noted the continued gap in unemployment rates between whites and blacks and Hispanics.

Key points With stock markets near record levels, and interest rates and credit conditions still loose, the report gave detailed attention to whether the financial system and bond markets posed any particular threat to the country's eight-year economic expansion.  JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT THE LEUTHOLD GROUP IN MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA: “I don’t see anything different from what the Fed has been saying already. The economy continues to be okay. It’s not overheating  or under-heating. The implicit message is that we are on track to raise interest rates and to shrink the balance sheet, not because the economy is overheating but we want to normalize monetary policy.” “It is their jobs to cite risks in the economy and markets. To me when they say ‘moderate’ vulnerabilities in the financial system, it’s a benign statement. If they are alarmed, they would be more aggressive language like ‘elevated.’ They are recognizing the pickup in subprime credit card and auto loan delinquencies which they probably heard from the private sector.” BRUCE MCCAIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT KEY PRIVATE BANK IN CLEVELAND, OHIO: “My general sense is a little bit of a defensive tone with respect to particularly the lower inflation numbers and the weaker compensation gains. Particularly the section on talking about the rules-based decision-making, the fact that there a lot of complicated inputs and to paraphrase can’t be totally restrained by rules-based framework, suggests that they still are firmly of the mind that they need to normalize policy and intend to continue with steps that way not only on the balance sheet, but also likely more interest rate hikes unless they get some clear indications that the wheels are falling off the economy.” “The one thing that stuck out to me was, too, the section that really focused on some of the portions of the labor force ... that have not changed significantly relative to what we saw before the last recession, it seems like they are de-emphasizing their role as chief employment officers in favor of some of the more monetary goals that are on their plate.   They mentioned that the VIX is at historically low levels. One would think that they might be somewhat concerned about the complacency in the markets given that valuations have risen, but you don’t get that tone from what they are saying.”  The general tone of the overall report was that: 'We think it’s time to normalize, we intend to do so, here are some of the reasons for it and here are some of the defenses against our critics.'  JASON WARE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ALBION FINANCIAL GROUP, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH: “They did mention early on in the summary that inflation has softened in the past few months. They put that up pretty front and center in the summary.  “They still find themselves in this frustrating conundrum that inflation isn’t rising despite it seeming that the labor market is near full employment, and without material inflation how much can they ratchet up the Fed Funds rate. That's probably a dovish tilt in the report and probably suggests they may pause in continuing to hike rates in the foreseeable future, maybe the next six months.   I think some of the committee, despite the more hawkish tone recently, are starting to be more sensitive to the fact that the fact that inflation is not materializing the way the market thought this year. “This is not a high impact report for traders. There's nothing in there that is a big surprise. “For the most part, they don’t have any unique insight into the stock market. In the last few years there have been moments when the Fed has commented on stock prices and clearly in a few instances there have been more cautionary type messages about elevated prices. They have mentioned in the past that they have observed that equity prices are high but that hasn’t translated into any prescient call.

The treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons will enter into force 90 days after 50 countries have ratified it. It was adopted with 122 votes in favor, one against and one abstention.  U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft and French Ambassador Francois Delattre said in a joint statement that their countries do  not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party  to the treaty.   Therefore, there will be no change in the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons,  they said.   A purported ban on nuclear weapons that does not address the security concerns that continue to make nuclear deterrence necessary cannot result in the elimination of a single nuclear weapon and will not enhance any country's security, nor international peace and security,  they said, citing North Korea.  Pyongyang's latest missile tests and claims that its newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) can carry a  nuclear warhead have alarmed the United States and other countries. At the start of the talks in March, Haley said dozens of countries were skipping the negotiations because they were committed to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which entered into force in 1970 and is aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology. The U.N. General Assembly resolution adopted a resolution in December, 113 in favor to 35 against, with 13 abstentions, to  negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading toward their total elimination  and encouraged all member states to participate.

Drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to July 7, bringing the total count up to 763, the most since April 2015, Baker Hughes energy services company said in its closely followed report on Friday.  That compares with 351 active oil rigs during the same week a year ago. Drillers have added rigs in 54 of the past 58 weeks since the start of June 2016. The pace of those additions, however, has slowed over the past few months with the decline in crude prices with the total added over the past four weeks holding at six the lowest since January.  U.S. crude futures were trading around $44 per barrel on Friday, putting the contract on track to fall for a sixth week in the past seven, on data showing U.S. output continues to rise, frustrating efforts by OPEC and other producers to curb global oversupply.  After agreeing in December to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from January-June 2017, OPEC and other producers in late May agreed to extend those cuts for another nine months through the end of March 2018. U.S. oil production rose 1 percent to 9.3 million bpd last week, correcting a drop in the previous week that was due to one-off maintenance work and hurricane shutdowns.  Analysts said U.S. shale companies would continue to drill for more oil so long as crude prices are expected to rise in future months. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading at about $44.50 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching over $46 a barrel. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, forecast the total oil and gas rig count would average 887 in 2017, 1,108 in 2018 and 1,219 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas. That compares with an average of 824 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 forecast would be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes.

While Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic have looked imperious so far at the grasscourt grand slam, the up-and-coming contenders need to study some of the greats of the game to gain a foothold.  I agree there is no room for serve-and-volley in tennis if you try to do it all the time,  said Wilander, in London leading Eurosport's coverage of the event.  But should it be used way more than it is? Yes, of course it should.  That style of tennis, where the server follows his delivery into the net to hit a volley or a smash, has all-but disappeared from the modern game as athletes have become stronger and racquets more powerful. Prior to 2002 it was the go-to tactic for almost all the champions over the years. Since 2002, when the grass surface was slowed down by Wimbledon organizers, it has virtually disappeared, as players thump the ball from the baseline waiting for an opening to blast a big forehand or backhand winner. In the first four days of the tournament only seven percent of points played in the men's draw were serve-volley -- even though the success rate was almost 70 percent. For women the statistic was worse -- one percent of points were serve-volley.  That is ridiculous. I mean, as I say, you can't do it all the time because the returns are so good these days, and the passing shots, but at the very least one in five points should be serve-volley,  Wilander said.  Especially against the guys who chip back around 30 percent of their returns.  These young guys are going to need to switch it up, try some new things. They are going to have to rush the top guys, not let them play like they want to play.  Because guess what happens when the top guys play the way they want to play -- there is a reason they are ranked one, two or three in the world: because they are better than you!  You need to take time away from them, make them uncomfortable -- and one way to do that is to serve-and-volley.  One player who has bucked the trend at these championships is Mischa Zverev. The Russian-born German has serve-volleyed more than 80 percent of his service points so far, at a success rate of almost 70 percent. Next up for the elder of the two Zverev brothers is Federer. The Swiss has been known to chip returns from time to time, so Wilander's theory will get an early test.  Why not?  the Swede said smiling.  It will be interesting.

Drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to July 7, bringing the total count up to 763, the most since April 2015, Baker Hughes energy services company said in its closely followed report on Friday.  That compares with 351 active oil rigs during the same week a year ago. Drillers have added rigs in 54 of the past 58 weeks since the start of June 2016. The pace of those additions, however, has slowed over the past few months with the decline in crude prices with the total added over the past four weeks holding at six the lowest since January.  U.S. crude futures were trading around $44 per barrel on Friday, putting the contract on track to fall for a sixth week in the past seven, on data showing U.S. output continues to rise, frustrating efforts by OPEC and other producers to curb global oversupply.  After agreeing in December to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from January-June 2017, OPEC and other producers in late May agreed to extend those cuts for another nine months through the end of March 2018. U.S. oil production rose 1 percent to 9.3 million bpd last week, correcting a drop in the previous week that was due to one-off maintenance work and hurricane shutdowns.  Analysts said U.S. shale companies would continue to drill for more oil so long as crude prices are expected to rise in future months. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading at about $44.50 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching over $46 a barrel. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, forecast the total oil and gas rig count would average 887 in 2017, 1,108 in 2018 and 1,219 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas. That compares with an average of 824 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 forecast would be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes.

The arrests began July 2 and since then mostly male Uighur students have been detained during raids on shops, restaurants and student accommodation in Cairo, according to Uighur students and New York-based Human Rights Watch.  Uighurs were also detained in Cairo and Alexandria airports as they tried to flee the country after the arrest began, students told Reuters.   There was no immediate comment from Egyptian authorities. Uighurs speak a Turkic language and live in China's far western region of Xinjiang. Hundreds have died in Xinjiang in the past few years, mostly in unrest between the around 10 million Uighur people, who call the region home, and the ethnic majority Han Chinese. The government has blamed much of the unrest on separatist Islamist militants, though rights groups and exiles say that anger over tightening Chinese controls on the religion and culture of Muslim Uighurs is more to blame. China routinely denies any repression in Xinjiang.   In the past few months, the Chinese government had ordered Uighur students studying abroad, including those in Egypt, to return home. There are reports that Chinese authorities have detained family members of these students to force them to come back,  Human Rights Watch Asia researcher Maya Wang told Reuters.    Human Rights Watch said it was unclear what caused the mass detentions by Egyptian authorities this week.   The basis of this treatment, and their whereabouts and well-being, are unclear, but we suspect that many of them face imminent deportations,  she said. Egypt itself has been fighting a growing Islamist insurgency, mainly in its Sinai region. Abdallah, a student who asked not to use his real name out of fear for his family in China, fled to Turkey by plane on Wednesday along with about 20 other people including women and children once they heard about the arrests.     He said others were not so lucky.  The Egyptian police detained about 30 people, all young guys, in the airport (on Thursday) and announced they would send them back to China,  he told Reuters via instant messaging platform Whatsapp. Videos shared on social media by students and activists showed men, said to be Uighur students, handcuffed together in the back of a moving truck. Other videos claimed to show people crouching and standing in groups after having been detained. Reuters could not independently verify the videos' content.  The Chinese came to the police station and they are now preparing to send them to China. They will return them to China where they will be accused of terrorism and they will either be imprisoned or executed,  said Fakhr al-Dina Razi, a Uighur student at Cairo's al-Azhar university.  Razi remains in Cairo and said via Whatsapp the community in Egypt is afraid because they know the fate awaiting them in China.  Islamic Studies in Egypt   Abdallah came to Egypt in 2011 to study Arabic and Islamic Studies at Cairo's historic al-Azhar university because such religious studies are not permitted in China. His story is typical of the students rounded up this week.  He said he had all the necessary permissions from Egypt and China to live and study in Cairo, but last year China began a crackdown on Uighur students abroad, and on their families still in China.   Abdallah said he has not spoken to his family in China for about a year because of this. He said Chinese authorities began to arrest people sending money to overseas students.  Some of us were asked, under pressure, to go back to China, by force applied to their families...Some of my fellow students returned, some remained in Egypt and some fled in fear to surrounding countries like Turkey,  Abdallah said.  He said some of those that returned to China were arrested and sentenced to prison, mainly as a result of their Islamic studies.  This week's crackdown by Egyptian authorities came as a surprise to him. Those that did not flee Egypt had left their homes to avoid the police, he said.       Another al-Azhar student who managed to flee abroad, but who was scared to give a name, said he wanted to continue his studies, but feared it was impossible to return to Egypt now. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, when asked whether it was true Egypt had detained Uighur students, told a daily news briefing on Thursday:  According to what I know at present, the Chinese Embassy in Egypt has already sent consular officials to carry out a consular visit.  He did not elaborate.  In September, Egypt's Interior Ministry and China's Public Security Ministry signed a technical cooperation deal which included Chinese support for Egypt's fight against terrorism and closer security cooperation, Egyptian state media reported.         Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Uighurs keen to escape unrest in Xinjiang have traveled clandestinely via Southeast Asia to Turkey, home to a large Uighur diaspora. In 2015, Thailand sent back to China about 100 Uighurs, a move that sparked anger in Turkey, and fed fears among rights groups and the United States about potential mistreatment. China later said some of that group were suspected of  terror  offences.   China's record of torture, disappearance, and arbitrary detention of Uighurs, as well as the politicized nature of judicial proceedings in past cases of forced repatriation, raise serious concerns that if deported, these individuals will be at risk of torture and ill-treatment,  Human Rights Watch's Wang said.

Three Court of Appeal judges said that a lower court was correct to rule in March that the story would breach Brevan Howard's right to confidentiality and was not of sufficient public interest to justify its publication. Reuters had argued that the March ruling by a High Court judge had given  insufficient weight  to matters of public interest and had failed to take into account the  limited  scope of the confidential information it wanted to publish.       Despite that raft of criticisms of the Judge's judgment, we are clear that the appeal should be dismissed,  Court of Appeal judge Terence Etherton wrote. A spokesman for Reuters said the agency was deeply disappointed.   We continue to believe that the public interest in publication of this information outweighs the confidentiality concerns raised here,  he said.  A spokesman for Brevan Howard said the firm  welcomes the decision of the court that supports the importance of its ability to communicate with its investors in a candid and responsible manner .  Brevan Howard, one of Europe's biggest hedge fund managers, said the Reuters story contained highly sensitive information it had sent to 36 potential investors electronically. Reuters obtained information for the story from confidential sources but when it contacted the hedge fund to ask questions before publication, Brevan Howard sought an injunction on the grounds of breach of confidence. Under Britain's legal system, individuals and companies can file for privacy or confidentiality injunctions to try to stop the media publishing information that they say is confidential. Reuters argued in court that public interest outweighed confidentiality concerns because hedge funds invest on behalf of institutional investors including pension funds, which affect the finances of millions of people. However the appeal court said the judge in March had balanced the public interest case against Brevan Howard's right to confidentiality and had made no error of law in his decision.

I really like him.  C Andrew Knapp collected his sixth walk in his last six games, bringing him up to 20 on the season. He's walked more times than all but one player amongst those who've had 140 plate appearances or fewer, and has a .435 on-base percentage in his last 13 games. He also came around to score a run Thursday night on a three-base throwing error by the Pirates. RHP Jeremy Hellickson's streak of winless starts ran to nine Thursday night as he received a no-decision in a 6-3 Pittsburgh win. Hellickson (5-5), who hasn't won a game since May 19, gave up three runs (all earned) on five hits in six innings before departing for a pinch hitter after throwing 77 pitches. He was hurt by a pair of home runs in the fourth inning, both of which came on change-ups up in the zone. He's now given up 20 home runs in 18 starts after yielding 24 in 32 starts a year ago. RF Aaron Altherr provided the Phillies' only RBIs in a 6-3 loss to Pittsburgh on Thursday, going 2-for-2 with two runs driven in thanks to an RBI single in the seventh inning. He was thrown out on both hits trying to stretch singles into doubles, both times by Pirates left fielder Jose Osuna.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-phillies-playerwatch-idUSMTZED77QCLP5M"},

A final decision of the Council of State, which most of the time is based on the counsel's recommendation, is expected by the end of July and could end regulated gas tariffs in France. ANODE, a lobby for alternative retail energy suppliers, had taken the matter to the court. The association said the regulated prices under which about 5.5 million sites, including half of France's residential clients and 11 percent of professional users continue to buy gas from Engie, was hampering competition and keeping prices high. Engie could not immediately be reached for comment. The company has said in the past that the regulated priced enabled it to meet public service obligations, including guaranteeing the security of supply, while the French government has said the mechanism protects the long-term purchasing power of consumers. The counsel argued the regulated prices were against European Union regulations, and that the French system was not justified, neither by the argument it guaranteed security of supply, nor that it set a reasonable price for gas.  There is no economic interest for the regulated gas prices that justifies hindrance to full competition in the market,  Marie-Astrid de Barmon said in her conclusion.  For these reasons, we conclude that the decree should be annulled,  she said. In September 2016, the European Court of Justice ruled the regulated tariffs were an obstacle to a competitive gas market, but could be justified under certain conditions. France's antitrust body ruled in 2013 the country should gradually phase out the regulated gas tariffs because they hindered competition and keep prices artificially high.

Three Court of Appeal judges said that a lower court was correct to rule in March that the story would breach Brevan Howard's right to confidentiality and was not of sufficient public interest to justify its publication. Reuters had argued that the March ruling by a High Court judge had given  insufficient weight  to matters of public interest and had failed to take into account the  limited  scope of the confidential information it wanted to publish.       Despite that raft of criticisms of the Judge's judgment, we are clear that the appeal should be dismissed,  Court of Appeal judge Terence Etherton wrote. A spokesman for Reuters said the agency was deeply disappointed.   We continue to believe that the public interest in publication of this information outweighs the confidentiality concerns raised here,  he said.  A spokesman for Brevan Howard said the firm  welcomes the decision of the court that supports the importance of its ability to communicate with its investors in a candid and responsible manner .  Brevan Howard, one of Europe's biggest hedge fund managers, said the Reuters story contained highly sensitive information it had sent to 36 potential investors electronically. Reuters obtained information for the story from confidential sources but when it contacted the hedge fund to ask questions before publication, Brevan Howard sought an injunction on the grounds of breach of confidence. Under Britain's legal system, individuals and companies can file for privacy or confidentiality injunctions to try to stop the media publishing information that they say is confidential. Reuters argued in court that public interest outweighed confidentiality concerns because hedge funds invest on behalf of institutional investors including pension funds, which affect the finances of millions of people. However the appeal court said the judge in March had balanced the public interest case against Brevan Howard's right to confidentiality and had made no error of law in his decision.

The assault on Imam Gharbi village appeared to be the sort of diversionary, guerrilla-style strike Islamic State is expected to employ as U.S.-backed Iraqi forces regain control over cities IS captured in a shock 2014 offensive. Security sources said IS insurgents had infiltrated Imam Gharbi, some 70 km (44 miles) south of Mosul on the western bank of the Tigris river, on Wednesday evening from a pocket of territory still under their control on the eastern bank.  Two Iraqi journalists were reported killed and two others wounded as they covered the security forces' counter-attack to take back the village on Friday. An unknown number of civilians and military were also killed or wounded. The fighting forced the U.N.-affiliated International Organization for Migration to suspend relief operations at two sites where it houses nearly 80,000 people near Qayyara, just north of Imam Gharbi, a U.N. statement said. With water trucks no longer able to reach the sites, the displaced people could run short of water at a time of midsummer temperatures well over 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), it said. The insurgents were still in control of half the village by Friday evening, security sources said.    In Mosul, IS clung to a slowly shrinking pocket on the Tigris west bank, battling for every meter with snipers, grenades and suicide bombers, which forced Iraqi troops to fight house-to-house in densely-populated blocks.  The Iraqi military has forecast final victory this week in what used to be the de facto capital of IS's  caliphate  in Iraq, after a grinding eight-month, U.S.-backed offensive to wrest back the city, whose pre-war population was 2 million.   Members of Iraqi federal police run with their weapons during fighting with Islamic State militants at the frontline in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 7, 2017.Ahmed SaadBut security forces faced ferocious resistance from several hundred militants hunkered down among thousands of civilians in the maze of alleyways in Mosul's Old City.  Mosul was by far the largest city seized by Islamic State in its offensive three years ago where the ultra-hardline group declared its caliphate over adjoining parts of Iraq and Syria. Asymmetric Attacks Slideshow (6 Images)Stripped of Mosul, IS's dominion in Iraq will be reduced to mainly rural, desert areas west and south of the city where tens of thousands of people live, and the militants are expected to keep up asymmetric attacks on selected targets across Iraq. Adhel Abu Ragheef, a Baghdad-based expert on jihadist groups, said Islamic State was likely to carry out  more of these raid-type attacks on security forces to try to divert them away from the main battle , now in Mosul and then in other areas west of Mosul including near the Syrian border still under IS control. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's  state of falsehood  a week ago, after security forces took Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up. Months of grinding urban warfare in Mosul have displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations. The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. Iraq's regional Kurdish leader said the Baghdad central government had failed to prepare a post-battle political, security and governance plan. The offensive has damaged thousands of structures in Mosul's Old City and destroyed nearly 500 buildings, satellite imagery released by the United Nations on Thursday showed. In some of the worst affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage, and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said.

Results long stayed provisional as the race jury looked at the photo finish to determine the winner of the 213.5-km flat ride from Troyes. Kittel was declared the victor ahead of Boasson Hagen (Dimension Data) by just six millimetres and joins Erik Zabel as the German rider with most stage wins on the Tour (12).  It's nice to be now one stage win shy of the record. I'm enjoying every single victory. I just concentrate on my job. It's just cycling that makes me happy,  said Kittel. Australian Michael Matthews (Team Sunweb) was a distant third as Chris Froome (Team Sky) retained the overall leader's yellow jersey. Kittel also snatched the green jersey for the points classification from Arnaud Demare (FDJ) after the French champion, who had been ill overnight, was not a factor in the sprint. Kittel has 197 points to Demare's 182.  It is the closest win of my career. What a difference six millimetres can make between a big joy and a big disappointment,  said Kittel.  I focus on the green jersey. These victories bring me big points.  I'm happy that I managed to throw my bike just the right way.  Until the final straight, the day had gone without any drama -- the usual scenario for long, flat stages. Four riders broke away from the gun, but their advantage was controlled by the sprinters' teams and the fugitives were caught with the line in sight, leaving it to the big-thighed sprinters to fight it out for victory.  Overall, Froome still leads team mate Geraint Thomas by 12 seconds and Italian Fabio Aru (Astana) by 14. Saturday's eighth stage will be one for the breakaway riders as it takes the peloton over 187.5km from Dole to the Station des Rousses in very hilly terrain.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 222,000 jobs last month, data from the Labor Department showed, beating economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in June after gaining 0.1 percent in May, but fell below the estimated 0.3 percent. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.  We're looking at now four of first six months of the year with 200,000 jobs or more and this is a nice solid report, so we can look forward to earnings season coming up,  said Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist for LPL Financial.  The one potential slight concern was the average wages didn't raise quite so much as some of those early estimates. But that falls in with some of the inflation data we've been seeing.  Investors are focused on wage growth and whether spending by consumers will be strong enough to back the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates once more this year. Odds of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting stood at 50.9 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Policymakers have taken opposing views on inflation after it retreated further below the central bank's 2 percent target in May, creating uncertainty over the future path of rate hikes. Adding to the jitters are bets that the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding their ultra-loose monetary policies. At 12:39 p.m. ET (1639 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 97.44 points, or 0.46 percent, at 21,417.48, the S&P; 500 was up 15.76 points, or 0.65 percent, at 2,425.51. The Nasdaq Composite was up 65.35 points, or 1.07 percent, at 6,154.81. Nine of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the tech index's 1.3 percent rise leading the gainers. Apple, Microsoft and Facebook gave the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. The financial index, which is sensitive to interest rates, rose 0.69 percent. Shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup were trading higher. Oil fell more than 3 percent after data showed U.S. production rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high. Oil prices are down more than 16 percent this year, adding to low inflation concerns. Tesla rose 1.9 percent after the luxury electric carmaker said about 3,500 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the second quarter and they would be counted as deliveries in the third quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,936 to 909. On the Nasdaq, 1,970 issues rose and 802 fell.

A prolonged heatwave across northern China, hydropower cuts in the south, a fresh crackdown on mine safety and imports curbs have triggered a weeks-long rally in the world's top buyer of the fuel. On Friday, the most-active futures prices hit 598.6 yuan ($88.04) per ton. That's up 18 percent since mid-May. In January, state economic planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a document it is comfortable with a price of 470 yuan ($69.12) to 570 yuan ($83.82 )per ton and will use measures to cool the market if it rises above 600 yuan.  But spot physical prices offered by major producers, such as Shenhua, ChinaCoal and Shandong Energy, are already at 600 yuan, sources with the three companies said driven by strong demand.   Our coal mines are almost working around the clock now,  said Wang Binghua, president of State Power Investment Corp, on the sideline of a company news conference this week. It has 81 million tonnes of annual coal capacity. It is not clear what level of intervention the government would consider. The NDRC may try to force miners to cut prices or set limits on the amount of inventory utilities and trading companies can hold to prevent them from buying extra volumes that could push prices higher or create shortages, according to four mining company executives and one power company executive. At least three of the top four mining firms, including ChinaCoal, Shenhua and Yitai, have halted spot sales to meet increasing demand from long-term contracts with clients, sources with the three companies said. The NDRC, Shenhua, ChinaCoal, Shandong Energy and Yitai did not respond to requests for comments. Major utilities buy on long-term contracts at about 570 yuan  ($83.83) per ton, although the smaller plants and traders are exposed to the cash market.     Analysts say utilities have about 20 days of inventory on hand, which is enough to see them through the busy summer months. Still, the price gains have tested Beijing's efforts to boost supplies, quell concerns about tightening availability during peak demand season and cool the red hot market. In a June 30 document, the NDRC asked miners to boost output as part of a series of steps to ensure power supplies over the summer.  Policy makers are trying to curb the rally in prices. But there is such a big demand for coal now that (Shenhua)'s spot prices has reached 600 yuan,  said a source from Shenhua.  A senior official at top utility Huaneng said a stable coal price was an increasingly important issue ahead of the Communist Party Congress this fall.  Our internal discussion with NDRC officials showed that the agency is keen on stabilizing prices and making sure utilities get enough supply during summer in preparation for the Congress meeting,  the official said.

Together the two Dutch municipalities hold 48.3 percent of Eneco and if more than 50 percent of shareholders decide to sell out by Oct. 31, Eneco will consider whether to seek a buyer or initiate an IPO, probably next year. Eneco's faces an uncertain future after it lost a decade-long battle against a government decision to separate grid operators from electricity generators. The company was split on Jan. 31 into grid operator Stedin NV and Eneco Groep NV. That triggered an external review of Eneco's future by a commission set up to protect the interests of the 53 Dutch municipalities that own the company. The review, published on Friday along with a statement from The Hague, which owns 16.6 percent of Eneco, said it had an annual operating profit of about 400 million euros ($456 million) and was worth roughly 2.7 billion euros. In a letter to shareholders, Eneco said they should hold onto their stakes given that the company was a  successful, sustainable company with structural dividend income , while a sale would only give the cities a one-off windfall. However, the commission said in a letter dated July 5 that Eneco had painted a  too one-sided  picture of its finances and not informed shareholders of risks to its business model, notably from falling energy prices and the loss of clients.

Slideshow (5 Images)The opposition has lodged a series of legal challenges over the organization of the election where President Uhuru Kenyatta is seeking a second and final five-year term against veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga. The electoral board resigned in October after the opposition accused it of bias. Kenya has a history of disputed elections. At least 1,200 people were killed in ethnic violence after the December 2007 polls. The opposition challenged the 2013 result, but it was upheld by the Supreme Court. On the ballot paper case, the IEBC awarded the 2.5 billion-shilling ($24 million) contract to Dubai-based firm Al Ghurair last year. But a high court judge canceled it in February, saying it did not follow new election regulations, after it was challenged by the opposition. The IEBC awarded the contract to Al Ghurair again in June, prompting Odinga's National Super Alliance to appeal again, leading to Friday's outcome. The former chairman of the IEBC is on trial for fraud after a London court convicted a British company of paying nearly 500,000 pounds ($620,000) in bribes in an election procurement scandal.

UNESCO designated Hebron and the two adjoined shrines at its heart - the Jewish Tomb of the Patriarchs and the Muslim Ibrahimi Mosque - a  Palestinian World Heritage Site in Danger . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called that  another delusional UNESCO decision  and ordered that $1 million be diverted from Israel's U.N. funding to establish a museum and other projects covering Jewish heritage in Hebron.  The funding cut is Israel's fourth in the past year, taking its U.N. contribution from $11 million to just $1.7 million, an Israeli official said.

Living in the heart of the city, they require intense security, with some 800 Israeli troops protecting them.

President Robert Mugabe's government has not received foreign funding since it started defaulting on its external debt in 1999 and is relying on domestic borrowing and taxes to fund its national budget. The IMF said in a statement on Friday after a meeting of its executive board this week that although Harare cleared its arrears with the fund last year, talks with the World Bank and other multilateral lenders faced delays.  It (Zimbabwe) is yet to reach agreement with the World Bank and other multilateral institutions on the settlement of arrears, and undertake reforms that would facilitate resolution of arrears with bilateral creditors,  the IMF said. The IMF also said Zimbabwe should not seek to clear its $1.75 billion foreign arrears through agreements that would worsen its debt situation.

The previously undisclosed details on the negotiations show how Amazon used its deep pockets and brand as leverage to convince Whole Foods to accept a sale process that would not result in a bidding war. Whole Food shares traded above Amazon's $42-per-share deal price for the first few days after the agreement was announced on June 16, on investor expectations of a higher bid. They have since traded slightly below that price, as such hopes dampened. The regulatory filing shows that Whole Foods agreed to forgo an auction process after it received expressions of interest from two other companies and four private equity firms. None of these parties are identified by name. The filing refers to a 'company X,' which proposed a merger of equals that valued Whole Foods at between $35 and $40 per share. U.S. supermarket chain owner Albertsons LLC is company X, a source familiar with the matter said. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. Nevertheless, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods agreed not to pursue this, or solicit any other bids, in part because Amazon was  very sensitive with respect to confidentiality  and did not want to compete in a broader sale process, the filing said. Whole Foods said in the filing it sought $45 per share from Amazon but settled for $42 per share, which the ecommerce giant called its  best and final offer.  Amazon had offered $41 in May, according to the filing. Amazon had also told Whole Foods it was considering other opportunities in case its final offer was turned down. The filing added that Amazon reserved the right to terminate the talks if there was any leak or rumor of its interest in Whole Foods. The other company that expressed interest in Whole Foods, referred to in the filing as 'company Y,' had an interest in exploring a commercial relationship, such as a supply arrangement, and did not discuss any merger or acquisition, according to the filing. Whole Foods' management, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC to explore a sale of the company, decided not to solicit proposals from the four private equity firms as the price proposed by Amazon likely exceeded the amount a private equity buyer could be expected to pay, according to the filing.

President Robert Mugabe's government has not received foreign funding since it started defaulting on its external debt in 1999 and is relying on domestic borrowing and taxes to fund its national budget. The IMF said in a statement on Friday after a meeting of its executive board this week that although Harare cleared its arrears with the fund last year, talks with the World Bank and other multilateral lenders faced delays.  It (Zimbabwe) is yet to reach agreement with the World Bank and other multilateral institutions on the settlement of arrears, and undertake reforms that would facilitate resolution of arrears with bilateral creditors,  the IMF said. The IMF also said Zimbabwe should not seek to clear its $1.75 billion foreign arrears through agreements that would worsen its debt situation. Zimbabwe's foreign debt stands at more than $7 billion, more than half of its GDP.

The company, best known for its participation in the Formula One racing series, is seeking to raise a total of £525m-equivalent through sterling and US dollar notes. The deal is reminiscent of peer Aston Martin, which issued in both currencies in March. Both McLaren tranches (rated B2/B) will be five-year non-call two senior secured notes. Initial pricing thoughts on the sterling tranche have been set at the low fives, while the US dollar piece is indicated 75bp back from that.  It's something we're looking at and probably going to play,  said a trader, pointing to the company's diversification and position as a well-known brand. In addition to car manufacturing and Formula One, the company is also a technology and data solutions supplier.  There are quite a few deals out there competing for investor attention. But, with a name like this, you don't have the problem of motivating people to come,  said a banker close to the deal. The Aston Martin notes (B3/B-) provide the best pricing reference points. It raised £550m-equivalent through 5NC2 notes split between a £230m portion at 5.75% and a US$400m tranche at 6.5%. The notes have traded well since, with the sterling bid at 104.49 to yield 4.44% and the dollar at 103.52 or 5.45%, according to Thomson Reuters data. FOOD FOR THOUGHT Although the McLaren name is capturing investors' attention some of the company's credit metrics could give food for thought. The  need for heavy spending on new model development significantly depresses profitability , according to a recent research note from S&P.; In addition, McLaren's financial risk profile  is constrained by its very highly leveraged capital structure , said the rating agency. The bond will more than double financial debt to £525m. And while the group reported revenues of £898m and Ebitda of £148m in 2016, S&P; reckons the latter was  near zero  after taking into account £112m of capitalised development costs and foreign exchange loss estimates. Free operating cashflow was negative at around £35m.  I think this is a challenge as you're dealing with a company that is nowhere near free cashflow positive. McLaren is spending as much in capex as it is generating in Ebitda. That's one where you're staring at a negative free cashflow story where there's no way out other than improving sales, which isn't always easy,  said an investor.  There's also the Formula One side, which is fine for now because they have contracts until 2020, but you've got to think that the brand will be affected by their performance.  Struggling McLaren's Formula One team has struggled in recent years and not won a race since 2012. Going into last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, the team was last in the constructors' championship. About £200m of the bond proceeds will be used to buy out Dennis's shares in McLaren Automotive and McLaren Technology Group, the two units that make up the company, though they are being merged into a new holding company, McLaren Group. Dennis, who has been with McLaren for 37 years, agreed to sell his shares in both entities at the end of June after being ousted as chief executive in November, when McLaren's majority shareholders put him on  gardening leave . He will receive a further £75m as deferred consideration, with half paid in December and the rest in August 2019. Proceeds will also be used to repay all of McLaren's £238m of outstanding bank debt. The European leg of the roadshow ends on Friday. The deal is being marketed in the US until Wednesday. JP Morgan, which also led Aston Martin's trade, is sole global coordinator and physical bookrunner, with HSBC as joint bookrunner. Barclays and Santander are co-managers.

Euro zone growth is picking up but underlying inflation is still weak, so the European Central Bank should adjust its policy carefully and flexibly to avoid abrupt market moves, ECB board member Benoit Coeure told two European newspapers.

Output by British factories and the construction sector unexpectedly shrank in May, on top of weak spending by consumers who are feeling the pinch from accelerating inflation since last year's vote to exit the European Union. The signs of continued weak growth came as businesses pressed British Prime Minister Theresa May and her government to negotiate a smooth Brexit in two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter investment. An employers group said on Thursday that Britain should stay in the EU's single market for a transition period. Executives from leading British companies were due to meet Brexit minister David Davis on Friday. Sterling dipped below $1.29 after Friday's data and hit its lowest level since June 28. British government bond prices rose. Analysts said the economy was now unlikely to recover much speed in the second quarter, after expanding by just 0.2 percent in the first three months of the year.  It's all building up a pattern here that says the economy is clearly losing momentum,  said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank.   It's not pointing to a particularly dynamic second quarter. Under those circumstances, the timing of the hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee pushing for a rate hike doesn't look great.  Growth in the second quarter was likely to edge up only slightly to 0.3 percent, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, a leading think tank, said. FILE PHOTO: A worker assembles metal components at the Mec Com Ltd factory near Stafford, central England December 15, 2016.Phil Noble/File PhotoThe Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output edged down by a monthly 0.2 percent, confounding forecasts for a 0.5 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists. Construction figures were also much worse than expected with output in the three months to May down 1.2 percent, the sharpest such drop since October 2015. The strength of next Wednesday's official data on wages is now likely to be critical for BoE policymakers as they mull whether to raise interest rates from their record low 0.25 percent.  Financial markets suggested there was a roughly 1-in-3 chance of a rate hike this year, down from 1-in-2 a week ago. MPCOIS=ICAP Some BoE policymakers have been pushing for the first interest rate hike in a decade. Rate-setter Michael Saunders said this week he was  reasonably confident  improving exports and investment would more or less compensate for the consumer slowdown. The manufacturing figures were hit by a 4.4 percent drop on the month in motor vehicle output, the biggest fall in over a year. Industry figures have shown a fall in new car sales. Broader industrial output fell 0.1 percent in May after a 0.2 percent rise in April. Separately on Friday, mortgage lender Halifax said house prices rose at the slowest annual pace in four years, which could erode consumer confidence. Trade data for May also looked weak. The goods trade deficit increased to 11.863 billion pounds ($15.33 billion) in May from 10.595 billion pounds in April, the ONS said, wider than all forecasts in the Reuters poll. Things looked brighter in terms of volumes of goods exported in the three months to May, which rose 3.8 percent. By comparison, import volumes rose 2.8 percent over the same period. However, business surveys have cast doubt about whether an improvement will be seen in the months ahead.

There is fierce competition between Paris, Frankfurt and other European cities to woo the banks based in the City of London financial center as they consider where to shift some  operations to maintain access to the European Union's single market after Britain leaves the bloc. Until now, Paris' rivals, including Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg, have been making the headlines as the locations banks, insurers and asset managers have chosen to open new hubs.  We are determined to make Paris more competitive and attractive,  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said, announcing that the government would scrap the highest bracket of payroll tax for firms like banks that do not pay VAT, and cancel a planned extension of tax on share trading.  It would also make sure that bankers' bonuses are no longer taken into account when labor courts decide on unfair dismissal compensation. The payroll tax France charges banks and some other sectors such as real estate and healthcare is a charge that companies pay on each salaried employee. It is not levied in most other European countries.  Tax was a big concern for London bankers at a roadshow organized by a French finance industry lobby in February this year to promote Paris as a financial center.      Philippe also pledged to review and change on a case-by-case basis the way EU financial regulations are transposed into French law, saying France had sometimes gone too far by imposing additional burden on businesses, compared to European rivals. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, Valerie Pecresse, President of the Ile-de-France region, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Junior Economy Minister Benjamin Griveaux, President of Greater Paris Metropolis Patrick Ollier attend a news conference to unveil a new raft of measures to make Paris more attractive for bankers fleeing Britain after Brexit, in Paris, France, July 7, 2017.Pascal RossignolGermany has said it is looking at making it easier to hire and fire senior bankers in a relaxation of its labor laws to help to attract financial firms to Frankfurt. Last Chance French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe attends a news conference to unveil a new raft of measures to make Paris more attractive for bankers fleeing Britain after Brexit, in Paris, France, July 7, 2017.Pascal RossignolPresident Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker, has a hard task to convince the investment community that France does not see the financial sector as an  enemy  - a phrase once used by former socialist President Francois Hollande. As part of the charm offensive, France has pledged to build three more international schools targeted at expatriates' children in the greater Paris region by 2022.  In a trip to New York last month, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said France would set up a special court to handle English-law cases for financial contracts after Britain leaves the EU. For his part, Philippe will next week give a speech to bankers at a conference in Paris, where the chief executive of U.S. investment bank JP Morgan (JPM.N) Jamie Dimon is expected to attend, according to the agenda on the event's website. The European Central Bank said on June 30 that banks should step up their Brexit preparations, while the Bank of England wants details of financial firms' contingency plans by July 14. But Britain is also pushing for a Brexit deal that would allow UK-based finance firms to continue to operate relatively freely in the EU after March 2019, when Brexit is due to take effect.  We are confident that plans to lower corporation tax to 17 percent by 2020, (and) a commitment to boost national infrastructure and developing trading relationships with new international partners in the coming years will ensure that London remains a world-leading financial hub,  the City of London said in a statement on Friday.

The STOXX 600  index fell 0.2 percent but remained above the 11-week low hit in the previous session, when European Central Bank minutes showed the euro zone rate-setters had left the door open to scrapping its bond-buying pledge. The ensuing spike in government bond yields across Europe sent regional benchmarks falling by more than 1 percent at one point on Thursday, with rate-sensitive stocks like utilities leading the fall.  Bund yields have broken above an important resistance and the trend is downwards but assets should find some support from short-term oversold conditions,  said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital in Milan. The pan-European index made a modest weekly gain following four straight weeks of declines. Last week, the index fell more than 2 percent as investors fretted over comments from ECB Chairman Mario Draghi indicating the central bank could begin to tighten monetary policy. And Bank of America Merrill Lynch said this week it saw the first outflows from Euro zone equity funds in 15 weeks, a possible sign unabashed enthusiasm over European equities is fading.  BAML strategists also predicted a big fall in global equities in autumn this year. On the day, the oil and gas index .SXEP, the worst sectoral performer so far this year, saw sharp falls, down 1.3 percent. Oil majors Total (TOTF.PA) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) fell 1 to 2 percent as oil prices were hit by news of a rise in U.S. production following earlier reports that OPEC output was also growing [O/R]. Carrefour (CARR.PA) was the biggest STOXX faller, down 5 percent as concern over profit margins overshadowed stronger-than-expected sales growth at the world's second-largest retailer.        The French group said sales growth accelerated in the second quarter, beating expectations and reflecting an improving performance in its core French market and robust sales in the rest of Europe. But Deutsche Bank cut its earnings-per-share expectations for Carrefour, saying uncertainty regarding margin pressure would probably weigh on the share price in the short term. Rate-sensitive utilities .SX6P rose 0.6 percent, as market talk of possible takeover interest in Centrica (CNA.L) helped the sector rebound following losses due to expectations over rising rates in the region. Blog WallStreetWires reported  rumours  that a consortium of foreign investors may be interested in the company, but analysts at Jefferies said such a deal was unlikely. Utilities Innogy (IGY.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE) and RWE (RWEG.DE) were also stronger, buoyed by supportive broker views. Banks .SX7P, which instead benefit when rates rise, were  weak following their recent outperformance. An Exane BNP Paribas downgrade of multiple European broadcasters sent the media index .SXMP down 1.5 percent to lead sectoral fallers in Europe. Analysts at the French broker said  anaemic  TV advertising  growth was likely to flatten or even dip into negative territory, warning that most broadcasters could cut their outlook in their upcoming earnings updates.

There was further frustration for the Belarussian as Watson bagged 11 games during a thrilling third round Centre Court encounter - the same number Azarenka had surrendered in total during their four previous showdowns. Yet, those stats and an astonishing moment of judgement by Watson in the third set could not deny Azarenka victory as she reached the last 16 with a heart-stopping 3-6 6-1 6-4 win over the British wildcard.  I really stepped up in the key moments,  said Azarenka, who is playing in only her second tournament after the birth of her son Leo in December. Fellow two-times grand slam champion Mary Pierce put it more forcefully:  Azarenka showed today why she is a former world number one - when it counts she takes it up to another level.  Mark of a champion.  When Azarenka broke for 4-3 in the deciding set, following an 11-minute game which featured six deuces and five game points for her opponent, Watson's slumped body language seemed to suggest it was game over and her spirit was broken. Yet at 30-30 in the next game, Watson suddenly stopped the action mid point, drawing gasps from the 15,000-strong crowd as she held her left arm aloft to challenge Hawkeye on the landing spot of an Azarenka groundstroke around the dusty, threadbare baseline. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 7, 2017   Belarus’ Victoria Azarenka in action during her third round match against Great Britain’s Heather WatsonToby MelvilleWith both players looking nervously at the giant screen on court, the hollering cheers that greeted Hawkeye's verdict left no doubt which way the call had gone - and that too by a whisker. A backhand long from Azarenka on the next point lifted the crowd off their seats as they erupted in celebration. Slideshow (2 Images)But the euphoria evaporated within minutes as 102nd ranked Watson, who had come within two points of beating Serena Williams at the same stage in 2015, chased down a lob only to wallop the ball into the net, handing Azarenka yet another break point. As she bent over her racket in frustration, Watson must have realised she was running out of lives.  A time violation was the last thing she needed - but it was what she got as she tried to gather her wits. When she did finally launch into her serve, the muted applause that greeted the end of the point confirmed that Azarenka stood only a game away from making the second week of the grasscourt major for the fifth time. Watson earned two further chances to throw Azarenka off course as she streaked 15-40 ahead in the 10th game but each time she miscued the service return, hitting long and wide. It was all over two points later as Watson's backhand error left Azarenka whooping in delight after two hours and six minutes.

KEY RATING DRIVERS Bolivia's ratings are supported by its strong external balance sheet, firm economic growth, and moderate public debt burden with low refinancing risk and debt service costs. These strengths are balanced by high fiscal and external deficits stemming from a structural terms-of-trade shock and expansionary policy response, involving steady erosion of buffers, and structural weaknesses in terms of low per-capita income and weak indicators of governance and the business climate relative to peers. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that the authorities will be able to contain the on-going erosion in fiscal and external balance sheets, which should remain strong relative to 'BB' category peers in the forecast period. Moreover, liquidity and solvency metrics have eroded at a pace broadly in line with Fitch's prior expectations incorporated in last year's downgrade from 'BB' to 'BB-'. However, beyond the two-year forecast horizon it is unclear if policies will be implemented that will stabilize the deterioration in the fiscal and external balance sheets. Bolivia's economic growth moderated to 4.3% in 2016 from 4.9% in 2015, below the official and Fitch's own prior forecasts, but marking a continued strong and stable performance. Lower government spending in the face of reduced natural gas revenues implied a somewhat reduced fiscal impulse, but broader monetary, credit and salary policies have remained supportive of growth. Fitch projects continued firm growth of 4% in 2017-2018. Inflation has fallen to low levels (1.8% in the 12 months through June) and monetary policy has remained expansionary. Credit growth remains high as banks have aimed to meet quotas under the Financial Services Law. Indicators of solvency, asset quality and profitability in the banking sector remain sound. Reduced fiscal revenues and execution challenges pose increasing constraints to the state-led growth model and could make medium-term prospects more dependent on private investment trends. Key bottlenecks include a rigid labour market and weak confidence in the legal framework according to surveys, which continue to weigh on the business climate despite government measures to improve it. Private investment at 8% of GDP in 2016 remains low. Ambitious public industrialization projects may result in a more limited economic boost than expected, in Fitch's view. Finished projects are operating below capacity, and others scheduled to open face uncertain timing, profitability and buyer commitments. The key gas sector is facing supply and demand challenges. Production is faltering on declines in mature fields (more than offsetting the boost from the new Incahuasi field) and more volatile Brazilian demand. Argentina fined Bolivia for sending gas below the contractual minimum in 2016. Production after 2019 is unclear in the absence of major discoveries and reserves that have not been certified since 2013, but the authorities aim to ramp up exploration with private companies. Weak gas prices and faltering volumes kept the current account deficit high at 5.5% of GDP in 2016, and foreign direct investment has continued falling. Capital outflows compounded these pressures in 2016, resulting in a USD3 billion fall in foreign reserves to USD10 billion. These FX pressures have persisted in 2017, but reserves have been kept above USD10 billion so far in the year due to one-off boosts from a sovereign bond issuance and changes in commercial bank reserve requirements benefitting the central bank's (BCB) balance sheet. Fitch expects external borrowing and policy actions (e.g. a recent hike in the commission on capital outflows) could ease the pace of reserve declines, but risks persist amid sluggish gas export volumes and prices, and hard-to-predict capital outflows. The sovereign's net foreign creditor position is set to reverse in the forecast period. However, the external liquidity ratio should remain far above the 'BB' median given low external debt service needs and still ample commercial bank and BCB assets. The public sector deficit fell to 6.6% of GDP in 2016 from 6.9% in 2015, balancing a lower general government deficit (3% in 2016, down from 4.5%) with higher deficits among SOEs. This outturn was better than Fitch's prior forecast, as greater-than-expected spending reductions (non-payment of a salary bonus, lower social spending and central and local-government capex) offset a sharp drop in gas revenues. Some payroll and pension obligations normally paid in January had been paid early in December 2015. With this effect eclipsed, the public sector and general government deficits rose to 9.1% and 4.3% of Fitch-estimated GDP, respectively, in the 12 months through March 2017. Fitch expects the fiscal deficit will rise back to higher levels in 2017-2019, reflecting the trend of weak gas revenues seen so far in 2017 and spending pressures that could intensify as 2019 elections approach or if execution of the five-year development plan (PDES) improves. General government debt rose to 32% of GDP in 2016 from 30% in 2015. Fitch projects the debt burden will rise to 38% of GDP by 2019 but remain below the current 'BB median of around 50%. The pace of deposit drawdown has slowed as deficit financing has relied increasingly on borrowing. General government deposits stood at 15% of GDP at end-2016, down from 23% in 2013, but remain relatively high. The indebtedness of public companies has risen considerably in recent years, and debt explicitly guaranteed by the treasury rose to 7.4% of GDP in 2016 from 3.2% in 2014. While this represents a source of contingent liability risk to the sovereign in the context of these companies' broadly weaker profitability, the intra-public sector nature of this debt (namely low-interest central bank loans) is a mitigating factor. Bolivia's public debt profile remains favourable. Refinancing risks are mitigated by low maturities in the coming years averaging 1.6% of GDP, and solid access to multilateral and bilateral lenders (e.g. China), capital markets (evidenced by a successful USD1 billion bond issuance in March), and a captive local market. Interest costs represent just 3.5% of revenues, below a 'BB' median near 9%, reflecting the concessional nature of the bulk of external debt and favourable local interest rates. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Bolivia a score equivalent to a rating of 'BB' on the Long-term Foreign Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: --Macroeconomic Performance and Policy Management: -1 notch, to reflect maintenance of expansionary policies (fiscal, monetary, salary, quasi-fiscal) and a stable currency in the face of a structural terms-of-trade shock that is supporting growth at the cost of high fiscal and external deficits, eroding buffers and raising economic vulnerability. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following risk factors individually, or collectively, could trigger a negative rating action: --Greater than expected deterioration of fiscal and external balance sheets (for example, due to a secular deterioration in the gas production profile); --Signs of increased macroeconomic instability or stress in the financial system; --Evidence of external financing constraints. The following risk factors individually, or collectively, could trigger a positive rating action: --Sustained fiscal deficit reduction that improves public debt dynamics; --Reduction in the current account deficit and improvement in external solvency and liquidity metrics; --Evidence of improvement in governance and the business climate that supports stronger investment and growth prospects. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch expects Brent oil prices to average USD52.5/b in 2017 and USD55/b in 2018, from USD45.1 in 2016, affecting Bolivian gas prices linked to global oil benchmarks.

The Chicago Board of Education wants to raise $200 million from the sale of general obligation bond sale through lead underwriter J.P. Morgan, according to the preliminary official statement. It plans to use the proceeds to reimburse costs of terminating interest-rate swaps and for capital improvement expenditures. Another part of the deal will restructure $50 million of outstanding debt in a  scoop and toss  that pushes out payments on the bonds to 2046. The district, which will offer the bonds with no ratings, included nine pages of potential risks for buyers in the prospectus. Escalating pension payments have led to drained reserves, debt dependency and junk bond ratings for the third-largest U.S. public school system, which is paying high interest rates on its short and long-term debt. Moody's on Thursday placed the district's B3 rating, which is one notch above Caa1, on review. It cited a delay in state grant payments of $466.5 million that Illinois was to have paid the Chicago Public Schools by June 30.  The rating review will consider any appropriation action the state takes that may or may not address the district's short-term liquidity needs and long-term budgetary hurdles,  Moody's said in a statement. Molly Poppe, a spokeswoman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who controls the public schools, declined to comment on Moody's review. She pointed to the mayor's December request for Moody's to withdraw all of its Chicago debt ratings. Nationwide, the $10.5 billion of bond and note deals scheduled to price in the coming week include $1 billion of New York City Transitional Finance Authority building aid revenue bonds. Bank of America Merrill Lynch will hold a retail presale period for the AA-rated bonds on Monday and Tuesday, followed by formal pricing on Wednesday. The New York and New Jersey Port Authority will sell $828.6 million of consolidated bonds through Goldman, Sachs & Co , which will offer the AA-minus-rated debt to retail investors on Wednesday ahead of formal pricing on Thursday.

Euro zone growth is picking up but underlying inflation is still weak, so the European Central Bank should adjust its policy carefully and flexibly to avoid abrupt market moves, ECB board member Benoit Coeure told two European newspapers. The Bank of Japan meanwhile said it would purchase an unlimited amount of bonds as it seeks to put a lid on domestic interest rates pushed higher by the broad sell-off in developed market bonds. Euro zone bond yields, which jumped as much as 12 basis points on Thursday as minutes from the ECB's latest meeting showed policymakers are open to a further step towards reducing monetary stimulus, rose 1-2 basis points on Friday.     They were thrust higher after data showed the U.S. economy added more jobs than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, signs of labor market strength. Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield edged up to 0.58 percent DE10YT=TWEB, a fresh 18-month high.  Low-rated Italian, Spanish and Portuguese government bond yields, seen as particularly vulnerable to unwinding of extraordinary stimulus, were particularly hard hit, rising 5-8 bps.

In just over a week, Bund yields have doubled, with German bonds bearing the brunt of selling in euro zone debt markets.  If the market is going to conclude that monetary policy makers are making an effort to tighten, we should have spreads widening, so that could be the next shoe to drop as the sell-off starts to impact credit and equities,  said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho. Jitters about tighter monetary policies from major central banks have rippled throughout global markets, hurting stocks and supporting the euro. U.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RR rose on Thursday on the back of the employment data and concern that rising oil prices could spur inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, 10-year Japanese government bond yields JP10YTN=JBTC hit five-month highs on Friday before the BOJ said it would buy JGBs.

There is fierce competition between Paris, Frankfurt and other European cities to woo the banks based in the City of London financial center as they consider where to shift some  operations to maintain access to the European Union's single market after Britain leaves the bloc. Until now, Paris' rivals, including Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg, have been making the headlines as the locations banks, insurers and asset managers have chosen to open new hubs.  We are determined to make Paris more competitive and attractive,  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said, announcing that the government would scrap the highest bracket of payroll tax for firms like banks that do not pay VAT, and cancel a planned extension of tax on share trading.  It would also make sure that bankers' bonuses are no longer taken into account when labor courts decide on unfair dismissal compensation. The payroll tax France charges banks and some other sectors such as real estate and healthcare is a charge that companies pay on each salaried employee. It is not levied in most other European countries.  Tax was a big concern for London bankers at a roadshow organized by a French finance industry lobby in February this year to promote Paris as a financial center.      Philippe also pledged to review and change on a case-by-case basis the way EU financial regulations are transposed into French law, saying France had sometimes gone too far by imposing additional burden on businesses, compared to European rivals. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, Valerie Pecresse, President of the Ile-de-France region, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Junior Economy Minister Benjamin Griveaux, President of Greater Paris Metropolis Patrick Ollier attend a news conference to unveil a new raft of measures to make Paris more attractive for bankers fleeing Britain after Brexit, in Paris, France, July 7, 2017.Pascal RossignolGermany has said it is looking at making it easier to hire and fire senior bankers in a relaxation of its labor laws to help to attract financial firms to Frankfurt. Last Chance French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe attends a news conference to unveil a new raft of measures to make Paris more attractive for bankers fleeing Britain after Brexit, in Paris, France, July 7, 2017.Pascal RossignolPresident Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker, has a hard task to convince the investment community that France does not see the financial sector as an  enemy  - a phrase once used by former socialist President Francois Hollande. As part of the charm offensive, France has pledged to build three more international schools targeted at expatriates' children in the greater Paris region by 2022.  In a trip to New York last month, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said France would set up a special court to handle English-law cases for financial contracts after Britain leaves the EU. For his part, Philippe will next week give a speech to bankers at a conference in Paris, where the chief executive of U.S. investment bank JP Morgan (JPM.N) Jamie Dimon is expected to attend, according to the agenda on the event's website. The European Central Bank said on June 30 that banks should step up their Brexit preparations, while the Bank of England wants details of financial firms' contingency plans by July 14. But Britain is also pushing for a Brexit deal that would allow UK-based finance firms to continue to operate relatively freely in the EU after March 2019, when Brexit is due to take effect.  We are confident that plans to lower corporation tax to 17 percent by 2020, (and) a commitment to boost national infrastructure and developing trading relationships with new international partners in the coming years will ensure that London remains a world-leading financial hub,  the City of London said in a statement on Friday.

The investigation was ordered by President Donald Trump in April under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and could clear the way for restrictions on steel imports. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross is expected to announce the outcome of the steel inquiry after Trump has spoken with G20 leaders at the July 7-8 summit in Germany. A decision that results in a material reduction in the current level of domestic steel imports could provide a near-term boost to shares of U.S. steel companies, according to Wall Street analysts. Recent trading data in options on top steel companies, including United States Steel Corp, Nucor Corp and AK Steel Holding Corp show traders are counting on some good news.  Everything looks pretty bullish. Every factor you would look at is sort of aligned in the same direction,  said Jim Strugger, MKM Partners derivatives strategist.  Traders have shown a marked preference for loading up on call options. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and usually are used to place bets on shares rising, while put options convey the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. For U.S. Steel Corp, there are 1.1 calls open for each open put contract, close to the most in more than five years, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data. Other steel stocks also exhibit similarly elevated positioning in call contracts.  They are not trying to pick a winner within the industry. It seems like it is more of a sector bet,  said Steve Claussen, vice president of trade strategy at E-Trade Financial in Chicago. Much of the bullish positioning is concentrated in contracts set to expire over the next two weeks.  The implied expectation is that you are expecting a short-term move very quickly. These are definitely event-driven trades in my opinion,  Claussen said. Several of these steel companies are set to report quarterly results before the end of July. Trump's election initially boosted steel stocks, with the S&P; 1500 steel index surging 36 percent in the month after the Nov. 8 vote. The index has given up most of those gains and is up 10 percent since the election.

We had an open and frank discussion and we’ve started a process where we will work together to obtain as much clarity and certainty as possible for industry as we prepare to leave the EU,  he said. Another industry group, the Federation of Small Businesses, said the government seemed committed to a pro-business Brexit.  I was heartened by the recognition of the benefits of free trade, and a clear moral drive that our future success will rest upon it,  Martin McTague, FSB policy director, said.        Employers are pushing for a Brexit deal that causes as little disruption as possible for them, including a transition period between Britain's planned departure from the bloc in 2019 and the start of its new relationship with the EU. Several people who took part in Friday's meeting - held at a country home which serves as an official residence of government ministers - declined to comment on the details of the discussions, saying they were intended to remain private. Separately on Friday, British finance minister Philip Hammond ruled out a proposal by a leading employers group that the country should stay in the EU's single market and customs union during a transition period.  My preference is that we negotiate a transitional structure,  Hammond said on the sidelines of a Group of 20 leader summit in Hamburg. This would take Britain  outside of those memberships (the single market and customs union)  but during a transition would replicate  as much as possible of the existing arrangements so the shock to business is minimized for the transition period.

The findings come as investors worry that demand for Tesla's luxury Model S sedan is waning ahead of the mass market Model 3 launch. Tesla earlier this week reported first-half global deliveries of its Model S and its Model X SUV at the low end of its own forecast, driving down the stock and raising questions about demand for the older models. Tesla’s share price more than doubled between early December and late June as investors bet on Chief Executive Elon Musk’s strategy to transform the low-volume luxury electric car maker into a diversified producer of mass market vehicles, storage batteries, electric commercial trucks and rooftop solar panels. The company’s market value rose past larger rivals General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co. Since June 23, however, Tesla shares have fallen by nearly 20 percent amid concerns that demand for the company’s existing models is weakening. Overall sales of electric vehicles in the United States remain stuck at less than 1 percent of total vehicle sales, despite a growing number of models fielded by Tesla and other car makers. Tesla declined to comment on California registration figures and noted that second-quarter global deliveries rose 53 percent from a year earlier, to just over 12,000 Model S and just over 10,000 Model X. It said earlier this week that battery pack production problems held back vehicle output in the second quarter until early June. California, a haven for environmentalists and techies, is one of the company's leading markets. The company does not break out results by geographic area. IHS analyst Stephanie Brinley cautioned that a single month of data could not fully explain Tesla demand.  If Tesla had an issue with its production for the month, that could explain  the drop in registrations, she said, noting in particular the problems with battery pack output. Still, she said, Tesla's Model S, launched in 2012, could be in need of a refresh.  They haven’t changed much on the exterior or much on the package,  and it is a high-fashion car, she said.  I can certainly understand where Model S sales may be softening a little bit because it’s an older product. That could be contributing to the issue.  Industry data reviewed separately by Reuters showed that the Model S registrations in California were uneven over the first four months of 2017, varying by more than 1,000 units month-to-month. In percentage terms Model S growth peaked in February, decelerated in March and turned negative in April in California. Brinley said it was difficult to assess whether that reflected demand or availability. IHS measures vehicle registration, which comes after a sale. Registration in California and overall in the United States rose sharply for the combined first four months of the year, but April showed steep declines. IHS has not released data for May or June. Chief Executive Musk in May stoked concerns that the Model 3 would cannibalize demand for the Model S when he told investors that some  confused  Tesla buyers regarded the new Model 3 as an upgrade to the Model S, affecting Model S orders. The new car is a $35,000 mass market vehicle, which costs about half the price of the Model S. Tesla reported first-half 2017 global deliveries rose to 47,100 in 2017. Tesla had predicted 47,000 to 50,000. Musk in May said there would be demand for 100,000 luxury Teslas. IHS reported April Tesla registrations fell to 2,177 from 2,867 in California. Nationally they dropped nearly 10 percent to 3,911 from 4,334. For the first four months, California registrations rose to 6,926 from 5,804 and U.S. registrations rose to 15,288 from 10,937. Tesla shares fell 5.6 percent to close at $308.83 on Thursday, although the stock is up about 45 percent for the year to date.

Meanwhile oil prices erased previous-day gains after a report showed U.S. production rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high, casting doubt on efforts to curb oversupply. Treasury yields and the dollar rose after falling right after the data was released as investors tried to figure out how the mix of strong jobs and weak wage growth would influence the U.S. Federal Reserve's plans for a rate hike or balance sheet reduction. “The bond market has already priced in an extremely slow Fed ... It’s not massively altering its course based on this report because it’s kind of a mixed bag report,  said Shyam Rajan, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. While Wall Street's S&P; 500 was on track for a weekly decline, equities rose on Friday as investors were reassured after weaker-than-expected private jobs numbers the day before.  It definitely seems the economy is on firm footing and this is a nice solid report so we can look forward to earnings season coming up,  said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial.  After yesterday's big selloff this is kind of a relief.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.7 points, or 0.41 percent, to 21,407.74, the S&P; 500 gained 14.04 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,423.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 59.93 points, or 0.98 percent, to 6,149.39. Bets that some of the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding ultra-loose monetary policies have roiled markets this week as European Central Bank minutes showed policymakers are open to tightening. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.21 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.10 percent. The U.S. dollar was up 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies and on pace to post its largest weekly percentage gain since late April. The greenback rose to two-month highs against the yen after the Bank of Japan increased its bond buying, expanding monetary policy when other central banks are moving to tighten.  We view today's report as supportive of the Fed view that they can hike an additional time later this year, while starting to reduce the balance sheet in the fall,  said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston.

Agassi was hired by Djokovic before the French Open in a bid to address his poor run of form but the Serb was badly beaten by Austrian Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros. Djokovic went into Wimbledon on the back of winning in Eastbourne, however, and has cruised through his two matches so far at the All England Club.  Novak is a great person, I really enjoy him, I respect him and I think we are starting to trust each other more,  Agassi told Reuters Television in an interview. The American, who won all four slams in a glittering career, is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his Wimbledon triumph and is also working as an ambassador for coffee company Lavazza. But his main task is to help Djokovic find the killer touch that has drifted out of his game in recent months and he says that requires work from both parties.  He is not directing me as much as we are learning. It is my job to learn him first and I am still learning. Then to figure out what is it that keeps you from a feeling in full flight and problem-solve,  he said.  That requires trust -- trust that I am going to learn him first and trust from him that he is going to buy into it and believe it and you remove all the hesitation that happens in a tennis court that keep someone from executing at their highest level,  he said. Agassi has also focused on getting Djokovic to focus his attention purely on elements of the sport that he can control, something he says the Serb has done well.  He has given everything I am asking for in terms of heart, fight and also the execution, what the plan is. The stuff you can’t control we are starting to forget about – like the courts, the wind, bad calls or anything else,  he said. The link-up with Djokovic is 47-year-old Agassi's first coaching job and marks his return to the game after retiring from the tour in 2006. The former world number one, who won eight Grand Slam titles in total, says he is enjoying the different stimulus that comes with coaching.  There is a level of pressure that is interesting because you are responsible for somebody else’s hopes and dreams,  he said.  I take that very seriously. That pressure comes and goes and in between you are more relaxed than as a player and you get to take in your environment,  he said.

The Outlook on FIBank's Long-Term IDR is Stable. The agency has also affirmed Raiffeisenbank (Bulgaria) EAD (Raiffeisenbank) and UniCredit Bulbank AD (Bulbank) at Long-Term IDR 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook and United Bulgarian Bank AD (UBB) at Long-Term IDR 'BBB+' with a Positive Outlook. Fitch has also upgraded UBB's VR to 'bb-' from 'b+' and affirmed the VRs of Raiffeisenbank and Bulbank at 'bb'. The upgrade of FIBank's Long-Term IDR and VR is driven by the stabilisation of the bank's asset quality, improvements in profitability and capitalisation and a moderation of the bank's risk appetite. The upgrade of UBB's VR reflects further moderate improvements in the bank's impaired loan ratio and coverage of impaired loans, expected benefits from the recent acquisition by KBC Bank (A/Stable/a) and greater emphasis in Fitch's assessment on the bank's sound capital and funding positions. The affirmation of the VRs of Raiffeisenbank and Bulbank reflects no major changes to their financial metrics over the last 12 months. The affirmation of Raiffeisenbank's, UBB's and Bulbank's IDRs reflects Fitch's opinion of a high probability that they would be supported, if required, by their respective parents. The three banks are owned, respectively, by Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI; 100% stake), KBC Bank (A/Stable/a; 99.9%) and UniCredit S.p.A. (BBB/Stable/bbb; 99.5%). KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Bulbank and Raiffeisenbank are based in the CEE region, which is strategically important for both Unicredit and RBI. The banks' synergies with their respective parents are strong and underpinned by long track records in supporting their parents' objectives - which is likely to continue - and a high level of management and operational integration. We see also strong synergies between UBB and KBC because Bulgaria is strategically important for KBC. KBC acquired UBB from National Bank of Greece (Restricted Default) on 14 June 2017 (see 'Fitch upgrades United Bulgarian Bank to 'BBB+' on acquisition by KBC; Outlook Positive' at www.fitchratings.com). In our opinion, any required support for the three banks would be small relative to their respective parents' ability to provide it. Our opinion reflects the owners' solid credit profiles and the small size of their Bulgarian subsidiaries relative to their respective parents. UBB could be rated within one notch of its parent were it not for the constraint from Bulgaria's Country Ceiling, which caps UBB's Long-Term IDR at 'BBB+'. Consequently, the Positive Outlook on UBB reflects that on the Bulgarian sovereign rating (BBB-/Positive). The Stable Outlooks on Raiffeisenbank's and Bulbank's Long-Term IDRs reflect our view that the risks related to their parents' credit profiles are broadly balanced. FIBank's IDRs are driven by standalone financial strength, as expressed by the bank's VR. The Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'No Floor' and the Support Rating (SR) of '5' for FIBank express Fitch's opinion that although potential sovereign support for the bank is possible, it cannot be relied upon. This is underpinned by the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, transposed into Bulgarian legislation, which requires senior creditors to participate in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of a bank receiving sovereign support. VRs Bulbank Bulbank's VR is constrained by our assessment of the challenging Bulgarian operating environment, which has particularly weighed on the bank's asset quality. Positively, the VR is underpinned by strong capital buffers, solid profitability, stable funding, comfortable liquidity and Bulbank's leading domestic market franchise. We expect Bulbank's fairly weak loan book quality to continue to improve in 2017 due to loan write-offs and healthy new loan origination. Its impaired loans ratio (about 11% at end-1Q17) is considerably better than the domestic sector average (about 18%), but is still quite high relative to other regional peers. This is mitigated by reasonable coverage of impaired loans by total reserves (about 73%), substantial capital buffers and a high proportion of low-risk exposures outside the loan book. Capitalisation is underpinned by the bank's high capital surplus over regulatory minimums, strong recurring profitability and moderate risk appetite. However, capital adequacy must be viewed in the context of the still difficult operating environment. At end-1Q17, the Fitch Core Capital (FCC) ratio, adjusting for a likely full distribution of 2016 annual profit, was 26.9%. Unreserved impaired loans accounted for a moderate share (about 13%) of adjusted FCC. Bulbank's strong franchise and large size have translated into more resilient through-the-cycle performance than Bulgarian peers. The bank's ratio of operating profit/risk-weighted assets (RWA; 3.8% in 2016) compares favourably with regional peers', reflecting a still wide net interest margin (3.9% in 2016) and high cost efficiency (cost/income ratio of 37%). Refinancing risks are low because the bank is self-funded with customer deposits. Bulbank has a strong deposit franchise, high liquidity buffers and can rely on ordinary liquidity support from its parent. The loans/deposits ratio fell to 80% at end-1Q17, from 86% at end-2015, reflecting continuing deposit inflows. Highly liquid assets covered 49% of customer deposits at end-1Q17. Raiffeisenbank Raiffeisenbank's VR reflects the bank's successful and fast reduction of impaired loans, cautious new lending, low refinancing risk, robust capitalisation, improving profitability and a moderately strong company profile. Raiffeisenbank's asset quality should remain one of the strongest in the banking sector due to the bank's successful and swift portfolio clean-up and moderate risk appetite. At end-2016, the bank's impaired loan ratio fell to 7.1% (from 19% at end-2013) and then improved further in 1Q17. The bank's conservative underwriting standards are underpinned by a well-developed risk-control environment and tight parental control. The bank is self-funded with granular deposits (89% loans/deposits ratio at end-2016) and could also rely on liquidity support from RBI. Its ample liquidity buffer equalled 29% of assets or 40% of customer deposits at end-2016. At end-2016, the bank's FCC ratio was robust (about 22% net of the proposed dividend on 2016 income). Fitch's assessment of capitalisation is also underpinned by the bank's moderate risk appetite, limited expansion plans and relatively stable pre-impairment profit generation compared with local peers. Improvement in the bank's operating profit/RWAs (2016: 4%, 2015: 2.2%) was mainly driven by smaller credit losses and lower funding costs. However, the bank's results in 2017 will be moderately weaker due to pressure on credit spreads and limited opportunities for further reductions in funding and operating costs. At end-2016, the bank was ranked sixth by total assets (about 7% market share). Its loan pricing power is weak, but the cost of its deposit funding was one of the lowest in the sector. The bank's through-the-cycle performance has been somewhat variable, but more resilient than most local peers due to the bank's stable business model and experienced management. UBB UBB's VR primarily reflects the bank's substantial capital buffers, solid pre-impairment profitability and limited refinancing risks. However, it also reflects the bank's weak, albeit improving, asset quality and some profitability pressures. The bank's impaired loans ratio has moderately improved (27.5% at end-1Q17, down from 29.6% at end-2015) due to loan write-offs, but it is still the highest among peers, mainly reflecting legacy problems. The inflow of new bad debt should remain contained. Significant improvement of loan quality metrics could be difficult to achieve, however, due to continuing loan book contraction. Coverage of impaired loans by total reserves strengthened (to 56% at end-1Q17 from 51% at end-2015) but remains only adequate compared with higher-rated peers, which is partly mitigated by available capital buffers. Capitalisation is underpinned by the bank's substantial capital buffers, solid pre-impairment profits and moderate risk appetite, which mitigate challenges stemming from the operating environment and weak asset quality. The bank maintained high capital buffers over regulatory minimums despite sizeable dividend pay-outs to its previous owner in 4Q16 and 1Q17. At end-1Q17, its adjusted FCC ratio (reflecting the dividend and 1Q17 net profit) was 24.4%. Unreserved impaired loans absorbed 54% of the adjusted FCC. However, if all outstanding impaired loans were 80% covered, the FCC ratio would drop to a still healthy 18.4%. Pre-impairment profitability has been supported by strong net interest margin (4.4% at end-2016) and good cost efficiency (cost/income ratio of 45%), which has offset high loan impairment charges (LICs; equal to 2.3% of average gross loans). At end-2016, operating profit/RWAs of 2.3% was average compared with peers. In 2017 UBB may face additional LICs due to its full asset review following the acquisition by KBC. UBB's limited refinancing risks reflect the bank's stable deposit-based funding, substantial liquidity buffers and potential liquidity support from KBC. At end-2016, the loans/deposits ratio fell to a comfortable 82% (end-2015: 97%) due to loan book shrinkage and deposit inflows. At end-1Q17, highly liquid assets covered about 35% of the customer deposit base. FIBank The upgrade of FIBank's VR predominantly reflects the stabilisation of the bank's asset quality metrics and improvements in the risk management framework, including consistent application of loan classification criteria in line with industry standards. It also reflects the reduction of unreserved impaired exposures, improved capitalisation - albeit this is still weak compared with peers - and improved loss absorption capacity through recurring profit generation. The VR is also supported by the bank's stable funding based on granular retail deposits and healthy liquidity. FIBank's VR continues to reflect significant asset quality problems associated with legacy loans, with the impaired loans ratio materially above the sector average, unreserved impaired loans equal to 71% of FCC, and a large stock of non-income generating repossessed assets equal to around 123% of FCC at end-2016. The VR also factors in significant and only gradually declining single-name concentrations in the loan book and still only moderate, albeit improved, capital buffers given FIBank's risk exposures. FIBank's risk management framework has improved and risk appetite has been reduced. The record of the bank's operation under the new risk management structure is, however, still short and legacy problems will continue to weigh on the risk profile of the bank over the medium term. Corporate governance deficiencies have largely been addressed, but some weaknesses are still present, in Fitch's view. These relate mainly to limited representation of independent members in the board. The bank's impaired loans ratio remained broadly unchanged at 24.4% at end-2016 (end-2015: 23.9%). Fitch expects the reported asset quality ratio to improve over 2017, driven by a contained inflow of new impaired loans, modest growth of new lending and moderate clean-up of the impaired loan stock through work-outs and write-offs. Coverage of impaired loans by provisions improved over 2016, but remained modest at 58% at end-2016. The loan book, although reasonably well-diversified across economic sectors, has large single-name concentrations. These are being gradually reduced, but no material reduction is expected over the medium term given the long-term nature of many of the largest exposures. The bank returned to operating profitability based on recurring revenues in 2016 supported by a strong net interest margin (around 5%) and reasonable cost efficiency (49% cost/income ratio) as well as more moderate impairment charges (around 260bps of average gross loans; 2015: 520bps). The record of improved profitability is short; however, operating profitability is likely to be supported by contained impairment charges driven by an improved economic environment. Earnings have, however, been weaker and more volatile through the cycle than at peers. Some weaknesses in FIBank's lending franchise and a reduction of risk appetite are putting pressure on lending margins, and further potential reduction in funding costs may not be sufficient to mitigate these. This was evident in 1Q17 results, with the net interest margin falling to around 4.2%, albeit still in line with that posted by peers in 2016. FIBank's FCC ratio improved over 2016 to 13.7% due to profits generated during the year, which will be fully retained. The quality of capital has also improved, although unreserved impaired loans still accounted for a high 71% of FCC at end-2016 (2015: 93%). Loss absorption capacity is enhanced by BGN210 million (equal to 3.4% of RWAs) of Basel 3 compliant AT1 securities included in regulatory Tier 1 capital. Capital buffers above Tier 1 regulatory minimum were moderate at end-2016, but will increase by around 160bp following the inclusion of 2016 profit. Funding is a rating strength and refinancing risk is low. Granular, mostly retail customer deposits accounted for 96% of total funding at end-2016. The growth of customer deposits in both 2015 and 2016 suggests that FIBank's deposit franchise has recovered from the turbulence that resulted in state liquidity support in 2014, which was fully repaid in 2016. However, FIBank's deposit funding relies mostly on term deposits, while the share of cheaper current and saving account deposits is lower than peers. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SUPPORT RATINGS The IDRs and SR of Raiffeisenbank, Bulbank and UBB are sensitive to our view of ability or propensity of their respective parents to support their Bulgarian subsidiaries. We do not expect the banks' owners' support propensity to weaken. UBB would be upgraded if Bulgaria's Country Ceiling is revised upwards. FIBank's IDRs are sensitive to changes in the bank's VR. VRs An upgrade of Raiffeisenbank's and Bulbank's VRs would require an improvement of the operating environment and a further strengthening of overall credit profile (Raiffeisenbank). An upgrade of UBB would require a significant reduction of its high impaired loans, a strengthening of its general risk management framework and an extended record of solid financial results. A further upgrade of FIBank would require faster resolution of legacy impaired loans, a reduction of loan book concentrations and monetisation of repossessed assets without denting its capitalisation, and a longer record of sound profitability. Deterioration in the operating environment, which would result in a substantial inflow of new bad debt and capital erosion at the four banks, could lead to downgrades of their VRs.

The previously undisclosed details on the negotiations show how Amazon used its deep pockets and brand as leverage to convince Whole Foods to accept a sale process that would not result in a bidding war. Whole Food shares traded above Amazon's $42-per-share deal price for the first few days after the agreement was announced on June 16, on investor expectations of a higher bid. They have since traded slightly below that price, as such hopes dampened. The regulatory filing shows that Whole Foods agreed to forgo an auction process after it received expressions of interest from two other companies and four private equity firms. None of these parties are identified by name. The filing refers to a 'company X,' which proposed a merger of equals that valued Whole Foods at between $35 and $40 per share. U.S. supermarket chain owner Albertsons LLC is company X, a source familiar with the matter said. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. Nevertheless, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods agreed not to pursue this, or solicit any other bids, in part because Amazon was  very sensitive with respect to confidentiality  and did not want to compete in a broader sale process, the filing said.  Whole Foods said in the filing it sought $45 per share from Amazon but settled for $42 per share, which the ecommerce giant called its  best and final offer.  Amazon had offered $41 in May, according to the filing. Amazon had also told Whole Foods it was considering other opportunities in case its final offer was turned down. The filing added that Amazon reserved the right to terminate the talks if there was any leak or rumor of its interest in Whole Foods.  The other company that expressed interest in Whole Foods, referred to in the filing as 'company Y,' had an interest in exploring a commercial relationship, such as a supply arrangement, and did not discuss any merger or acquisition, according to the filing. Whole Foods' management, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC to explore a sale of the company, decided not to solicit proposals from the four private equity firms as the price proposed by Amazon likely exceeded the amount a private equity buyer could be expected to pay, according to the filing.

Edinburgh-based Celtic Renewables has developed a process to manufacture the biofuel biobutanol from draff and pot ale - barley kernels and a yeasty liquid that are produced when whisky is made and then usually thrown away. Martin Tangney, the president of Celtic Renewables and director of Edinburgh Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre, said that a desire to effectively manage resources had inspired him to pursue the project.   What I did was I look at this as a business innovation as much as a technical innovation and thought: 'if 70 percent of the cost of production is coming from the raw materials – why not tackle that end of it?'  he told Reuters by telephone on Friday. Tangney showed the new fuel's efficiency by driving a rental car filled with the mixture around the university's car park this week. Bourbon whiskey barrels in St. Philip, Barbados December 2, 2016. Picture taken December 2, 2016.Adrees LatifTangney said that Celtic would get inexpensive or free raw materials from the distillery it works with, who were keen to cut the 300,000 pounds ($386,370.00) a year it costs to dispose of the whisky waste residues. Biobutanol also has an advantage over other biofuels. More of it can be included in consumer petrol - as much as 15 percent - without requiring engine modifications. With the assistance of 9 million pounds of funding support from the Scottish government and other investors, the company plans to open a factory in 2018 that can produce 500,000 liters of the fuel annually.  With the raw material available throughout Scotland, Tangney estimates it could eventually produce 50 million liters of biofuel each year.  The whisky industry will now have a sustainable and reliable way of disposing of their residue , Tangney said.  Plus we’ll create a brand new industry out of something that has no value whatsoever.

Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index ended the day up 0.2 percent at 7,350.92 points, reversing earlier losses after weak housing data drove sterling to a nine-day low, helping the index's dollar earners. Non-farm payrolls data from the U.S. showing stronger than expected jobs growth also helped support gains which led blue chips to their first positive week since the end of May. Oil & gas stocks dropped however after oil prices fell more than 1 percent following a rise in U.S. output, with Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.L. and BP down 0.9 percent each.  Regardless of what OPEC try and do, it seems the supply overhang is preventing any kind of sustainable rally,  Ian Williams, strategist at Peel Hunt, said. Financials were also weaker, with HSBC and Barclays both in negative territory, cooling after the sector hit its highest level since the end of February in the previous session on expectations of higher interest rates. Supporting the index, shares in easyJet rose 5.3 percent after Credit Suisse upgraded the budget airline to  outperform  on the back of an improvement in summer trading. Utility Centrica was among biggest gainers, up 2.8 percent on takeover rumours, although analysts at Jefferies were sceptical. Royal Mail was the worst performer on the day after UBS cuts its rating to  sell  from  neutral , saying the company would continue to see sub-market growth in parcel volume due to its need to modernise. WPP also fell 2.7 percent after Exane BNP Paribas cut the advertising firm  to  underperform  and downgraded French peer Publicis to  neutral , saying they need to evolve more quickly.  Marketing is driven by mobile, nimbler brands, ecommerce and automation/AI. These areas are dominated by platforms where agencies are sparse, raising the risk of lower mid-term growth,  analysts at Exane said.  WPP & Publicis have good track records of adapting to industry changes. We would buy once evidence they have adapted mounts, or on a much greater valuation discount,  they added. Outside of the blue chips, a strong trading update from retailer Dunelm sent its shares 5.4 percent higher to the top of the FTSE 250, which closed 0.1 percent higher. In a second takeover in as many days for British small-caps, Cape shares soared 46 percent after French construction equipment maker Altrad Investment Authority said it would buy the oil services firm.  It's been a little surprising we have not seen more international buyers [for UK companies] given the fact that sterling has been so cheap,  said Andy Jackson, manager of the UK value opportunities fund at Miton.

The previously undisclosed details on the negotiations show how Amazon used its deep pockets and brand as leverage to convince Whole Foods to accept a sale process that would not result in a bidding war. Whole Food shares traded above Amazon's $42-per-share deal price for the first few days after the agreement was announced on June 16, on investor expectations of a higher bid. They have since traded slightly below that price, as such hopes dampened. The regulatory filing shows that Whole Foods agreed to forgo an auction process after it received expressions of interest from two other companies and four private equity firms. None of these parties are identified by name. The filing refers to a 'company X,' which proposed a merger of equals that valued Whole Foods at between $35 and $40 per share. U.S. supermarket chain owner Albertsons LLC is company X, a source familiar with the matter said. Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment. Nevertheless, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods agreed not to pursue this, or solicit any other bids, in part because Amazon was  very sensitive with respect to confidentiality  and did not want to compete in a broader sale process, the filing said.  Whole Foods said in the filing it sought $45 per share from Amazon but settled for $42 per share, which the ecommerce giant called its  best and final offer.  Amazon had offered $41 in May, according to the filing. Amazon had also told Whole Foods it was considering other opportunities in case its final offer was turned down. The filing added that Amazon reserved the right to terminate the talks if there was any leak or rumor of its interest in Whole Foods.  The other company that expressed interest in Whole Foods, referred to in the filing as 'company Y,' had an interest in exploring a commercial relationship, such as a supply arrangement, and did not discuss any merger or acquisition, according to the filing. Whole Foods' management, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC to explore a sale of the company, decided not to solicit proposals from the four private equity firms as the price proposed by Amazon likely exceeded the amount a private equity buyer could be expected to pay, according to the filing.

Researchers found that women with depressive symptoms were also more likely to have money worries, caregiving responsibilities or chronic health conditions, suggesting there are many issues that could contribute to depression in this age group. Treatment for depression should therefore address the hormonal problems in this mix that are modifiable, the study team writes in Menopause. “Other studies had already shown that when women were perimenopausal or early postmenopausal that there is an increased vulnerability to depressive symptoms,” senior study author Susan Davis told Reuters Health by email. “We were interested in whether hot flushes were indicative of heightened vulnerability - and we found this to be the case,” said Davis, a researcher with the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University in Melbourne. Davis and colleagues enrolled more than 1,500 mostly white women between the ages of 65 and 79 who were randomly selected from Australian voter rolls.  The women answered questionnaires that asked about life and financial circumstances, relationships, health problems and medication use. They also asked about post-menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats and pain during intercourse, as well as about depressive symptoms and recent use of anti-depressant medications. One of every three women reported having hot flashes, which also increased their risk of depressive symptoms by 67 percent compared to women without hot flashes.  One in four women had used a psychotropic medication such as an antidepressant in the previous month. Women with partners were about 40 percent less likely to have depression symptoms compared to women who were alone. Women who were employed had less than half the risk of depressive symptoms compared to women who were unemployed.  While hot flashes, vaginal dryness and pelvic floor dysfunction were each independently associated with depression risk, the study cannot prove that these or any other factors examined in the analysis cause depression.  Davis, however, said loss of estrogen could be a contributor. “Estrogen has major central effects in the brain and the sudden fall in estrogen at menopause can cause some women to become profoundly anxious (or depressed),  she said.  After childbirth the sudden drop in hormones can have the same effect.” Older women with hot flashes, vaginal dryness or pelvic floor concerns should be evaluated for depression,  particularly if they have financial housing issues or significant caregiving responsibilities,” Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email.  “Women going through the menopause are four times more likely to suffer from depression than women who are younger than 45,” said Pinkerton, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Charlottesville, Virginia, and executive director of the North American Menopause Society Depression is not anxiety, bouts of sadness, low mood or mood swings but a mental disorder defined by the feeling of extreme sadness lasting for more than two weeks, often with no specific cause, and which interferes with everyday life, Pinkerton said. As far as treatment, evidence doesn't support hormone therapy as a first treatment of depression, although it is often used along with counseling or antidepressants, she noted. “For more severe depression, antidepressant medications can be used to correct the chemical imbalance and some have been found to relieve hot flashes. If depression is severe, antidepressant medication is most effective when used in combination with counseling or psychotherapy,” she said. For mild to moderate depression, herbal remedies such as St. John’s wort, cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle changes may be helpful, such as prioritizing tasks, exercising, engaging in activities, recognizing the effect of stress on your mood, she said.  Women with a history of perimenopause-related depression that improves on hormone therapy need to be monitored after hormone therapy is stopped, as their depressive symptoms may recur, Pinkerton added.

The £3bn-equivalent five-tranche transaction allowed the company, which leases homes to the Ministry of Defence, to slice its eye-watering borrowing costs nearly in half.   transaction is transformational and puts Annington in a strong position with both cheaper and longer-term debt that sets us up well for the future, said James Hopkins, Annington's CEO. The proceeds from the new notes, sold off Annington's £2.5bn EMTN programme, will be used to refinance much of its old debt, which includes a string of structured notes and a high-yield-style PIK toggle, issued in 2012 with a whopping 13% coupon. Annington was created in 1996 to acquire more than 57,400 residential properties from the Ministry of Defence, the majority of which were immediately leased back to the MoD on a 200-year lease. The company refurbishes and sells or rents on the open market those homes released by the MoD as surplus to its needs.  When we acquired Annington in 2012, we always knew there was a single issue that would hold the business back – its legacy capital structure,  said Andrew Geczy, CEO of private equity company and Annington owner Terra Firma.  I'm definitely a fan of the new Annington issue,  said Gordon Shannon, a portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management.  Given the volatile political situation and uncertainty around government spending, defence policy and Brexit, the MoD appears to be taking a pretty conservative approach to housing stock releases.  Annington owns almost 40,000 homes, with most still leased to the MoD, making it one of the largest private owners of residential property in England and Wales.  Effectively, they are turning a fairly complex capital structure into something far simpler,  Shannon said.  The covenants on the new unsecured issuance were very strong, so revenues allocated to bondholders remain predictable. You are buying UK government-backed income streams, with upside potential if we see an acceleration of old MoD housing stock disposal again.  Geczy told IFR that the latest transaction would afford Annington the possibility of cashing in on lucrative UK real estate opportunities.  This deal will allow Annington to incrementally expand its activities in the private rental sector and it will be key to the company finding opportunities around the UK,  he said.  It will allow the firm to make the right kind of deals, and free up cashflow, which will be key for the firm to expand in the UK real estate market.  Taking Action After wrapping up its roadshow on Tuesday, Annington came to the market the following day with a £625m eight-year tranche, a £600m 12-year, a £625m 17-year and a £625m 30-year. The issuer locked in coupons of 2.646%, 3.184%, 3.685% and 3.935%, respectively. It also offered a €500m seven-year piece at 1.65%.  It was one of the most complex deals that we have worked on, given the company's complicated capital structure,  said Marco Baldini, head of European bond syndicate at Barclays.  We had been working on the deal since the beginning of this year, and the timing of the deal was dependent on all the different workstreams like the LM being completed, but we knew it was coming and were on standby.  Annington launched a liability management exercise for four of its structured notes at the end of June, which totalled over £2.9bn. The sterling portion of the bond became the second biggest corporate sterling bond of all time at £2.475bn. Last year, National Grid Gas Finance sold a £3bn five-trancher.  We wanted to make sure that the deal made sense for the market, and that there was sufficient liquidity in the market for the size and structure which we wanted to do,  Geczy said.  We were also very keen to get the deal done ahead of the summer, as we didn't want to risk being hit by potential interest rate increases further into the year.  Annington (NR/BBB/BBB) wrapped up its European roadshow on Tuesday via bookrunners Barclays and JP Morgan. Adding to this week's corporate sterling supply was Volkswagen Financial Services. The borrower sold a £300m long five-year bond at 115bp over Gilts on Wednesday, on orders of £320m. Volkswagen, rated A2/BBB+ by Moody's/S&P; (expected), mandated RBC CM and Santander as joint bookrunners.

Analyses by computer experts showed that waves of attacks had been launched via software updates of the M.E.Doc accounting software since April, the BSI said in a statement. That meant that companies that used the software might have been infected by the malicious software, even if there were no obvious signs of a breach, BSI said. Data backups carried out after April 13 should also be viewed as compromised.  Some German firms have seen production and other critical processes laid still for over a week,  BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said.  It has resulted in millions of euros of damage, and this in a case where Germany got off lightly.  BSI last week said more than a dozen German companies had been affected by the virus which has been dubbed  NotPetya  by some experts, all via a subsidiary in Ukraine. The Ukrainian software firm used to launch the global cyber attack this week said all computers sharing a network with its infected accounting software had been compromised by hackers. The German statement added to the growing conviction among experts that the global attack was more harmful than initially believed. The virus took down thousands of computers in dozens of countries, disrupting shipping and businesses.  German security officials are still investigating the origin of the virus and do not have reliable data to confirm a claim by the Ukrainian government that Russia was behind the attack. Chancellor Angela Merkel is hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin and other world leaders in Hamburg this week, but there has been little public discussion about cyber security. Schoenbohm said the latest attacks were at least harmful as the WannaCry ransomware attacks seen in May. The agency said it had information making clear that significant efforts were required to restore business processes once infected.  We must continue to increase Germany's resilience in the wake of cyber attacks,  Schoenbohm said. The agency urged German companies to separate networks that had the M.E. Doc software installed, to increase network surveillance and to look for any signs of compromise. Password changes and software updates for all infected networks were crucial, the agency said, noting that companies should also review administrative settings for networks.

The meeting comes after a Pakistani counter-terrorism court sentenced a 30-year-old man to death for making blasphemous comments on Facebook, part of a wider crack-down. Joel Kaplan, Facebook's vice president of public policy, met Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan, who offered to approve a Facebook office in Pakistan, which has 33 million users of the network. Khan said Pakistan believes in freedom of expression, but that does not include insulting Islam or stoking religious tensions.  We cannot allow anyone to misuse social media for hurting religious sentiments,  Khan said. Facebook called the meeting  constructive .  Facebook met with Pakistan officials to express the company's deep commitment to protecting the rights of the people who use its service, and to enabling people to express themselves freely and safely,  the company said in an email.  It was an important and constructive meeting in which we raised our concerns over the recent court cases and made it clear we apply a strict legal process to any government request for data or content restrictions.  Pakistan's social media crack-down is officially aimed at weeding out blasphemy and shutting down accounts promoting terrorism, but civil rights activists say it has also swept up writers and bloggers who criticize the government or military.  One of five prominent writers and activists who disappeared for nearly three weeks this year later told a U.N. human rights event in March that Pakistan's intelligence agencies had kidnapped him and tortured him in custody. Others' families said right-wing and Islamist parties had filed blasphemy accusations against them to punish them for critical writings. Anything deemed insulting to Islam or the Prophet Muhammad carries a death penalty in Pakistan, and sometimes a mere allegation can lead to mob violence and lynchings. Right groups say the law is frequently abused to settle personal scores. In April, a Pakistani university student, Mashal Khan, was beaten to death by a mob after being accused of blasphemous content on Facebook. Police arrested 57 people accused in the attack and said they had found no evidence Khan committed blasphemy.

Rowe will report to Chief Administrative Officer Hope Hardison, effective immediately, Wells Fargo said in a statement.  Investor relations had previously been separate from the other functions and reported to Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry. The change comes after an internal investigation found the bank was too decentralized, a problem that contributed to a culture that allowed employees to create as many as 2.1 million unauthorized customer accounts without getting the necessary attention from top management. Since the scandal, Wells Fargo replaced its chief executive, who retired, and has overhauled its government relations and public policy unit.

The meeting comes after a Pakistani counter-terrorism court sentenced a 30-year-old man to death for making blasphemous comments on Facebook, part of a wider crack-down. Joel Kaplan, Facebook's vice president of public policy, met Interior Minister Nisar Ali Khan, who offered to approve a Facebook office in Pakistan, which has 33 million users of the network. Khan said Pakistan believes in freedom of expression, but that does not include insulting Islam or stoking religious tensions.  We cannot allow anyone to misuse social media for hurting religious sentiments,  Khan said. Facebook called the meeting  constructive .  Facebook met with Pakistan officials to express the company's deep commitment to protecting the rights of the people who use its service, and to enabling people to express themselves freely and safely,  the company said in an email.  It was an important and constructive meeting in which we raised our concerns over the recent court cases and made it clear we apply a strict legal process to any government request for data or content restrictions.  Pakistan's social media crack-down is officially aimed at weeding out blasphemy and shutting down accounts promoting terrorism, but civil rights activists say it has also swept up writers and bloggers who criticize the government or military.  One of five prominent writers and activists who disappeared for nearly three weeks this year later told a U.N. human rights event in March that Pakistan's intelligence agencies had kidnapped him and tortured him in custody. Others' families said right-wing and Islamist parties had filed blasphemy accusations against them to punish them for critical writings. Anything deemed insulting to Islam or the Prophet Muhammad carries a death penalty in Pakistan, and sometimes a mere allegation can lead to mob violence and lynchings. Right groups say the law is frequently abused to settle personal scores. In April, a Pakistani university student, Mashal Khan, was beaten to death by a mob after being accused of blasphemous content on Facebook. Police arrested 57 people accused in the attack and said they had found no evidence Khan committed blasphemy.

Analyses by computer experts showed that waves of attacks had been launched via software updates of the M.E.Doc accounting software since April, the BSI said in a statement. That meant that companies that used the software might have been infected by the malicious software, even if there were no obvious signs of a breach, BSI said. Data backups carried out after April 13 should also be viewed as compromised.  Some German firms have seen production and other critical processes laid still for over a week,  BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said.  It has resulted in millions of euros of damage, and this in a case where Germany got off lightly.  BSI last week said more than a dozen German companies had been affected by the virus which has been dubbed  NotPetya  by some experts, all via a subsidiary in Ukraine. The Ukrainian software firm used to launch the global cyber attack this week said all computers sharing a network with its infected accounting software had been compromised by hackers. The German statement added to the growing conviction among experts that the global attack was more harmful than initially believed. The virus took down thousands of computers in dozens of countries, disrupting shipping and businesses.  German security officials are still investigating the origin of the virus and do not have reliable data to confirm a claim by the Ukrainian government that Russia was behind the attack. Chancellor Angela Merkel is hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin and other world leaders in Hamburg this week, but there has been little public discussion about cyber security. Schoenbohm said the latest attacks were at least harmful as the WannaCry ransomware attacks seen in May. The agency said it had information making clear that significant efforts were required to restore business processes once infected.  We must continue to increase Germany's resilience in the wake of cyber attacks,  Schoenbohm said. The agency urged German companies to separate networks that had the M.E. Doc software installed, to increase network surveillance and to look for any signs of compromise. Password changes and software updates for all infected networks were crucial, the agency said, noting that companies should also review administrative settings for networks.

The rating action follows Elite's announcement on 5 July 2017 that the insurer will cease writing new business with immediate effect and go into run-off. Fitch will resolve the RWN after a review of the company's run-off plan and additional financial information, including discussions with Elite's senior management. The review will assess the robustness of the run-off plan, including the sufficiency of reserves to carry out an orderly run-off process. Equally, understanding the foundations of the company's expected financial performance will be key in determining Elite's future ratings. RATING SENSITIVITIES Elite's ratings are likely to be downgraded if Fitch's assessment concludes that reserves are likely to be insufficient to meet insurance liabilities in the run-off process. The ratings are also likely to be downgraded if Elite's capital, as measured by Fitch's Prism Factor-Based Model (FBM), weakens to a capital score of 'Somewhat Weak' from 'Adequate' currently. Elite's ratings are expected to be affirmed if Fitch's assessment concludes that reserves are likely to prove sufficient to meet insurance liabilities as they fall due provided Elite maintains an 'Adequate' level of capitalisation as measured by Prism FBM.

Non-farm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, driven by hefty gains in healthcare, government, restaurants and professional and business services sectors, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was the second biggest payrolls increase this year and beat economists' expectations for a 179,000 rise. The economy also created 47,000 more jobs in April and May than previously reported. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.  The continued vitality in the U.S. labor market means that the Fed is on track to begin shrinking its balance sheet in September and to raise rates again in December,  said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts. The jobless rate has dropped four-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the most recent Fed median forecast for 2017. Though the average workweek increased to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in May, wage growth remained stubbornly tepid, putting a wrinkle in the otherwise upbeat employment report. Average hourly earnings increased four cents, or 0.2 percent, in June after gaining 0.1 percent in May. That lifted the year-on-year wage increase to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in May, suggesting some slack still remains in the labor market. U.S. financial markets shrugged off the anemic wage growth and investors focused on the jump in payrolls, which reinforced views that the economy regained speed in the second quarter after a lackluster performance at the start of the year. Stocks on Wall Street .SPX were trading higher and the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies .DXY. Prices for U.S. Treasuries US10YT=RR fell.   The overall takeaway for the growth picture is that the economy seems to have finished the second quarter with decent momentum, and fears of a sharp slowing in the third quarter should be mollified by today's report,  said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Related CoverageInstant View: U.S. job growth accelerates in June, but wage growth slowRepublican President Donald Trump, who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration, has pledged to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes and cutting regulation. But Republicans have struggled with healthcare legislation overhaul and there are worries that political scandals could derail the Trump administration's economic agenda. Worker Shortage There is optimism that the tightening labor market will soon spur faster wage growth amid growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Some economists, including the Fed, believe that weak productivity is constraining wages. FILE PHOTO: Leaflets lie on a table at a booth at a military veterans' job fair in Carson, California October 3, 2014.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoOthers argued soft economic growth last year hurt wages.  Wage inflation was never going to be a 2017 event. You get paid this year based on how your firm did last year and last year was a slow year for GDP and, more importantly, earnings,  said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.  Wages are accelerating in some industries, just not enough industries to push up the averages.  The Federal Reserve - the U.S. central bank - raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in June for the second time this year. With inflation, however, retreating further below the Fed's 2 percent target in May, economists expect another rate hike only in December. They expect an announcement in September on starting to reduce the Fed's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.8 percent. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.6 percent last month. This alternative measure of unemployment hit a 9-1/2-year low in May. It has declined eight-tenths of a percentage point this year. Employment gains were broad in June, with manufacturing payrolls rising 1,000 after factories shed 2,000 jobs in May. But the automobile sector lost a further 1,300 jobs as slowing sales and bloated inventories forced manufacturers to cut production. The sector has shed jobs for three straight months. Ford Motor Co (F.N) has announced plans to slash 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Others, like General Motors (GM.N), are embarking on extended summer assembly plant shutdowns, which will leave workers temporarily unemployed. Construction added another 16,000 jobs last month. Healthcare employment surged by 59,100, while the professional and business services sector created 35,000 jobs. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger of future hiring, increased by 13,400. Restaurants and bars hired 29,300 workers. Retailers recruited 8,100 workers, a respite for a sector which had shed jobs for four straight months. Department store operators like J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), Macy's Inc (M.N) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF.N) are struggling with stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon (AMZN.O). Government employment rebounded by 35,000 jobs last month, with gains at federal and local governments.

Non-farm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, driven by hefty gains in healthcare, government, restaurants and professional and business services sectors, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was the second biggest payrolls increase this year and beat economists' expectations for a 179,000 rise. The economy also created 47,000 more jobs in April and May than previously reported. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.  The continued vitality in the U.S. labor market means that the Fed is on track to begin shrinking its balance sheet in September and to raise rates again in December,  said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit in Lexington, Massachusetts. The jobless rate has dropped four-tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the most recent Fed median forecast for 2017. Though the average workweek increased to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in May, wage growth remained stubbornly tepid, putting a wrinkle in the otherwise upbeat employment report. Average hourly earnings increased four cents, or 0.2 percent, in June after gaining 0.1 percent in May. That lifted the year-on-year wage increase to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in May, suggesting some slack still remains in the labor market. U.S. financial markets shrugged off the anemic wage growth and investors focused on the jump in payrolls, which reinforced views that the economy regained speed in the second quarter after a lackluster performance at the start of the year. Stocks on Wall Street .SPX were trading higher and the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies .DXY. Prices for U.S. Treasuries US10YT=RR fell.   The overall takeaway for the growth picture is that the economy seems to have finished the second quarter with decent momentum, and fears of a sharp slowing in the third quarter should be mollified by today's report,  said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. Related CoverageInstant View: U.S. job growth accelerates in June, but wage growth slowRepublican President Donald Trump, who inherited a strong job market from the Obama administration, has pledged to sharply boost economic growth and further strengthen the labor market by slashing taxes and cutting regulation. But Republicans have struggled with healthcare legislation overhaul and there are worries that political scandals could derail the Trump administration's economic agenda. Worker Shortage There is optimism that the tightening labor market will soon spur faster wage growth amid growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Some economists, including the Fed, believe that weak productivity is constraining wages. FILE PHOTO: Leaflets lie on a table at a booth at a military veterans' job fair in Carson, California October 3, 2014.Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoOthers argued soft economic growth last year hurt wages.  Wage inflation was never going to be a 2017 event. You get paid this year based on how your firm did last year and last year was a slow year for GDP and, more importantly, earnings,  said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.  Wages are accelerating in some industries, just not enough industries to push up the averages.  The Federal Reserve - the U.S. central bank - raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in June for the second time this year. With inflation, however, retreating further below the Fed's 2 percent target in May, economists expect another rate hike only in December. They expect an announcement in September on starting to reduce the Fed's $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.8 percent. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.6 percent last month. This alternative measure of unemployment hit a 9-1/2-year low in May. It has declined eight-tenths of a percentage point this year. Employment gains were broad in June, with manufacturing payrolls rising 1,000 after factories shed 2,000 jobs in May. But the automobile sector lost a further 1,300 jobs as slowing sales and bloated inventories forced manufacturers to cut production. The sector has shed jobs for three straight months. Ford Motor Co (F.N) has announced plans to slash 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Others, like General Motors (GM.N), are embarking on extended summer assembly plant shutdowns, which will leave workers temporarily unemployed. Construction added another 16,000 jobs last month. Healthcare employment surged by 59,100, while the professional and business services sector created 35,000 jobs. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger of future hiring, increased by 13,400. Restaurants and bars hired 29,300 workers. Retailers recruited 8,100 workers, a respite for a sector which had shed jobs for four straight months. Department store operators like J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), Macy's Inc (M.N) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF.N) are struggling with stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon (AMZN.O). Government employment rebounded by 35,000 jobs last month, with gains at federal and local governments.

The 29-year-old proved too solid for a listless Nishikori, winning 6-4 7-6(3) 3-6 6-3 on Court Three.  I could not get into my rhythm,  Nishikori told a large gathering of Japanese reporters.  It was really hard for me to be aggressive today. In the third set I began to move him around a bit but it didn't last long enough unfortunately. I totally lost my rhythm out there.  It has been a mediocre year for Nishikori who is struggling to build on the promise he showed when he reached the 2014 U.S. Open final, losing to Marin Cilic. After reaching the final in two of his first three tournaments of 2017 he has not made one since and has been suffering with niggling injuries. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 7, 2017   Japan’s Kei Nishikori in action during his third round match against Spain’s Roberto Bautista AgutAndrew CouldridgeOn Friday he paid the price for failing to take his break point chances in the first set, especially at 4-4 when Bautista Agut saved one with a crisp forehand winner. The Spaniard broke in the next game to take the opening set. Slideshow (3 Images)It was a similar story in the second set with Nishikori unable to convert any of the five break point chances that came his way before succumbing in a tiebreak in which Bautista Agut reeled off the last four points. Nishikori, who has never flourished on grass and is yet to go past the fourth round at Wimbledon, did briefly gain the upper hand as he took the third set. When he broke at the start of the fourth with a running forehand pass, to the delight of his fans, it seemed the match could swing his way but it proved a false dawn. Eighteenth seed Bautista Agut belted a forehand winner to break back for and delivered another hammer blow to move 5-3 ahead before sealing victory as Nishikori skewed a backhand out. Bautista Agut will face stiffer opposition on Monday when he plays Croatia's seventh seed Marin Cilic.

In their weekly round up of global asset flows, BAML said the prospect of more U.S. rate hikes, combined with the ECB readying to scale back its stimulus, meant markets were at a  massive inflection point  in the decade-long easy money trade. Year-to-date $170 billion has been pumped into equities while $208 billion has gone into bonds. It means both asset classes are on track for record years in terms of inflows if they keep it up, but BAML is doubtful.  Next 6 months, higher interest rates likely much more negative for stocks & credit given new central bank policies,  its strategists wrote.  Will likely lead to 'Humpty Dumpty' big fall in market in autumn, in our view.  Over the last week from Wednesday-to Wednesday for BAML's number crunchers, there were already some signs a shift may be taking place. Tech funds saw their largest redemptions in 30 weeks, for consumer sector-focused funds it was the biggest in 21 weeks, while Eurozone equity funds saw their first outflows in 15 weeks.  At the same time though, banks and financials saw their biggest inflows in 20 weeks, there was an overall $2.9 billion pumped into equities and emerging market debt and equity funds enjoyed 23rd and 16th consecutive weeks of inflows respectively. For timing the expected  big fall  BAML added that monitoring corporate bonds and company profits would be key. They said credit markets remain strong, but noted the U.S. high yield has lagged high grade debt since March, which is a disconnect with European credit markets.  And while corporate profit growth has accelerated, the disconnect with employment growth is notable. Further weak payroll growth would hint at profits topping out and a policy mistake from the central banks if they tighten policy.  Summer 2017 = massive inflection point in central bank liquidity trade,  BAML said.

The payout was given to Khadr on Wednesday and was cashed immediately, the report said, citing a source involved in the transaction. (tgam.ca/2tnsBoR) Reuters reported earlier in the week that Canada's Liberal government would apologize to Khadr and pay him a compensation. A Canadian citizen, Khadr was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 at age 15 after a firefight with U.S. soldiers. He pleaded guilty to killing a U.S. Army medic and became the youngest inmate held at the military prison in Cuba. Khadr later recanted and his lawyers said he had been grossly mistreated. In 2010, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that Canada breached his rights by sending intelligence agents to interrogate him and sharing the results with the United States. Khadr spent a decade in Guantanamo before being returned to Canada in 2012 to serve the rest of his sentence and was released in 2015. (reut.rs/2twHV0W) Khadr was taken to Afghanistan by his father, an al Qaeda member, who apprenticed the boy to a group of bomb makers. The father died in a battle with Pakistani forces in 2003. His case has divided Canadians. Human rights advocates such as Amnesty International say the one-time child soldier was denied due process while the then-Conservative government dismissed calls to seek leniency, noting he had pleaded guilty to a serious crime. Khadr had sued Ottawa for C$20 million and the government would have weighed the political damage of continuing to fight him in court, Professor Audrey Macklin, chair of human rights law at the University of Toronto, said on Wednesday.

Fitzgerald, an obstetrician-gynecologist, has run the Georgia state health agency for the past six years, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a press release. HHS Secretary Dr Tom Price, a former U.S. representative from Georgia, said Fitzgerald has  a deep appreciation and understanding of medicine, public health, policy and leadership — all qualities that will prove vital as she leads the CDC in its work to protect America’s health.  Frieden, who played a leading role in fighting the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and Zika epidemic that begin in Brazil in 2015, wished Fitzgerald well.  Her experience as state health commissioner is important to understanding the needs of public health.  Frieden said in a statement emailed to Reuters. A key question, he said, will be whether Fitzgerald will succeed in getting the Trump administration to support the CDC's work by funding the agency in a stable and sufficient manner.

Currently, BoG is 99.6%-owned by BGEO, which in turn is fully owned by UK-based holding BGEO Group PLC, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Fitch understands from management that BGEO will remain the holding company for Bank of Georgia following the demerger. However, BGEO will cease to be the holding company for the group's investment business. The demerger will not have a direct impact on BoG's financial metrics, in Fitch's view, as the investment business was already deconsolidated from BoG as a result of a legal restructuring in August 2015. Fitch also believes the refinancing risks of the bank will be manageable in case of a transfer of the USD350 million senior Eurobond from the BGEO level to the bank. The bond is equal to a significant 10% of the bank's end-1Q17 liabilities, but USD150 million of the bond proceeds have already been on-lent by BGEO to BoG, and the bank maintains a sizeable liquidity cushion (at end-1Q17 equal to 19% of its liabilities). The details on how BGEO might transfer the Eurobond to BoG are unclear at present. The direct impact on the financial profile of BGEO should be moderate, in Fitch's view. The transaction will likely be accounted as an equity distribution for BGEO, but Fitch estimates that double leverage should not increase as a result and should remain below 120% in the medium term. The ratings of BoG reflect the bank's adequate asset quality, reasonable capitalisation, sound profitability metrics and a stable funding profile. The ratings also capture the bank's high lending dollarisation level and significant borrower concentrations. Upside for BoG's ratings is limited, as they are already at the same level as the Georgian sovereign. The 'BB-' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating of BGEO is at the same level as that of BoG, its main operating subsidiary, reflecting Fitch's view that the default risk of the holding company is highly correlated with that of BoG. On 3 July 2017 BGEO Group PLC announced its intention to demerge the group into a London-listed banking business (Bank of Georgia Group PLC) and a London-listed investment business (BGEO Investments PLC). Management believes this should create additional value to the shareholders, enhance growth opportunities for both businesses and help to avoid any cross-business conflict of interest. According to management, the transaction should be completed in 1H18.

With stock markets near record levels, and interest rates and credit conditions still loose, the report gave detailed attention to whether the financial system and bond markets posed any particular threat to the country's eight-year economic expansion.  The answer so far is no, said the Fed, noting that there is little evidence of a liquidity crunch in the corporate or other bond markets, and no evidence that rising asset values pose a problem. The structure of the corporate bond market is changing with new regulations, the Fed said, but by traditional measures shows only minimal strain in adapting. Related CoverageAnalyst View: Fed sees steady economy, only 'moderate' financial vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system remained, on balance, moderate,  concluded the report, submitted to Congress on behalf of the Fed's Washington-based Board of Governors.  Valuation pressures across a range of assets and several indicators of investor risk appetite have increased further...However, these developments in asset markets have not been accompanied by increased leverage.  The combination of rising asset values and rising leverage is considered particularly toxic, indicating that investments are being made with borrowed money and leaving investors unable to repay those debts if the value of the underlying assets decline. U.S. Treasury yields rose after the report, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note near a more than eight-week high. U.S. stocks edged higher. The release of the report on Friday comes ahead of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's appearance next Wednesday and Thursday before the House and Senate committees that oversee the central bank and related issues. The roughly 60-page document is largely a review of economic and policy developments since the last report, in February. In this instance the document took on a steady-as-she-goes quality. Growth in the first quarter was slow at about 1-1/2  percent on an annualized basis, and inflation took a step backward. But consumer confidence remained strong, and  business investment has turned up....The housing market continues its gradual recovery. Economic growth has also been supported by recent strength in foreign activity.   The government on Friday said non-farm payrolls surged by 222,000 in June and workers put in more hours but average hourly earnings grew a modest 0.2 percent. [L1N1JX1IB]            Along with the discussion of financial conditions, however, the Fed did highlight some long-term problems. The central bank noted that weak productivity growth may become entrenched as a  new normal,  and could be one reason wage growth remains weak.  It also noted the continued gap in unemployment rates between whites and blacks and Hispanics.

Jones’ team analyzed data collected by a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiative called TickNET, which aims to prevent tick-borne diseases across the country. Lyme disease is the most common such disease in the U.S.; the risk of exposure is highest in northeastern states, the researchers write in Zoonoses and Public Health. “Preventing tick bites by avoiding wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, appropriately using repellents on skin and clothing, and checking for ticks after going outside are effective prevention methods,” Jones said in an email. The researchers surveyed 2,727 households in three states where Lyme disease is endemic: Connecticut, Maryland and New York. More than half of the households, 1,526, had a dog, a cat or both. About 88 percent of these households reported using some form of tick control on their pets. Overall, about 31 percent of pet owners had found a tick crawling on a human in the household and 19 percent of pet owners had found a tick attached to a human household member. By comparison, about 20 percent of non-pet owning households found a tick crawling on a human and 14 percent found a tick attached to a human. About 20 percent of pet-owning households had found ticks on their pets. Finding a tick on a pet doubled the likelihood of finding ticks crawling on or attached to household members.  Owners still found ticks on their pets when they used tick control medication, the study authors note.  But the researchers found no significant difference in tick-borne diseases reported by pet owners and non-owners - in each group, about 20 percent had had a verified tick-borne illness. Certain property characteristics, such as having a vegetable garden, compost pile, log pile, bird feeder, stone walls and children’s play equipment, were associated with higher odds of finding ticks crawling on, or attached to, human household members.  “Lyme disease is getting more attention because the number of human cases has increased, and tick habitats are changing as an indirect consequence of climate change,” said Dr. Bruno Chomel, a veterinary researcher at the University of California, Davis who wasn’t involved in the study.  “It makes sense that people who have pets, especially dogs, are more likely to be around fields or areas where ticks could be hanging out,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “Pets can bring these parasites into the human environment, especially if they sit on couches or sleep in beds with owners.” One limitation of the study is that tick control use was self-reported, so the research team wasn’t sure whether the owners applied the medication accurately and consistently or what brand was used. In addition, the study group may have been too small to detect an increased risk of tick-borne diseases when a household included pets, the authors write.  “Pet owners are encouraged to check their pets for ticks daily, especially after they spend time outdoors,” Jones told Reuters Health. “Enjoy the outdoors, but prevent tick bites on yourselves and your pets.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tRlZQh Zoonoses and Public Health, online June 19, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pets-ticks-idUSKBN19S28W"},

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 222,000 jobs last month, data from the Labor Department showed, beating economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in June after gaining 0.1 percent in May, but fell below the estimated 0.3 percent. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.  Given the focus of the Fed on inflation and the fact that the inflation indicators in this report were slightly disappointing, I think the market has a toned down reaction to it,  said Shyam Rajan, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch in New York.  But in the bigger picture, it's still a pretty decent report.  Investors are focused on wage growth and whether spending by consumers will be strong enough to back the Federal Reserve's plan to raise rates once more this year. Odds of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting stood at 50.9 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Policymakers have taken opposing views on inflation after it retreated further below the central bank's 2 percent target in May, creating uncertainty over the future path of rate hikes. Adding to the jitters are bets that the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding their ultra-loose monetary policies. At 10:46 a.m. ET (1446 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 59.51 points, or 0.28 percent, at 21,379.55 and the S&P; 500 was up 8.17 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,417.92. The Nasdaq Composite was up 40.97 points, or 0.67 percent, at 6,130.44. Eight of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the tech index's 1.04 percent rise leading the gainers. Apple, Microsoft and Facebook gave the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. The financial index, which is sensitive to interest rates, pared early gains to trade little changed. Shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup were flat after having risen about 0.8 percent in early trading. Goldman Sachs fell 0.5 percent. Oil fell more than 3 percent after data showed U.S. production rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high. Oil prices are down more than 16 percent this year, adding to low inflation concerns. Chevron fell 0.8 percent, while Exxon was off 0.25 percent. The two stocks were a drag on the Dow and the S&P.; Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,495 to 1,209. On the Nasdaq, 1,608 issues rose and 984 fell.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd owns the generic versions of Alimta in question after buying Allergan Plc's generic business Actavis last August.      Alimta, whose chemical name is pemetrexed, is Lilly's top-selling oncology treatment and generated sales of $2.3 billion last year. This decision applies to about $300 million worth of annual sales, Evercore ISI's Umer Raffat said. The court's key conclusions confirm that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by these generic pemetrexed products in Britain, France, Italy and Spain prior to June 2021, said Michael Harrington, senior vice president and general counsel for Lilly. The court also upheld the indirect infringement finding by the UK Court of Appeal, Lilly said, adding that the full judgment is expected by Wednesday.  In major European countries, the basic compound patents for Alimta expired in December 2015 but its vitamin regimen patents run until June 2021. The so-called vitamin regimen patent in question covers a method in which patients take folic acid and vitamin B12 prior to Alimta, to reduce the drug's toxicity and allow it to interrupt the ability of cancer cells to reproduce. The UK Court of Appeal in June 2015 ruled that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would be indirectly, not directly, infringed when the generic product is reconstituted or diluted in saline.  The announcement on Friday implies that the UK Supreme Court found the Actavis product being infringed, regardless of the diluent used, Lilly said. A U.S. appeals court ruled in favor of Lilly in a similar case in January. It still faces a review of the issue by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which analysts said could result in further appeals if it is not in Lilly's favor. Teva could not be immediately reached for comment.    Shares of Lilly rose 30 cents to $81.90 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday morning. Teva's U.S. shares fell 25 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $31.52.

Stada's management is now reviewing the new offer, which is at the same price as the previous 5.3 billion euro ($6 bln) bid  but lowers the shareholder approval threshold to somewhere below 65 percent, the sources said. The private equity firms' previous offer of 66 euros a share, launched in April, secured the support of 65.52 percent of Stada's equity but failed to go through because the threshold was 67.5 percent. Stada's management had backed the original takeover and Bain and Cinven will launch the new offer once the Stada board and  Germany's financial watchdog have cleared it, the sources said. That could be as early as next week, they added.  The first bid missed the threshold despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. Some shareholders, mainly hedge funds, held back some of their shares, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. Bain and Cinven have set the acceptance threshold at below 65, although financing banks had given them room to reduce it to as low as 60 percent, the sources said.  The bidders obtained firm commitments for their new offer from significantly more than 15 percent of Stada's voting rights, giving them confidence that the offer will go through, the sources said. Activist investor Elliott Management's move to buy a Stada stake has delayed the board's review of the offer, the people added.   Stada wants to be extra cautious not to make any mistakes that could draw any litigation,  one of the people said.  The size of the stake Elliott has bought remained unclear. It will have to be disclosed shortly, if the regulatory 3 percent or 5 percent thresholds have been crossed.  Elliott, which has not expressed a view publicly on the takeover bid, has not met with Bain and Cinven and has not made any specific proposals regarding the potential new bid, the sources said.  Stada's chief executive and its head of finance resigned on Tuesday ahead of the expected new bid, adding a note of uncertainty to the takeover process, which has proven to be more complex than the private equity firms anticipated after launching their blow-out offer.

After numerous hints and suggestions from policymakers, investors seem to have decided central banks are preparing to wind down their ultra-loose monetary policies. The focus this week will be on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday, even though she is likely to stick with the line that one more hike can be expected this year. How the market judges her words will be reflected in the Treasury yield curve. The gap between two- and 10-year yields has picked up this month since hitting its narrowest in almost 10 months in late June as investors wondered how an absence of inflation chimed with expectations of rate hikes. The chart below shows just how far yields have been compressed. The last time all maturities on the benchmark curve, from one-month bills to 30-year bonds yielded at least 1 percent was Sept. 12, 2008, the Friday before Lehman Brothers collapsed. (For graphic on U.S. yields in rate suppression era click reut.rs/2tYn7T6) 2/ Boj Fights Back Not all central banks are climbing aboard the policy-tightening bandwagon. The Bank of Japan on Friday offered to buy unlimited amounts of Japanese Government Bonds as a broad sell-off in debt markets pushed 10-year JGB yields to their highest since early February and significantly above BOJ's target of zero percent under its yield-curve-control policy. But will the BOJ be able to keep yields down when all around others are rising? And what will this mean for the yen? The BOJ may have to turn back from its slow stealth tapering efforts but it could mean spreads between Japanese yields and those in Europe, the United States or even in Australia will widen and the yen will become the preferred funding currency.  (For graphic on Asia yield spreads click reut.rs/2ux8004) 3/ Hidden Strength The latest Reuters poll for the euro/sterling exchange rate shows analysts expect the pair to barely move, stuck around the 88 pence level over the next year. But the pair's actual performance differs markedly from the median forecast from the start of this year. Forecasts suggested sterling would strengthen against the euro but, instead, the euro is up nearly 5 percent higher since January. Some analysts say this reflects a strength in the euro zone economy they had not expected. Layer in continuing ECB taper-talk, and some scepticism about the possibility of the Bank of England raising rates this year, and the euro could strengthen further against the pound in the remainder of 2017. For graphic on Euro/sterling actual vs Reuters poll forecast click reut.rs/2tZJ982) 4/the Heat Is on The second half of the year for U.S. stocks is setting up for a battle among sectors as the tech sector flounders after the runaway gains seen earlier this year. The sector is close to ceding its crown as the year's best performers to healthcare. At the other end of the table, telecoms have nearly slipped under energy stocks as the year's biggest laggards. The remaining sectors are clustered around the 9 percent return on the broad S&P; 500. Capturing sector shifts and beating the benchmark has become crucial for fund managers facing an onslaught from ETFs which now own more than a third of the top U.S. benchmark. (For graphic on S&P; 500 sector performance click reut.rs/2toxaPE) 4/ Waiting for Wage Growth A key metric coming into sharp focus for financial markets is wage growth, or lack thereof, across most developed markets. While the global economy and corporate profits are on a synchronized upswing for the first time in more than 6 years, this is yet to trickle down to salary slips. With labor markets running at or near full capacity the pressure to raise wages is slowly rising. That could see profit margins getting squeezed at companies that are not able to pass on higher costs to their customers.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd owns the generic versions of Alimta in question after buying Allergan Plc's generic business Actavis last August.      Alimta, whose chemical name is pemetrexed, is Lilly's top-selling oncology treatment and generated sales of $2.3 billion last year. This decision applies to about $300 million worth of annual sales, Evercore ISI's Umer Raffat said. The court's key conclusions confirm that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by these generic pemetrexed products in Britain, France, Italy and Spain prior to June 2021, said Michael Harrington, senior vice president and general counsel for Lilly. The court also upheld the indirect infringement finding by the UK Court of Appeal, Lilly said, adding that the full judgment is expected by Wednesday.  In major European countries, the basic compound patents for Alimta expired in December 2015 but its vitamin regimen patents run until June 2021. The so-called vitamin regimen patent in question covers a method in which patients take folic acid and vitamin B12 prior to Alimta, to reduce the drug's toxicity and allow it to interrupt the ability of cancer cells to reproduce. The UK Court of Appeal in June 2015 ruled that the Alimta vitamin regimen patent would be indirectly, not directly, infringed when the generic product is reconstituted or diluted in saline.  The announcement on Friday implies that the UK Supreme Court found the Actavis product being infringed, regardless of the diluent used, Lilly said. A U.S. appeals court ruled in favor of Lilly in a similar case in January. It still faces a review of the issue by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which analysts said could result in further appeals if it is not in Lilly's favor. Teva could not be immediately reached for comment.    Shares of Lilly rose 30 cents to $81.90 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday morning. Teva's U.S. shares fell 25 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $31.52.

The US$458bn CLO market is still analyzing new structures and features to help it to comply with rules in the Dodd-Frank Act that took effect in December that require managers to hold some of their funds’ risk. Crescent Capital Group issued the first CLO with an Applicable Margin Reset (AMR) in June, which allows CLOs to be repriced without managers having to update regulatory valuation analysis or buy more retention. Other managers have also begun researching the structure, which is expected to be used more widely. The “automatic feature of the AMR can be cheaper than going through a refinancing exercise and can be much easier because it’s baked in and automatic, which may be attractive to equity” investors, according to Sean Solis, a partner at law firm Dechert. A record US$100.2bn of CLOs has been reworked this year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral. Junior CLO investors have pushed to refinance to increase their payouts as they receive the interest left over after debtholders are repaid, and lower coupons for senior CLO noteholders boost their payments. Investment manager Sancus Capital Management began working on the AMR structure more than two years ago because the process of calling securities and re-issuing them to refinance a CLO seemed to be “unnecessarily complicated,” according to Olga Chernova, chief investment officer. “We thought, ‘Why don’t we just build in a mechanism where the securities could be refinanced via an auction and people could bid, like in a BWIC, and if the clearing level is tighter, the coupon gets reset,’” she said. AMR CLOs are modeled on auction-rate securities. Investors submit interest rates that they are willing to receive for owning the fund’s debt tranches. Offers must be lower than the existing spread. Crescent’s CLO requires bids to be at least 10% lower, according to Asif Khan, who runs the new-issue CLO business at MUFG Securities and arranged the new fund. The investor with the lowest coupon offer wins and tranche spreads remain unchanged if no bids are submitted.  Crescent continues to place a high priority on being an innovator in the CLO asset class, and we are pleased to partner with MUFG and Sancus by serving as collateral manager for the global launch of the AMR feature,  a Crescent spokesman said. Regulatory Relief Managers can either buy vertical strips of CLO funds, which are 5% of every tranche of the fund, or horizontal strips, which are 5% of the face amount of all of the fund’s tranches and held in the equity slice, to comply with the risk-retention rules. Firms that buy horizontal slices have to give investors a fair value interpretation of the debt that they intend to hold. A CLO refinancing is considered a new offer and sale of securities, and therefore requires the “sponsor” to comply with risk-retention rules, Solis said. As sponsors organize and initiate deals, this means that managers that own horizontal slices have to provide a fresh fair value analysis as part of the transaction. As valuations are likely to be lower the longer that CLO funds are outstanding, managers would need to buy more equity to comply with the rules - unless they use an AMR structure. A letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to Dechert and Sancus in September said that the use of an AMR structure would not constitute an “offer and sale of asset-backed securities” and therefore managers would not need to rework valuations or buy additional equity. AMR structures also allow managers to reprice CLOs faster and more cheaply than a traditional CLO refinancing, which allows CLOs to cut tranche spreads, matching lower returns from US leveraged loans. More than US$358bn of US leveraged loans were refinanced in the first half of 2017, according to LPC data, as borrowers rushed to take advantage of increased investor demand for floating-rate debt on the back of rising interest rates. MUFG has received several calls from interested CLO managers and is working on more funds with the AMR structure, Khan said. The bank is also working on using the feature in CLO resets, where the maturity of deals is extended to allow the funds to remain in place. “The process makes CLOs more democratic because when the deal refinances, everyone can participate and it makes the process easier and the cost of the refinancing comes down,” Khan said. “This idea will grow; that’s our objective.” (Reporting by Kristen Haunss; Editing by Tessa Walsh)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/clo-amr-idUSL1N1JY0TJ"},

The Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas was breached in the attack, according to Bloomberg. A representative with the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp declined to say if the plant was hacked, but said it continued to operate safely.  There has been absolutely no operational impact to Wolf Creek. The reason that is true is because the operational computer systems are completely separate from the corporate network,  company spokeswoman Jenny Hageman said in an email to Reuters. The report identified the first known victims of a hacking campaign targeting the power sector that was first reported by Reuters on June 30. The attacks were described in a confidential June 28 U.S government alert to industrial firms, warning them of a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear, power and critical infrastructure sectors. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation said that hackers had succeeded in compromising networks of some targets, but did not name victims. The government also released a 30-page bulletin with advice on how firms could bolster security to defend against the attacks. The alert said that hackers have been observed using tainted emails to harvest credentials to gain access to networks of their targets.  Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,  the report said. Homeland Security and the FBI issued a statement to Reuters late on Thursday saying that the alert was part of an ongoing effort to advise industry of cyber threats.  There is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks,  the agencies said. A nuclear industry spokesman told Reuters on Saturday that hackers have never gained access to a nuclear plant. The Homeland Security technical bulletin included details of code used in a hacking tool that suggest the hackers sought to use the password of a Wolf Creek employee to access the network. Hageman declined to say if hackers had gained access to that employee's account. The employee could not be reached for comment.

June employment figures for both sides of the border came in stronger than expected. Canada added 45,300 jobs, topping the 10,000 forecast, while U.S. non-farm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs, ahead of the 179,000 economists were expecting.

At 10:26 a.m. ET (1426 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index was down 162.22 points, or 1.08 percent, at 14,915.78. Earlier, it fell to 14,916.94, its lowest since mid-November. Nine of the index's 10 main sectors were down. The energy group retreated 2.5 percent, while bank stocks slipped 0.6 percent. The materials sector, which includes miners and other natural resource companies, lost 1.9 percent. The three sectors account for roughly two-third of the index's weight. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd was among the most influential movers on the downside, falling 2.0 percent to C$36.12. Encana Corp shares declined 4.4 percent to C$10.56. U.S. crude oil fell 3.6 percent to $43.89 a barrel. Prices retreated after data showed U.S. production rose last week just as exports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hit a 2017 high, casting renewed doubt about producers' efforts to curb excess supply. Barrick Gold Corp eased 1.6 percent to C$20.01, while Goldcorp Inc fell 2.8 percent to C$16.14. The price of gold, which has shed about 6 percent since touching a seven-month peak in early June, hit a two-month low on Friday amid the increasing likelihood of another U.S. rate hike. Dollar-denominated bullion typically loses value when the greenback and interest rates rise as it does not pay interest. Paramount Resources Ltd tumbled 5.4 percent to C$17.73 after it said late on Thursday it would buy the Canadian subsidiary of U.S. oil and gas company Apache Corp for C$459.5 million.

With stock markets near record levels, and interest rates and credit conditions still loose, the report gave detailed attention to whether the financial system and bond markets posed any particular threat to the country's eight-year economic expansion. The answer so far is no, said the Fed, noting that there is little evidence of a liquidity crunch in the corporate or other bond markets, and no evidence that rising asset values pose a problem. The structure of the corporate bond market is changing with new regulations, the Fed said, but by traditional measures shows only minimal strain in adapting.  Vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system remained, on balance, moderate,  concluded the report, submitted to Congress on behalf of the Fed's Washington-based Board of Governors.  Valuation pressures across a range of assets and several indicators of investor risk appetite have increased further...However, these developments in asset markets have not been accompanied by increased leverage.  The combination of rising asset values and rising leverage is considered particularly toxic, indicating that investments are being made with borrowed money and leaving investors unable to repay those debts if the value of the underlying assets decline. The release of the report on Friday comes ahead of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's appearance next Wednesday and Thursday before the House and Senate committees that oversee the central bank and related issues. The roughly 60-page document is largely a review of economic and policy developments since the last report, in February. In this instance the document took on a steady-as-she-goes quality. Growth in the first quarter was slow at about 1-1/2 percent on an annualized basis, and inflation took a step backward. But consumer confidence remained strong, and  business investment has turned up....The housing market continues its gradual recovery. Economic growth has also been supported by recent strength in foreign activity.  Along with the discussion of financial conditions, however, the Fed did highlight some long-term problems. The central bank noted that weak productivity growth may become entrenched as a  new normal,  and could be one reason wage growth remains weak. It also noted the continued gap in unemployment rates between whites and blacks and Hispanics.

Stada's management is now reviewing the new offer, which is at the same price as the previous 5.3 billion euro ($6 bln) bid  but lowers the shareholder approval threshold to somewhere below 65 percent, the sources said. The private equity firms' previous offer of 66 euros a share, launched in April, secured the support of 65.52 percent of Stada's equity but failed to go through because the threshold was 67.5 percent. Stada's management had backed the original takeover and Bain and Cinven will launch the new offer once the Stada board and  Germany's financial watchdog have cleared it, the sources said. That could be as early as next week, they added.  The first bid missed the threshold despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups to trump a rival offer from private equity duo Advent and Permira. Some shareholders, mainly hedge funds, held back some of their shares, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. Bain and Cinven have set the acceptance threshold at below 65, although financing banks had given them room to reduce it to as low as 60 percent, the sources said.  The bidders obtained firm commitments for their new offer from significantly more than 15 percent of Stada's voting rights, giving them confidence that the offer will go through, the sources said. Activist investor Elliott Management's move to buy a Stada stake has delayed the board's review of the offer, the people added.   Stada wants to be extra cautious not to make any mistakes that could draw any litigation,  one of the people said.  The size of the stake Elliott has bought remained unclear. It will have to be disclosed shortly, if the regulatory 3 percent or 5 percent thresholds have been crossed.  Elliott, which has not expressed a view publicly on the takeover bid, has not met with Bain and Cinven and has not made any specific proposals regarding the potential new bid, the sources said.  Stada's chief executive and its head of finance resigned on Tuesday ahead of the expected new bid, adding a note of uncertainty to the takeover process, which has proven to be more complex than the private equity firms anticipated after launching their blow-out offer.   Bain, Cinven, Stada and Elliott declined to comment.

Prices as measured by the benchmark IPCA index fell 0.23 percent in June, the sharpest drop since August 1998. The annual inflation rate fell to 3.00 percent, at the bottom end of the central bank's target band of 4.5 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage point.     A weaker-than-expected economic recovery has weighed on Brazilian inflation and allowed the central bank to cut the benchmark Selic rate from its highest level in eight years.     The bank has been signaling since its last policy meeting that it could reduce the pace of rate cuts to 75 basis points per meeting, from the current 100 basis points, because of growing political uncertainty.     Those bets lost some steam after the IPCA release. Rate-future yields indicated traders saw a 70 percent chance of a 100 basis-point cut to 9.25 percent at the central bank's July meeting, with a 30 percent chance of a slower 75 basis-point reduction. Bets were evenly split on Thursday.     The Brazilian real strengthened 0.3 percent, in line with Latin American currencies such as Mexico's and Colombia's pesos.     Demand for emerging market assets rose after a report showed stubbornly sluggish U.S. wage growth in June despite stronger-than-expected jobs growth.     The report was the latest in a batch of mixed economic indicators that have left traders skeptical over the Federal Reserve's plan to increase rates once more this year and three times next year.     A slower pace of rate hikes would support the allure of emerging markets, which offer higher yields. Still, the Chilean peso slipped 0.1 percent, tracking a decline in prices of copper, a key export.

Banks stepped in to sell dollars after the peso fell as low as 17.38 per U.S. dollar on Thursday, traders said, taking profits after the currency weakened 7.0 percent during nine straight losing sessions beginning on June 23, the longest such streak since February 2016. Macri had let the exchange rate float shortly after taking office in December 2015, prompting a sharp depreciation against the dollar after years of currency controls put in place by former populist President Cristina Fernandez kept the peso artificially strong. The decline in recent weeks has come as a flood of foreign currency that entered the country thanks to debt sales and a tax amnesty program has eased up, and as investors hedge bets by buying dollars as the elections approach, in which Fernandez could win a Senate seat. While the drop has prompted calls for central bank action amid concern it could worsen inflation seen above 20 percent this year, analysts said the currency had been stronger than expected in the first half of the year and remained far from official expectations for an average of 17.92 in 2017.  With the dollar in the neighborhood of 17 pesos, there is only a partial correction of that lag,  said Jorge Vasconcelos, an economist at the Fundacion Mediterranea think tank. The peso was up 0.6 percent at 16.98 per dollar as of 11:53 a.m. local time (1453 GMT). Officials have repeatedly played down concerns about the dollar exchange rate, noting that a floating exchange rate can protect the economy from external shocks and that the peso's sharp moves against the dollar contrast with more modest moves against other currencies.  There's no reason to worry when the dollar moves,  Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne told reporters on Friday at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, according to local newspaper La Nacion.  The exchange rate will have less and less impact on price formation.

After numerous hints and suggestions from policymakers, investors seem to have decided central banks are preparing to wind down their ultra-loose monetary policies. The focus this week will be on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday, even though she is likely to stick with the line that one more hike can be expected this year. How the market judges her words will be reflected in the Treasury yield curve. The gap between two- and 10-year yields has picked up this month since hitting its narrowest in almost 10 months in late June as investors wondered how an absence of inflation chimed with expectations of rate hikes. The chart below shows just how far yields have been compressed. The last time all maturities on the benchmark curve, from one-month bills to 30-year bonds yielded at least 1 percent was Sept. 12, 2008, the Friday before Lehman Brothers collapsed. (For graphic on U.S. yields in rate suppression era click reut.rs/2tYn7T6) 2/ Boj Fights Back Not all central banks are climbing aboard the policy-tightening bandwagon. The Bank of Japan on Friday offered to buy unlimited amounts of Japanese Government Bonds as a broad sell-off in debt markets pushed 10-year JGB yields to their highest since early February and significantly above BOJ's target of zero percent under its yield-curve-control policy. But will the BOJ be able to keep yields down when all around others are rising? And what will this mean for the yen? The BOJ may have to turn back from its slow stealth tapering efforts but it could mean spreads between Japanese yields and those in Europe, the United States or even in Australia will widen and the yen will become the preferred funding currency.  (For graphic on Asia yield spreads click reut.rs/2ux8004) 3/ Hidden Strength The latest Reuters poll for the euro/sterling exchange rate shows analysts expect the pair to barely move, stuck around the 88 pence level over the next year. But the pair's actual performance differs markedly from the median forecast from the start of this year. Forecasts suggested sterling would strengthen against the euro but, instead, the euro is up nearly 5 percent higher since January. Some analysts say this reflects a strength in the euro zone economy they had not expected. Layer in continuing ECB taper-talk, and some scepticism about the possibility of the Bank of England raising rates this year, and the euro could strengthen further against the pound in the remainder of 2017. For graphic on Euro/sterling actual vs Reuters poll forecast click reut.rs/2tZJ982) 4/the Heat Is on The second half of the year for U.S. stocks is setting up for a battle among sectors as the tech sector flounders after the runaway gains seen earlier this year. The sector is close to ceding its crown as the year's best performers to healthcare. At the other end of the table, telecoms have nearly slipped under energy stocks as the year's biggest laggards. The remaining sectors are clustered around the 9 percent return on the broad S&P; 500. Capturing sector shifts and beating the benchmark has become crucial for fund managers facing an onslaught from ETFs which now own more than a third of the top U.S. benchmark. (For graphic on S&P; 500 sector performance click reut.rs/2toxaPE) 4/ Waiting for Wage Growth A key metric coming into sharp focus for financial markets is wage growth, or lack thereof, across most developed markets. While the global economy and corporate profits are on a synchronized upswing for the first time in more than 6 years, this is yet to trickle down to salary slips. With labor markets running at or near full capacity the pressure to raise wages is slowly rising. That could see profit margins getting squeezed at companies that are not able to pass on higher costs to their customers.

Nearly three-quarters of all syndicated loans in the first six months were used to refinance existing debt, driving total fees to a record, even though refinancing is less lucrative than new loans backing mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) . “There were simply a lot of low-fee repricing and refinancing deals. These transactions boost the volume numbers, but don’t have the same impact on arrangement fees as new-money, acquisition finance loans,” said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services. Issuance by ‘junk’ rated companies refinancing or repricing to cut borrowing costs and lock in cheap debt before interest rates rise pushed US leveraged lending to a first-half record of about US$732bn, Thomson Reuters LPC data shows. Bank fees of around US$6.3bn from underwriting leveraged loans in the first half set a new half year record and were 65% higher than the same time last year, according to Freeman Consulting, which has been tracking this income since 2000. The jump in fees for leveraged loans offset falling fees on the US$854m of investment-grade loans arranged during the first half, which is the lowest half year issuance since the second half of 2013. The volume of loans backing mergers by higher-rated companies slid 3.5% from the same period last year as the market awaits details of new highly anticipated US tax and trade policies. “On both the leveraged and investment-grade side, M&A; has been fairly weak compared to 2015 and 2016, when there were more large-scale deals that relied on the capital markets for debt financing,” said Nassof. “For leveraged deals, private equity acquirers have been priced out of the market,” he said. “On the investment-grade side, major corporate acquirers are still on the sidelines as they digest the transformational deals they made last year, and wait for clarity on tax reform.” In the second quarter, only one acquisition loan supporting an investment grade merger topped US$5bn – the US$15.7bn bridge loan for US medical supplier Becton Dickinson’s purchase of medical technology company C R Bard, Nassof noted. This is the lowest number since the start of 2014 as there are usually an average of 3.5 deals of at least this size per quarter, he said. Home of the Brave The dip in M&A; dealmaking is due to the absence of detail on new tax and trade policies, rather than a lack of lender or investor appetite, said executives, strategists and bankers, as debt market conditions remain positive. The timing of legislative changes pledged by the Trump administration was pushed back after efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, failed earlier this year. “Clearly it’s not a lack of capital, that’s not the constraint,” said Ravi Saligram, chief executive officer of Ritchie Bros., a global auctioneer of industrial equipment. The companies that are venturing into large takeovers are those expecting less regulatory pushback, or are eager to grow by acquisition when organic growth is stunted, bankers and strategists said. Antitrust rulings have also curbed M&A; business after scuttling two major tie-ups in the insurance industry earlier this year. The pace of corporate mergers is widely expected to pick up once there is more evidence that planned tax and trade changes are gaining traction. The possibility that guidelines curbing leveraged lending could be rolled back could also mean more new issuance, and fee income for banks going forward. In the meantime, the heavy wave of refinancing is helping to boost banks’ profits while new-money lending remains light. Fees on business including M&A; advisory, equity and bond underwriting as well as syndicated loan arrangement jumped 20% in the first half from the same period last year to almost US$24bn, according to Freeman Consulting. This was the highest overall investment banking fee pool since the first half of 2015.

William Morva, 35, was pronounced dead at 9:15 p.m. EDT, Virginia Department of Corrections spokeswoman Lisa Kinney said. Morva declined to make a final statement, she said. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe refused to block the execution earlier on Thursday, saying that examinations by prison doctors since Morva's 2008 conviction had shown no sign that he suffered from severe mental illness or delusional disorder, an ailment akin to schizophrenia, as his lawyers had claimed. Morva's death sentence, for killing an unarmed security guard and a sheriff's deputy in a 2006 escape from custody, had  triggered renewed debate about capital punishment.  Related CoverageVirginia says execution of killer William Morva to proceed The record before me does not contain sufficient evidence to warrant the extraordinary step of overturning the decision of a lawfully impaneled jury following a properly conducted trial,  McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in a statement. A review of the autopsy of Ricky Gray, a Virginia inmate executed in January, showed fluid in his lungs and blood on his lips, suggesting the drugs had not stopped his heart quickly as intended, the newspaper said. A spokesman for McAuliffe did not respond to a request for comment. William Charles Morva is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters June 29, 2017. Virginia Department of Corrections/Handout via REUTERSMore than 34,000 people, along with U.N. human rights experts and the daughter of the slain deputy, had asked  McAuliffe to spare Morva's life. Morva held dual U.S.-Hungarian citizenship, and the European Union and the Hungarian Embassy in Washington had called on McAuliffe for clemency. Morva's deadly rampage took place after he was taken to a hospital while being held in the Montgomery County Jail on robbery charges. He stole a gun at the hospital and shot the security guard. Morva shot the deputy sheriff during a search for him the next day. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up his case. Morva's execution was the 13th in the United States this year, and the 113th in Virginia since the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of the death penalty in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. That number places Virginia second among states on the U.S. executions list behind Texas, which has had 542.

Flavio Cattaneo took over as chief executive at Telecom Italia (TIM) a little more than a year ago, earning praise from France's Vivendi and other investors for cutting costs at the heavily indebted firm. But in recent weeks Cattaneo has engaged in a heated exchange with Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda and other government officials over the ultrafast broadband rollout across Italy, ruffling feathers at Vivendi.  There is a problem, a real one,  a source close to the matter told Reuters.  Either TIM continues with Cattaneo, but in a different way, or it will have to be someone else.  The source said discussions were ongoing to figure out the best solution. Several managers at Vivendi, including CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, told Cattaneo to soften his tone, stressing it was Vivendi, the top investor with a 24 percent stake, that was driving policy at the Italian firm, another person added.  Flavio is like a thoroughbred that is difficult to tame,  the second source said.  He must understand that Vivendi now has a say on every subject.  TIM strongly denied any tension between its CEO and Vivendi. The French media giant also denied any tension with Cattaneo. The 54-year old manager was appointed last year after his predecessor resigned over strategy clashes with Vivendi. The French firm backed Cattaneo's promotion to CEO from board member, but  that does not give him a blank check , one of the people said. TIM has been at loggerheads with Rome over rolling out superfast Internet in so-called non-economically viable areas. The government says TIM undermined the state tender process by going back on its word not to invest in broadband in the rural and sparsely populated areas. In a parliamentary hearing last week, Cattaneo said TIM would not be involved in the tenders because of the way the government handled the process.  If they are already constructed in an ad hoc way, there's no point wasting time,  the CEO said in comments that the industry minister called  serious and unacceptable . The minister also said he would meet Cattaneo to discuss the issue, although sources said no date had been set. This week, Italy's antitrust watchdog launched an inquiry to see if TIM had tried to obstruct the tender process. Souring relations between TIM and Rome took a turn for the worse last year when the government, keen to bring ultrafast Internet to all Italians to boost growth, drafted in state-controlled utility Enel to help with the broadband rollout after claiming TIM was dragging its feet. TIM's decision not to invest in areas where it said it could not guarantee a return on its investment forced Rome to step in with state subsidised tenders. But in March TIM said it would invest its own money in some of those areas, arguing the market had changed. This shift angered Rome, which claimed it undermined the state tenders. Vivendi, which plans to use Italy to build a southern European media empire, has supported TIM's acceleration of the broadband rollout. It has also backed aggressive cost cutting. But the French, already under scrutiny for their growing influence over Italy Inc, do not want to antagonise the government any further, several sources said. The group, led by tycoon Vincent Bollore, is also aware of growing political pressure to put TIM's copper network - a key source of revenue - back into state hands.  Cattaneo has an A side that Vivendi likes and a B one that Vivendi likes less,  one of the people said.  Vivendi is getting tired of having to clarify things with him so frequently ... now Vivendi wants action, not words.  Other investors remain on the fence for now, saying Cattaneo has been the driver behind TIM's turnaround.  We like Cattaneo who's been crucial to getting TIM's costs in order and finally kick-starting the turnaround,  said Tommaso Iaquinta, the CEO of New York-based Once Capital Management.  Obviously we are watching how the fallout with the government unfolds and whether it will impact TIM.

State-owned Bankia achieved the lowest ever coupon for a Spanish public Additional Tier 1 bond sale, the riskiest debt that banks can issue, beating national champions Santander and BBVA. The €750m no-grow perpetual non-call five-year (rated B+ by S&P;), its inaugural AT1, priced at 6%. It was the week's second Spanish subordinated deal after CaixaBank's €1bn 2.75% 11-year non-call six Tier 2 (Ba2/BB+/BBB-/BBB), which drew €2.2bn from 225 investors and priced 100bp inside the €1bn 3.5% 10NC5 Tier 2 it sold in February.  The market is continuing as if never happened,  said one investor. Spanish bank bonds broadly held steady in the aftermath of Popular's resolution in June, but this week's deals have now proved that the primary market remains wide open for the country's lenders. Furthermore, there was little evidence that investors forced either issuer to pay up despite recent events, with CaixaBank pricing roughly flat to fair value and Bankia arguably at least 25bp through. That said, Bankia's orderbook dropped from €3.5bn-plus to €2.5bn-plus (pre-reconciliation) as investors bristled at the 50bp move from 6.5% area initial price thoughts. Presumably as a result, Bankia's new bonds slipped quite dramatically and were some 14bp wider by Friday afternoon. CaixaBank's new bonds on the other hand were bid 2bp tighter. The sector also proved impervious to the collapse of two Italian lenders and the first case of AT1 coupon cancellation (at Bremer Landesbank).  Popular was an isolated case and rather well flagged,  said Gildas Surry, a partner at Axiom Alternative Investments.  Caixabank is in a very different position with a strong commercial franchise in Spain. The risk we see in such a transaction is ... around the potential referendum in Catalonia in the autumn.  Trading Places While banks' market access clearly remains intact, Popular has fuelled debate around the relative pricing of sub debt after its Tier 2 bonds were wiped out alongside more deeply subordinated AT1s.  The scars should be in the Tier 2 space, but CaixaBank did very well,  said Barry Donlon, head of capital solutions at UBS.  The consensus is that we shouldn't see any negative impact on Tier 1 yields as the market view is that it is correctly priced for the risk. However, for Tier 2, some investors have speculated that we would see a sell-off, but that hasn't been the case.  Though some investors sold out their Tier 2 positions, those bonds were all sold into willing buyers without too much impact on market levels, Donlon added. Notable re-pricing has been limited to the likes of Liberbank and Cajamar - Liberbank's €300m 6.875% 10NC5 is bid in the low 90s, for example, tumbling from 105. While Popular has highlighted the potential losses borne by Tier 2, others suggest that it is perhaps AT1 that should trade tighter.  It's not generic though,  said Steve Hussey, head of financial institutions credit research at AllianceBernstein.  You should evaluate on a case-by-case basis in terms of assessment of the underlying credit fundamentals and the sizes of the relative tranches across the capital structure.  Forced Hand Supply and demand dynamics will also continue to provide support for AT1 and Tier 2 debt. After almost €10bn of euro AT1 issuance this year, supply is expected to remain fairly muted. At 5.26% the Bank of America Merrill Lynch CoCo index is only just wide of the year's tights, having rallied from 6.14% at the start of the year, and observers reckon there is room for further compression. The same is true for Tier 2, particularly given the growth of senior non-preferred debt as the most cost-effective route to building regulatory buffers is also likely to weigh on supply, supporting valuations. Furthermore, with some investors unable to buy AT1 bonds because of mandate restrictions, Tier 2 is the highest yielding paper available to them, particularly with most other asset classes now bid at historically tight levels.  It's a seller's market,  said Keval Shah, head of bond syndicate at Lloyds Bank.  It's clear with the cash currently at hand investors are having to buy primary. If they choose to sit out on relative value concerns, there are plenty of others who are willing to take up the slack.  Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were structuring advisers and global coordinators on Bankia. They were also joint leads alongside Bankia, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and UBS. Barclays, BNP Paribas, CaixaBank, Credit Agricole and JP Morgan were leads for CaixaBank.

(LVS) and all of its subsidiaries at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The subsidiaries affirmed include Las Vegas Sands, LLC (LVS LLC), Sands China, Ltd. (Sands China), VML US Finance, LLC (VML US), and Marina Bay Stands Pte. Ltd. (MBS). Fitch links all of the IDRs within the LVS corporate structure. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Investment-Grade Rationale: LVS' 'BBB-' IDR reflects the company's strong financial profile, which can comfortably withstand cyclical-related operating pressures in the context of the financial parameters consistent with an investment-grade IDR. Other key rating drivers include LVS' strong liquidity profile, including discretionary FCF; significant capacity to monetize noncore assets, and high-quality assets in attractive regulatory regimes. Leverage Within Thresholds: Fitch-calculated leverage metrics remain within Fitch's thresholds for a 'BBB-' IDR of 4x gross leverage and 3.5x net leverage and provide for some flexibility with respect to ramping up shareholder friendly activity or funding a major development such as an integrated resort (IR) in Japan. Fitch forecasts that gross leverage remains below 3x through the projection horizon. This assumes slight growth in dividends, $500 million in annual share repurchases, no asset sales and no major developments. Capital Allocation: Amid deterioration in Macau operations, LVS stopped share buybacks, reduced debt and decelerated dividend growth maintaining gross leverage at or below 3x. LVS' public gross leverage target is 2.5x-3.0x, per fourth-quarter 2015 earnings call. (Fitch-calculated leverage is about 0.5x higher compared to the company's methodology). Development Pipeline: With the Parisian complete, LVS is in position to start generating positive FCF, which can be applied to returning cash to shareholders or funding development capex. Fitch forecasts discretionary FCF (excluding development capex) in excess of $300 million. There are no imminent projects on the horizon although LVS is in a good position to bid on an IR license in Japan, for which the company said it is ready to invest $10 billion. Non-core Assets Provide Support: LVS' facilities include 2.5 million square feet of leasable retail space including approximately 600,000 in Singapore and 1.75 million square feet in Macau. Mall operating income for the LTM period ending March 31, 2017 is $545 million, which translates into $6.8 billion - $13.6 billion of contingent liquidity assuming 4%-8% capitalization rates. LVS has expressed interest in selling its Singapore retail and has a history of selling non-core assets. It sold 440,000 square feet of retail space in the Venetian Las Vegas for $766 million in 2004 and later sold another 400,000 square feet at the Palazzo for $295 million amid the last recession. Macau Recovery: Fitch projects LVS' Macau-segment EBITDA will grow 12% in 2017 driven by the ramp up at The Parisian and a marketwide recovery. These drivers will be partially offset by cannibalization on LVS' existing properties from The Parisian and other expansions in the market. Fitch projects Macau's gaming revenues will grow by 14% in 2017, with the growth being more skewed towards VIP. Fitch maintains a positive long-term outlook on Macau supported by the expanding middle class in China and the development of infrastructure in and around Macau, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge DERIVATION SUMMARY LVS' 'BBB-' IDR reflects the company's conservatively managed balance sheet, strong liquidity, robust discretionary FCF and significant capacity to monetize non-core assets. LVS also maintains a strong business profile supported by high-quality assets in attractive regulatory regimes, which provides the company with one of the best global market exposure profiles in the industry. LVS' leverage metrics are strong for 'BBB-' IDR, but the ratings are somewhat constrained at this time by the potential for a large scale development in Japan and the 2022 expiration of the concession in Macau. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Revenues grow 10% in 2017, driven by the ramp up for the Parisian and the market-wide recovery in Macau. Afterwards, revenues grow 3%-4% per year with mid-single digit growth in Macau helping to boost more flat growth elsewhere. --EBITDA margins after corporate expense stable at about 35%. --No new debt or major developments (no Japan). Capex is in line with the company's public forecast ($500 million maintenance capex per year and development capex winding down through 2019). --Corporate level dividends growing at 2% per share per year and $500 million of share repurchases per year. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Maintaining gross and net leverage below 3.5x and 3.0x, respectively. --Should LVS obtain a license(s) to develop an integrated resort in Japan, greater clarity on project's return on investment prospects and funding strategy would help build support for an upgrade. Conditions that may limit rating upside include LVS moving forward with a project despite very restrictive operating conditions such as a foreigners-only policy and LVS being aggressive with shareholder friendly actions leading up to the heavier capex spending phase. --A renewal of the concession in Macau, which expires 2022, would also help build support for an upgrade. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Leverage exceeding 4x on a gross basis and 3.5x on a net basis for an extended period, likely driven by pursuing multiple large-scale projects at once or deviating from its articulated financial policies. LIQUIDITY LVS' liquidity is strong, with $1.6 billion in excess cash net of $400 million in estimated cage cash. LVS also has $3.3 billion of revolver availability for total $4.9 billion of available liquidity. Maturities are manageable. The Singapore facility's amortization starts to ramp up in 2018 with $214 million due that year and $1.1 billion in 2019. The Macau facility amortizes largely 2020-2022, just prior to the Macau gaming concession expiration. Melco Resorts & Entertainment and SJM Holdings, two Macau concession holders, recently completed financings with maturities extending beyond their respective concession expirations, which alleviate to a degree concerns regarding Macau operators' ability to refinance past 2022. LVS has no large scale development capex underway. Fitch believes there is a good chance that LVS wins a license bid to develop a large scale integrated resort (IR) in Japan. LVS stated that it may spend $10 billion on the resort should it win a license. Japan lawmakers fist need to pass a bill outlining more detailed regulations, and Fitch estimates that the license RFP process will not start until 2018 at the earliest with heavier capex spending not starting until 2020 or 2021.

Trump, a Republican who called it an  honor  to meet with the Russian president, drew swift criticism from Democrats at home, who accused him of dismissing U.S. intelligence and giving Putin's denial, reiterated on Friday, of Russian interference too much weight. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters at a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg that Trump had  positive chemistry  with Putin during the meeting, which lasted some two hours and 15 minutes. He opened their discussion by pressing Putin about  the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election  and had a robust exchange, Tillerson said. The Russian president has denied any meddling in the U.S. democratic process last year and Moscow has asked for proof that it took place. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Trump accepted Putin's assertions that the allegations, backed by U.S. intelligence agencies, were false. Tillerson said they both sought to move on.  The presidents rightly focused on how do we move forward from what may be simply an intractable disagreement at this point,  Tillerson said. That explanation did not sit well with Democrats. “Working to compromise the integrity of our election process cannot and should not be an area where ‘agree to disagree’ is an acceptable conclusion,  said U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a statement. On Thursday in Poland Trump gave lukewarm support to the view that Moscow interfered in the 2016 U.S. political process.

Trump says his team did not collude with Russia. Tillerson said they agreed to work on commitments of  non-interference in the affairs of the United States and our democratic process as well as those in other countries.  Andrew Weiss, a former National Security Council official responsible for Russia, said Trump had sent the wrong signal with upbeat body language and by not pushing Putin harder on alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election.  The atmospherics were chummy,  said Weiss, who is now at Washington's Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington.  The clear push from Trump to normalize U.S.-Russian relations was on display in the meeting.

The face-to-face encounter was one of the most eagerly anticipated meetings between two leaders in years. Trump and Putin spoke through translators with their respective foreign ministers present for six minutes before reporters were allowed into the room for their statements. Afterwards the reporters were ushered out and the meeting continued.  President Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well,  Trump told reporters, sitting alongside the Russian leader. Slideshow (14 Images) We've had some very, very good talks. ... We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States and for everybody concerned. And it's an honor to be with you.  Putin, through a translator, said:  We spoke over the phone with you several times,  adding:  A phone conversation is never enough.   I am delighted to be able to meet you personally, Mr. President,  he said, noting that he hoped the meeting would yield results. Both men sat with legs splayed. Trump listened intently as Putin spoke. The encounter went longer than expected, and first lady Melania Trump came in at one point to urge them to conclude, Tillerson said. The two men later joined other G20 leaders at a concert. Mrs. Trump sat next to Putin at dinner. Before the get-together, some feared the U.S. president, a political novice whose team is still developing its Russia policy, would be less prepared for the talks than Putin, a former KGB agent who has dealt with previous U.S. presidents and scores of other world leaders. Amid criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine and Syria and the investigations into its role in the U.S. campaign, Trump has come under growing pressure to take a hard line against the Kremlin. On Thursday, Trump delivered some of his sharpest remarks about Moscow since becoming president, urging Russia to stop its  destabilizing activities  and end its support for Syria and Iran. But Trump stopped short on Thursday of any personal criticism of Putin and declined to say definitively whether he believed U.S. intelligence officials' assertion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  I think it was Russia but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure,” Trump said on a visit to Poland.

On July 1, in a long expected move, Sweden started a two-year phasing out of its tax on nuclear power production, which many nuclear energy producers, including Vattenfall , said had created losses and halted investments.  The tax reduction will be 3 billion crowns per year ... This tax relief is (for us) more pointed towards investments on the prolongation of Swedish nuclear,  Vattenfall's chief executive Magnus Hall said in an interview on Friday. Vattenfall operates seven out of the eight remaining nuclear reactors in Sweden, three at Forsmark and four at Ringhals. Two of the latter are scheduled to be decommissioned by 2020.  We will keep to the schedule of closing them in 2020 and 2019,  Hall said, adding Vattenfall was not planning to invest in new nuclear reactors in Sweden as it was pursuing other more cost-effective technologies. He said the company planned to invest up to 2 billion crowns in solar energy over the next two years, while around 5 billion euros would be spent mainly on wind power over the next five years, much of it offshore wind. Sweden has also voted for legislation forcing nuclear producers to expand the facilities of their reactors, adding external installations that can independently inject water to cool the reactors by 2020.  We have taken a decision already for lifetime extensions for Forsmark 1-2-3 ... the lifetime extension for Ringhals 3 and 4 will be on the table for some decision during the fall,  the CEO said. The phase-out of the nuclear tax in Sweden was a prerequisite for the investment in the reactors' lifetime extensions, he added. In Germany, Vattenfall was forced to halt its nuclear power production and the company is now in a legal dispute over compensation it is claiming from the German state. Hall said the company expected a non-appealable decision from an arbitration court in Washington, D.C. by autumn 2017. Vattenfall, which has suffered for years from low power prices and large impairments related to unsuccessful overseas ventures, made a record loss in 2016. Hall said he expected a  positive results  this year and to pay dividends in 2018. The last time the government's former cash-cow paid a dividend was for 2012. Unlike its German hydropower operations, where Vattenfall recently announced it would cut up to 60 percent of staff to bring down costs, the company's equivalent Swedish operations will not be downsized because they already have a leaner structure, Hall said.

Following the jobs report, the dollar rose to two-month highs against the yen, on pace to post its largest weekly percentage gain since late April. The greenback also rose to a more than one-week peak against sterling. Friday's data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, beating economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. Data for April and May was revised to show 47,000 more jobs created than previously reported.  We view today's report as supportive of the Fed view that they can hike an additional time later this year, while starting to reduce the balance sheet in the fall,  said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston. But while the employment headline number was strong, inflation pressure was still tame. Average hourly earnings, which currency and bond traders also monitor closely, increased just 0.2 percent in June, down from expectations of a 0.3 percent rise. Loh said hourly earnings' 2.5 percent gain from a year earlier were disappointing, with growth slower than at the start of the year and mostly stagnant over the past several months. The dollar initially weakened to 113.54 yen following the jobs report from 113.74 yen minutes before the data's release, as investors focused mostly on the inflation implications of the average earnings growth. It was last at 113.88, up 0.6 percent. The euro, on the other hand, rose to around $1.1430, from $1.1411 ahead of the jobs report, and was last at $1.1395, down 0.2 percent. That pushed the dollar index up 0.3 percent at 96.042 Sterling, meanwhile, fell to a more than one-week low of $1.2871 and was last down 0.7 percent at $1.2882. After the jobs data, U.S. short-term interest rate futures reflected continued bets that the Fed would raise interest rates in December.

The pick-up in activity coincides with broader growth in the Canadian economy, two years after it was hit by low prices for oil, a major export. The recovery in the economy and recent hawkish comments from the Bank of Canada have markets betting on an interest rate hike next week. However, the survey of purchasing managers also showed input prices were higher, with the measure increasing to 57.4 from 51.3, suggesting companies' operating margins may be squeezed.

The IMF now expects Europe's largest economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2017 in real terms, compared with its April forecast of 1.6 percent, and by 1.6 percent in 2018, up from 1.5 percent.  Germany's growth momentum has remained solid, underpinned by robust domestic demand,  the IMF said, pointing to rising employment, increased state spending and the European Central Bank's (ECB) continued monetary stimulus. But it also noted that the ECB's ultra-loose policy was partly to blame for weak profitability in the banking sector.  Low interest rates, if prolonged, would also negatively affect life insurers given their extensive reliance on guaranteed products,  it said. The IMF predicted German exports growth would gradually recover after shipments abroad slowed last year and said this would push up business investment and imports. German wage growth has stayed stable and core inflation steady at about 1 percent despite record low unemployment, high job vacancy rates and rising capacity utilization, it said. Germany's large current account surplus shrunk slightly, to 8.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 from 8.6 percent in 2015 , mainly due to the deterioration of the income and services balance, the IMF said. It warned that Germany's aging population and Berlin's slow progress on structural reforms would dampen growth in the medium term, and urged the government to boost potential growth and speed up external rebalancing to help rein in the current account surplus.  To this end, directors recommended using leeway available within the fiscal rules to further expand public investment in infrastructure, widen the provision of childcare services, foster refugee integration, and reduce the tax burden on labor.  The IMF welcomed signs from German politicians that further reform measures are being mulled. Heading toward a federal election on Sept. 24, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their rival Social Democrats (SPD) both have promised to lower income tax for the middle class and increase investment on digital infrastructure.

Trump,Mitch McConnell,USA,HEALTHCARE/INSURANCE (UPDATE 1),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON, July 7 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday that Congress must act to shore up private health insurance markets if it fails to repeal Obamacare, comments seen as providing a pathway to a bipartisan deal to fix the health system. Speaking at a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky, McConnell said:  If my side is unable to agree on an adequate replacement, then some kind of action with regard to the private health insurance market must occur,  the Associated Press reported.  No action is not an alternative,  McConnell was quoted as saying.  We've got the insurance markets imploding all over the country, including in this state.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed McConnell's comments as a possible opening that could help achieve a bipartisan solution to fix problems with former President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law, dubbed Obamacare.  It is encouraging that Senator McConnell today acknowledged that the issues with the (health insurance) exchanges are fixable and opened the door to bipartisan solutions to improve our healthcare system,  Schumer said in a statement.  Democrats are eager to work with Republicans to stabilize the markets and improve the law,  he added. Many of the individual health insurance markets established under Obamacare have struggled, hurt by an unfavorable balance of sick and healthy customers, and some insurers have pulled out because of uncertainty on whether the government will continue to fund cost-sharing subsidies to help individuals pay premiums. Republicans have been fighting to repeal Obama's signature piece of domestic legislation since it was first approved. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress made repeal a central campaign promise last year. But efforts to replace the healthcare law this year have run into difficulties. The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a replacement bill in May. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 23 million people would lose insurance coverage under the House plan, the Senate made clear it would write its own bill rather than voting on the House measure. The Senate unveiled its healthcare measure in late June. That measure's fate was uncertain after the CBO predicted that under it 15 million people would lose health insurance in 2018, with the number growing to 22 million as a result of cuts to the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled that would take place in 2025. At least one Republican senator publicly opposed the bill and others were critical of it. McConnell can only afford to lose two Republicans from his 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate and still pass the measure.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-insurance-idUSL1N1JX1VO"},

A week of U.N.-mediated talks in the Swiss Alps culminated in a  yelling and drama  session that leaves unresolved a conflict that has kept Greece and Turkey at loggerheads and has hampered Ankara's hopes of joining the European Union. Greek and Turkish Cypriots have lived estranged since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek inspired coup. Major natural gas discoveries in the region over the past decade had added impetus to efforts to secure a deal. Turkey has 30,000 troops stationed in northern Cyprus and their status in any post-settlement peace deal proved to be the undoing of a process one diplomat lamented came  so, so close  to succeeding. Diplomats said Turkey had offered little to Greek Cypriots wanting a full withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island.     Indications which had emerged on Thursday that Turkey was  considering relinquishing intervention rights vanished when the Greek side asked for that commitment in writing. The Greek Cypriots had been ready to make conditional concessions on Turkish Cypriot demands for a rotating presidency, the other key issue. Their plan was submitted in writing.  I don't know where it may go from here,  a diplomatic source told Reuters.  Lack of Trust Related CoverageTurkey says will defend rights of Turkish CypriotsThat source found fault with Turkish Cypriots for being  a bit greedy  and  overplaying their hand , but also Greek Cypriots, who possibly made a tactical error in asking for a written commitment from Turkey relinquishing its intervention rights before a deal had been agreed.  I just don't think there is a sense of trust there. We were really, really close,  the diplomatic source added. Another source close to the Greek side said Turkey had refused to deliver on earlier indications made to the United Nations that it would be  flexible  on intervention rights.  When the United Nations suggested those points be summarized, paving the way for a possible meeting between the prime ministers of Turkey, Greece and Britain - the guarantor powers - next week in New York, Ankara balked.  A woman holds a placard during a demonstration in favour of a peace settlement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on divided Cyprus, at Ledra's checkpoint of the UN-patrolled  green line  in Nicosia, Cyprus July 6, 2017.Yiannis KourtoglouTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu then said those rights could possibly be subject to a review in 15 years, two sources said.  We didn't see that flexibility,  the source close to the Greek side said. Cyprus talks have collapsed before, most spectacularly in 2004, when Greek Cypriots rejected a U.N. reunification blueprint in a referendum while Turkish Cypriots backed it. On that occasion, it took several years for the United Nations to re-engage in a conflict viewed as a diplomats' graveyard; it has seen more than 25 special UN envoys over the years.  Slideshow (2 Images)Next Steps? In Turkey, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said his country would maintain a constructive stance, adding that the Greek side had not done so.  Of course, what is indispensable for us is that no matter what result is obtained or what topic is agreed upon, security and the issue of guarantees are vitally important (to ensure) that past troubles are not repeated, and easing up on these is out of the question,  Yildirim said. Ankara supports a breakaway unrecognized state in north Cyprus which is heavily reliant on Turkish political and financial support. Britain, the former colonial power in Cyprus and a guarantor nation under a convoluted treaty which granted the island independence in 1960, said it was  enormously disappointed .  Now is a time for calm reflection and consideration of next steps. Our commitment to a deal remains unwavering,  a British government spokesperson said. A downcast Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, who had flown in on Thursday to help clinch a deal, said the world body remained at the disposal of the sides to facilitate any future engagement. Quite what that means is unclear. Cavuslogu said the outcome showed the  impossibility of a solution within the parameters of the U.N. good offices mission .  There is now no sense in insisting on these parameters,  he said.

The quality and number of golden ornaments is highly unusual and includes 22 complete pieces - such as symbol-laden pendants, a nose ring and a chest plate - all made from thin sheets of the precious metal, lead archaeologist Leonardo Lopez told Reuters.  Held in a stone box, the cache was discovered in April near the capital city's bustling main square, the Zocalo, behind the colonial-era Roman Catholic cathedral and off the steps of what was once the most important Aztec ceremonial temple, now known as the Templo Mayor.  These are, without a doubt, the largest and most refined pieces of gold discovered so far,  said Lopez, referring to the 205 offerings discovered over nearly four decades of excavations around the site, 16 of which have contained some gold. Not long after the roughly eight-month-old wolf was killed, it was likely dressed with golden ornaments as well as a belt of shells from the Atlantic Ocean, then carefully placed in a stone box by Aztec priests above a layer of flint knives, according to Lopez. The west-facing wolf represented Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec war god and solar deity. Wolves were believed to help guide fallen warriors across a dangerous river in the netherworld. The Templo Mayor would have been as high as a 15-story building before it was razed along with the rest of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan after the 1521 Spanish conquest of Mexico. Measuring about 12-1/2 cubic feet, the trove was also filled with other layers of once-living offerings from the air, land and sea, all infused with spiritual meaning for the Aztecs.  What they're doing is they're communicating with those levels of the environment that they live in because they know that they've been given the gift of life,  said David Carrasco, a Harvard University historian of religion and Aztec scholar. Gold pieces formed into symbols are seen at a site where a sacrificed young wolf elaborately adorned with some of the finest Aztec gold has been discovered, adjacent to the Templo Mayor, one of the main Aztec temples, in Mexico City, Mexico  June 22, 2017. Picture taken June 22, 2017.Henry RomeroExcavations began in the densely-packed area after the demolition of two buildings that once covered the site. The box was damaged in 1900 when a sewage line was laid down next to it, Lopez said, and city workers must have had no inkling of what lay inside if they even noticed it at the time.  If they had seen the golden objects, they would have ransacked it right away,  he said. Slideshow (11 Images)The Aztecs, who called themselves  Mexica,  prized gold, though nearly their entire supply was looted by the Spanish and melted into bars for easier transport to Europe. Objects made of jade and feathers of the quetzal were considered even more valuable. Quetzal birds are native to Central America and the male grows a long, brilliant green tail feather that was especially valuable to the Aztecs. The golden wolf was buried during the 1486-1502 reign of King Ahuitzotl, the most feared and powerful ruler of the Mexica, who extended the empire as far south as present-day Guatemala. The reign of Ahuitzotl was particularly brutal, which may also explain the fate of the young wolf. Lopez said tests on its ribs will be needed to confirm his theory that the animal's heart was torn out as part of the sacrifice, just as captured warriors were ritually killed on blood-soaked platforms of Aztec temples. But this was no ordinary violence, noted Carrasco.  These people didn't just kill these things. They didn't just kill people and throw them away,  he said.  They took elaborate, symbolic care for them because they knew that the presence that they represented, the presence of god, had to be nurtured.

Facing an election in 2018, Mugabe says the subsidy will make Zimbabwe self-sufficient in the grain and help struggling farmers. Mugabe's government announced the scheme last year as part of a 'Command Agriculture' drive, saying it would pay farmers $390 a ton for maize this harvest to encourage farmers to plant. Nearly 70 percent of Zimbabwe's population is rural-based and survives on agriculture. The government has not said what it will do with the maize it has bought - essentially who it will sell to and for how much. That information is needed to work out how much the scheme will cost the government. However, the Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe, a grouping of the 100 biggest private millers, has agreed to buy 800,000 tonnes of maize from the state for $194 million this season, or $242.50 a ton, its chairman, Tafadzwa Musarara, told Reuters. At this price, the government would lose $147.50 for every ton it buys from farmers and sells to these private millers, totaling $118 million, according to Reuters calculations. Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the subsidy calculations.  The final cost could be much higher if the government buys more grain, with the southern African nation forecast to grow 2.1 million tonnes of maize this year, financial analysts said.  Escalating Debt  Zimbabwe is already in arrears for $7 billion of international debt - around 50 percent of GDP - and its domestic debt burden is growing rapidly as Mugabe's administration runs ever larger budget deficits. Domestic debt now stands at $4 billion after a 2016 deficit of $1.4 billion - from an initial forecast of just $150 million. This year's deficit forecast is $400 million. The budget does not include any 'Command Agriculture' spending. Chinamasa issued a statement in the state-owned Herald newspaper on June 28 defending the maize subsidies:   The command agriculture program was designed to (mobilize) sustainable and affordable funding for our agriculture so as to ensure food security, eliminate imports of food, to increase exports from this sector and reduce poverty.      Despite government assertions that the subsidies will help farmers and feed the nation, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said the scheme is typical of the practices that have taken root during Mugabe's 37 years in power. He said it would benefit ruling ZANU-PF party members who acquired land after the violent eviction of 4,000 white commercial farmers from 2000.  Who is benefiting? The same ZANU-PF elites who took the land,  Tsvangirai told Reuters.  The Treasury has to fork that out and it's not sustainable. It's a fiscal nightmare.  Chinamasa said in his statement that concerns about mismanagement had been dealt with and all beneficiaries of the agriculture program would be held in a database. Mugabe, 93, and who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980, has personally defended the maize subsidy but the World Bank says paying above the market rate is not the answer.  Government intervention is both expensive and inefficient, especially the use of price support, as floor prices are set far higher than import-competing prices,  it said in its latest Zimbabwe report published in June. Subsidies, Heavy Rainfall An International Monetary Fund source, who declined to be named, said the subsidy would be difficult to monitor, funds could be funneled to political interests and crops could be smuggled across borders.   The 'Command Agriculture' drive includes farmers receiving seed, fertilizer and chemicals with the proviso that they sell part of their crop to the state as repayment.  Mugabe says the policy is the reason for Zimbabwe forecasting a maize harvest of 2.1 million tonnes this year, enough to meet local demand for the first time in 16 years. The IMF source and an agriculture expert at a Western aid agency said the forecast was more to do with heavy rainfall. Neighboring countries have also had bumper crops this season. Zimbabwe has since 2001 relied on imports and foreign donors to meet demand for maize. Drought, lack of financing and Mugabe's seizures of land from white farmers that hit commercial agriculture were blamed for low grain production over the years. Zimbabwe has banned grain imports to protect local farmers,  just one year after a devastating drought left more than four million people in need of food aid.

The stake sale will test the interest of some of the largest consumer food companies, which are looking to revitalize their sales as consumers turn to novelty and healthier alternatives.  A deal could also give thirteen-year old Kind, which has developed a brand known for its use of ingredients  people can see and pronounce,  its first corporate partner to expand both in the United States and abroad. New York-based Kind, which has $727 million in annual sales according to Euromonitor, is working with investment banks BDT Capital Partners and Centerview Partners Holdings LLC on the stake sale, the sources said. BDT is also a minority investor in Kind. The process could attract large food companies such as Kellogg Co (K.N), General Mills Inc (GIS.N), Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) and Mars Inc, the sources said. Kind is not offering the right to buy out the entire company down the line as part of the deal, one of the sources added. The sources requested anonymity because the process is confidential.   Kind is solely focused on becoming the foremost health and wellness leader to provide our consumers with delicious and healthy products so they can do the kind thing every day,  a Kind spokesman said, declining to comment specifically on the stake sale process. BDT declined to comment and Centerview could not be immediately reached for comment. Kind, founded in 2004 by Daniel Lubetzky, the Mexican-American son of a Holocaust survivor, sells nut bars, breakfast bars, clusters and fruit bites. It was one of the first popular food snacks to eschew artificial flavors and  preservatives, a trend that larger food companies are now embracing as they seek to woo back customers. In the United States, the world's biggest packaged food market, upstart brands such as Kind could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade's time compared with 5.0 percent now, according to Bernstein Research. In search of growth, food companies have turned to acquisitions, such as General Mills' $820 million deal for organic food maker Annie’s Inc in 2014. Still, minority investments in established brands such as Kind have been less frequent.  Private equity firm VMG group bought a stake in Kind in 2008. It later sold back its share to Lubetzky in 2014 in a stake sale that valued the company at $728.5 million.

Non-farm payrolls jumped by 222,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday, beating economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain.

U.S. Treasury futures gained while the U.S. dollar trimmed its gains, with the dollar index .DXY flat versus up 0.2 percent just before the numbers.  Analysts Comments: SHYAM RAJAN, HEAD OF U.S. RATES STRATEGY AT BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH IN NEW YORK: “The larger message is: this does not necessarily alter the moves that we’ve seen over the last two weeks in any way. In the last two weeks, yields have risen because of what the (German) Bund market has done and what yields in Germany have done. This in the short term at least does not add a meaningful stop to that move. So I think this is status quo as it relates to the U.S., so we’re going to continue to be driven by Bunds and European yields.” “Given the focus of the Fed on inflation, and the fact that the inflation indicators in this report were slightly disappointing, I think the market has a toned down reaction to it, but in the bigger picture it’s still a pretty decent report. The headline figure was decent, the pickup in the unemployment rate was because the participation rate went up, so it’s not a bad pickup in the unemployment rate.”“The bond market has already priced in an extremely slow Fed. It’s much slower than the median dots already. It’s not massively altering its course based on this report, because it’s kind of a mixed bag report. But I do think strongly that we’ll go back to being driven by Europe in the next couple of weeks.” JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT TD AMERITRADE IN CHICAGO: “I was surprised by a few things in it, we didn’t have a lot of healthcare jobs created. That was the first time in a long time healthcare wasn’t in our top three. And there wasn’t much weakness in retail as I thought there would be, so I am interested to see what happens in those two going forward.   There just isn’t any wage pressure at all and that is a little bit concerning, as you can’t continue to get all this job growth without wage pressure. So something is not adding up at all. Or the gig economy is bigger than we think it is.  JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT THE LEUTHOLD GROUP, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA:  On the surface, this is a goldilocks report. Solid job gains, uptick in participation and no wage pressures. Good for stocks. With any productivity gains, this suggests a real GDP growth rate north of 3.0 percent. The problem though is the same issue faces the financial markets now that was there before the report. And that is that if we are creating 200,000 jobs with near 4.0 percent unemployment, inflation is going to soon increase putting pressure on the Fed and ‘bond vigilantes.’ So a solid report particularly for stocks this morning but the financial markets still face the same issue...Will inflation rise soon pushing yields higher?”  Kully Samra, Uk Managing Director at Charles Schwab: “A positive jobs report which surpasses expectations. With unemployment so low and labor markets becoming tight, job creation is a challenge so growth is a positive sign for the US economy. “With only one more rate hike expected this year, investors should turn their attention to the Fed, which will soon attempt to shrink its behemoth $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Success would be if the Fed can gracefully divert the excess liquidity it’s created from financial assets to the real economy. “Since rates began to rise in December 2015, financial conditions have loosened and hence the Fed is likely to remain on a tightening path, notwithstanding subdued inflation or a persistent turn in the jobs market. Looser financial conditions are also a key reason for the strength in the stock market, and this bull market should persist provided the Fed doesn’t tighten conditions too much or too fast.” Mark Hamrick, Senior Economic Analyst, bankrate.com:  Hiring is back to where it has been throughout much of the eight-year-old economic expansion. With a June surge in hiring and upward revisions to payroll gains for April and May, the past three months are looking better than what we’d been thinking. Growth is modest, not spectacular, which is to be expected for a mature expansion.   Once again, the buzz kill on the jobs report is the lack of more substantial wage growth. Average hourly earnings are up 2.5 percent over the past year. This suggests that we’ve not yet checked off the 'full employment' box, meaning more progress can be extracted from the job market. More than 5 million Americans still work part-time who’d like to have full-time work.  RYAN DETRICK, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST FOR LPL FINANCIAL, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA:  It’s definitely a step in the right direction. We're looking at now four of first six months of the year with 200,000 jobs or more. Clearly some of the economic data we saw in the second quarter was on the weak side so it’s nice to see the jobs market continues to show life and by no means is it showing signs of weakness.  It definitely seems the economy is on firm footing and this is a nice solid report so we can look forward to earnings season coming up.  The one potential slight concern was the average wages didn't raise quite so much as some of those early estimates. But that falls in with some of the inflation data we've been seeing.  After yesterday's big sell off this is kind of a relief. We wouldn't be surprised if we had a little bit of a relief bounce but this is a Friday and this is summer time. These are light volume days.   MARK GRANT, CHIEF STRATEGIST AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF HILLTOP SECURITIES, FT. LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA:  Politics aside, the U.S. economy is picking up again. You can point fingers where you like but the numbers are encouraging.  Consensus had been for increase of 178,000 and 220,000 new jobs were added in June. The ‘Doom and Gloom’ crowd just got subdued. That said, I still think that we are done with rate hikes for this year. I believe the Fed's outlook will be significantly changed when Mr. Trump appoints four new members of the Fed. I also think that significant pressure will come from Mr. Mnuchin & Co. to hold interest rates down.   MICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON: “The topline number is quite strong, we saw positive revisions to the previous month and the average for this year is consistent with the average employment per month from last year. Again, it’s not showing any real deceleration in the labor market. “We see an uptick in wages a little bit, so that again indicates with the tightness in the labor market  perhaps we’ll see some wage acceleration. Lastly, the gains were broad-based across industries, so that’s always a good thing as well. I always look to see if it was driven by one or two industries, but this had some solid gains across the board. It’s interesting, both the stock market and bond market seem like it this morning, as stocks ticks up and yields have ticked a bit lower. “The Fed is on hold for the summer months. I don’t think they’ll do anything in terms of a rate hike or begin the balance sheet run-off process at the end of July. They don’t meet in August so it’s probably not until at least until September where the Fed begins to tighten monetary policy conditions again, and I don’t think this report does anything to change that.” TOM DI GALOMA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SEAPORT GLOBAL, NEW YORK: “On the surface it looks like a solid report, there’s an uptick in the unemployment rate, however.   What’s going on with rates is we’ve moved a very big way in a very short period of time. I think the market’s a bit oversold, I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if we saw some pretty decent buying around these levels. If anything we’re probably due for a bit of a rally. I don’t think it’s done anything to change the Fed’s view.   It’s just a little bit stronger than expectations. I think the Fed is probably more worried about the balance sheet than they are about moving rates at this point, they seem to be more focused on that. If anything I think the Fed doesn’t move rates until December and focuses more on the balance sheet in the September time frame.” SHANNON SACCOCIA, HEAD OF ASSET ALLOCATION AND PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, BOSTON PRIVATE WEALTH, BOSTON: “This is a pretty good report for the equity market. The most notable piece of information is the average hourly earnings and its implication on inflation. The Fed wants to see it in excess of 3.0 percent. We are still hovering at 2.5 percent level. The Fed wants to get in one more rate hike this year.  But there’s no justification for them to accelerate as far as their path of rate hikes and tapering bond reinvestments. On the other hand, there is enough for the equity market to not worry of economic softness after the ISM manufacturing report earlier this week and this jobs report.” Americas Desk","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-instant-view-idUSKBN19S1U8"},

Canada's economy added 45,300 jobs last month, topping the  10,000 gain forecast by economists. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.5 percent, even as more people were looking for work.                   It is a pretty solid report ... if you were leaning toward a hike in July this would do nothing to dissuade you,  said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.     Chances of an increase at next week's rate meeting rose to 91 percent from 86 percent before the jobs report, data from the overnight index swaps market showed.                Expectations of a rate increase have been rising since top Bank of Canada officials said in June that a pair of 2015 interest rate cuts had done their job in cushioning the economy from collapsing oil prices.                  At 9:24 a.m. ET (1324 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2894 to the greenback, or 77.56 U.S. cents, up 0.7 percent.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.2994, while it touched its strongest since Sept. 8 at C$1.2888.     The loonie strengthened even as prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell.     U.S. crude        was down 1.82 percent at $44.69 a barrel after data showed U.S. production rose last week just as Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries exports hit a 2017 high, casting doubts on efforts by producers to curb oversupply.                  The U.S. dollar        rose against a basket of major currencies after U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, signs of labor market strength that could keep the Federal Reserve on course for a third interest rate increase this year despite benign inflation.                  Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper yield curve, with the two-year            down 4 Canadian cents to yield 1.165 percent and the 10-year             falling 41 Canadian cents to yield 1.881 percent.     The 10-year yield reached its highest intraday since June 2015 at 1.886 percent, while the gap between the two-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 2.6 basis points to -23.8 basis points, its narrowest since Oct. 18, as Canadian government bonds underperformed.

The stake sale will test the interest of some of the largest consumer food companies, which are looking to revitalize their sales as consumers turn to novelty and healthier alternatives.  A deal could also give thirteen-year old Kind, which has developed a brand known for its use of ingredients  people can see and pronounce,  its first corporate partner to expand both in the United States and abroad. New York-based Kind, which has $727 million in annual sales according to Euromonitor, is working with investment banks BDT Capital Partners and Centerview Partners Holdings LLC on the stake sale, the sources said. BDT is also a minority investor in Kind. The process could attract large food companies such as Kellogg Co (K.N), General Mills Inc (GIS.N), Campbell Soup Co (CPB.N) PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) and Mars Inc, the sources said. Kind is not offering the right to buy out the entire company down the line as part of the deal, one of the sources added. The sources requested anonymity because the process is confidential.   Kind is solely focused on becoming the foremost health and wellness leader to provide our consumers with delicious and healthy products so they can do the kind thing every day,  a Kind spokesman said, declining to comment specifically on the stake sale process. BDT declined to comment and Centerview could not be immediately reached for comment. Kind, founded in 2004 by Daniel Lubetzky, the Mexican-American son of a Holocaust survivor, sells nut bars, breakfast bars, clusters and fruit bites. It was one of the first popular food snacks to eschew artificial flavors and  preservatives, a trend that larger food companies are now embracing as they seek to woo back customers. In the United States, the world's biggest packaged food market, upstart brands such as Kind could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade's time compared with 5.0 percent now, according to Bernstein Research. In search of growth, food companies have turned to acquisitions, such as General Mills' $820 million deal for organic food maker Annie’s Inc in 2014. Still, minority investments in established brands such as Kind have been less frequent.  Private equity firm VMG group bought a stake in Kind in 2008. It later sold back its share to Lubetzky in 2014 in a stake sale that valued the company at $728.5 million.

Comments from central banks in the euro zone, Britain and Canada since early last week have led to a view that an era of ultra-loose policy is drawing to a close. That in turn has sparked heavy selling in government bond markets, where yields have long been pinned down by record-low interest rates and monetary stimulus. Because quantitative easing (QE) was used as a substitute for negative interest rates, unwinding QE will be a key part of the normalisation of rates policy, Chris Iggo, CIO for global fixed income at AXA Investment Managers, said in a note.  The significant increase in government bond yields over the last week suggests that markets are starting to price this in,  he said.  My guess is that it will have quite a bit further to go. In the space of just over a week, benchmark German 10-year Bund yields have doubled -- vaulting above 0.50 percent to 18 month highs. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are up 23 basis points from the start of last week, while Japanese bond yields shot up to five-month highs earlier on Friday -- prompting the Bank of Japan to promise unlimited bond purchases to keep a lid on bond yields.  There's no doubt that there has been a significant repricing in the last week and a half across global bond markets,  Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in his daily note on Friday. In the euro zone, comments from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi last week fuelled talk that the ECB was likely to start scaling back its bond-buying stimulus in coming months. ECB officials, unnerved by the bond market reaction, have since tried to soothe markets, stressing they would be cautious about any change in policy, but yields have remained elevated. The shake-out in bond markets follows a period when investors were too complacent, said Mark Dowding, co-head of investment grade debt at BlueBay Asset Management. He said that U.S. jobs data suggested the selloff could be contained given signs that wage growth is modest, but added that bond markets remained vulnerable to further selling.  A lot of markets are at important technical levels, so losses could beget further selling and if that were to occur you could see more volatility across world markets,  Dowding said.  There is a sense that we are at a cuspy point in bond markets.

The economy added 45,300 jobs last month, Statistics Canada said, topping forecasts for a gain of 10,000. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.5 percent, its lowest since April, even as more people were looking for work. The details were somewhat mixed, with part-time jobs rising by 37,100 and accounting for the bulk of the hiring gains. Full-time employment rose by 8,100. But economists were more focused on the strength the labor market has shown over the past several months as the economy has recovered from the hit it took from cheaper oil prices two years ago. Since last June, employers have added 350,800 jobs, with 248,200 of those full-time. With the economy improving, Bank of Canada policymakers have taken a more hawkish tone. Markets are increasingly betting on a rate hike after the central bank's next meeting on Wednesday.  The strength in labor markets, with no indication of any kind of pullback, leaves the Bank of Canada poised to start tightening policy later this month,  said Royal Bank of Canada assistant chief economist Paul Ferley. The Bank of Canada lowered rates twice in 2015 to cushion the blow from the oil price shock and has since left them at 0.50 percent. Top policymakers have said in recent weeks that those cuts have done their job, laying the groundwork to move rates higher. Market odds of a rate increase next week rose to 90.6 percent from 86.5 percent just before the report was released, while the Canadian dollar strengthened to a nearly 10-month high against the greenback. The service sector led June's jobs gains with 29,200 new jobs, including 27,000 professional, scientific and technical services positions, as employers hired more computer system designers. Hiring also rose in the healthcare, public administration and accommodation industries. Goods producers added 16,000 jobs, with gains in agriculture and manufacturing. Still, economists said there was no sign of wage pressure, with average hourly earnings up 1 percent from a year earlier, matching May's pace. Still, the Bank of Canada probably believes it is only a matter of time before wages start to firm, said Scotiabank economist Derek Holt.

Fox's comments came a day after the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said London's  red lines  for a future trading relationship meant Britain was definitely leaving the single market and customs union and would carry consequences. Britain responded to Barnier by saying it was still hoping for trade that was  as frictionless as possible .  We're going into an arrangement with the EU already with zero tariffs, we're going there with complete regulatory equivalence and with customs systems that already work,  Fox told Reuters during a visit to Paris.   The only reason we wouldn't replicate them would be if politics got in the way of good economics.  British Prime Minister Theresa May wants to use Brexit to create a  Global Britain , saying London will be in a stronger position outside the EU to negotiate new trade deals. May has acknowledged Britain may need an implementation period to smooth its exit from the bloc, and business leaders have pressed her to push for Britain to remain within the single market until a final deal is negotiated. Fox said the government  wanted to have minimal disruption and maximum continuity  until it reached a final agreement, adding that it was perfectly reasonable that people should want to have some transitional period.   But we can't have a perpetual transitional period undermining the concept of Brexit itself,  he said. Britain is not allowed to negotiate and conclude new trade agreements with non-EU countries as long as it is a member of the union. Nonetheless, Fox dismissed suggestions that a transitional period might hamper his efforts to reach new accords swiftly.  The most we can do is scope them out at the present time to begin negotiations after we leave. So it's very unlikely we'd be concluding many of those within that time scale (transition) so it probably makes no difference whatsoever.  The EU on Thursday celebrated a far-reaching trade pact with Japan, the world's fourth biggest economy, raising questions over Britain's ability to leverage a similar deal once outside the bloc and the future of Japanese manufacturers in Britain. Fox dismissed the concerns.  If the deal is ratified before we leave the EU we would simply transitionally adopt that into UK law,  Fox said.  If it's not ratified ... Clearly now we would have a template, but we would have the ability to tweak it at the edges if that is what was wanted.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 222,000 jobs last month, data from the Labor Department showed, beating economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in June after gaining 0.1 percent in May, but fell below the estimated 0.3 percent. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.  The topline number is quite strong. We saw positive revisions to the previous month and the average for this year is consistent with the average employment per month from last year,  said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Investors are focused on wage growth and whether spending by consumers will be strong enough to back the Fed's rate hike plans. Odds of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting stood at 50.6 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Policymakers have taken opposing views on inflation after it retreated below the central bank's 2 percent target in May, creating uncertainty over the future path of rate hikes. Adding to the jitters are bets that the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding their ultra-loose monetary policies. At 9:33 a.m. ET (1333 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 49.53 points, or 0.23 percent, at 21,369.57, the S&P; 500 was up 6.67 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,416.42. The Nasdaq Composite was up 27.33 points, or 0.45 percent, at 6,116.80. Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the tech index's 0.49 percent rise leading the gainers. The financial index rose 0.47 percent. Shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs rose about 0.8 percent in premarket trading. Oil fell more than 2 percent after data showed U.S. production rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high. Oil prices are down more than 16 percent this year, adding to low inflation concerns. The energy sector fell 0.2 percent and was the only laggard. Tesla edged up 0.8 percent after the luxury electric carmaker won an Australian contract to install the world's biggest grid-scale battery. Tesla's shares have fallen about 15 percent this week following the company's lower-than-expected deliveries. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,468 to 943. On the Nasdaq, 1,366 issues rose and 676 fell. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-idUSL4N1JY4AE"},

Prices as measured by the benchmark IPCA index fell 0.23 percent in June, the first deflation rate since June 2006 and the fastest drop in prices since August 1998, government statistics agency IBGE said on Friday.     The annual inflation rate dropped to 3.00 percent, down from 3.60 percent in the 12 months through May and below the 3.06- percent rate forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.     The official inflation target for 2017 is 4.5 percent, with a tolerance range of 1.5 percentage point.     Yields on interest rate futures were down as traders added bets on a 100-basis-point interest rate cut at the next central bank's monetary policy meeting on July 26.      The bank had previously signaled that it could reduce the pace of cuts to 75-points per meeting because of growing political uncertainty, but has moderated its tone in recent speeches as market volatility ebbed and price rises continued to slow.                  Inflation has slumped from nearly 11 percent in early 2016 as a deep recession ended earlier this year left the economy operating well below its capacity.

The work at Pennsylvania Station is due to begin Monday and run through Sept. 1, leaving the roughly 600,000 commuters who arrive there each morning from New Jersey and Long Island scrambling for alternate ways into the city. Ferry operators, bus services and even parking lots are looking to capitalize on the disruption, which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said will likely mean a  summer of hell  for those who rely on the New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road systems that will be disrupted as Amtrak undertakes $40 million in track repairs.  This is going to be a tough couple of months,  said Ronnie Hakim, interim executive director for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the LIRR, the Metro-North Railroad and New York City subways and buses.  Hakim advised commuters to travel outside of peak periods if possible, spread out along platforms to avoid overcrowding and purchase tickets ahead of time.   Consider trying to do things a little differently,  she said.  Related CoverageNew York-bound train derails just days ahead of planned track repairsCommuters waylaid by a series of recent derailments got yet another taste of travel disruptions to come on Thursday night, when a NJ Transit train carrying 180 customers and crew derailed near Penn Station. One option officials are warning against is trying to drive into the already congested city, even as parking lots near the midtown transit hub urge riders in billboards and advertisements to do just that.  Anyone who works in the city understands the gridlock that characterizes downtown and midtown Manhattan during business hours. It's why they chose mass transit to begin with,  said New Jersey state Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who chairs the chamber's transportation committee. Commuters walk through Penn Station during the morning commute in New York City, NY, U.S. July 7, 2017.Brendan McDermidWisniewski urged riders to consider ferries and buses as alternatives, with 97,000 cars per day already crossing from New Jersey to New York City, according to city data.  The delays will take a toll on the city's economy, with Manhattan employers expected to lose an estimated $14.5 million for every hour that train commuters from New Jersey and Long Island are delayed, according to an estimate by the Partnership for New York City.  Silver Lining? Slideshow (3 Images)Some regular train riders are trying to find silver linings to the change in routine. Among them are commuters taking New Jersey Transit up on its offer to honor some train tickets on ferries that carry travelers across the Hudson River, a journey that normally costs $9 each way.  Riding the ferry is definitely way less stressful than having to run into a tunnel and hope the train gets you there,  Tim Dedman, 43, of West Orange, New Jersey, an information technology manager who works in lower Manhattan.  The view is great. All these gleaming towers rising out of the fog.    Others are using the transit trauma to nurture a creative streak.  Who knew my disgust, Could be expressed artfully? Now get me to Penn,  wrote Joey Neri, an advertising copywriter, in a haiku posted on the Facebook group NJ Transit Riders Revolt. Neri, 30, said in an email that he moved to Edison, New Jersey, because of the direct train service to Penn Station just months before the repairs were announced. He said he had not written a haiku since high school but now so regularly posts 17-syllable poems that he has picked up the nickname  the Bard of Penn Station.  His planned Monday missive?  It is July tenth, The Summer of Hell begins, Good luck commuters.

OPEC and allied non-OPEC producers such as Russia agreed to limit oil supply into 2018, but crude prices LCOc1 have fallen since May, partly because of higher production from Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempt from cutting output. Key energy ministers, including those for Saudi Arabia and Russia, have previously said there was no immediate need for extra measures to support oil prices. But on Friday, Russia's Energy Ministry said Moscow was ready to consider proposals, including revising the deal if need be. OPEC delegates told Reuters that while no concrete discussions about further steps were talking place now, the Russian comments gave a positive basis for ideas, such as a larger cut, to be considered.  Encouraging indications from Russia for such thoughts like deeper cuts give better justification to promote and develop such ideas to rebalance markets,  one source close to OPEC said.  It provides a good basis, but no discussion is there yet.  Oil ministers from five countries monitoring the deal plus Saudi Arabia as OPEC president are scheduled to meet in Russia on July 24. They could recommend adjusting the pact to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November. OPEC officials have been talking about whether production by Libya and Nigeria should be capped, although such a step would face resistance from those countries. In addition, OPEC also looked at a larger production cut at its last meeting held in May, only to reject it. Both ideas will probably be looked at again at the meeting this month in the form of scenarios, OPEC sources said. But one OPEC delegate said additional steps were unlikely to win sufficient support now from enough of the 24 OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating because the existing agreement runs until March 2018.  I don't think the member countries are ready to do anything more,  the delegate said.  Let's wait and see how the agreement works.

The monitoring group Airwars says a total of at least 4,354 civilians have been killed by coalition air strikes. The latest coalition report included an incident on April 17 near the Syrian town of Abu Kamal, in which it said 25 civilians were killed and 40 were wounded during a strike against an Islamic State headquarters that caused a secondary explosion in the adjacent building.  Since the start of the campaign against Islamic State militants, the coalition has carried out nearly 22,000 strikes and has received 727 reports of potential civilian casualties, the report said.  The coalition, battling to defeat Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties.

On his first official visit to Southeast Asia, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi this week met communities in the towns of Sittwe and Maungdaw in Myanmar's Rakhine state, home to a large population of Rohingya Muslims. He also met Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's de facto leader. Rakhine State in west Myanmar has seen the most serious religious violence in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar since the military began to end its decades of strict rule, with hundreds of Rohingya Muslims killed and more than 140,000 people displaced there in communal unrest in 2012. Tensions have risen again in recent days after village administrators were murdered and troops killed three people while clearing a Rohingya militant camp.  It's important to work on granting citizenship to the Muslim community, that has been deprived of citizenship for many years,  Grandi told reporters in Bangkok. Myanmar's government regards the approximately one million Rohingya as illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh and denies them citizenship, even though Rohingya families have lived there for generations. Grandi also said that more investment was needed in the region. UNHCR High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi gestures during a news conference at a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, July 7, 2017.Athit Perawongmetha It is one of the poorest states in the Union of Myanmar and there's an urgent need for development investments that must be inclusive of the two communities,  he said. Last October, Rohingya insurgents launched deadly attacked on Myanmar guard posts near the Bangladesh border, provoking a military crackdown in which the United Nations says hundreds were killed, more than 1,000 homes burned and some 75,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh. The United Nations has established a fact-finding mission to investigate crimes against humanity allegedly committed by Myanmar's military during the counter-offensive. Suu Kyi's administration has rejected the allegations and opposes the mission. In the latest unrest in the region, a Rohingya Muslim man was killed and six wounded when they were attacked by a mob of Rakhine Buddhists this week. In Thailand, more than 102,000 refugees from Myanmar live in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. Most are members of the Karen ethnic minority who fled conflict in Myanmar over the past 30 years. The Thai government was preparing to help about 200 camp residents to return to Myanmar in the near future, Grandi said, following the voluntary repatriation of 71 Myanmar refugees in October. Grandi will fly to Bangladesh on Saturday. Reporting by Donna Airoldi; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-refugees-idUSKBN19S1VJ"},

Slideshow (6 Images)On Friday the number of protesters accompanying Kilicdaroglu reached some 50,000. A large rally is expected on Sunday in Istanbul, supported by parliament's third largest party, the pro-Kurdish HDP.  The battle in parliament will most likely be tougher in the coming days because they want to limit our right to speak by changing the internal bylaws and it is impossible for us to tolerate this,  Kilicdaroglu said.  Therefore this battle will get tougher, and it may even spill over to the streets.

Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud is not cited as the target of the probe into the way a party promoting France at a consumer electronics fair in Las Vegas in 2016 was organized. Macron won power in May promising to rid politics of corruption and conflicts of interest. Several members of his government have bowed out following media scrutiny of funding investigations in which their names have cropped up. The investigation announced on Friday concerns a party for Business France at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, where Macron himself was present in his role as economy minister.  There was no open tender to organize the event and the party was put together by the Havas public relations agency. Havas has said it had an 18-month contract with the state agency which allowed for it to do the job without the need for a public tender. Penicaud, head of Business France at the time, said she was the one who raised the alarm when an audit exposed a potential problem. Macron has said any minister placed under formal investigation by magistrates must resign even though such investigations do not automatically lead to trial. Penicaud, who appears to escape that obligation because she has not personally been placed under investigation, is in charge of sensitive negotiations with labor unions over Macron's plans to shake up the jobs market. The prosecutor's office said the full-scale inquiry followed preliminary investigations opened in mid-March on the basis of information supplied by state financial inspectors.

President Robert Mugabe's government has not received foreign funding since it started defaulting on its external debt in 1999 and the country is relying on domestic borrowing and taxes to fund its national budget. The IMF said in a statement on Friday after a meeting of its executive board this week that although Harare cleared its arrears with the fund last year, talks with the World Bank and other multilateral lenders faced delays.  It (Zimbabwe) is yet to reach agreement with the World Bank and other multilateral institutions on the settlement of arrears, and undertake reforms that would facilitate resolution of arrears with bilateral creditors,  the IMF said. The IMF also said Zimbabwe should not seek to clear its $1.75 billion arrears through agreements that would worsen its debt situation. Zimbabwe's foreign debt stands at more than $7 billion, more than half of its GDP. On April 27, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa said the southern African nation had met all conditions to clear arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank, paving the way for possible future funding from the IMF. But the IMF warned that Zimbabwe's borrowings from its central bank and domestic banks to plug its budget deficit was unsustainable and had  significant potential for generating inflationary pressures.  The World Bank has forecast a 3.2 percent annual inflation rate in Zimbabwe at the end of this year, before accelerating sharply to 9.6 percent at the end of 2018. The government's domestic borrowing stands at more than $4 billion and is seen growing as the government struggles to raise money to finance everything from salaries to agriculture.  The marked increase in public debt is crowding out private sector activity, aggravating liquidity shortages, and exacerbating debt distress,  the IMF said. Zimbabwe has been facing shortages of cash and foreign currency since last year, forcing banks to limit daily withdrawals while importers, including mining companies, have struggled to pay for their goods abroad.

Big labels like Universal are booming, while listeners can access tens of millions of songs through relatively affordable services like Spotify. Yet as problems at Germany’s SoundCloud highlight, the loss-making streamers themselves have yet to prove they have an independent future alongside tech rivals such as Apple and Amazon. SoundCloud, which was the target of an aborted bid by Spotify last year, said on Thursday it was sacking 173 staff – about 40 percent of its workforce – and closing its San Francisco office. Founder and Chief Executive Alex Ljung said in a blog post that cutting costs would help on its “path to profitability” and keep the company in control of its “independent future”. The Berlin-based company is different from streaming behemoths Spotify and Apple Music, as it relies more on amateur musicians than the output of major artists. SoundCloud’s failure to turn its 175 million unique monthly listeners into a profitable business is nonetheless instructive of the sector’s challenging economics. Major labels and artists have so far done best from the boom in streaming revenues, which grew at a compound average rate of 48 percent from 2014 to 2016 to reach $4.5 billion, according to Morgan Stanley. Spotify’s revenue last year was more than $3.3 billion, according to filings published by Music Business Worldwide – a 50 percent-plus annual increase. But its cost of revenue – mainly royalties and other payments to rights holders and publishers – was 85 percent of that figure, which means most of the money is going straight out the door. Labels could give the independent streamers a break by cutting royalty rates, but have so far driven a hard bargain. Unless that changes, behemoths like Apple and Amazon will take a bigger share of the market in the long run, as they can afford to subsidise music streaming with income from other corners of their vast empires. Apple Music had 20 million subscribers at the end of last year, according to Morgan Stanley. Building a sustainable streaming business model will be difficult for Spotify, SoundCloud and other independents. For the likes of Apple and Amazon, it would just be another string to their bow.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings (ZCCM-IH) and Sinoconst will raise financing for the project from local and international financial institutions, Lungu said. Zambia's is Africa's No.2 copper producer and the industrial metal is the main foreign exchange earner and a key employer. But the southern African nation has been trying to diversify away from mining to insulate itself from commodity price shocks by investing in other areas including agriculture. Lungu said the plant - to be built in Ndola in Zambia's copperbelt, about 400 km north of Lusaka - would be completed in three years and create roughly 1,000 jobs at construction stage.  The copperbelt being a largely mining province and with the cyclical nature of this industry that has affected job security, I believe this project could not have come at a better time,  he said. The plant will have a daily output of 5,000 tonnes of cement and will also have two 20 megawatt (MW) coal fired power plants to provide electricity to the facility, Lungu said.

One of the most highly anticipated M&A; deals of the year, BAT is potentially eyeing a jumbo multi-currency offering for launch at the end of July, according to a banker familiar with the matter.  BAT is readying docs. It has shareholder meetings and earnings at the end of July and then it has a window, and they are keen,  the banker said. The shareholder meeting is due to take place on July 19 and the Reynolds acquisition should close on or around July 25, the company said on its website.  It could be the biggest bond deal for the European market of all time. And even though they will issue a lot in US dollars, they won't be leaving euro and sterling investors disappointed,  the banker said. AB InBev holds the record for the largest corporate deal in Europe, having sold a €13.25bn six-tranche transaction in March 2016. European bonds have become a hotbed for M&A; financing over the last year with a host of US blue-chip companies raising debt in jumbo multi-tranche format. Deals for AT&T;, Allergan and Verizon have demonstrated Europe's ability to compete with the US dollar market thanks to the attractive coupons they can attain. Investors have long speculated over the skew between the US dollar, sterling and euro portions of the BAT deal. The company announced earlier this year it will refinance US$20bn across two bridge facilities in the three currencies. BAT will have to weigh up the costs of issuing in euros and sterling versus US dollars, particularly because the acquisition will be paid for in the latter currency. BAT's euro and US dollar bonds trade roughly flat to each other after factoring in the basis swap, meaning it has flexibility around its funding strategy, albeit before taking into account the other costs associated with a swap. BAT's €650m 2.75% March 2025 notes are bid around 70bp over euro swaps, equivalent to US$ Libor plus 120bp, which is where its US$1.5bn 3.95% June 2025 bonds are trading. The company will also be keeping a close eye on the rates market, where both Bunds and Treasuries have sold-off sharply. Ten-year Bund yields have jumped more than 30bp over the past fortnight following hawkish comments from Mario Draghi late last month. Ten-year Treasury yields, meanwhile, have gained over 20bp during the same period. Both the ECB and FOMC meet later this month and the outcome of those meetings could yet impact the BAT deal. A spokesperson at BAT declined to comment on the timing and size of the transaction. BAT has mandated 19 banks for the bridge portion of the financing.

Everything seems to indicate that we are walking down the same path,  Goldfajn told GloboNews TV.  It looks like maybe the inflationary and disinflationary effects have canceled each other out, or that there have been no effects at all.  The central bank had been signaling since its latest policy decision in May that higher political uncertainty due to a corruption investigation into Temer could lead to a reduction in the size of rate cuts. Policymakers have slashed the benchmark Selic rate by 400 basis points since October, to 10.25 percent, and are expected to cut it further until it reaches 8.25 percent by December, according to the weekly poll.  The important thing is that we will always be monitoring (the scenario) to make sure whether we should be moving to one side or the other. We are walking in the middle for now,  Goldfajn said.

Its aggressive bond buying operations sent most Japanese government bond yields lower and weakened the yen. It also marked a reversal in the recent slow and stealth tapering of the bond buying operation central to its easy monetary policy.  The BOJ has sent a very strong signal that they are committed to the yield curve control policy and they are not coming to the global tightening party. The reward has been a lower currency,  said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB in Sydney. The BOJ's announcement followed a spike in 10-year Japanese government bond yields to 0.105 percent, its highest since early February and significantly higher than the zero percent it targets for that maturity under its yield-curve-control policy. The spike was in parallel to the steep rise in German, U.S. and other European bond yields over the past week and a half, spurred by concerns global central banks are moving toward reducing stimulus.  It had its origins in a string of hawkish messages from the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, furthered on Thursday by minutes from the European Central Bank's latest meeting showing it could be open to scrapping its bond-buying pledge.  The Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes this week suggested it may also soon begin paring back its large bond holdings in the coming months. But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda had said in March that it was possible the central bank won't increase its bond yield targets even as overseas long-term interest rates rise. Powerful Weapon To ensure it had a stronger shield in case increased buying was not enough, the BOJ employed its most powerful weapon -- of unconditional buying at specific yield -- only for a third time after it started its yield curve control policy in September. In a special market operation on Friday, the BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at a yield of 0.110 percent.  This came on top of an increase in the size of its regular auction-based purchase of five to 10-year maturities to 500 billion yen from the previous 450 billion yen. A Japanese flag flutters atop the Bank of Japan building in Tokyo, Japan June 16, 2017.Toru Hanai The BOJ showed its strong determination to keep the 10-year yield around zero percent and not to let it rise above 0.10 percent,  said Koichi Sugisaki, strategist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. Following the BOJ's operation announcement the 10-year yield fell to 0.085 percent while expectations of widening in yield differentials with other countries sent the yen down to 113.835 to the dollar, its lowest in a month and a half. The BOJ's offer of unlimited buying drew no selling because the market quickly recovered on the announcement, enabling any sellers to offload JGBs at better prices in the market, rather than to the BOJ. But Friday's increase in bond buying went against the central bank's attempts in recent months to reduce its massive debt purchases.  The BOJ has been slowing the pace of its bond buys as its holdings of JGBs have already topped 40 percent of the entire market, threatening the smooth functioning of the bond market. To avoid running out of JGBs to buy and for its stimulus policy to be sustainable, many analysts say the BOJ will need to further reduce the pace of its bond buying in future.  Former BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai told Reuters on Friday the Bank of Japan should steadily proceed with an  implicit tapering  of its bond purchases as any rise in yields would be temporary.  Shirai said the central bank may temporarily accelerate purchases of JGBs to contain rises in bond yields, but won't have to buy huge amounts to cap yields around its zero percent target. The BOJ has said it is aiming to increase its bond holdings by about 80 trillion yen a year. But in reality, the pace has been slowing substantially already to below 70 trillion yen by June. If the current pace of buying continues, the annual increase in its bond portfolio is expected to fall below 60 trillion yen this year. But Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics in Singapore, said:  We expect U.S. 10-year yields to climb further to 3.0 percent by year-end so chances are that the BOJ will have to conduct additional fixed purchase operations in coming months.  Takuji Okubo, principal and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors, thinks the impact of Friday's operation may not last long.  If the global bond market continues to sell off, there will come a time when the BOJ starts to feel it alone cannot hold off the tide any more and it could cause a nasty turbulence,  he said.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 222,000 jobs last month, data from the Labor Department showed, beating economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2 percent in June after gaining 0.1 percent in May. While the unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from a 16-year low of 4.3 percent, that was because more people were looking for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.  The topline number is quite strong. We saw positive revisions to the previous month and the average for this year is consistent with the average employment per month from last year,  said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Investors are focused on wage growth and whether spending by consumers will be strong enough to back the Fed's rate hike plans. Odds of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting stood at 50.6 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Policymakers have taken opposing views on inflation after it retreated below the central bank's 2 percent target in May, creating uncertainty over the future path of rate hikes. Adding to the jitters are bets that the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding their ultra-loose monetary policies. Shares of banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan , Citigroup and Goldman Sachs rose about 0.4 percent in premarket trading. Dow e-minis were up 42 points, or 0.2 percent, with 24,801 contracts changing hands at 8:39 a.m. ET (1239 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were up 6.25 points, or 0.26 percent, with 167,099 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 29 points, or 0.52 percent, on volume of 33,505 contracts. Oil fell more than 2 percent after data showed U.S. production rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high. Oil prices are down more than 16 percent this year, adding to low inflation concerns. U.S. stocks ended sharply lower on Thursday due to a steep fall in technology stocks and a disappointing private sector hiring report. Rising tensions in the Korean peninsula also added to the pressure. Investors will also be watching for developments from the G20 summit, which is underway in Germany, with focus on President Donald Trump's first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tesla rose 2.3 percent after the luxury electric carmaker won an Australian contract to install the world's biggest grid-scale battery.

Austria sued Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium, including Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI), in February, alleging deception and fraud linked to a near 2 billion euro ($2.3 billion) jet order in 2003. Airbus and the consortium have denied the accusations. The charges were the latest in a series of rows between Austria and the consortium, which have sparked two parliamentary inquiries and resulted in Airbus boss Tom Enders being investigated by Vienna prosecutors. The defense ministry said in a statement that Austria's 15 Eurofighter jets could be phased out from 2020. The continued use of the Eurofighter planes for 30 years - the normal life span of such jets - would cost up to 5 billion euros, largely for maintenance. Buying and operating a new fleet comprised of 15 single-seater and three twin-seater supersonic jets over the same period could be 2 billion euros cheaper than continuing its current program, the ministry added.  It is necessary to get a grip on the overflowing costs of the Eurofighter,  Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said. A source at the ministry was confident existing maintenance contracts with Airbus for the Eurofighters could be renegotiated. Doskozil said some kind of compensation for its Eurofighters was  likely  to come from the court battle. Alternatively, the aircraft or parts could be sold. Airbus and Eurofighter said in emailed statements:  it is not for us to comment  on Austrian defense procurement discussions, adding the Eurofighter  works very well for all other customers . Doskozil said the plan had nothing to do with campaigning ahead of Austrian elections in October and that he expected it to go ahead even if there was a change in government.  Talks Underway The defense ministry said it had already been in touch with other governments, air forces and aircraft producers.          It prefers a government-to-government deal that would see Vienna lease or buy aircraft from another country, rather than organizing a tender that would take longer and might jeopardize the 2020-2023 timeframe for the change of fleet. Such a government-to-government deal could involve the other country buying supersonic jets from one of its national producers whose planes have self-defense systems, radar-guided missiles and can operate at night.  The head of export and international relations at Sweden's Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), Joakim Wallin, said the FMV supplied Austria last month with pricing and technical information about 18 Saab (SAABb.ST) JAS Gripen fighter jets.  We expect to hear from them again after the summer,  Wallin told Reuters, referring to a potential deal that could see Saab sell the planes to the FMV which would sell them to Austria. He declined to give details on the price quoted. Austria has also spoken with U.S. officials about its interest in the U.S.-built F-16 fighter jet, made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the largest arms maker in the world, according to a source familiar with the matter. Lockheed is still offering the F-16 in international competitions, although production is due to end, the source said. It would take about three years to start delivering aircraft, or about two years after a contract was signed, the source added. The tranche 1 type of the Eurofighter jets which Austria uses is also in operation in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.

U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, signs of labour market strength that could keep the Federal Reserve on course for a third interest rate increase this year despite mild inflation. However, stubbornly sluggish wage growth remains a concern for investors on worries over whether spending by U.S. consumers will be strong enough to back the U.S. Federal Reserve's intention to further tighten policy. Bets that the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding ultra-loose monetary policies have roiled markets and European Central Bank minutes released on Wednesday indicate its policymakers are open to further steps. This sent German government bond yields to 18-month highs, lifted the euro and weighed on stocks. European bonds steadied on Friday though some investors see more room for yields to rise.  Unwinding QE will be a key part of the normalisation of rates policy,  said Chris Iggo, CIO Fixed Income at AXA Investment Managers.  The significant increase in government bond yields over the last week suggests that markets are starting to price this in. My guess is that it will have quite a bit further to go.  The ripple effects are being felt across asset classes.  Bond yields rule,  strategists at Morgan Stanley, led by Hans Redeker, said in a note to clients. Bond markets are increasingly affecting FX and equity markets, the strategists said, drawing parallels with moves seen in 2013 during the so-called  taper tantrum,  when Fed signals about withdrawing liquidity hit markets. MSCI's gauge of global stocks was at its lowest since late May's record highs and down 0.6 percent for the week. European shares fell 0.3 percent led lower by financials. Stock futures on Wall Street  pointed to a steady open after a tech-led swoon pulled major U.S. benchmarks sharply lower overnight. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies and hit a seven-week high against the yen after the Bank of Japan increased its government bond buying, expanding monetary policy when other central banks are moving towards tightening. The BOJ said it would purchase an unlimited amount of bonds as it sought to put a lid on domestic interest rates pushed higher by the broad sell-off in developed market bonds. In commodity markets, Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading down 1.2 percent, at $47.55 per barrel. Oil prices are down more than 16 percent this year, muddying the outlook for inflation expectations globally. Weakness in crude prices caused a drag on UK bluechips , though a slide in sterling after disappointing economic data helped the exporter-heavy index outperform the region on the day. Sterling slipped to the day's lows against the dollar, setting it up for its weakest weekly performance in a month, after industrial output data unexpectedly contracted in May, posing fresh challenges for the UK economy.  Given the soft data this week, I think a UK rate hike is increasingly becoming a 2018 story,  said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.

Austria sued Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium, including Britain's BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI), in February, alleging deception and fraud linked to a near 2 billion euro ($2.3 billion) jet order in 2003. Airbus and the consortium have denied the accusations. The charges were the latest in a series of rows between Austria and the consortium, which have sparked two parliamentary inquiries and resulted in Airbus boss Tom Enders being investigated by Vienna prosecutors. The defense ministry said in a statement that Austria's 15 Eurofighter jets could be phased out from 2020. The continued use of the Eurofighter planes for 30 years - the normal life span of such jets - would cost up to 5 billion euros, largely for maintenance. Buying and operating a new fleet comprised of 15 single-seater and three twin-seater supersonic jets over the same period could be 2 billion euros cheaper than continuing its current program, the ministry added.  It is necessary to get a grip on the overflowing costs of the Eurofighter,  Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said. A source at the ministry was confident existing maintenance contracts with Airbus for the Eurofighters could be renegotiated. Doskozil said some kind of compensation for its Eurofighters was  likely  to come from the court battle. Alternatively, the aircraft or parts could be sold. Airbus and Eurofighter said in emailed statements:  it is not for us to comment  on Austrian defense procurement discussions, adding the Eurofighter  works very well for all other customers . Doskozil said the plan had nothing to do with campaigning ahead of Austrian elections in October and that he expected it to go ahead even if there was a change in government.  Talks Underway The defense ministry said it had already been in touch with other governments, air forces and aircraft producers.          It prefers a government-to-government deal that would see Vienna lease or buy aircraft from another country, rather than organizing a tender that would take longer and might jeopardize the 2020-2023 timeframe for the change of fleet. Such a government-to-government deal could involve the other country buying supersonic jets from one of its national producers whose planes have self-defense systems, radar-guided missiles and can operate at night.  The head of export and international relations at Sweden's Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), Joakim Wallin, said the FMV supplied Austria last month with pricing and technical information about 18 Saab (SAABb.ST) JAS Gripen fighter jets.  We expect to hear from them again after the summer,  Wallin told Reuters, referring to a potential deal that could see Saab sell the planes to the FMV which would sell them to Austria. He declined to give details on the price quoted. Austria has also spoken with U.S. officials about its interest in the U.S.-built F-16 fighter jet, made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the largest arms maker in the world, according to a source familiar with the matter. Lockheed is still offering the F-16 in international competitions, although production is due to end, the source said. It would take about three years to start delivering aircraft, or about two years after a contract was signed, the source added. The tranche 1 type of the Eurofighter jets which Austria uses is also in operation in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.

The firm is suspected of masking interior decoration costs at Cho's private home as expenses associated with the construction of a new hotel between May 2013 and August 2014, police said in a statement. No suspects had been named, a police official told Reuters. A Korean Air spokesman said the airline was cooperating with police. Cho could not be reached for comment.  The firm's shares extended losses on the news to be down 2.2 percent, while Hanjinkal, the airline's largest shareholder, also fell 2.2 percent as of Friday's close.  Cho's daughter, Heather, gained international notoriety in 2014 when, as an executive of the airline, she forced a steward off one of its planes in New York because she was unhappy about the way she had been served macadamia nuts. She served nearly five months in jail in Korea for violating plane safety. The raids on Korean Air Lines are the first to target a major family-run conglomerate, or chaebol, since President Moon Jae-in came to power in May on the back of promises to reform the opaque business empires which dominate South Korea's economy.

Deliveroo's 15,000 bikers are self-employed so they do not receive rights such as the minimum wage, an arrangement the company argues gives both it and its staff flexibility. Its riders have become a familiar sight on British streets since the company started trading in 2013 and are a symbol of the burgeoning  gig economy  in which people work simultaneously for different firms without fixed contracts. Deliveroo's proposals for a change in the law to allow either additional rights for self-employed riders, or to create a new category of employment, were criticized by one of Britain's biggest unions.  It's the exploitative employment practices of companies like Deliveroo that are out of date - not the law,  the GMB union said on Friday. In Britain, the self-employed have no entitlement to employment rights beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination laws, whereas workers also receive entitlements such as annual leave, rest breaks and the minimum wage.  Like taxi app Uber [UBER.UL], Deliveroo has been criticized by unions who say it is exploiting its staff by not offering basic protections and some riders are pursuing legal action to push for workers' rights.   Current employment law prevents on-demand companies from extending some of the entitlements that are open to 'workers' without calling into question the status of its riders, who are self-employed,  the company said on Friday.  Deliveroo is calling for a change ... that would allow it to offer new benefits to its riders, for example sick pay, insurance or shares for long-standing riders,  it said.  The proposals have been submitted to a government review set up in response to public and political concern that more and more Britons do not have a stable income because they have no guarantee of how many hours they will work. Last year, a tribunal ruled two drivers at Uber should be treated as workers and paid the minimum wage and holiday pay, a decision that could drastically hit the gig economy. Uber has appealed.

Output by British factories and the construction sector unexpectedly shrank in May, on top of weak spending by consumers who are feeling the pinch from accelerating inflation since last year's vote to exit the European Union. The signs of continued weak growth came as businesses pressed British Prime Minister Theresa May and her government to negotiate a smooth Brexit in two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter investment. An employers group said on Thursday that Britain should stay in the EU's single market for a transition period. Executives from leading British companies were due to meet Brexit minister David Davis on Friday. Sterling dipped below $1.29 after Friday's data and hit its lowest level since June 28. British government bond prices rose. Analysts said the economy was now unlikely to recover much speed in the second quarter, after expanding by just 0.2 percent in the first three months of the year.  It's all building up a pattern here that says the economy is clearly losing momentum,  said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank.   It's not pointing to a particularly dynamic second quarter. Under those circumstances, the timing of the hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee pushing for a rate hike doesn't look great.  Growth in the second quarter was likely to edge up only slightly to 0.3 percent, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, a leading think tank, said. FILE PHOTO: A worker assembles metal components at the Mec Com Ltd factory near Stafford, central England December 15, 2016.Phil Noble/File PhotoThe Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output edged down by a monthly 0.2 percent, confounding forecasts for a 0.5 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists. Construction figures were also much worse than expected with output in the three months to May down 1.2 percent, the sharpest such drop since October 2015. The strength of next Wednesday's official data on wages is now likely to be critical for BoE policymakers as they mull whether to raise interest rates from their record low 0.25 percent.  Financial markets suggested there was a roughly 1-in-3 chance of a rate hike this year, down from 1-in-2 a week ago. MPCOIS=ICAP Some BoE policymakers have been pushing for the first interest rate hike in a decade. Rate-setter Michael Saunders said this week he was  reasonably confident  improving exports and investment would more or less compensate for the consumer slowdown. The manufacturing figures were hit by a 4.4 percent drop on the month in motor vehicle output, the biggest fall in over a year. Industry figures have shown a fall in new car sales. Broader industrial output fell 0.1 percent in May after a 0.2 percent rise in April. Separately on Friday, mortgage lender Halifax said house prices rose at the slowest annual pace in four years, which could erode consumer confidence. Trade data for May also looked weak. The goods trade deficit increased to 11.863 billion pounds ($15.33 billion) in May from 10.595 billion pounds in April, the ONS said, wider than all forecasts in the Reuters poll. Things looked brighter in terms of volumes of goods exported in the three months to May, which rose 3.8 percent. By comparison, import volumes rose 2.8 percent over the same period. However, business surveys have cast doubt about whether an improvement will be seen in the months ahead.

Deliveroo's 15,000 bikers are self-employed so they do not receive rights such as the minimum wage, an arrangement the company argues gives both it and its staff flexibility. Its riders have become a familiar sight on British streets since the company started trading in 2013 and are a symbol of the burgeoning  gig economy  in which people work simultaneously for different firms without fixed contracts. Deliveroo's proposals for a change in the law to allow either additional rights for self-employed riders, or to create a new category of employment, were criticized by one of Britain's biggest unions.  It's the exploitative employment practices of companies like Deliveroo that are out of date - not the law,  the GMB union said on Friday. In Britain, the self-employed have no entitlement to employment rights beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination laws, whereas workers also receive entitlements such as annual leave, rest breaks and the minimum wage.  Like taxi app Uber [UBER.UL], Deliveroo has been criticized by unions who say it is exploiting its staff by not offering basic protections and some riders are pursuing legal action to push for workers' rights.   Current employment law prevents on-demand companies from extending some of the entitlements that are open to 'workers' without calling into question the status of its riders, who are self-employed,  the company said on Friday.  Deliveroo is calling for a change ... that would allow it to offer new benefits to its riders, for example sick pay, insurance or shares for long-standing riders,  it said.  The proposals have been submitted to a government review set up in response to public and political concern that more and more Britons do not have a stable income because they have no guarantee of how many hours they will work. Last year, a tribunal ruled two drivers at Uber should be treated as workers and paid the minimum wage and holiday pay, a decision that could drastically hit the gig economy. Uber has appealed.

The protests have unleashed a political crisis in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, governed for the first time by a regional party in coalition with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, which draws support from India's Hindu majority. The clashes, sparked by the killing of separatist militant Burhan Wani by security forces on July 8 last year, have recently spread to college campuses and schools.  They are drawing a new generation into a decades-old struggle for 'azaadi', or independence, for India's only Muslim-majority region, which is also claimed by neighboring Pakistan.  If I get a weapon, I am ready to join the militancy – but for the time being, the stone is our weapon,  said one 23-year-old student, who asked not to be identified.  He is one among many young men in the state's summer capital of Srinagar who find themselves fighting street battles, slinging stones at pellet gun-wielding police officers from their own communities, and even their own families.  My father is in the police, posted in Srinagar,  the protester added.  He used to tell me to join the police, but now he does not insist.

Relations between the NATO allies deteriorated sharply in March when the Dutch, on the eve of their national election, barred Turkish ministers from speaking at rallies of ethnic Turks in the Netherlands, citing security concerns. President Tayyip Erdogan, who wanted to encourage Turks living in Europe to back his plans in a referendum for increased powers, accused the Netherlands of acting like a  banana republic  and his foreign minister described the country as the  capital of fascism .  In view of the current condition of the bilateral relationship ... the cabinet finds a visit by the Turkish deputy prime minister or any other member of the Turkish government undesirable,  the Dutch cabinet said in a statement.  This decision is logical in view of the events in March,  it added. Turkey has said it plans commemoration events in several European cities that have a large ethnic Turkish diaspora and the foreign ministry in Ankara criticized the Dutch stance.  The statement... is telling in terms of this country's understanding of democracy , Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Huseyin Muftuoglu said. Military officers attempted to overthrow Erdogan and his government last July in a coup attempt that quickly collapsed. Erdogan accused European governments of being slow and insufficiently vigorous in their condemnation of the coup, in which more than 240 people were killed. Since then, Turkey has jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000, including soldiers, teachers and civil servants, over alleged links with the exiled Muslim cleric Ankara blames for the failed coup. The large-scale purges have added to the strains in Turkey's relations with Western countries, which have stepped up their criticism of Ankara's record on democracy and human rights. Turkey says the crackdown is necessary because of the gravity of the security threats facing it.

Amnesty's Idil Eser and the others face a week in detention on suspicion of terrorist group membership after being taken on Wednesday from a training workshop they were holding at a hotel on Buyukada, an island just south of Istanbul.  We are gravely concerned about all arbitrary arrests and detentions of human rights defenders in Turkey,  Elizabeth Throssell, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva.  We fear they are now at significant risk of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,  she said of the eight Turkish human rights activists and two foreign trainers – a German and a Swedish national - held this week. Nils Melzer, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture who made an official visit to Turkey last December, had  found evidence of widespread abuse, particularly during initial detention , Throssell said, adding:  So that underscores our fear there.  Turkish authorities have repeatedly denied accusations of torture while saying a firm security stance is needed in the face of dangers it faces from Kurdish militants as well as wars in neighboring Iraq and Syria. Throssell said the Ankara government seemed to have criminalized the legitimate exercise of rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression under the state of emergency imposed after an attempted coup in July 2016. The detentions, which Amnesty called a  grotesque abuse of power , came less than a month after a court ordered the arrest of the chairman of Amnesty's Turkey branch on the same charge. Over the past year, Turkey has jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with terrorist groups. There were concerns regarding their access to lawyers, Throssell said. People on hunger strike are among  nearly 150,000 people arbitrary dismissed  since the coup attempt, she said.  So we're talking big numbers here with regard to human rights defenders and to people who have been sacked.  The purge has alarmed Turkey's Western allies and rights groups, who say the government has used the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. Ankara has said the security measures are needed because of the gravity of the threats confronting Turkey.

Finance Minister Stephen Dhieu Dau presented a 46.5 billion South Sudan Pound (SSP) ($300 million) budget for 2017-2018 to ambassadors on Thursday, ahead of a presentation to parliament this month.  The budget is expected to exceed available resources by SSP 16.8 billion ... to be provided by donor countries,  Dhieu said. The financial year ends on July 31. South Sudan is riven by civil war and ore than a quarter of its 12 million population have fled their homes. Civil servants and soldiers go unpaid for months and hyperinflation renders the money almost worthless. South Sudan's leaders and their families have amassed great wealth during the conflict, according to a report by U.S. advocacy group The Sentry, which was co-founded by actor George Clooney. The government denied the findings. The United Nations has said ethnic cleansing in the conflict could lead to genocide, and international rights groups have documented the torture, rape and murder of civilians by soldiers or government-allied forces. The rebels have also been accused of severe rights violations. Those concerns mean Western donors are unlikely to step forward.  We will do our best to support you, but as I said, we are constrained by the ongoing conflict,  said U.S. Ambassador Mary Catherine Phee, according to audio of the presentation. Dau said the government wanted to avoid borrowing from the Central Bank to halt the plunge of the pound, which has declined in value to around 155 to the dollar. In 2011, when South Sudan became independent from Sudan, the exchange rate was just below 3 SSP to the dollar. South Sudan's oil production has been crippled and the young country must pay hefty fees to Sudan to use its infrastructure for export. Production will fall to around 110,000 barrels per day this year, Dau said, down from 130,000. But the price is predicted to be around $45 per barrel, up from $30. Dau said oil revenues are projected to increase to SSP 127.2 billion in 2017-2018. But only SSP 25.5 billion will remain after South Sudan pays Sudan and disburses subsidies to the national oil company, Nilepet. Non-oil revenue has increased, but the fall of the pound has devalued it in dollar terms, Dau said. Donors already pay for almost all health and education expenditure in South Sudan. Japanese Ambassador Kiya Masahiko said they wanted to see more accountability and good financial management.  Public finance management: if you do it, we can support you. If you don’t do it, no one can support you,  Masahiko said. (Editing by Robin Pomeroy)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/southsudan-budget-idUSL4N1JY3M6"},

Some shale producers claim they can drill wells profitably at prices well below $50 per barrel and in some cases below $40. But Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, a major producer in North Dakota and Oklahoma, has said oil prices need to be above $50 to be sustainable. Prices below $40 would force producers to idle rigs again, he said in a recent interview (“Harold Hamm warns oil prices below $40 will idle U.S. drilling”, CNBC, June 28). The renewed drop in oil prices, unless quickly reversed, looks set to put these conflicting claims to the test.  Fifteen independent producers with operations focused on the United States reported a combined net loss of $3.7 billion in the first three months of 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2uxKwbb). But most of the losses were attributable to Marathon Oil, which reported a net loss of $4.9 billion, mostly as a result of an impairment charge linked to its Canadian oil sands businesses. The other fourteen companies in the sample reported total net income of almost $1.3 billion, up from a loss of $9.9 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Ten companies in the sample reported positive net income during the first quarter, up from just two in the previous quarter and none in the first quarter of 2016. Financial performance for the companies in the sample has been steadily improving since losses peaked at $23 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Shale producers have benefited from a combination of cost reductions, improvements in drilling efficiency and well productivity, and a significant increase in oil and gas prices. The average price of WTI, the domestic benchmark, rose from $33 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 to $52 in the first quarter of 2017. The average price of gas delivered to Henry Hub rose from just $2 per million British thermal units to $3.07 over the same period. But benchmark oil prices fell by 7 percent in the second quarter, though gas prices were up 2 percent. Both oil and gas prices have slid so far in the third quarter. Given the precarious profitability of oil producers in the first quarter when oil prices were above $50, the slide in WTI during the second and third quarters will renew the pressure on drilling firms. Unless there are further exceptional write-downs, the sample group may be able to increase their net income in the second quarter despite the fall in prices. Many, though not all, shale producers have hedged the price of their output for the remainder of 2017 which gives them some protection in the short-term against the downturn. But very little production has been hedged so far for 2018. The current calendar strip means hedging is only possible for 2018 at a WTI price of around $47 - and many shale producers will actually receive less.

Top of the vacancy list at France's DGSE, the equivalent of  America's CIA or Britain's MI6, are posts for young information technology gurus and linguists who master the finer points of Russian, Chinese or Farsi, widely used in Iran and Afghanistan. While publicity is not usually a priority of the foreign spy service (the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure, or DGSE), its head of administration said recruitment pressures are changing things.  All kinds of telecoms and IT profiles interest us, from crypto-mathematicians to super geeks,  Charles Moreau, head of DGSE administration, told Reuters during an interview at the agency's northeastern Paris headquarters - nicknamed  La Piscine  (The Pool). The DGSE hiring target is 500-600 recruits a year to bring its numbers up to 7,100 by 2019, but the skills required are not those of amphibious frogmen or secret agents of the kind incarnated by the fictional British character James Bond. Today the foreign spy service is recruiting in an increasingly open and competitive marketplace where it has to vie with big industrial groups, start-ups and other top-end recruiters to attract high-fliers, says Moreau, whose remit covers oversight of hiring. Ironically, the focus on young communications and technology wizards, the super geeks Moreau spoke of, is not totally new. When militants flew planes into the New York World Trade Centre in 2001, prompting the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in pursuit of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, U.S. intelligence services stood accused of having expanded internet surveillance at the expense of old-fashioned feet-on-the-ground spies. Recent cyber attacks that disrupted business operations and hospital services in many countries across the world have, however, increased fears that assailants motivated by money or ideology could cripple even more strategic targets such as power and water networks. Finding new-era intelligence services personnel is not the  behind-the-scenes affair it used to be but one where recruiters  scout for talent just like the rest, said Moreau.  We can no longer sit on our hands and wait for them to come to us, it's an intensely competitive marketplace,  he said. One difficulty was finding language experts, notably with mastery of Russian and Chinese, the languages of two countries whose increasingly central role has shaken up an old world order dominated by U.S. military might. Beyond that, France's military intervention abroad, against the Islamic State militant group in the Middle East and also in northern Mali, requires niche language skills.  It wasn't easy with Arabic and Farsi but it's another ball game with dialects like Tamachek (spoken by the Tuareg tribe in Mali and other parts of Africa),  said Moreau.

A quiet summer market has however resulted in a significant spread between what buyers are offering and what sellers demand, they added.  It's been a bad week, and next week we believe prices might drop further to average 57-58 crowns,  said an exporter who declined to be named.  We have been buying smaller fish, of 2-3 kilos, for around 45-46 crowns per kilo, 3-4 kilo fish at 55 crowns, while bigger fish sizes are more expensive,  the exporter added. A salmon producer also expected a drop, but not by as much.  Prices are down, to between 60-63-64 crowns. The market is quiet due to summer holidays, while the volume is not very high,  the producer said. Prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January before dropping to 50 crowns, but have since rallied before easing again. Norway is the world's top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish. Production costs are at around 32-33 crowns per kilo. Supply constraints are expected to support prices in the first half of 2017 before an expected increase in volumes later in the year. Leading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon.

(Reuters) - Two lanes apart at a noisy, fast-paced auto auction near Detroit, two vehicles show why major U.S. automakers have a problem with used cars. In one lane of the Manheim auction facility, a black 2015 Chevy Malibu sedan with barely 20,000 miles on it sold for just over $13,000, less than half its original sticker price. In the other lane, a white 2013 Chevy Silverado pick-up truck sold for $11,500 - despite having 200,000 miles on the odometer. America's renewed lust for new SUVs and trucks instead of smaller cars is already hurting major auto companies, which posted their fourth consecutive month of declining new vehicle sales.  But millions cars that were leased two or three years ago, many of them used compact and midsized cars with low mileage, are heading toward auction lots and used car dealerships.  (For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2pe1E2x) That surge in supply threatens to depress prices for new and used vehicles, raising the risk of losses for automakers and finance companies on lease deals. It also undercuts the value of cars customers want to trade in for a new vehicle.  So major carmakers, including General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), are aligning with auto auction houses with aggressive moves to make sure they are getting the best prices for their vehicles. Such maneuvers include transporting the automobiles to where the greater demand is based on real-time pricing data, spending more to spruce up used cars and slowing the pace which leased cars get moved to used car lots or auction houses. Auto auction houses such as Manheim in southeastern Michigan are where the romance of new car marketing goes to die. The dominant player in the U.S. auction market along with rival KAR Auction Services Inc (KAR.N), Manheim treats vehicles like commodities, grading them on a fine-tuned scale from one (poor) to five (excellent) that provides dealers with certainty and transparency.   If a dealer sees a 2015 Ford Fusion with a rating of 4.3, they know what to pay for it and what they can sell it for,  said Matt Trapp, a Manheim vice president on a tour of the auction, scanning tags on vehicles with his smartphone to pull up a multitude of transactions for that make, model, year, condition and mileage.   If you don't want to overbid on this one, wait a minute and another will be right along,  he said. Increasingly, the auction houses and automakers are collaborating to try to raise the scores, and the prices, of vehicles running through auctions. Auction houses have offered add-on reconditioning services on used vehicles for decades, but after the lean years following the Great Recession, demand is rising for those higher-margin services.      Manheim's chief economist Jonathan Smoke says  we can help determine the optimal way to sell their vehicle, which includes location, timing,  the level of reconditioning and whether to opt for a physical auction or online auction. Online auctions account for 30 percent of sales at Manheim versus 10 percent three years ago, he added. $2,700 Separates Memphis and Miami Armed with detailed, real-time pricing data that was not available during the last downturn, auctioneers can now help automakers figure out where a used car could fetch the best price.  Manheim has an expanded logistics arm that can aggregate cars for transport to the place they'll fetch the highest price at auction, or arrange their sale before they even move.  Jason Ferreri, KAR's executive vice president of online services, said this is happening  significantly more often.  Potential buyers inspect used vehicles being sold during a dealer-only auction at Manheim Detroit auction house in Carleton, Michigan, U.S., June 29, 2017.Rebecca CookNeither he nor Manheim officials would give specifics. In April, KAR agreed to buy DRIVIN, a data aggregator that matches vehicle inventory to dealer demand, whose founders include Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, the co-founders of Groupon Inc (GRPN.O), for $43 million in stock. Ferreri said the deal was in response to automakers' demands for greater data services amid the influx of off-lease vehicles. This real-time pricing data helps the companies steer the used cars toward higher demand.   For example, the national price for a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu with average mileage the week of June 11 was $15,514, according to data compiled for Reuters by car-shopping website CarGurus. In Memphis, that Malibu cost nearly 9 percent above the national average fair price, but in Miami it would sell for more than 9 percent below that price, representing a difference of $2,700. Manheim's Matt Trapp, whose territory includes the U.S. northeast, says around 40 percent of vehicles coming off leases are returned to dealers within around five hours' drive of New York City. Many are now being shipped to other regions.  In New Jersey, for instance, one in three off-lease vehicles now leaves the state, Trapp says. Slideshow (10 Images) I am not seeing a glut of used cars hitting the market,  said Mike Gentry, who buys cars for 20 dealerships in northwest Ohio and attended the Manheim auction outside Detroit.  Automakers have set a floor for pricing and when they can't get that price they ship them 500 miles to where they can get a better price.  More Pricing Tools in the Garage GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company is relying on  a lot more tools  including certified pre-owned vehicles  to support resale values.  A Ford spokesman said the company has adopted a  disciplined approach  to maintaining used car values. Those tools include slowing the flow of vehicles to the used market, which they can afford in the short term as their balance sheets are strong.  With off-lease vehicles we are not seeing all of them coming to market, some of them are being held back,  National Automobile Dealers Association chief economist Steven Szakaly told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. Automakers also allow their franchised dealers to take first pick of vehicles just coming off a lease before they go to auction. These are usually sold as  certified pre-owned  cars that come with a factory warranty, and a higher price tag than a run-of-the-mill used car. For vehicles that have suffered wear and tear, auction houses are now preparing for what Manheim's Mandy Savage calls a  tsunami  that will hit the market in the coming years. At Manheim's body shop here in Carleton, Savage, the facility's general manager, says 90 percent of the vehicles being painted or undergoing small fixes are cars that have just come off lease. Automakers are increasingly willing to spend $500 to boost a car's resale value by $750, she said.  This is not an art,  she said.  It's a science.  But Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners, said propping up used car values makes sense, but automakers will have to do more to stem the flow of used cars longer-term by trimming inventory levels.  I expect to see more production cuts,  he said. Reporting By Nick Carey; Editing by Joe White and Edward Tobin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-auction-idUSKBN19S1NA"},

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu had been asked to interpret a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court that revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning people from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent extremist attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Watson said in Thursday's ruling he  declines to usurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court to interpret its own order.  Hawaii said late on Thursday it would appeal against Watson's ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, according to a court filing. The Justice Department said in a statement it was pleased with the ruling.  We are confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will again vindicate the president and his constitutional duty to protect the national security of the United States,  it said. The government said after last month's Supreme Court ruling that a  bona fide relationship  meant close family members only, such as parents, spouses, fiancés, siblings and children. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would still be banned. The state of Hawaii asked Watson last week to clarify the Supreme Court's ruling, arguing the government's definition of  bona fide relationship  was too narrow. Justice Department lawyers said its definition  hews closely  to language found in U.S. immigration law, while Hawaii's attorney general's office said other parts of immigration law included grandparents as close family. The government reversed its position on fiancés before the ban went into effect last week, saying they could also qualify for exceptions. The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week compared to January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-ruling-idUSL1N1JY0DT"},

The dense, urban environment allows them to disperse and hide easily, and the city is full symbols of the wealth they detest - from the gleaming 800 million euro ($913 million)Elbphilharmonie concert hall to the shipyards that build luxury yachts. As the July 7-8 summit started on Friday, Black Bloc anarchists and other anti-capitalist protesters sat in groups on main intersections, blocking streets and bridges leading to the summit venue as well as a road used by trucks at Hamburg Port. On Thursday night, they hurled beer bottles, blocked roads using trash bins and set cars on fire. A Black Bloc activist who gave her name as Noura blamed police intransigence for the violence.  The police represent a government that says it is open and tolerant,  said the 27-year-old, who came from the western town of Krefeld and was trying to talk male friends out of hurling beer bottles at riot police.  We just want them to listen to us and take our ideas seriously,  she said.  How do they want these young people not to be angry when they dismiss them all as a bunch of violent thugs?  The Black Bloc movement, which gained prominence in the 1980s with violent protests against nuclear power and squatter evacuations, wants to end capitalism and replace it with a libertarian system void of state power and money. German police stand guard during a demonstration at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 7, 2017.Fabrizio BenschHamburg locals watched the violence unfold from their balconies on Thursday night, as police officers in full riot gear chased groups of mostly teenage Black Bloc activists who splintered when they saw the police approach, hiding in alleys on a hill on the northern bank of the Elbe River. The militants' youthful agility helps them evade arrest by policemen hampered by heavy anti-riot armor and age. Only 29 activists have been arrested so far and more than 100 policemen have been injured. Outside an underground station near the summit venue, riot police officers readying for an advancing group of protesters told a German woman driving a large black Audi with two children to speed away, as her luxury vehicle could be a target. Several Black Bloc youth responded with  Get lost!  when approached by journalists, fearing that reporters wearing helmets were undercover police. Their actions have led Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble to cancel a discussion with pupils at a school in the city and police have used water cannon to clear roads that G20 officials will use to reach the summit venue. Many locals are angry that Hamburg is hosting the summit, concerned it will cost millions to clean up the city.  We feel helpless,  said Rebecca Schmuck, 28, standing with friends on a slope overlooking the fish market where police stopped the main protest on Thursday after Black Bloc activists refused orders to remove their masks as required by German law during public demonstrations.  I am against violence but I do understand the Black Bloc,  said Schmuck.  Police should have ignored the few of them wearing masks and maybe no violence would have happened.

The number of venues for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer Londoners has fallen to 53 from 125, a loss of nearly 60 percent since 2006, according to an audit by the Urban Laboratory at University College London. London's mayor, Sadiq Khan said urgent action needed to be taken in light of the  shocking  statistics, as the British capital prepares to celebrate Pride weekend.  I want London's LGBT+ community to feel truly valued, happy and safe in our great city and know how important these spaces are to its wellbeing,  said Khan in a statement. Many LGBT pubs and nightclubs are thriving businesses but rent hikes from landlords and construction for London housing and public transport projects have forced many to close their doors, the report said. Some of the city's iconic gay bars, such as the Black Cap pub in north London and the Joiners Arms to the east, have closed down as part of plans to redevelop them. Ben Campkin, senior lecturer in architecture at UCL, said LGBT spaces remain vital, despite social media making it easier for LGBT people to communicate.  The ... evidence we have collated disputes unsubstantiated but often repeated claims that LGBTQ+ spaces are no longer needed, or have been replaced by digital apps, which tend only to serve small sections of these communities,  said Campkin.  Where they have survived, LGBTQ+ spaces are extremely valuable... and the consequences of closures are acutely felt.  Petitions and protests at the closure of historic central London venues have drawn support from hundreds of patrons, but they have limited power to resist large property owners and off-shore investors leading redevelopment projects, the report said. Campkin recommends London's boroughs should recognise the importance of LGBT venues in their local plans and conduct assessments when developments threaten gay bars, nightclubs or music venues. Amy Lamé, a comedian and performer at LGBT clubs in London who was recently appointed the 'Mayor's Night Czar' will mediate between the owners of venues and developers, Khan said.

Back in May funds were beating a collective retreat from the London zinc market after a second failed attempt at the big-number $3,000-per tonne resistance level. The London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month price troughed at $2,427.50 on June 7, since when it has bounced back to a current $2,783.00.  Funds have returned with a vengeance, according to LME broker Marex Spectron, which estimates they have gone from net short at the start of June to net long. Indeed at over 20 percent of open interest speculative length is back to levels last seen in January.  What's caused this sharp shift in positioning?  The short answer is LME stocks. While the headline number continues to tick lower, now down by 146,600, or 34 percent, on the start of the year,  live  on-warrant tonnage has slumped to levels not seen since 2007.  There were 109,100 tonnes of net new cancellations over the course of June, leaving on-warrant inventory standing at a depleted 70,350 tonnes.  LME time-spreads have tightened accordingly, the benchmark cash-to-three-months period trading close to level after being in relatively comfortable $19-per tonne contango just a month ago.  Disappearing visible inventory has rekindled zinc's stop-start bull narrative of supply shortfall.  Fooled Again?  LME inventory levels have been a false friend for zinc's many bull admirers in recent times.  Stocks have for years now been highly concentrated in New Orleans, a location that has seen mass movement between on- and off-market storage driven not by physical market but by financing drivers.  The most recent manifestation was the appearance of 22,100 tonnes of zinc in LME sheds in New Orleans at the start of May.  Since then, however, total inflow into the LME storage system has amounted to just 125 tonnes and that at Port Klang in Malaysia.  There are still grounds for caution, particularly in the form of the large short position sitting on the LME's July prime prompt date (July 19).  Representing between 30 and 40 percent of open interest <0#LME-FBR>, will it be closed out, rolled or physically delivered?  We won't have to wait long to find out, but countering the potential for more smoke and mirrors is a real tightening in the zinc supply chain in the North American market Although it's dropped out of the headlines, the strike at the CEZ refinery in Canada, North America's second-largest producer of refined zinc, is rumbling on into its fifth month.  CEZ is majority owned by the Noranda Income Fund (NIF_u.TO) but is in essence a tolling plant for Swiss powerhouse Glencore and members of Canada's United Steelworkers union were making their views heard at Glencore's annual meeting on May 24.  Noranda Income Fund has been tight-lipped about the impact. Its last official comment in March, one month into the strike, was that it was maintaining production at 50-60 percent of 275,000-tonne per year capacity.  First-quarter production, only partly reflecting the impact of the Feb. 12 walk-out, slid to just over 50,000 tonnes from 73,000 tonnes in the previous quarter.  Second-quarter results are now pending but the ongoing loss of units is somewhere in the mix at New Orleans, which holds the only LME-registered zinc stocks in the United States.   Shanghai Stocks Slump There's more in the mix as well.  Everyone's watching China. As the world's largest processor of mined concentrates into refined zinc, the country is on the front-line of the tightening in the raw materials segment of the supply chain.  The collective betting is that it is only a matter of time before China's import demand heats up as domestic production fails to keep pace with demand.  That hasn't happened yet.  Refined zinc imports are running at subdued levels. Despite an acceleration in April and May, the cumulative year-to-date tally is 138,700 tonnes, down 46 percent on last year's levels and 2016 wasn't a bumper import year either.  That said, there are signs of stress in China's zinc market.  Stocks held in Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) warehouses have, like the LME, been rapidly depleted since the start of the year.  Despite a small week-on-week bounce to 66,947 tonnes, the headline figure has fallen by 85,877 tonnes since January. The last time ShFE stocks were this low was all the way back in 2009, when the Shanghai zinc contract was still in its infancy. National refined metal production was down by almost 10 percent in May with several large operators taking maintenance downtime.  Zinc concentrate imports have surprised on the upside with inbound flows up 25 percent so far this year.  That partly reflects strong imports from Peru (up 40 percent) but also higher imports from second-tier suppliers such as Russia (up 218 percent), Myanmar (up 149 percent) and Iran (up 55 percent).  The overall impression is of a smelter sector that is actively thrifting and simultaneously trying to tap new sources of supply.  Hoarding physical metal in anticipation of stronger Chinese zinc import demand is the other dimension of the LME stocks picture.  Pendulum Swings The zinc pendulum has swung from poor technicals to constructive fundamentals over the space of the last month and the funds are responding by getting back in on the long side.  There is still a lot of uncertainty out there as to the real state of play in the physical market and LME stock levels are only one component of the puzzle and an historically unreliable one at that.  But at current levels the London zinc market is starting to look like an increasingly tight space, particularly for short-position holders.  But there is one in particular, that one sitting on the July date, that merits attention. Its actions will determine the next swing of the funds-fundamentals pendulum.

In a letter to Draghi that was published on Friday, European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly said the meetings of the Group of Thirty, where central bankers, economists and financiers talk behind closed doors, are  not transparent  and questioned the ECB president's membership of the club.  Where ECB members attend meetings organized by the Group of 30, they must abide by Treaty transparency requirements,  O'Reilly said in the letter.  However, Group of 30 meetings are not transparent.  O'Reilly, who watches for ethics lapses at European institutions and can make non-binding recommendations, asked the ECB whether it would consider publishing agendas and summaries of those meetings. Draghi has until September to reply to the letter in writing.  The new inquiry was triggered by a complaint by activist group Corporate Europe Observatory, which says proximity between ECB officials and the G30 is incompatible with Frankfurt's role as the euro zone's top banking watchdog, taken up in 2014.     The G30 includes the chairmen of several commercial banks, such as JPMorgan's Jacob A. Frenkel and UBS's Axel Weber. Both firms have units in the euro zone that are directly supervised by the ECB.     A similar complaint was rejected by the Ombudsman of the time in 2012. But O'Reilly decided the ECB's new supervisory duties warranted a fresh enquiry.  A spokesman for the ECB said:  We are cooperating with the Ombudsman, as we did with the previous inquiry.   The group in question here is very diverse ... (and) we see it as a relevant forum to engage with, always remembering that we have a range of rules and instruments in place to avoid apparent or potential conflicts of interest,  he added In the letter, Ombudsman O'Reilly asked why Draghi's membership in the G30 was in the public interest and whether it could really be considered personal given that he was replaced by his deputy, Vitor Constancio, in one occasion.  It may be argued, therefore, that the ECB’s involvement in the Group of 30 is rather of an institutional nature,  the Ombudsman said in the letter, dated July 4th. She also questioned whether the ECB found it appropriate that the chair of its own ethics committee, Jean-Claude Trichet, who may be called to assess the bank's role in the Group of 30, was also the honorary chairman of the same group. Ties between the ECB and financial sector firms have been in the spotlight since 2015, when Executive Board member Benoit Coeure discussed the bank's money-printing plans at a private event with hedge funds. This led to Ombudsman O'Reilly appealing to Draghi to scrap such meetings ahead of setting policy - a recommendation that the ECB adopted. Draghi has been a member of the G30 since 2006, when he was still the governor of the Bank of Italy. He sits alongside Bank of England governor Mark Carney and the Bank of Japan's Haruhiko Kuroda, as well as Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman. ECB vice president Vitor Constancio and Sabine Lautenschlaeger, who represents the ECB's supervisory arm on the board, have also spoken at G30 meetings. Their speeches were published on the ECB's website. ECB senior supervisor Julie Dickson contributed to a G30 paper on banking conduct, albeit only as an external observer.

China's economic achievement in the first half was  hard won , Li told a meeting.  We should firm our confidence, but also prepare to cope with challenges,  he was quoted as saying. China will maintain proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy and keep macro-economic policies stable, Li said. The government would appropriately expand aggregate demand and expand effective investment, especially private investment, he added. Li told the World Economic Forum in June that China was capable of achieving its full-year growth target and controlling systemic risks despite challenges. The government aims for economic growth of around 6.5 percent this year. The economy grew 6.9 percent in the first quarter. A raft of data in coming weeks is expected to show steady growth in the world's second-biggest economy, but government measures to rein in the housing market and debt risks are likely to drag on activity over the next few quarters.

(Reuters) - Two lanes apart at a noisy, fast-paced auto auction near Detroit, two vehicles show why major U.S. automakers have a problem with used cars. In one lane of the Manheim auction facility, a black 2015 Chevy Malibu sedan with barely 20,000 miles on it sold for just over $13,000, less than half its original sticker price. In the other lane, a white 2013 Chevy Silverado pick-up truck sold for $11,500 - despite having 200,000 miles on the odometer. America's renewed lust for new SUVs and trucks instead of smaller cars is already hurting major auto companies, which posted their fourth consecutive month of declining new vehicle sales.  But millions cars that were leased two or three years ago, many of them used compact and midsized cars with low mileage, are heading toward auction lots and used car dealerships.  (For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2pe1E2x) That surge in supply threatens to depress prices for new and used vehicles, raising the risk of losses for automakers and finance companies on lease deals. It also undercuts the value of cars customers want to trade in for a new vehicle.  So major carmakers, including General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), are aligning with auto auction houses with aggressive moves to make sure they are getting the best prices for their vehicles. Such maneuvers include transporting the automobiles to where the greater demand is based on real-time pricing data, spending more to spruce up used cars and slowing the pace which leased cars get moved to used car lots or auction houses. Auto auction houses such as Manheim in southeastern Michigan are where the romance of new car marketing goes to die. The dominant player in the U.S. auction market along with rival KAR Auction Services Inc (KAR.N), Manheim treats vehicles like commodities, grading them on a fine-tuned scale from one (poor) to five (excellent) that provides dealers with certainty and transparency.   If a dealer sees a 2015 Ford Fusion with a rating of 4.3, they know what to pay for it and what they can sell it for,  said Matt Trapp, a Manheim vice president on a tour of the auction, scanning tags on vehicles with his smartphone to pull up a multitude of transactions for that make, model, year, condition and mileage.   If you don't want to overbid on this one, wait a minute and another will be right along,  he said. Increasingly, the auction houses and automakers are collaborating to try to raise the scores, and the prices, of vehicles running through auctions. Auction houses have offered add-on reconditioning services on used vehicles for decades, but after the lean years following the Great Recession, demand is rising for those higher-margin services.      Manheim's chief economist Jonathan Smoke says  we can help determine the optimal way to sell their vehicle, which includes location, timing,  the level of reconditioning and whether to opt for a physical auction or online auction. Online auctions account for 30 percent of sales at Manheim versus 10 percent three years ago, he added. $2,700 Separates Memphis and Miami Armed with detailed, real-time pricing data that was not available during the last downturn, auctioneers can now help automakers figure out where a used car could fetch the best price.  Manheim has an expanded logistics arm that can aggregate cars for transport to the place they'll fetch the highest price at auction, or arrange their sale before they even move.  Jason Ferreri, KAR's executive vice president of online services, said this is happening  significantly more often.  Potential buyers inspect used vehicles being sold during a dealer-only auction at Manheim Detroit auction house in Carleton, Michigan, U.S., June 29, 2017.Rebecca CookNeither he nor Manheim officials would give specifics. In April, KAR agreed to buy DRIVIN, a data aggregator that matches vehicle inventory to dealer demand, whose founders include Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, the co-founders of Groupon Inc (GRPN.O), for $43 million in stock. Ferreri said the deal was in response to automakers' demands for greater data services amid the influx of off-lease vehicles. This real-time pricing data helps the companies steer the used cars toward higher demand.   For example, the national price for a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu with average mileage the week of June 11 was $15,514, according to data compiled for Reuters by car-shopping website CarGurus. In Memphis, that Malibu cost nearly 9 percent above the national average fair price, but in Miami it would sell for more than 9 percent below that price, representing a difference of $2,700. Manheim's Matt Trapp, whose territory includes the U.S. northeast, says around 40 percent of vehicles coming off leases are returned to dealers within around five hours' drive of New York City. Many are now being shipped to other regions.  In New Jersey, for instance, one in three off-lease vehicles now leaves the state, Trapp says. Slideshow (10 Images) I am not seeing a glut of used cars hitting the market,  said Mike Gentry, who buys cars for 20 dealerships in northwest Ohio and attended the Manheim auction outside Detroit.  Automakers have set a floor for pricing and when they can't get that price they ship them 500 miles to where they can get a better price.  More Pricing Tools in the Garage GM spokesman Jim Cain said the company is relying on  a lot more tools  including certified pre-owned vehicles  to support resale values.  A Ford spokesman said the company has adopted a  disciplined approach  to maintaining used car values. Those tools include slowing the flow of vehicles to the used market, which they can afford in the short term as their balance sheets are strong.  With off-lease vehicles we are not seeing all of them coming to market, some of them are being held back,  National Automobile Dealers Association chief economist Steven Szakaly told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. Automakers also allow their franchised dealers to take first pick of vehicles just coming off a lease before they go to auction. These are usually sold as  certified pre-owned  cars that come with a factory warranty, and a higher price tag than a run-of-the-mill used car. For vehicles that have suffered wear and tear, auction houses are now preparing for what Manheim's Mandy Savage calls a  tsunami  that will hit the market in the coming years. At Manheim's body shop here in Carleton, Savage, the facility's general manager, says 90 percent of the vehicles being painted or undergoing small fixes are cars that have just come off lease. Automakers are increasingly willing to spend $500 to boost a car's resale value by $750, she said.  This is not an art,  she said.  It's a science.  But Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners, said propping up used car values makes sense, but automakers will have to do more to stem the flow of used cars longer-term by trimming inventory levels.  I expect to see more production cuts,  he said. Reporting By Nick Carey; Editing by Joe White and Edward Tobin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-autos-auction-idUSL1N1JW19S"},

But despite spending three months without touching a racket, Kvitova played in the French Open and won her first tournament back on the grass in Birmingham -- leading some to tip her for a fairytale tilt at a third title at the All England Club. However, the dream came to an end on Wednesday with a second-round loss to 95th-ranked American Madison Brengle.  I am home sooner than I wanted to be, but you know what? I reached my goal, to play tennis again, to play tennis at Wimbledon and to compete in the sport I love,  Kvitova wrote on Instagram on Friday.   The last six months were difficult but now I can push restart.   She told reporters after her defeat she was hoping to get back to her traditional preparation schedule ahead of the U.S. Open, which begins in late August, to make up for the lost six months on the tour.  This is only the beginning of my new journey and I will come back stronger. See you next year, my dear Wimbledon,  she wrote, with a photo of her sending a kiss to the crowd.

Viktor Melin, 23, received the longest sentence for carrying out bomb attacks on a left-wing bookstore and an asylum center and an attempted bombing of a second asylum center. The attacks took place in November and January. Nobody was killed but one man was seriously wounded in the asylum center attack. A 50-year old man, Jimmy Jonasson, was sentenced to five years in prison for assisting in two of the attacks and a 20-year old man, Anton Thulin, got one year and six months for assisting in the attempted bombing.  All three men have a common background in the Nordic Resistance Movement and got to know each other through that organization,  Gothenburg District Court said in its verdict. The neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement is known as one of the most violent far-right groups in Sweden. In a 2009 report, Swedish security police said the organization's goal was to establish a totalitarian government through revolution.  However, the prosecutor has said there were no signs of a direct link between the group and the recent attacks. The two younger men who have been sentenced received paramilitary training in Russia prior to the attacks, the verdict stated.

The JSE, which employs around 430 staff, would also make cuts to its technology operating expenditure, it said.

Credit rating agencies Fitch and S&P; Global Ratings in April downgraded the country's debt to below investment grade after a cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma.

The flight by the B-1B Lancer bombers from Guam on Thursday came as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping prepare for a meeting on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Germany. The two leaders were expected to discuss what China can do to rein in North Korea's missile and nuclear weapon programs. North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday that some experts believe has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

With the biggest data set-piece of the month - the U.S. non-farm payrolls report - due at 1230 GMT, the dollar edged higher across the board. The data will be closely watched by traders for a steer on when they should expect U.S. interest rates to be hiked again. Markets are currently pricing in an almost 60 percent chance of another rate rise so far this year, after two so far. Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 179,000 jobs last month, above May's relatively small gain of 138,000. But BMO currency strategist Stephen Gallo, in London, said the wages and unemployment numbers would be more important for the U.S. Federal Reserve than the headline jobs figure, as they have been for a number of months.  What the Fed is leaning on to justify normalisation policy is a pick-up in nominal wage pressure,  he said.  Provided that the unemployment drop is being driven by good things – people in the labour force finding new work – that would silence the Fed naysayers for a while. It reduces the risk of a more dramatic selloff in the dollar short-term.  The dollar gained over half a percent against the yen to hit 113.84, its strongest since May 16. The BOJ said earlier on Friday it would buy an unlimited amount of bonds, as it sought to put a lid on domestic interest rates pushed higher by the broad sell-off in developed market bonds.  (T)hey’ve said they’re going to stick to their yield target and they proved today that’s what they’ll actually do,  said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.  But the market seems to be speculating increasingly that central banks will change their monetary policy to become more restrictive, and there was even some speculation that ... maybe the BOJ would also turn to this path.  Minutes from the Fed's June meeting released on Wednesday showed that some policymakers wanted to announce the beginning of the central bank's reduction of its massive debt portfolio by the end of August, but others wanted to wait until later in the year. The euro edged down 0.1 percent to $1.1409, not far from 14-month highs of $1.1445 touched last week. European Central Bank policymakers are open to a further step towards reducing their monetary stimulus but are likely to move slowly out of fear of causing market turmoil, minutes of their last meeting showed on Thursday. Faster economic recovery in the euro zone is giving the ECB room to pare its extraordinary stimulus measures, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Thursday.

The former British colony situated at the mouth of China's Pearl River Delta is one of the world's top global transit hubs for endangered species and their products, such as shark fin, pangolin skin and rosewood furniture. Customs officials on Thursday said they had seized 7,200 kg (15,873 lb) of ivory tusks, valued at around HK$72 million ($9.22 million), at a cargo warehouse beside the city's harbor. The ivory was discovered in a 40-foot container from  Malaysia declared to hold frozen fish, beneath which officers found the tusks.   The 1,000 boxes were half-empty when we found them with frozen fish put around the ivory,  said customs official Raymond Chan.  Conservation group WildAid estimated the tusks had probably been taken from about 720 elephants. Hong Kong's agriculture, fisheries and conservation department said it was investigating the shipment's final destination, probably a nearby country.  Customs and Excise Department officials (L-R), Endangered Species Protection Officer Timothy Lam, Ports Control Group Head Chan Wan-hung and Special Investigation Group Head Wan Hing-chuen, attend a news conference with seized ivory tusks in Hong Kong, China July 6, 2017.Bobby YipA special administrative region of China, Hong Kong has lagged other places, including the mainland, in adopting tighter rules against trading of ivory and other endangered species.  Regulatory loopholes allow traders to use a stockpile of legal ivory as cover to smuggle illegal ivory to unsuspecting buyers, say groups such as the World Wildlife Fund and WildAid.  China, Singapore and the United States have all banned the ivory trade, with the mainland closing down all operations by the end of this year. Slideshow (3 Images)Hong Kong, however, has only timetabled a ban by 2021. Legislators are set to discuss the issue on Friday and decide if traders should be compensated in the case of a total ban.  The teeming port city has the largest retail market for ivory, with 90 percent of consumers from the mainland. Hong Kong has been trading ivory for more than 150 years, fashioned into jewelry and sculptures, but activists say illegal poaching is pushing elephants toward extinction. The independent Environmental Investigation Agency last week identified Shuidong, a southern Chinese coastal town close to Hong Kong, as the hub for 10 to 20 Chinese-led criminal syndicates bringing in ivory from Africa.  African rangers detailed harrowing firsthand tales of elephant poaching during a June visit to Hong Kong, an event marked by a tense standoff with traders who say their business is legal.

Norway's Protector Forsikring the insurance provider for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which owns the building, also said it had been aware Grenfell Tower had been refurbished during the insurance underwriting process. It said it had considered this renovation, which was criticized by some residents, as a positive step.

Protector's previous estimate was for claims of 20 million pounds to cover the building itself, with the remainder covering additional expenses such as alternative housing for residents. It provided no breakdown of the updated figure, but it has previously said the cost would largely be covered by reinsurance through Germany's Munich Re, which declined to comment on Friday.

The work at Pennsylvania Station is due to begin Monday and run through Sept. 1, leaving the roughly 600,000 commuters who arrive there each morning from New Jersey and Long Island scrambling for alternate ways into the city. Ferry operators, bus services and even parking lots are looking to capitalize on the disruption, which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said will likely mean a  summer of hell  for those who rely on the New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) systems that will be disrupted as Amtrak undertakes $40 million in track repairs.  This is going to be a tough couple of months,  said Ronnie Hakim, interim executive director for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the LIRR, the Metro-North Railroad and New York City subways and buses. Hakim advised commuters to travel outside of peak periods if possible, spread out along platforms to avoid overcrowding and purchase tickets further ahead of time.  Consider trying to do things a little differently,  she said. One option that officials are warning commuters against is trying to drive into the already congested city, even as parking lots near the midtown transit hub urge riders in billboards and advertisements to do just that.  Anyone who works in the city understands the gridlock that characterizes downtown and midtown Manhattan during business hours. It's why they chose mass transit to begin with,  said New Jersey state Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who chairs the chamber's transportation committee. Wisniewski urged riders to consider ferries and buses as alternatives, with 97,000 cars per day already crossing from New Jersey to New York City, according to city data. The delays will take a toll on the city's economy, with Manhattan employers expected to lose an estimated $14.5 million for every hour that train commuters from New Jersey and Long Island are delayed, according to an estimate by the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit business-advocacy group. Silver Lining? Some regular train riders are trying to find silver linings to the change in routine. Among them are commuters taking New Jersey Transit up on its offer to honor some train tickets on ferries that carry travelers across the Hudson River, a journey that normally costs $9 each way.  Riding the ferry is definitely way less stressful than having to run into a tunnel and hope the train gets you there,  Tim Dedman, 43, of West Orange, New Jersey, an information technology manager who works in lower Manhattan.  The view is great. All these gleaming towers rising out of the fog.  Others are using the transit trauma to nurture a creative streak.  Who knew my disgust, Could be expressed artfully? Now get me to Penn,  wrote Joey Neri, an advertising copywriter, in a haiku posted on the Facebook group NJ Transit Riders Revolt. Neri, 30, said in an email that he moved to Edison, New Jersey, because of the direct train service to Penn Station just months before the repairs were announced. He said he had not written a haiku since high school but now so regularly posts 17-syllable poems that he has picked up the nickname  the Bard of Penn Station.  His planned Monday missive?  It is July tenth, The Summer of Hell begins, Good luck commuters.

The game has roughly 55 million daily active users and analysts estimate its monthly revenue is more than 1 billion yuan  ($147.09 million), making it the firm's top-grossing game.  It comes as Tencent announced this week it would slash the number of hours underage users can access the app, amid a wider campaign by the Chinese authorities to stamp out gaming behavior that it deems  harmful to the psychology of minors .  The new bans restrict players under 12 to one hour of game play a day and limits users under 18 years to two hours. China's People's Daily called the game  poison , alluding to a Chinese gaming term used to describe addictive games and called for the industry to be further regulated. Tencent stock has dipped by 4.2 percent since the bans were announced on Monday. The multi-player role playing game is free, but allows users to purchase items to advance more quickly in the game. The game's launch in the Europe Union and the United States marks its first attempt to bring the massively popular homegrown franchise to western markets. Tencent has previously acquired top-grossing foreign titles, including an $8.6 billion majority stake in  Clash of Clans  maker Supercell, but it is yet to export self-produced games of the same size to Western markets. A Tencent spokeswoman said it currently had no timeline for the game's expansion.  Honour of Kings is already available in markets in Asia including Taipei, Thailand and Hong Kong, as well as Turkey.

The Padres look to rebound after seeing their three-game road winning streak come to a halt when they continue their trek on Friday with the first of three contests versus the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. Cory Spangenberg went 3-for-7 with a homer and three RBIs as San Diego opened its interleague series against Cleveland with two victories before going 1-for-3 with a run scored on Thursday as the Padres fell to 14-27 on the road following an 11-2 setback.

Pivetta answered a disastrous start with a strong one on Sunday, allowing one run on as many hits over seven innings in a 7-1 rout of the Mets.

The game has roughly 55 million daily active users and analysts estimate its monthly revenue is more than 1 billion yuan  ($147.09 million), making it the firm's top-grossing game.  It comes as Tencent announced this week it would slash the number of hours underage users can access the app, amid a wider campaign by the Chinese authorities to stamp out gaming behavior that it deems  harmful to the psychology of minors .  The new bans restrict players under 12 to one hour of game play a day and limits users under 18 years to two hours. China's People's Daily called the game  poison , alluding to a Chinese gaming term used to describe addictive games and called for the industry to be further regulated. Tencent stock has dipped by 4.2 percent since the bans were announced on Monday. The multi-player role playing game is free, but allows users to purchase items to advance more quickly in the game. The game's launch in the Europe Union and the United States marks its first attempt to bring the massively popular homegrown franchise to western markets. Tencent has previously acquired top-grossing foreign titles, including an $8.6 billion majority stake in  Clash of Clans  maker Supercell, but it is yet to export self-produced games of the same size to Western markets. A Tencent spokeswoman said it currently had no timeline for the game's expansion.  Honour of Kings is already available in markets in Asia including Taipei, Thailand and Hong Kong, as well as Turkey.

We've taken the option on Carlos Sainz and he will be in a Toro Rosso next year,  Red Bull team principal Christian Horner told Sky Sports television during practice for the Austrian Grand Prix on Friday.  It makes no sense loaning him out. I don't know where he thinks he'll be.  It's a bit disingenuous saying stuff like that. Without Red Bull he wouldn't be in Formula One.  Sainz had told reporters on Thursday that he was unlikely to stay at the Red Bull-owned team for a fourth season and was open to offers. The 22-year-old, who has eclipsed Russian team mate Daniil Kvyat this season, is seen as a rising star and has been linked in media speculation to a number of other teams. His chances of moving up to Red Bull next year look non-existent, however, with the former champions having Australian Daniel Ricciardo and Dutch teenager Max Verstappen locked in.  Our plans for next year is that our cars will have the same numbers on them next year,  Horner said.  Both drivers will be with us 100 percent.  Toro Rosso, established as a feeder team for Red Bull, has a history of moving young drivers either upwards or out. Those who have graduated include four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel and their current race winners. Others have been less fortunate, their Formula One careers effectively ended after being cast out of the Red Bull fold. Kvyat is in the rare position of having been promoted and then demoted again in a swap with Verstappen, who won in Spain on his Red Bull debut last year.

The lender plans to launch a new wealth management unit in Japan at the start of the business year beginning April 2018, and targets 50 billion yen ($439.95 million) in annual operating profit within four to five years, Muneaki Tokunari told Reuters. MUFG's foray into wealth management comes as profitability at Japan's banks is pressured by negative interest rates and tepid corporate demand for cash during a period of weak economic growth. The new wealth management business will operate under the MUFG brand leveraging the expertise of U.S. bank Morgan Stanley, of which the Japanese lender is the single largest shareholder with a 23.4 percent stake, Tokunari said.  We would introduce some wealth management knowledge and expertise from Morgan Stanley, because they have successfully expanded their wealth management business (in the United States),  he said.  We have seconded many young recruits to Morgan Stanley to get some hints, to get some expertise from their wealth management business.  MUFG and Morgan Stanley already have a flourishing brokerage joint venture in Japan, stemming from a $9 billion lifeline the Japanese lender provided the Wall Street bank at the height of the financial crisis at the end of the last decade. The venture, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, was ranked second for Japanese mergers and acquisition advisory in 2016, and third for equity capital market underwriting, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tokunari said the new wealth management business would mainly target MUFG's existing small and mid-sized corporate clients, offering investment products and solutions. Private wealth rose 1.1 percent last year in Japan to $14.9 trillion, and is likely to reach $16.2 trillion by 2021, showed consultancy BCG's latest Global Wealth Market report. Of the total, 59 percent is in the form of cash and deposits representing significant opportunity for wealth managers to channel dormant funds into investments, analysts said. Tokunari also said MUFG would change the name of core banking unit Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) to MUFG Bank from April 1 to  simplify  the brand as it looks to expand overseas to offset slowing growth at home.

The first phase comprises building a paint shop that would create 400 jobs. However, it involves the purchase of land in northeast Slovenia, which has not yet been completed. State secretary at the Ministry of Economy Ales Cantarutti said on Thursday that there was a  60:40 percent chance that we will succeed  in approving the project.  We are working on a Plan B, but I cannot get into details regarding this,  Magna spokesman Rej Husetovic said on Friday.  Slovenia is still our number one priority and we hope that we will be able to move forward.  He would not comment on local media reports that Magna, which assembles vehicles under contract as well as making parts, is considering Hungary and Croatia as alternative locations if Slovenia fails to grant it planning permission in the near future. The planned new facility will serve the Canadian company's contract vehicle assembly plant in Graz, Austria. Cantarutti said on Thursday that Slovenia plans to wrap up a public debate on the environmental aspect of the Magna investment later this month and the government then hopes to be able to give the green light. In December the Slovenian parliament passed a law to speed up the purchase of land where Magna is due to build its plant, and Cantarutti said almost all land purchases have now been agreed and the last one is due to be resolved next week. $1 = 0.8756 euros Reporting By Marja Novak; Editing by Susan Fenton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/slovenia-magna-idUSL8N1JY1S5"},

Pacquiao backed the letter in his own statement on Wednesday.  I would be very grateful if the GAB can provide any evidence indicating fraud or violation of law,  WBO president Francisco Valcarcel said in his response on Thursday.  The purpose of this review is to be able to give the fans certainty of who was the winner of the bout, even though we do not have the power to reverse the decision of the judges.  Horn won the match after judges scored the bout 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 in the 29-year-old's favor. The WBO's review will have five judges re-watching the fight and providing their own scores.

The officials who participated in this fight are all professional, distinguished, honest and honorable human beings,  Valcarcel added.

The Audi employee was arrested on Monday, at the behest of Munich prosecutors, a spokeswoman for the Munich prosecutors office said on Friday. When asked if the arrest was at the request of U.S. authorities, the spokeswoman said it was not. She did not give the name of the person.   Munich prosecutors declined to comment on whether the arrested person is a current or former Audi employee. Audi and parent Volkswagen both declined to comment. On Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it charged former manager Giovanni Pamio with directing Audi employees to design software to cheat U.S. emissions tests in thousands of Audi diesel cars. Audi is a division of Volkswagen Group.      The Munich prosecutor's office said the Audi employee was brought before a judge on Tuesday and was now being held in custody.  The spokeswoman declined to discuss the possibility of the detained person being extradited to another country or comment on whether Munich prosecutors were in touch with U.S. authorities. The German arrest was part of a wider probe into fraud and false advertising and is a consequence of  findings following searches,  the spokeswoman said. In March, Munich prosecutors searched the offices of Jones Day, the lawfirm Volkswagen had hired to lead an internal investigation into its emissions scandal and Audi's headquarters. Volkswagen condemned the searches at the time, and never published the full findings of its internal investigation which was being conducted by Jones Day.  The raids by Munich prosecutors in March sought to shed light on who was involved in the designing and using illicit software used in 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche cars with bigger 3.0 litre engines. No members of the Audi management board are being personally investigated as part of that probe, the spokeswoman said on Friday. In the criminal complaint released by U.S. authorities on Thursday, U.S. prosecutors charged that Pamio ignored or suppressed warnings by certain Audi engineers that the pollution control systems being used on the brand's diesel engines violated U.S. clean air rules. U.S. prosecutors said Pamio had ordered subordinates to send false information to American regulators stating that Audi's  clean diesels  did not use technology designed to cheat federal pollution tests.  Neither Pamio nor his representatives could be reached for comment on Friday.  Reporting by Edward Taylor, Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz.

What has shifted in recent months is an acceptance that fiscal policy, touted around the turn of the year as the essential comeback kid after the shock election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, has not yet come back. Much of this is because of a lack of progress on Trump's tax cut agenda, dimming down what was called the  Trumpflation  trade in financial markets and now even calling into question a multi-year rally in the U.S. dollar.  But what this does is thrust central bankers -- who only six months ago were said to be waning in influence -- back into the spotlight. Many seasoned central bank watchers say past experience shows that until inflation really accelerates convincingly, and for a sustained period for reasons other than a rise in the price of oil, the best monetary policy is to be doing nothing.  The latest minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's policy discussions show a split over inflation, which is sure to cast unusually sharp focus on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to both houses of Congress in the coming week. Indeed, with the exception of persistent four-decade-low first-time claims for jobless benefits, U.S. economic data has been undercutting relatively modest expectations for the past several months, particularly on measures of inflation. Wage inflation across most of the developed world, widely viewed by economists as the most compelling and potent driver of sustained overall price inflation, hasn't picked up the way central bankers have predicted it would either.  The Fed, however, remains set on further interest rate rises, and is now contemplating how and when to start reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, bloated by years of mass asset purchases as stimulus once it had no interest rate left to cut.  Of course the evolution of the economic data over the next few months remains of critical importance,  notes Investec's chief economist Philip Shaw.  In particular, will the momentum of the economy be maintained and is the recent run of soft inflation idiosyncratic, as most senior Fed officials seem to believe?  FILE PHOTO: Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz (L) speaks with Bank of England governor Mark Carney as they gather for a family photo after a meeting of G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors during the IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Washington October 10, 2014.Jonathan Ernst/File PhotoWorthwhile Canadian Initiative? It's not only Yellen who might set the mood in the coming week. The Bank of Canada meets to set policy on July 12 following a run-up in the Canadian dollar, with markets leaning toward expecting the first rate rise in nearly seven years. The domestic debate is partly over whether a rate rise is now warranted in part to tamp down rampant urban housing markets -- particularly in Vancouver and Toronto -- as soaring real estate prices have pushed Canada's household debt to income ratio to near the highest in the world. Slideshow (2 Images)Like in other similar economies, Canada's consumer price inflation on its own does not point convincingly to a need for the Bank of Canada to deliver higher interest rates.   Its decision one way or the other could have an effect on markets beyond its shores as it will be seen as a proxy for policy normalization over a wider jurisdiction,  notes Shaw.  For some, discussion of  normalization  appears eerily similar to 2011, when the European Central Bank, faced with a similarly shaky-looking inflation outlook, raised interest rates in what is now regarded as a mistake, arguing higher rates would be supportive of business confidence.  A punishing sovereign debt crisis followed and a period of eye-wateringly high unemployment, ushering in an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet by well over a trillion euros and counting, along with negative interest rate policy.  For now, the ECB appears to be moving very gingerly toward unveiling how and when it will trim back its tens of billions worth of monthly bond purchases, but that date is approaching. Some of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee also now think that now is the time to raise rates -- despite the  uncertainty of Britain starting to negotiate its way out of the European Union. They are prompted by a surge in inflation caused in large part from a plunge in sterling after the Brexit vote. For now, they remain in a minority, but the possibility has supported the pound and markets have been put on notice.  But a change of mood appears to have taken place at the Bank of Japan, however, which is backing off initial attempts to signal an imminent shift away from its ultra-easy monetary policy. On Friday it launched a bond-buying bonanza, offering to snap up unlimited quantities in order to calm markets.

The lender plans to launch a new wealth management unit in Japan at the start of the business year beginning April 2018, and targets 50 billion yen ($439.95 million) in annual operating profit within four to five years, Muneaki Tokunari told Reuters. MUFG's foray into wealth management comes as profitability at Japan's banks is pressured by negative interest rates and tepid corporate demand for cash during a period of weak economic growth. The new wealth management business will operate under the MUFG brand leveraging the expertise of U.S. bank Morgan Stanley, of which the Japanese lender is the single largest shareholder with a 23.4 percent stake, Tokunari said.  We would introduce some wealth management knowledge and expertise from Morgan Stanley, because they have successfully expanded their wealth management business (in the United States),  he said.  We have seconded many young recruits to Morgan Stanley to get some hints, to get some expertise from their wealth management business.  MUFG and Morgan Stanley already have a flourishing brokerage joint venture in Japan, stemming from a $9 billion lifeline the Japanese lender provided the Wall Street bank at the height of the financial crisis at the end of the last decade. The venture, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, was ranked second for Japanese mergers and acquisition advisory in 2016, and third for equity capital market underwriting, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tokunari said the new wealth management business would mainly target MUFG's existing small and mid-sized corporate clients, offering investment products and solutions. Private wealth rose 1.1 percent last year in Japan to $14.9 trillion, and is likely to reach $16.2 trillion by 2021, showed consultancy BCG's latest Global Wealth Market report. Of the total, 59 percent is in the form of cash and deposits representing significant opportunity for wealth managers to channel dormant funds into investments, analysts said. Tokunari also said MUFG would change the name of core banking unit Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU) to MUFG Bank from April 1 to  simplify  the brand as it looks to expand overseas to offset slowing growth at home. MUFG's overseas operations currently account for 40 percent of revenue, and the executive said this could rise to 50 percent in the next five years as it looks for growth opportunities in the United States and the rest of Asia.

A prolonged heatwave across northern China, hydropower cuts in the south, a fresh crackdown on mine safety and imports curbs have triggered a weeks-long rally in the world's top buyer of the fuel. On Friday, the most-active futures prices hit 598.6 yuan ($88.04) per ton. That's up 18 percent since mid-May. In January, state economic planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a document it is comfortable with a price of 470 yuan ($69.12) to 570 yuan ($83.82 )per ton and will use measures to cool the market if it rises above 600 yuan.  But spot physical prices offered by major producers, such as Shenhua, ChinaCoal and Shandong Energy, are already at 600 yuan, sources with the three companies said driven by strong demand.   Our coal mines are almost working around the clock now,  said Wang Binghua, president of State Power Investment Corp, on the sideline of a company news conference this week. It has 81 million tonnes of annual coal capacity. It is not clear what level of intervention the government would consider. The NDRC may try to force miners to cut prices or set limits on the amount of inventory utilities and trading companies can hold to prevent them from buying extra volumes that could push prices higher or create shortages, according to four mining company executives and one power company executive. At least three of the top four mining firms, including ChinaCoal, Shenhua and Yitai, have halted spot sales to meet increasing demand from long-term contracts with clients, sources with the three companies said. The NDRC, Shenhua, ChinaCoal, Shandong Energy and Yitai did not respond to requests for comments. Major utilities buy on long-term contracts at about 570 yuan  ($83.83) per ton, although the smaller plants and traders are exposed to the cash market.     Analysts say utilities have about 20 days of inventory on hand, which is enough to see them through the busy summer months. Still, the price gains have tested Beijing's efforts to boost supplies, quell concerns about tightening availability during peak demand season and cool the red hot market. In a June 30 document, the NDRC asked miners to boost output as part of a series of steps to ensure power supplies over the summer.  Policy makers are trying to curb the rally in prices. But there is such a big demand for coal now that (Shenhua)'s spot prices has reached 600 yuan,  said a source from Shenhua.  A senior official at top utility Huaneng said a stable coal price was an increasingly important issue ahead of the Communist Party Congress this fall.  Our internal discussion with NDRC officials showed that the agency is keen on stabilizing prices and making sure utilities get enough supply during summer in preparation for the Congress meeting,  the official said.

U.S. monthly payrolls data is due on Friday and economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 179,000 jobs in June, above May's gain of 138,000. Investors are focused on wage growth and whether spending by U.S. consumers will be strong enough to back the U.S. Federal Reserve's intention to further tighten policy. Bets that the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding ultra-loose monetary policies have roiled markets and European Central Bank minutes released on Wednesday indicate its policymakers are open to further steps. This sent German government bond yields to 18-month highs, lifted the euro and weighed on stocks.  Bond yields rule,  said strategists at Morgan Stanley, led by Hans Redeker. Bond markets are having an increasing impact on FX and equity markets, the strategists said, drawing parallels with moves seen in 2013 during the so-called  taper tantrum,  when Fed signals about withdrawing liquidity hit markets. MSCI's gauge of global stocks was at its lowest since late May's record highs and down 0.6 percent for the week. European shares fell 0.3 percent led lower by financials. Stock futures on Wall Street  pointed to a steady open after a tech-led swoon pulled major U.S. benchmarks sharply lower overnight. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies and hit a seven-week high against the yen after the Bank of Japan increased its government bond buying, expanding monetary policy when other central banks are moving towards tightening. The BOJ said it would purchase an unlimited amount of bonds, as it sought to put a lid on domestic interest rates pushed higher by the broad sell-off in developed market bonds. In commodity markets, Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading down 1.2 percent, at $47.55 per barrel. Oil prices are down more than 16 percent this year, muddying the outlook for inflation expectations globally. Weakness in crude prices was drag on UK's bluechips though a slide on sterling after disappointing economic data helped the exporter-heavy index outperform the region on the day. Sterling slipped to the day's lows against the dollar, setting it up for its weakest weekly performance in a month, after industrial output data unexpectedly contracted in May, posing fresh challenges for the UK economy.  Given the soft data this week, I think a U.K. rate hike is increasingly becoming a 2018 story,  said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.

Hillhouse is targeting to raise about 8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in the fund, said one of the sources. Venture capital and private equity funds are lining up to raise funds in yuan, tapping into the appetite of investors eager to grab opportunities in domestic Chinese businesses that are typically restricted to overseas buyers and as startup founders prepare to take their companies public in local markets. Fund managers are also looking to benefit from growing sources of capital at insurance firms and other large domestic institutional investors, as well as wealthy individuals looking to boost returns in alternative assets, analysts and investors said.  It's a very sizeable pool of capital that is looking for investment opportunities and the channels to raise funds have improved,  said an investor in several China-focused funds who  was not authorized to speak publicly about the industry.  If you have enough of a local investment program, you can find opportunities to invest locally in yuan as well, so it makes sense to raise those funds.  Investment managers have raised 59.6 billion yuan in funds denominated in the Chinese currency so far in 2017, compared with 64.4 billion yuan in all of 2016, according to data provider Preqin. That would put this year on pace to be the biggest since 2012, when 145.8 billion yuan in aggregate capital was raised. Hillhouse declined to comment. The sources did not want to be named because the capital raising plans are not public. The investment firm, founded in 2005 by Zhang Lei with seed funds from Yale University's endowment, has raised yuan-denominated funds before and is among several China-focused investment managers such as Qiming Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital China that have funds in both U.S. and Chinese currencies.  But increasingly companies that previously only targeted U.S. dollar fundraising are also launching yuan funds. Lightspeed China Partners and Morningside Venture Capital closed their debut yuan funds earlier this year. And GGV Capital, an early backer of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, ride hailing firm Didi Chuxing and phone maker Xiaomi Inc, was also looking to launch its first fund in yuan.

I'm very sorry to tell you that despite the very strong commitment and engagement of all the delegations and different parties ... the conference on Cyprus was closed without an agreement being reached,  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a news conference after a stormy last session. The collapse marked a dramatic culmination to more than two years of a process that had been widely thought of as the best chance at reunification since the island was split between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations in 1974. Guterres had flown in on Thursday to press Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci to seal a deal reuniting the east Mediterranean island, while U.S. Vice President Mike Pence had phoned to urge them to  seize this historic opportunity . Diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus have failed since the island was riven in a 1974 Turkish army invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. The week of talks in the Swiss Alps, which the United Nations said was the  the best chance  for a deal, ground to a halt as the two sides failed to overcome final obstacles. Diplomats said Turkey had appeared to be offering little to Greek Cypriots wanting a full withdrawal of Turkish troops from the island, although the Greek Cypriots had indicated readiness to make concessions on Turkish Cypriot demands for a rotating presidency, the other key issue. Guterres finally called a halt at 2 a.m. after a session marred by yelling and drama, a source close to the negotiations said. Not 'End of Road'  Unfortunately... an agreement was not possible, and the conference was closed without the possibility to bring a solution to this dramatic and long-lasting problem,  Guterres said.  That doesn't mean that other initiatives cannot be developed in order to address the Cyprus problem,  he added. Guterres declined to elaborate on what exactly had caused the collapse, but said there was still a wide gap between the two delegations on a number of questions. A girl holds a placard during a demonstration in favour of a peace settlement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on divided Cyprus, at Ledra's checkpoint of the UN-patrolled  green line  in Nicosia, Cyprus July 6, 2017.Yiannis KourtoglouWithout a fallback option, it was unclear what, if any, peace process could continue. Reunification attempts have always been under the umbrella of the United Nations, which has one of its longest-serving peacekeeping forces on the island. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who with his Greek counterpart Nikos Kotzias had been attending the peace talks at the Swiss Alpine resort of Crans-Montana for a week, spoke of different options.  This outcome shows the impossibility of reaching a settlement within the parameters of the Good Offices Mission,  Cavusoglu wrote on his twitter feed, using a term referring to the UN.  No use in insisting on them.  Slideshow (4 Images)Greek Cypriots, due to launch gas drilling off the island in coming weeks that Turkey opposes, pointed the finger of blame at the Turkish side. Nicos Christodoulides, spokesman for the Greek Cypriot government, said Turkey had refused to relinquish its intervention rights on Cyprus or the presence of troops on the island.  Tonight's development is in no way positive, but it is not the end of the road either,  he said, without elaborating. Guterres, who began his role in January by announcing a  surge of diplomacy for peace , is known for his energy and drive. But he appeared tired and downcast as he announced the collapse of the talks to a handful of journalists at an impromptu news conference that lasted only three and a half minutes. Diplomats say that Cyprus should be much simpler to resolve than many other situations where the United Nations hopes for peace, such as the bloody and complex wars in Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, South Sudan, Libya, or the Korean peninsula. Yet it is a conflict which has become deeply entrenched after years of stalemate and distrust. Success in the Cyprus talks would have given Guterres a high profile at the G20 talks in Hamburg, where he is due on Friday, and where he will meet U.S. President Donald Trump, who has promised to cut the U.S. share of U.N. funding.

While no one was hurt, the jarring developments, uncharacteristic even by the rough-and-tumble tradition of Illinois politics, show how the nation’s extreme political polarity poses increasing danger for elected leaders. Minutes before the scheduled House votes on a contentious budget plan, the statehouse was shut down after a woman threw a powdery substance in the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor and in the House gallery. The powder was determined later to pose no hazard. Authorities did not identify the woman nor was it clear whether she would face criminal charges for the scare that lasted nearly two hours and delayed the votes. A Republican House member this week revealed he had received a death threat on Sunday from someone who posted on his Facebook page,  I’m coming for you.  State Representative Steven Andersson, a Republican from Chicago’s western suburbs, who relayed the threat to the Illinois State Police, said,  It’s stressful to get this level of vitriol and hatred.   The State Police did not respond to a query by Reuters on Thursday about the incident. Andersson accused a conservative think tank of spurring its followers to launch social media protests against him and other Republicans who broke ranks with Republican Governor Bruce Rauner by giving pivotal support to the Democratic budget and tax hike that went into effect. In response, the think tank, the Illinois Policy Institute, encouraged its Facebook and Twitter followers to tone down their rhetoric and disavowed anyone making threats during the heat of political battle.  I don’t think it’s OK to threaten public officials, and that behavior should be identified and called out,  said a spokesman, Eric Kohn. The events in Illinois are part of a larger national trend involving disillusioned political followers that, at its most extreme, resulted in a shooting last month at congressional Republicans as they practiced for a benefit baseball game.  The days of just being cavalier and going into an auditorium or a setting with no regard of your security or not taking any precautions of what could happen are over,  said Ken Wheatley, a former FBI agent and San Diego, California, security consultant.

The Audi employee was arrested on Monday, at the behest of Munich prosecutors, a spokeswoman for the Munich prosecutors office said on Friday. When asked if the arrest was at the request of U.S. authorities, the spokeswoman said it was not. She did not give the name of the person.   Munich prosecutors declined to comment on whether the arrested person is a current or former Audi employee. Audi and parent Volkswagen both declined to comment. On Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said it charged former manager Giovanni Pamio with directing Audi employees to design software to cheat U.S. emissions tests in thousands of Audi diesel cars. Audi is a division of Volkswagen Group.      The Munich prosecutor's office said the Audi employee was brought before a judge on Tuesday and was now being held in custody.  The spokeswoman declined to discuss the possibility of the detained person being extradited to another country or comment on whether Munich prosecutors were in touch with U.S. authorities. The German arrest was part of a wider probe into fraud and false advertising and is a consequence of  findings following searches,  the spokeswoman said. In March, Munich prosecutors searched the offices of Jones Day, the lawfirm Volkswagen had hired to lead an internal investigation into its emissions scandal and Audi's headquarters. Volkswagen condemned the searches at the time, and never published the full findings of its internal investigation which was being conducted by Jones Day.  The raids by Munich prosecutors in March sought to shed light on who was involved in the designing and using illicit software used in 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche cars with bigger 3.0 litre engines. No members of the Audi management board are being personally investigated as part of that probe, the spokeswoman said on Friday. In the criminal complaint released by U.S. authorities on Thursday, U.S. prosecutors charged that Pamio ignored or suppressed warnings by certain Audi engineers that the pollution control systems being used on the brand's diesel engines violated U.S. clean air rules. U.S. prosecutors said Pamio had ordered subordinates to send false information to American regulators stating that Audi's  clean diesels  did not use technology designed to cheat federal pollution tests.  Neither Pamio nor his representatives could be reached for comment on Friday.  Reporting by Edward Taylor, Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz.

It would be one of the first major structural changes in the country following the end of President Yahya Jammeh's more than 20-year rule in January. State-owned China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) says one of its subsidiaries has made a bid for a 140 million euro ($159.91 million) contract Gambia has launched to redevelop the port. France's Bollore Group has also submitted an offer to develop the port for hundreds of millions of dollars, sources told Reuters, and was part of a recent delegation of French investors to the country. The port was run by a state agency during Jammeh's rule. It is considered to have strategic potential thanks to its easy access to Atlantic shipping lanes. Abdoulie Tambedou, managing director of the Gambia Ports Authority said there had already been several offers.  The Chinese are interesting in investing in the infrastructure for an overall envelope of 140 million euros,  he told Reuters in an interview.  We hope to agree the financing in the next six months.  An official at CCCC confirmed that one of its subsidiaries was bidding for the contract, without specifying which. In a sign of their interest, a witness saw a Chinese delegation visiting the port last week. Tambedou confirmed Bollore's offer, without giving the price, and said this included both infrastructure costs and the rental concession. Chinese interest in the project follows Gambia's endorsement in March 2016 of the  one China  policy, which states that Taiwan is part of a unified China. President Adama Barrow's new government reaffirmed that position in February. China is also a major market for Gambia's exports, which globally are mainly peanuts, wood, cashews, fish and fruit. Upgrading the port will take 30-36 months to complete, Tambedou said. Struggling Gambia is poor. It ranks 173 out of 189 countries on the U.N. Human Development Index, below Haiti. It is badly in need of key infrastructure development. There is not a single bridge across its eponymous 1,120 km (695 mile)-long river that wiggles up the length of the country, for example. People and goods have to be shipped across on ferries - or go around. Gambia is nonetheless seen as a key transit country for reaching remote areas of Guinea, Mali and Senegal that are easier to access from Banjul than from the countries' own ports and capitals. Space constraints at the port, however, currently mean that arriving cargo ships often have to wait at anchorage before entering. Since the departure of Jammeh, Tambedou said that trade was picking up, with shippers sending imports such as sugar in bigger volumes than before.

Those people say Toshiba's leadership is sticking to Plan A: selling the world's second-largest memory chip maker to a Japanese government-backed group that also includes Bain Capital. But the clock is ticking for Toshiba, which was still recovering from a $1.3 billion accounting scandal in 2015 when it was hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns at its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse in December.  Unless it closes a deal by March, a gaping balance-sheet hole will prompt automatic delisting of its shares from Tokyo's stock market - further battering its shareholders. As questions emerge around the role of South Korean rival SK Hynix in the preferred bidder group, some Toshiba executives and officials at the company's main creditor banks say they want top management to look at other options.  Toshiba hastily picked the consortium ahead of its [June 28] annual shareholders meeting, but more and more flaws are emerging as time passes,  said a senior official at one of Toshiba's banks. SK Hynix, which was initially included just to help fund the deal, is now looking to own equity in Toshiba's chips unit, according to sources, raising antitrust and national concerns in Japan. SK Hynix has not commented. Addressing concerns that its chip technology could be handed to a foreign rival, Toshiba said previously that SK Hynix would have no equity or management influence. Scrapping that deal would leave one obvious option: rival suitor Western Digital, which bid for the chip business with private equity firm KKR. But Western Digital, already a Toshiba joint venture partner, is in a legal dispute with the Japanese firm, and sources describe a deep distrust. But Western Digital could have the support of government-backed Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) and Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ) - both currently part of the preferred buyer consortium - the sources said. They are said to be wary of SK Hynix, and of Toshiba agreeing a sale to the group while Western Digital has sought an injunction to stop it.  If asked, we are ready to team up with Western Digital and KKR, and we actually prefer that,  said a senior official at one of the government investors. Both the DBJ and INCJ declined to comment.  A Toshiba spokesman said the firm is negotiating with the preferred buyer consortium to sign a definitive agreement as soon as possible. The logo of Toshiba Corp is seen behind a traffic light at the company's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan March 29, 2017.Issei KatoSelling other assets seems a less likely avenue, as Toshiba has few of sufficient value, and a piecemeal process could take too long.  It sold its medical equipment business to Canon Inc for $6 billion last year. There are plans to list Toshiba's smart meter business Landis+Gyr, but that will not plug the gap. Toshiba turned down offers from buyout group CVC and industrial conglomerate Hitachi to buy the business for almost $2 billion earlier this year, sources have said. Toshiba cannot raise cash by issuing shares because of restrictions imposed by the bourse after the 2015 scandal. Deal or No Deal Toshiba has been scrambling for cash for months - since it shocked investors late last year with news of the cost overruns and delays at Westinghouse, which forced a hefty writedown and losses. Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March in one of the nuclear industry's most costly collapses to date, leaving Toshiba to cover $6 billion of liabilities it guaranteed. Even so, investors and some creditors say they fear Toshiba may simply refuse to consider what appears to be the most obvious option.  Some within Toshiba say they'd rather die than be (acquired by) Western Digital,  said a banking official who has discussed the deal with senior Toshiba executives. Western Digital is a recent partner for Toshiba - it bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner for 17 years, in May last year. A leap from joint venture partner to buyer would have to overcome significant distrust.     Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent a sale of Toshiba's chips arm without its consent.  We worked with SanDisk over more than 10 years, but it's been just one year that we've worked with Western Digital executives, and we've had no good experience from it,  a senior Toshiba executive said. Two people familiar with the matter said Toshiba believes that even if the court grants the injunction, it can proceed with a chip sale agreement - so long as it holds off completion.

The softer data comes on the heels of Wednesday's release of the minutes from the Fed's June meeting, which showed policymakers were increasingly split on the inflation outlook and how it might affect the pace of rate increases.          Oil prices fell more than 1 percent with U.S. crude futures dipping below $45 per barrel as news of a rise in U.S. production added to earlier reports that OPEC output was also on the rise.      Markets are mixed, bit more on the negative side. I think for now we are still in the risk-off mood. We do not really want any surprises from the U.S. Fed and this (market movement) is because of the Fed,  said Mikey Macainag, an analyst with Sunsecurities Inc.      Malaysia, one of the biggest oil and natural gas exporters in Asia, closed 0.6 percent lower as weaker crude oil prices overshadowed positive May exports data.     The index is down 0.2 percent for the week, its third straight week of losses.          Focus has now shifted to Germany where leaders from the world's top economies are preparing for tough talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on climate change and trade on Friday during a Group of 20 summit.      Traders were also wary about the upcoming G20 meeting where a clash of 'ideals' was expected given the 'egoistic' nature of President Trump and his recent frosty meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel.  NetResearch Asia said in a note.       In other Southeast Asian markets, Indonesia ended 0.6 percent lower with Unilever Indonesia Tbk dragging the index down.     Vietnam closed the session 0.8 percent lower as financial and consumer shares declined.      Vietnam drifted lower for the week, snapping four-straight weeks of gains.       Bucking the trend, Singapore shares closed the day marginally higher as DBS Group Holdings and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp gained 0.4 percent each.

Under the emergency rule imposed after the coup, Turkish authorities took control of companies suspected of having links to followers of Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Muslim cleric blamed by Ankara for the failed military takeover. The 965 companies under state management control, based in 43 provinces across Turkey, have assets totaling some 41 billion lira ($11.3 billion) and employ 46,357 people, Canikli said in a written statement. Turkey took control of a bank, industrial companies and media firms as part of the crackdown on companies accused of links to Gulen. He has denied involvement in the putsch. Apart from the business crackdown, Turkey has jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000, including soldiers, police officers, teachers and civil servants, over alleged links with terrorist groups. The purge has alarmed Turkey's Western allies and human rights groups, who say President Tayyip Eroding is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent, a charge he denies. Ten people including Amnesty International's Turkey director and other rights activists were detained this week on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organization, Amnesty said on Thursday, in what it called a  grotesque abuse of power . The government has said the security measures are necessary because of the gravity of the threats facing Turkey, which is also battling Kurdish and Islamist militants. More than 240 people were killed in last year's coup attempt.

Hillhouse is targeting to raise about 8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in the fund, said one of the sources. Venture capital and private equity funds are lining up to raise funds in yuan, tapping into the appetite of investors eager to grab opportunities in domestic Chinese businesses that are typically restricted to overseas buyers and as startup founders prepare to take their companies public in local markets. Fund managers are also looking to benefit from growing sources of capital at insurance firms and other large domestic institutional investors, as well as wealthy individuals looking to boost returns in alternative assets, analysts and investors said.  It's a very sizeable pool of capital that is looking for investment opportunities and the channels to raise funds have improved,  said an investor in several China-focused funds who  was not authorized to speak publicly about the industry.  If you have enough of a local investment program, you can find opportunities to invest locally in yuan as well, so it makes sense to raise those funds.  Investment managers have raised 59.6 billion yuan in funds denominated in the Chinese currency so far in 2017, compared with 64.4 billion yuan in all of 2016, according to data provider Preqin. That would put this year on pace to be the biggest since 2012, when 145.8 billion yuan in aggregate capital was raised. Hillhouse declined to comment. The sources did not want to be named because the capital raising plans are not public. The investment firm, founded in 2005 by Zhang Lei with seed funds from Yale University's endowment, has raised yuan-denominated funds before and is among several China-focused investment managers such as Qiming Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital China that have funds in both U.S. and Chinese currencies.  But increasingly companies that previously only targeted U.S. dollar fundraising are also launching yuan funds. Lightspeed China Partners and Morningside Venture Capital closed their debut yuan funds earlier this year. And GGV Capital, an early backer of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, ride hailing firm Didi Chuxing and phone maker Xiaomi Inc, was also looking to launch its first fund in yuan.

The American was playing Romania's Sorana Cirstea on Court 17 on Thursday when she appeared to slip as she approached the net at the beginning of the third set. She fell awkwardly to the grass and, after a moment's silence, screamed out in pain before repeatedly shouting  help me!  as she clutched her right leg. The 32-year-old was treated by doctors on the court for more than 20 minutes, during which time she was given oxygen and an injection, before she was taken to hospital.  Bethanie is currently undergoing more scans this morning, and we should know more within the next few hours,  a statement from the WTA women's tour said.   Bethanie of course thanks everyone for their kind wishes and messages of support.

The rivals, separated by 14 points after eight races, were getting back to business after calming a 'road rage' controversy that has dominated Formula One since the previous race in Azerbaijan. Hamilton, the only driver on the current grid to have won previously in Austria following the retirement of 2016 champion and team mate Nico Rosberg, set a fastest time of one minute 05.975 seconds on soft tyres. The lap was the fastest yet around the Red Bull-owned circuit. On a sunny morning in the scenic Styrian hills, Red Bull's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen ended the session second fastest, 0.190 off Hamilton's pace and using supersoft tyres, with Valtteri Bottas third for Mercedes. Vettel's time of 1:06.424 was nearly half a second off the pace. Mercedes have won every year since Austria returned to the calendar in 2014, after being absent for a decade, with Hamilton triumphant in 2016. The Briton and his Ferrari rival, a four-times world champion with Red Bull, have been closely matched on race pace, however, with each winning three grands prix so far this season.  Hopefully we have a calmer race and we should have more, let's say, consistent conditions, then you are able to read much more how close we are,  Vettel said on Thursday after making a public apology to Hamilton for the Baku furore. The German had driven into the back of Hamilton's car, while the race leader was waiting for the safety car to pit, and had pulled alongside to remonstrate. He then accused Hamilton of 'brake-testing' him, words he retracted this week after apologising. The furore was still a major talking point when the teams regrouped but both drivers said they had moved on and were focusing on Sunday's race. Behind the top four, Azerbaijan race winner Daniel Ricciardo was fifth fastest for Red Bull ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. Ricciardo injected some Australian humour into the build-up when he jokingly told Sky Sports television, while struggling to keep a straight face, that Baku had changed everything.  I always said I want to win five races and retire so I'm probably not going to compete this weekend,  he smiled.  I think I'm done. So it's changed pretty dramatically my position in the sport.  He then reassured  people at home who don't understand my silly sense of humour  not to worry. (Editing by John O'Brien)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-austria-idUSL4N1JY3LI"},

Naked. Pete Sharwood-Smith, Gary Lincoln-Hope, Pete Cheek and Olly Aylott jumped from a plane 22,400 feet above a Kenyan beach on Thursday, aiming for the world record for the highest naked jump and appealing for unity after the bruising referendum campaign.   We're not allied to any political party, we just want to reinforce the positive aspects of being British and British people are known for doing silly things, especially after the pub,  said 43-year-old Sharwood-Smith, a red-haired Scot.  England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland -- we're all better together.   Britons voted to leave the European Union on June 23, 2016. Planning for the jump began about six months ago.     The Guinness Book of World Records said naked skydiving was not a category it monitored, but Jeff Dawson, who founded the U.S.-based Society for the Advancement of Naked Skydiving, said the highest naked jump he knew of was 18,000 feet.  Cheek, a 39-year-old web designer and photographer from London, said he also jumped to celebrate his father Pat Cheek, who often did gardening or construction work naked before he died of cancer 10 years ago.

Kenya is a beautiful country and I thought some high-speed nudity would only add to the experience.   Lincoln-Hope, who served in the elite British Parachute Regiment, is the only member of the team to have jumped naked before, hoping  then to break the record for the largest number of people parachuting without clothes. At 16, they fell short, and he broke his foot.

Everything was very numb,  he said. Air temperature was around -18 degrees Celsius (-4°F) with 125 mile per hour wind chill factor.  After removing oxygen masks and jumping from the plane, the four had five minutes to get to 15,000 feet, where normal oxygen levels resumed, or their ability to think clearly would be affected, Lincoln-Hope said. Maths teacher Olly Aylott, 33, joined the record attempt at the last minute after meeting the other three on the beach by chance on Wednesday.   British people are known for being quite prudish but we're not really,  he said.  A crew met the four on the beach with wraps.

The state budget is not enough for the government's ambitious plan to expand infrastructure in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Costs of moving goods around the sprawling archipelago are among Asia's highest.  Widodo told Reuters this week that he had instructed ministers to market the country aggressively to investors, capitalizing on Standard & Poor's May 19 upgrade of its credit rating to investment grade. Indonesia is hoping to attract the likes of Canada Pension Plan, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) and other institutional investors, Thomas Lembong, chairman of Indonesia's investment coordinating board, told Reuters.  We can't just sit back and wait for people to come because competition to attract capital flows is ferocious,  Lembong said.  Everything from toll roads to power plants to airports to ports should be securitized to capital markets.  Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg on Thursday that the government plans to securitize projects that are  already active and revenue-generating . That way, pension funds will not be involved in  the nitty-gritty of the new project or a project already being built so they can see the risk in a much better way,  she said. Under a securitization model, a company typically issues a trust-like investment structure that is backed by future revenue from a project or an asset, with investors earning a certain rate of return.

Antara Foto/Aloysius Jarot Nugroho via REUTERSPositive Initial Response Indonesia's biggest toll road operator, PT Jasa Marga Tbk, has begun working to securitize about half of the 4 trillion rupiah ($298.4 million) in revenue expected over five years from a road linking Jakarta to cities in West Java province. The securities - expected to offer annual returns of 8-9 percent over five years - have received a positive initial response from potential investors including pension funds, said Donny Arsal, Jasa Marga's finance director.   Cars pass through a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Semarang, Central Java province, Indonesia July 3, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Aditya Pradana Putra via REUTERSState-controlled electricity firm Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) is issuing securities backed by the projected five-year income of 10 trillion rupiah from a power plant operated by its unit. PLN decided on this new investment structure as it had already raised funds from bonds, bank loans and other sources, finance director Sarwono Sudarto said.  There is already a limit to the existing models of funding,  Sudarto said, adding that under asset securitization, there is no transfer of ownership of its physical asset. There's no guarantee the securitization plans will succeed. Andre Varian, a portfolio manager at BNI Asset Management, said the securities issued by state firms are relatively new in Indonesia and their returns are not much higher than those offered by other fixed-income assets.  The lack of liquidity in the domestic market may also deter foreign investors, Varian said.  Foreign demand would be very limited since there is no liquidity.    Additional reporting by Thomas Escritt in Hamburg, John Chalmers and Fransiska Nangoy in Jakarta; Editing by Richard Borsuk","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-economy-idUSKBN19S177"},

A.P. Moller-Maersk, Danish owner of the world's biggest container shipping line, operates 76 ports via its APM Terminal division and was one of the many firms hit by the ransomware virus along with Russia's Rosneft and advertising agency WPP. For the shipping sector, this was among the biggest-ever disruptions given Maersk handles one out of seven containers shipped globally.  Our first priority has not been to look at the financial impact,  Robbert van Trooijen, Maersk's Asia Pacific chief executive told reporters on a call.   It is too early to predict what the impact will be on the quarter-two, or potentially the quarter-three result.   The attack did not impact Maersk's physical loading of goods, but disrupted data-reliant processes such as creating arrival notices and obtaining customs clearance - leading to congestion at some of its ports, including in the United States, India, Spain and the Netherlands.  Van Trooijen said all ports Maersk worked with were now back on stream and releasing cargo.  Over the last 48 hours we are basically ensuring that just about every port in the world is able to receive and release cargo again.   He said it was unclear how many bookings had been canceled due to the attack which spread globally on June 28, but the firm was now seeing a rebound in bookings as systems recovered. He added Maersk would discuss settlement and liability issues with individual shippers who had been affected.  The cyber virus is believed to have first taken hold in Ukraine before spreading globally where it locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely. Van Trooijen said the company did not believe Maersk was deliberately targeted, given the virus' geographic reach, and that it would continue to work with cybersecurity and software firms to ensure it was as protected as it could be. He, however, warned it would be difficult to guard against new, random viruses.   There was nothing in terms of patches that we missed, there was no cyber security measures that we didn't take, so we were already in quite a strong position,  he said.

Rahman, who converted to Islam in his 20s, is in London with a show called  Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow . He told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that his interpretation of the Muslim faith meant living a life that was simple and in which humility was key.  Islam is an ocean, you know, it has different sects. More than 70. So I follow the Sufi kind of philosophy which is about love,  Rahman said.  I am what I am because of the philosophy I'm following, my family is following. And of course, many things are happening, and I feel it's mostly political.  Steeped in folklore, poetry and spiritualism, Sufism is a non-violent form of Islam based on hypnotic rituals and reflects the religion’s mystical side. A.R. Rahman performs during the Intel keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas January 5, 2016.Rick WilkingThe 50-year-old artist, who has won two Oscars, two Grammys and a Golden Globe, has over 160 film soundtracks to his name, including the Oscar-winning  Slumdog Millionaire  and Bollywood films like  Lagaan  and  Taal .  He sings, writes songs, plays instruments and composes music and has teamed up with other global artists including Mick Jagger, Sarah Brightman and the Pussycat Dolls. Rahman said his latest tour, which kicks off at Wembley SSE Arena in London on July 8, will take his fans on a journey through his music for the last quarter of a century. The softly spoken artist, who nevertheless has a powerful stage presence, said he still had more to achieve and hoped music would help bring more people together.  If you take an orchestra, you have the underprivileged and the privileged, playing together. We have different races playing together. We have different religions playing together. But one sound comes out,  he said.  You work towards one harmony.  Reporting by Serena Chaudhry","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/people-ar-rahman-idUSL8N1JX5AM"},

While the troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in barracks across the former British colony will remain a low-key presence, more robust public engagement and displays of China's growing military capabilities are likely, according to local officials, foreign envoys and analysts.  The visit will help to stir the patriotism of Hong Kong comrades and help people to love the country and love Hong Kong more,  Ding Yi, a vice admiral of the Chinese navy, told reporters after the Liaoning steamed into Hong Kong waters flanked by two Type 52 destroyers from its strike group.  The 8,000-strong Hong Kong garrison - split between bases in the city and across the mainland border in southern Guangdong - has already embarked on more intense training and live-fire drills in recent months, including helicopter exercises. For a Graphic, click [tmsnrt.rs/2p3GE0L]  The days of visiting U.S. ships and sailors being the most obvious military figures in Hong Kong is starting to die out ... there is a sense now that Hong Kong is ready for more PLA displays,  said one foreign envoy. A recent article in the Communist Party's ideological journal Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, quoted senior PLA officers on the need to improve both combat capabilities and the  safeguarding of sovereignty through education  in Hong Kong.  An editorial in Hong Kong's pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po newspaper on Friday urged more military activities to stir national feeling locally and  promote the return of the people's hearts   We can see their (PLA) posture is starting to change and they moving to a new role,  said Zhang Baohui, a mainland security expert at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.  In part, we can see them attempting to foster a greater sense of nationality in Hong Kong.  China's aircraft carrier Liaoning sails into Hong Kong, China July 7, 2017.Greg TorodeThe Hong Kong garrison has yet to respond to Reuters' questions, while a Hong Kong government spokesmen referred inquiries to the PLA. Under Hong Kong's constitution, the Chinese government is responsible for foreign affairs and defense. Sealed Within Barracks China's aircraft carrier Liaoning sails into Hong Kong, China July 7, 2017.Bobby YipDespite living within a free and staunchly capitalist city for two decades, PLA troops remain largely sealed within their Hong Kong barracks, kept away from local media and fed a strict diet of Communist Party and military propaganda, say those familiar with the garrison. While some of the PLA's Hong Kong properties sit just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border, they live a similar existence to Chinese peacekeepers in far more potentially hostile states. Their families are kept back in mainland China, and young soldiers are kept well away from potential trouble spots and red-light areas -- a far cry from Hong Kong's reputation as a rollicking liberty port for Western servicemen dating back to the Cold War. Trevor Hollingsbee, a former naval intelligence analyst with the British Defence Ministry, said that with its helicopters, ranks of light tanks, air defense missiles and fast corvette ships the Hong Kong garrison was now stronger than the British units they replaced - even though Hong Kong was well protected by the PLA's broader southern forces.  They remain a highly symbolic presence and the whole situation is a bit odd, in military terms,  he said.  Unlike the situation under the British, there is no compelling strategic need to keep such a force in Hong Kong itself...and even if they do show themselves more, they'll ultimately be kept well away from the broader community. They'll remain deeply cautious about Western influence.  Additional reporting by William Ho, Jasper Ng, Susan Gao and Clare Jim in Hong Kong.

Singapore overall refining margins to Dubai crude DUB-SIN-REF rose to $7.34 per barrel on July 6, the highest since Feb. 16, amid weaker crude prices and strong demand for oil product such as fuel oil, gasoil and jet fuel. Japanese refineries were mainly running at above 90 percent of their capacity from January to May this year compared with below 90 percent for the same period last year, according to data from the Petroleum Association of Japan. South Korean refineries had an even higher throughput of 99.1 percent for the January to May period compared with last year's 96.6 percent, data from Korea National Oil Corp showed.  (Margins) were strong because of tight regional inventories, and this shows how solid demand is,  said a source from a South Korean refinery who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.  There is little reason to trim down the run rates,  the source added. Asia's refinery run rates are expected to increase further in the second half, said Peter Lee, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, adding that the pace of incremental fuel demand growth will outstrip refining capacity additions over 2017-2019.  This will be positive for runs, before the market flips into a refining overcapacity from 2020,  he said. Strong margins were seen across three key refined products, fuel oil, jet fuel and diesel which make up about 40 to 70 percent of a refinery's output.  Fuel oil is often treated like a by-product but recently it became the same price or higher than Dubai crude, which means there is no reason to keep run rates low unless you have a planned maintenance,  said a trader with a Japanese refinery who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media. The cost of Dubai crude, the Middle East oil benchmark DUB-1M-A for Asia refiners that typically process Middle East grades, has dropped 11 percent to $47.11 per barrel since May 25, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said it would extend output cuts.  (The strength in margins) relies on (product) demand remaining strong and refinery maintenance, both planned and unplanned, remaining elevated. If either disappoint then margins are ripe for a correction,  said Virendra Chauhan, analyst at Energy Aspects.

Shares in Dunelm rose as much as 6.2 percent on Friday, topping the FTSE midcap index after the company said its revenue rose to 240 million pounds ($310.94 million) for the 13 weeks ended July 1. Robust growth in consumer spending has been one of the main factors sustaining Britain's economy since the Brexit vote last June. However, retailers fear spending will fall as inflation erodes real earnings growth. Dunelm, which sells cushions, bedding and kitchen equipment, said revenue growth was partly driven by its acquisition of WS Group, which owns the Worldstores, Kiddicare and Achica brands, in November for 8.5 million pounds. The company, which generates 20 percent of its sales online, saw an improvement in online and home delivery sales on the back of its launch of Worldstores products on the Dunelm website. Worldstores contributed 22.6 million pounds, or 9.4 percent of revenue, to Dunelm in the fourth quarter. Like-for-like sales rose 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter, while home delivery sales rose 32.1 percent, Dunelm said. Sales over the Easter period were 7 percent lower than a year ago, it said. The company had warned earlier this year that it would increase prices on a number of products to offset the impact of a weak pound.  We maintain the view that a consumer squeeze on disposable income will impact the homewares industry and Dunelm,  analysts at Jefferies said in a note on Friday. Dunelm said it expected full-year pretax profit, excluding acquisition charges, of 109 million pounds to 111 million pounds, lower than the 128.9 million pounds reported a year earlier. Dunelm's gross margins, excluding Worldstores, fell by about 75 basis points as the company gave more discounts on some of its end of season stock. It expects full-year gross margin to be broadly flat from last year at about 49 percent.

Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 percent in the first quarter, Trump said on Twitter on Wednesday, casting doubt on China's assertion it is working to press North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs. Data released in April by Beijing showed China's trade with North Korea grew 37.4 percent in the first quarter over the corresponding 2016 period, the Global Times said, adding that subsequent data showed declining trade in April and May.  First quarter data cannot speak for the whole year,  the paper said in an editorial that carried the headline  China-NK Q1 trade data must be read fairly .  The trade volume for 2017 is unlikely to grow significantly from last year,  it said. While the first-quarter rise was  somewhat unexpected , the newspaper said China had been strictly implementing U.N. sanctions against North Korea, and that a ban on imports of its coal had taken a toll on two-way trade. The newspaper said trade between China and North Korea had declined during the previous three years. China has not imported North Korean coal since it banned imports of the fuel on Feb. 18, the General Administration of Customs said in April. The Global Times, published by the official People's Daily, reiterated that sanctions should not affect normal trade activities with North Korea, especially those concerning people's livelihoods.  America's public opinion mistakenly depicts U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang's nuclear and missile activities as a total embargo,  it said, citing a four-fold increase in China's grain exports to North Korea in the first quarter.  Beijing will never export materials to Pyongyang that could be used for nuclear and missile activities.   It also urged China and the United States to communicate further on the sanctions on North Korea and  narrow down their divergences . A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, referred questions on the trade figures to the Commerce Ministry, and reiterated that as neighbors, China and North Korea had  normal  trade relations. China also fully enforced U.N. resolutions on North Korea, Geng told a daily news briefing. China's Commerce Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the Global Times article.

North Korea on Tuesday test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea said it could carry a large nuclear warhead. Speaking at a news conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda, Trump said North Korea was  a threat, and we will confront it very strongly . He said the United States was considering  severe things  for North Korea, but that he would not draw a  red line  of the kind that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had drawn but not enforced on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Trump added:  They are behaving in a very, very dangerous manner and something will have to be done.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the missile test in itself did not bring the parties closer to a war and stressed that America's focus was on diplomatic efforts to pressure Pyongyang.  We stand ready to provide (military) options if they are necessary. But this is a purely diplomatically led (effort),  Mattis told a small group of reporters at the Pentagon.

Diplomatic efforts remain under way as we speak.  Mattis spoke by phone with South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo on Thursday, reaffirming Washington's commitment to the U.S.-South Korea alliance and promising  the full range of U.S. capabilities.  He spoke with his Japanese counterpart on Wednesday.  The issue presents Trump, who took office in January, with perhaps his biggest foreign policy challenge and has put pressure on his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom the Republican president had pressed without success to rein in Pyongyang. China called on Thursday for restraint and made clear it did not want to be targeted by U.S. sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump gives a public speech in front of the Warsaw Uprising Monument at Krasinski Square in Warsaw, Poland July 6, 2017.Carlos BarriaChinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said that while China would implement relevant U.N. resolutions,  the U.S. should not use their domestic laws as excuses to levy sanctions against Chinese financial institutions . Late on Thursday, court filings made public disclosed that U.S. authorities were trying to seize millions of dollars from companies that deal with North Korea, including the country's military, from eight large international banks. Russia objected on Thursday to U.N. Security Council condemnation of the North Korean rocket launch because the U.S.-drafted statement referred to it as an intercontinental ballistic missile, diplomats said. Moscow has said it believes Pyongyang fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday, while China has not identified the rocket launched. North Korea said it tested an ICBM and the United States said that was likely true. Slideshow (3 Images)'Bad Behavior' Trump flew to Hamburg on Thursday to attend a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 developed nations, and was due to meet with Xi there. His frustration that Beijing has not done more to clamp down on North Korea prompted him to tweet on Wednesday:  Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!  Trump did not mention China in his remarks in Poland but his message that other countries needed to do more was clearly meant for Beijing.  President Duda and I call on all nations to confront this global threat and publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences for their very, very bad behavior,  he said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions in coming days, and that if Russia and China did not support the move, then  we will go our own path.  Some diplomats say Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbor and has resisted tougher measures, such as an oil embargo, bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers, and measures against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with the North. U.S. officials have said the United States might seek unilaterally to sanction more Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, especially banks, echoing a tactic it used to pressure Iran to curb its nuclear program.

Faced with opposition from Akzo's boards, PPG dropped its attempt to buy the maker of Dulux paints on June 1. Under Dutch securities law PPG cannot approach the company again for at least six months. PPG's final proposed offer in cash and shares was worth more than 95 euros per Akzo share. The company's stock was trading up 0.2 percent on Friday at 77.58 per share. In a preliminary ruling in May Amsterdam's Enterprise Chamber rejected Elliott's bid to compel Akzo to convene an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to vote on dismissing Antony Burgmans, saying it was an attempt to wrest control of the company's strategic direction from the board.. That case is continuing. But Elliott said on Friday it had started a new action at a different venue, the Interim Relief Court, which is part of Amsterdam's District Court. The Enterprise Chamber case is expected to take months, with the next hearing scheduled for September 20, while the District Court case should be heard within several weeks. A date has not yet been set. Elliott, which is now Akzo's largest shareholder with a 9.5 percent stake, said it had lost all confidence in Burgmans and believed it must pursue the case to defend shareholder rights under Dutch corporate governance law. In response, Akzo Nobel's director of public and media relations Diana Abrahams said the company has been in close contact with its shareholders since the ruling in May, when the judges also told it to repair relations with its disgruntled shareholders.  We have had more than 130 contacts with shareholders in June, seeking feedback,  Abrahams said, adding that the company would put forward a plan to appease shareholders at the company's second-quarter results on July 25. Akzo is also seeking to sell its chemicals division, representing a third of profits, in order to fund an extraordinary dividend and share buyback to placate investors. Under Dutch law shareholders are in theory granted the right to request an extraordinary meeting of shareholders but the Enterprise Chamber ruling restricted the circumstances for exercising that right. Elliott said on Friday that now that PPG's bid was off the table it is merely attempting to censure the company's management for poor performance, rather than seeking to change its strategic direction.  Elliott finds Chairman Burgmans’ views on shareholder democracy to be archaic and wholly unacceptable in today’s capital markets,  it said in a statement.

With nervousness rising about higher global interest rates ahead of U.S. jobs data, Russia's rouble and Turkey's lira were both down for a fifth day and roughly 2 and 3 percent respectively for the week. South Africa's rand racked up a 3 percent weekly loss as worries continued about its central bank's independence, plans for land redistribution without compensation as well a lack of drive for much-needed economic reforms. MSCI's 24-country emerging market share index dropped 0.4 percent, falling for a second day and week running, while emerging sovereign bond spreads over U.S. Treasuries -- the premium investors demand to buy EM debt -- hovered at their highest in two weeks. EM stocks surged more than 15 percent in the first half of the year but the MSCI index has now lost $100 billion over the last month.  This may be the beginning of a larger dollar up move against emerging market currencies,  said Commerzbank FX technicals analyst Axel Rudolph. He said downtrend lines had now been broken on both dollar-lira and dollar-rand charts and if the greenback got above highs hit earlier in the month against the likes of the euro, it would be confirmation that it was on the rise again. Most Asian currencies also traded cautiously overnight as investors awaited the U.S. June jobs report, the Bank of Japan boosted its bond buying programme but the European Central Bank (ECB) signalled it was edging closer to scaling its back. There was much focus too on the first face-to-face meeting between Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin since Trump became U.S. President. The rouble drop on the day took it to a five-month low of 60.49 versus the dollar. Russian stocks were also down with the dollar-denominated RTS index 1.8 percent lower and the rouble-based MICEX off 0.9 percent at 1,906 points. Analysts at Binbank said in a note that the rouble could firm up below the psychologically important threshold of 60 against the dollar if the Putin-Trump meeting goes well. The rouble is also under pressure from unexpectedly high inflation, which hit 4.4 percent in June, challenging the central bank's aim of bringing it to a post-Soviet low of 4 percent this year.  The Russian central bank is now more likely to pause its rate cuts in July to address the inflationary shock,  analysts at Alfa Bank said in a note. Other tensions which have buffeted emerging markets over the last few weeks were also rumbling on. The Unites States said it was increasingly concerned that a rift between Qatar and other Arab states could drag on for a long time. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said it was time for North Korea to decide whether it wanted dialogue or not. Chinese data showed its foreign exchange reserves rose modestly in June to $3.057 trillion. It was its fifth straight monthly rise, although by slightly less than economists had expected. The yuan was heading for a modest weekly fall while Chinese stocks ended mixed as they snapped a two-week winning streak.

Selahattin Demirtas, held at a prison in the northwestern province of Edirne, had asked to be present at the hearing but then refused to travel to Ankara in handcuffs, it said.  (Demirtas) stated he was still a lawmaker, that his immunity was still intact, and that he would not attend the hearing if he were put in handcuffs,  a party statement said. It said the prison gendarme told Demirtas they could not take him to Ankara without handcuffs, upon which he returned to his room at the prison. HDP lawyers left the courtroom in Ankara in protest, a Reuters reporter said, while the public inside the court applauded the decision to handcuff Demirtas. Police dispersed a crowd outside the court. More than a dozen HDP lawmakers, including the party's former co-leader Figen Yuksekdag, have been jailed, mostly due to suspected links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), following an abortive putsch last July.  This is an act of civilian coup, Selahattin Demirtas is the chairman of HDP and a lawmaker,  Serpil Kemalbay, who replaced Yuksekdag after her arrest, told reporters.  It is just another dimension of the ongoing injustice, and totally unacceptable .  We are protesting this use of force against our chairman and call for freedom and justice for all . Prosecutors want Demirtas jailed for 142 years and Yuksekdag for up to 83 years on charges of terrorist propaganda. Demirtas was sentenced in February for  insulting the Turkish people, the government and state institutions . The HDP also says as many as 5,000 of its members have been detained as part of a crackdown that followed last year's failed coup, and which rights groups say targets dissent. The arrests handicapped the second-largest opposition party before an April 16 referendum in which Turks narrowly approved constitutional changes sharply boosting President Tayyip Erdogan's powers.     The government says the HDP is an extension of the PKK, which has waged an insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast for more than three decades. The HDP denies direct links to the PKK, deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and European Union.

Wu TAIPEI, July 7 (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports in June surged more than expected, underpinned by robust shipments into China, as the tech supply chain for gadgets that make up smartphones and ultra-thin laptops enters its seasonally-busy second half. June exports rose 13 percent from a year ago, increasing for a ninth straight month and beating the 8.7 percent forecast in a Reuters poll. Imports rose a smaller 3.7 percent for the same time period, easing back after solid gains in recent months, finance ministry data showed.  The peak in imports is slowly passing, but exports' growth is just starting,  said Aidan Wang, an analyst at Cathay Securities Investment Trust in Taipei. Although a high base from last year's second half may result in  ordinary  gains in the months ahead,  the export momentum is still quite strong,  he said. Taiwan is one of Asia's major exporters, especially of technology goods, and its export trend is an important gauge of global demand for technology gadgets worldwide. Last month's jump was boosted by a 21 percent on-year advance in shipments to China, the island's largest export destination and where many Taiwanese tech firms have production plants. In May, exports to China rose only 6.4 percent. Gains for Components Shipments were led by double-digit gains in electronic components, up 19.5 percent in June from a year ago, and parts related to information, communication and visual gadgets - category for smartphones - up 17.2 percent. For 2017's first half, exports grew 12.5 percent from a year earlier. The government has forecast shipments for the full year will rise 8.57 percent compared with 2016, when they contracted 1.8 percent. Hopes for a strong second half stem from anticipation of a new, 10th anniversary iPhone by Apple Inc and other product launches that should fuel year-end holiday demand. A private barometer of Taiwan's manufacturing activity in June indicated bright prospects with a sharp rise in new export orders, a leading indicator of shipments in the following two-three months. Taiwan's trade with the United States in June produced a surplus of $920 million, wider than May's $628 million, ministry data showed. The trade gap remains below one of the thresholds that could trigger punitive moves by the U.S. Treasury. Taiwan, as part of a public comment process on its trade with the United States, said in May that arms sales narrow the bilateral trade gap. In June, President Donald Trump's administration notified Congress of $1.42 billion in arms sales to Taiwan. Beatrice Tsai, a Taiwan finance ministry official, told reporters that arms sales have in the past been included in the trade figures and would contribute to a narrower trade gap.

Cargill's petroleum business includes crude oil and oil products trading. The company will remain active in edible oils in the food and agriculture space, she said.

Macquarie also announced in mid-June that it would acquire Cargill's North America power and gas business for an undisclosed amount. It was not immediately clear how many traders had left Cargill's oil trading team or how many were transferred to Macquarie.  Macquarie declined to provide further details beyond the initial announcement of the sale.  Macquarie, which operates a global oil business active in both financial and physical markets, will see the deal expand its footprint, by adding facilities in Geneva, Switzerland and Minneapolis, Minnesota.

A number of insurers that write insurance in Britain operate from Gibraltar and from Malta. If Britain loses access to the single market after Brexit, Malta-based insurers will no longer be able to sell insurance into Britain. Gibraltar, in contrast, is a British overseas territory, so those ties will continue.  An application to re-domicile St Julians has been submitted to the Malta Financial Services Authority in order to protect the business and enable the insurer to continue trading with the UK,  Markerstudy said in a statement.  The favoured proposal is to move the operation to Gibraltar.  Markerstudy already has two insurance firms in Gibraltar focusing on UK business, Markerstudy Insurance and Zenith Insurance. Nigel Feetham, partner at Gibraltan law firm Hassans, said Gibraltar and Malta were comparable jurisdictions for insurers.  The system of law is not entirely dissimilar and the authorisation process and prudential regime in insurance are also very similar,  he said. Gibraltan insurers with large exposure to the European Union are also considering moving operations, Feetham said, with Luxembourg and Malta the favoured locations. However, Gibraltan insurer Elite, which last year said it planned a move to Luxembourg as a result of Brexit, said this week it would stop writing new business.

Reserves rose $3.2 billion during June to $3.057 trillion, in line with economists' forecast in a Reuters poll. The reserves rose by $24 billion in May to $3.054 trillion. It was the first time that reserves had climbed for five months in a row since June 2014, and marked its highest level in eight months.  China's foreign exchange reserves suggest that outflow pressures may have eased last month,  wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, adding that June could mark the first month since October 2015 in which the PBOC was a net buyer of foreign exchange. He estimated that China's capital outflows dropped to roughly $10 billion in June from $29 billion in May. The country's foreign exchange regulator said that the slight increase in reserves in June was driven by stronger non-dollar currencies against the greenback. China's foreign reserves will remain stable as cross-border capital flows become more balanced, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement following the data release. China burned through nearly $320 billion of reserves last year but the yuan still fell about 6.5 percent against the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994. Faced with an entrenched bearish yuan view, Beijing moved swiftly over the past few months to flush out speculators, quash expectations of a further steep depreciation and safeguard its reserves. That strategy to head off risks to the economy from capital outflows seems to have worked so far, with the yuan up about 2 percent against the dollar this year. In May, net foreign exchange sales by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) fell to the lowest in nearly two years as the yuan stabilised. China also recorded a surplus in its capital and financial account in the first quarter, data from the foreign exchange regulator showed, indicating net capital inflows as policymakers tightened supervision of outflows. However, French investment bank Natixis said in a report that its capital flow tracker for China showed outflows for the second quarter will rise to $144.1 billion, reversing the trend in the first quarter. The tighter grip on capital flows has also become a setback for China as it has been aspiring to turn the yuan into a global currency. In an effort to reassure global investors worried about the stepped up capital control measures, China's premier Li Keqiang told the World Economic Forum last month that Beijing will not restrict cross-border movement of foreign firms' earnings. Traders said some major state-owned banks were spotted selling dollars in the market this week, a trend seen over the past few months in what analysts believe is part of official efforts to stabilise the yuan. Still, the yuan is forecast to weaken to 7.05 per dollar in 12 months, according to a Reuters poll of more than 50 foreign exchange analysts taken in June. The yuan is predicted to trade at 6.95 per dollar by the end of this year, compared with 7.2 per dollar forecast at the beginning of the year. The value of gold reserves fell to $73.585 billion at the end of June, from $75.004 billion at end-May, data published on the People's Bank of China website also showed.

ECB board member Benoit Coeure fine-tuned the message in interviews on Friday, saying that any policy adjustment should be careful to avoid disrupting markets, and underlying inflation remained weak despite a pick-up in growth in the euro zone.     But after Thursday's jump in the 10-year Bund yield above 0.5 percent, many investors think hawkish comments from global central banks have triggered a trend of rising bond yields, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.      Many people tend to think now that (ECB President Mario) Draghi's speech last week (about possible policy tweaks) was a watershed,  the trader said, adding that  after years of strong price gains a correction looks reasonable .     Hungary's 10-year bond yield has risen about 35 basis points in the past two weeks to 3.18 percent, while the country's shorter than one-year debt yields remain near zero, kept low by the Hungarian central bank's loose policies.     Hungarian and Polish long-term yields rose 1-2 basis points on Friday after a 10 basis point jump on Thursday.     The yield on Czech 10-year bonds was bid at 1.07 percent, up 5 basis points.     The rise in long-term yields is caused by global factors, while domestic fundamentals remain strong and also shield currencies in the region which is immune to a recent decline n crude prices unlike some other emerging markets, analysts said.     A surge in Hungary's budget deficit in June did not trigger worries as it was caused by one-off factors.     Figures showing a higher-than expected May trade surplus helped the forint strengthen, one dealer said, adding that Moody's is unlikely to change the country's sovereign rating in a review due after local markets close.     Fitch is due to review Poland's rating, but analysts expect no change.      The only country in the region where a possible rise in the budget deficit has been a worry is Romania.     Romania's 10-year bond yield was still flat, bid at 4.03 percent, after robust demand at an auction on Thursday, which followed significant expiries in Romanian debt last month.      With another large redemption on the horizon this month, liquidity should remain sufficient to keep rates subdued,  ING analysts said in a note.

Lee,US,SAMSUNG,ELEC,RESULTS,Science","sector":"Technology","content":"SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) on Friday said its second-quarter operating profit likely rose 72 percent from a year earlier to a new record, beating analyst estimates, as strong memory chip prices helped widen margins. The Apple Inc (AAPL.O) smartphone rival and global memory chip leader said second-quarter operating profit was likely 14 trillion won ($12.11 billion), compared with the 13.1 trillion won average of 19 analyst estimates in a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue likely rose 18 percent from a year earlier to 60 trillion won, versus analysts' forecast of 59 trillion won. Samsung shares are trading at a near-record high of 2.4 million won as of Thursday, as investors look forward to record earnings in 2017 driven by growing demand for chips capable of powering ever more complex servers and smartphones. On Tuesday, the company said it would invest $18.6 billion to extend its lead in memory chips and next-generation displays.  Samsung did not elaborate on its April-June performance and will disclose detailed results at the end of July. Even so, analysts have tipped its chip division to propel the firm to record overall profit. The memory chips industry is widely Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS on Friday estimated a record quarterly operating profit for April-June, propelled by a memory chip boom that analysts say will continue to pad margins for the rest of 2017. The Apple Inc AAPL.O smartphone rival and global memory chip leader said second-quarter operating profit was likely 14 trillion won ($12.11 billion), compared with the 13.1 trillion won average of 19 analyst estimates in a Thomson Reuters poll. Employees walk in the main office building of Samsung Electronics in Seoul, South Korea, in this file photo taken on January 6, 2016.Kim Hong-JiRevenue likely rose 18 percent from a year earlier to 60 trillion won, also a quarterly record, versus analysts' forecast of 59 trillion won. The South Korean firm did not elaborate and will release detailed earnings in late July. The robust estimates reinforce expectations for best-ever earnings for Samsung this year, fuelled by a so-called memory chip supercycle. Analysts predict shortages for both DRAM and NAND chips to persist for the rest of this year due to limited supply growth and demand for more computing power on smartphones and servers, padding margins for memory makers. Another profit driver has also emerged in the form of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. Samsung has a stranglehold on the market for the bendy, next-generation screens which are widely expected to be used for Apple's latest iPhones, due out by October.  In July DRAM prices will go up again, while from mid-August on, OLED panels go out for Apple,  HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh said. He expects Samsung's third-quarter operating profit to exceed 15 trillion won. Samsung shares were down 0.3 percent in early Friday trade, compared with a 0.2 percent fall for the broader market, as the strong earnings outlook was already priced in. The stock is up more than 30 percent this year and hovering near all-time highs. While analysts say the memory chip industry will ride a super-cycle for several years on the back of consolidation and new demand from services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, its growth rate may slow from the massive jump expected this year. Samsung said on Tuesday it would invest $18.6 billion to extend its lead in memory chips and next-generation displays, a move likely to ease shareholder fears that major decisions were on the backburner while Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee fights bribery charges in court. On the mobile front, sales prospects for the Galaxy Note 8 will be closely watched in the third quarter, after its predecessor was pulled from the market last year due to fire-prone batteries. Samsung is preparing to unveil the handset in August, a source told Reuters, underscoring the firm's desire to continue the Note brand.

GPIF on Friday reported a return of 5.86 percent in the year, on assets worth 144.9 trillion yen - a record high for the fund. In 2015, the fund posted a negative return of 3.82 percent and it lost 5.3 trillion yen. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 12.8 percent last fiscal year, helped by the Bank of Japan's aggressive purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF). Global stocks also benefitted from continuing loose monetary policy, with central banks around the world keeping rates close to all-time lows. GPIF made a return of 14.89 percent on its Japanese stock holdings, and 14.2 percent on its foreign stock holdings. In 2014, GPIF made a major policy shift, increasing investments in riskier assets such as stocks for higher returns, while it reduced its reliance on low-yielding domestic bonds. Japanese stock holdings accounted for 23.28 percent of GPIF's assets, while domestic bonds made up 31.68 percent. The pension fund allocated 23.12 percent to foreign stocks and 13.03 percent to foreign bonds. The remaining 8.89 percent was held mainly in cash, which increased from 5.14 percent a year ago.  The market was volatile throughout the year and it was difficult to make a prediction,  GPIF President Norihiro Takahashi told a news conference.  So that's why we wanted to increase our cash holdings to prepare for our next investments,  he said. In the year to March, markets were affected by Britain's vote last June to leave the European union and U.S. President Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. GPIF's Japanese bond portfolio made a negative return of 0.85 percent, while foreign bond holdings returned a negative 3.22 percent as yields rose, pushing bond prices down.

It corrects  the rating action on the senior unsecured rating of JSC Leasing company Europlan's bonds to affirmation at 'BB-' following the transfer of the notes from PJSC Europlan, and not withdrawn at PJSC Europlan and assigned at opco as stated initially. Fitch Ratings has withdrawn PJSC Europlan's ratings, including its Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'BB-'. Simultaneously, the agency has assigned the newly created JSC Leasing company Europlan (LC Europlan) Long-Term IDRs of 'BB-' with a Stable Outlook. The rating actions follow the completion of the reorganisation of PJSC Europlan. The reorganisation involved the transfer from PJSC Europlan to its new subsidiary LC Europlan of all financial liabilities relating to its leasing business (including outstanding bonds and bank loans) and all of its leasing assets, but only a portion of its cash and liquid assets. Fitch has withdrawn PJSC Europlan's ratings as it has undergone a reorganisation. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for PJSC Europlan. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS The asset/liability transfer is the second stage of Europlan's reorganisation, the ultimate purpose of which is to create a holding company for the non-bank financial assets of Safmar Group, which apart from Europlan include a 49% stake in VSK Insurance (BB-/Stable), and a 100% stake in Safmar pension fund. The first stage of the reorganisation was completed in December 2016, when Safmar contributed its stakes in the pension fund and insurance company to PJSC Europlan, which additionally raised RUB15 billion of equity contributed in cash via a secondary public offering. The rating actions reflect Fitch's view that LC Europlan's credit profile does not significantly differ from that of PJSC Europlan before it received stakes in the pension fund and VSK. LC Europlan's management has informed us that there are no plans to change the strategy of the company after the carve-out. The company will continue to focus on retail financial leasing of vehicles. LC Europlan will retain its core management team and existing branding. LC Europlan's 'BB-' Long-Term IDRs and senior debt rating reflect the company's significant franchise in the Russian auto leasing sector, so far conservative management and risk appetite, and sound financial metrics. At the same time, the ratings also reflect the high-risk Russian operating environment and contagion risks resulting from Europlan's shareholder, Safmar Group (previously known as B&N; Group). As per preliminary management accounts after the reorganisation, LC Europlan's leverage (defined as debt/equity) has increased to 3.3x compared with 1.5x at PJSC Europlan prior to reorganisation, as a result of PJSC Europlan retaining a sizable part of its cash and liquid assets. However, Fitch views this leverage as consistent with a 'BB-' rating. The senior unsecured notes issued by PJSC Europlan were transferred to LC Europlan's as part of the group reorganisation and have been affirmed at 'BB-'. LC Europlan's senior debt rating is aligned with the company's Local-Currency IDR, reflecting Fitch's view of average recovery prospects for unsecured senior creditors in case of default. This in turn is driven by the moderate proportion of company assets that have been pledged to secured creditors. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade of LC Europlan's IDRs is currently unlikely given the still challenging operating environment and expected further increase in leverage from renewed business growth. The company could be downgraded if its asset quality and performance weaken significantly, to the extent that this results in a marked increase in the company's leverage or compromises the quality of its capital. LC Europlan could be also downgraded if Fitch concludes that its strategy, risk appetite, balance sheet structure and/or financial metrics are likely to significantly weaken following shareholder actions, or if the company become significantly exposed to related parties, non-core assets or other contingent risks arising from the other assets of its owner. The senior debt rating could be downgraded in case of downgrade of the company's Local-Currency IDR, or a marked increase in the proportion of pledged assets, potentially resulting in lower recoveries for unsecured senior creditors in a default scenario. The rating actions are as follows: PJSC Europlan Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs: 'BB-'; withdrawn Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: 'B'; withdrawn JSC Leasing company Europlan Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs: assigned at 'BB-'; Outlooks Stable Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: assigned at 'B' Senior unsecured debt: affirmed at 'BB-' (transferred from PJSC Europlan) Contacts: Primary Analyst Aslan Tavitov Director +44 20 3530 1788 Fitch Ratings Limited 30 North Colonnade London E14 5GN Secondary Analyst Ruslan Bulatov Associate Director +7 495 956 9982 Committee Chairperson James Watson Managing Director +7 495 956 6657 Media Relations: Julia Belskaya von Tell, Moscow, Tel: +7 495 956 9908, Email: julia.belskayavontell@fitchratings.com; Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

The state budget is not enough for the government's ambitious plan to expand infrastructure in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Costs of moving goods around the sprawling archipelago are among Asia's highest.  Widodo told Reuters this week that he had instructed ministers to market the country aggressively to investors, capitalizing on Standard & Poor's May 19 upgrade of its credit rating to investment grade. Indonesia is hoping to attract the likes of Canada Pension Plan, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) and other institutional investors, Thomas Lembong, chairman of Indonesia's investment coordinating board, told Reuters.  We can't just sit back and wait for people to come because competition to attract capital flows is ferocious,  Lembong said.  Everything from toll roads to power plants to airports to ports should be securitized to capital markets.  Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg on Thursday that the government plans to securitize projects that are  already active and revenue-generating . That way, pension funds will not be involved in  the nitty-gritty of the new project or a project already being built so they can see the risk in a much better way,  she said. Under a securitization model, a company typically issues a trust-like investment structure that is backed by future revenue from a project or an asset, with investors earning a certain rate of return.

Antara Foto/Aloysius Jarot Nugroho via REUTERSPositive Initial Response Indonesia's biggest toll road operator, PT Jasa Marga Tbk, has begun working to securitize about half of the 4 trillion rupiah ($298.4 million) in revenue expected over five years from a road linking Jakarta to cities in West Java province. The securities - expected to offer annual returns of 8-9 percent over five years - have received a positive initial response from potential investors including pension funds, said Donny Arsal, Jasa Marga's finance director.   Cars pass through a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Semarang, Central Java province, Indonesia July 3, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Aditya Pradana Putra via REUTERSState-controlled electricity firm Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) is issuing securities backed by the projected five-year income of 10 trillion rupiah from a power plant operated by its unit. PLN decided on this new investment structure as it had already raised funds from bonds, bank loans and other sources, finance director Sarwono Sudarto said.  There is already a limit to the existing models of funding,  Sudarto said, adding that under asset securitization, there is no transfer of ownership of its physical asset. There's no guarantee the securitization plans will succeed. Andre Varian, a portfolio manager at BNI Asset Management, said the securities issued by state firms are relatively new in Indonesia and their returns are not much higher than those offered by other fixed-income assets.  The lack of liquidity in the domestic market may also deter foreign investors, Varian said.  Foreign demand would be very limited since there is no liquidity.    Additional reporting by Thomas Escritt in Hamburg, John Chalmers and Fransiska Nangoy in Jakarta; Editing by Richard Borsuk","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-economy-idUSL4N1JY1YC"},

Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.2 percent at 7,323.50 points at 0852 GMT on Friday, on track to post its first weekly gain since the end of May. The index pared losses after weak housing data drove sterling to a nine-day low. Oil & gas stocks dropped, taking around 8 points off the FTSE, after oil prices fell more than 1 percent following a rise in U.S. output, with Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.L. and BP down 0.9 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.  Regardless of what OPEC try and do, it seems the supply overhang is preventing any kind of sustainable rally,  Ian Williams, strategist at Peel Hunt, said. Financials were also weaker, with HSBC and Barclays both in negative territory, cooling after the sector hit its highest level since the end of February in the previous session on expectations of higher interest rates. WPP was the biggest individual FTSE faller, dropping 3.2 percent, after Exane BNP Paribas cut the advertising firm to  underperform  and downgraded French peer Publicis to  neutral , saying they need to evolve more quickly.  Marketing is driven by mobile, nimbler brands, ecommerce and automation/AI. These areas are dominated by platforms where agencies are sparse, raising the risk of lower mid-term growth,  the analysts at Exane said in a note.  WPP & Publicis have good track records of adapting to industry changes. We would buy once evidence they have adapted mounts, or on a much greater valuation discount,  Exane added. Shares in Royal Mail were also down 3 percent after UBS cuts its rating to  sell  from  neutral . Shares in easyJet bounced around 4 percent after Credit Suisse upgraded it to  outperform  on the back of an improvement in summer trading. Utility Centrica was the biggest gainer, up 5 percent on takeover rumours, although analysts at Jefferies were sceptical. Outside of the blue chips, a strong trading update from retailer Dunelm sent its shares 5.4 percent higher to the top of the FTSE 250, which fell 0.4 percent.

The effort was revealed two days after North Korea tested a long-range missile capable of reaching Alaska, ratcheting up tensions with the United States and adding to worries about North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's nuclear weapons plans. Thursday's filings show that Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the federal court in Washington, D.C. on May 22 granted U.S. prosecutors' applications for  damming  seizure warrants against Bank of America Corp, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Standard Chartered Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. Prosecutors believe the banks have processed more than $700 million of  prohibited  transactions on behalf of entities tied to North Korea since 2009, including the period after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, the filings show. Some of the transactions were processed for Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material Co and four affiliated  front  companies that prosecutors said tried to evade sanctions through transactions that would benefit North Korean entities,  including the North Korea military and North Korea weapons programs,  according to the filings. A person answering the telephone at Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material Co in northeastern China said the company was not aware of the case, and declined to comment. The company is based in Dandong, a city on the border with North Korea, where the majority of trade between the two countries takes place. On its Alibaba page, the company says annual revenue exceeds $100 million, and it has 12 years of experience in dealing with anthracite, briquettes and graphite. In a 2013 online profile for an industry conference in China, Dandong Zhicheng said it imported 1.8 million tonnes of North Korean anthracite coal, worth about $250 million. A Bank Of America sign  is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York August 21, 2014.Carlo AllegriAlthough it did not give a timeframe, that figure makes the company one of the largest suppliers of North Korean coal to major steel producers such as China Minmetels and Hesteel Group. On February 18, China banned the import of North Korean coal for the rest of the year, and in April ordered trading firms, including Dandong Zhicheng, to return their North Korean coal cargoes, sources said at the time. Dandong Zhicheng and the alleged front companies were not the named defendants in the court papers made public.  The filings did not say any of the banks knowingly violated  sanctions against North Korea. Asked about the issue, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that any infringements of U.N. resolutions on North Korea would be dealt with according to Chinese law, and that China opposed  long-armed jurisdiction . In her decision, Howell authorized warrants requiring the eight banks to accept incoming transactions but not allow outgoing transactions involving the five companies for 14 days, and thereafter to seize what they collected. Howell, an appointee of President Barack Obama, overruled a federal magistrate judge's May 2 refusal to authorize the warrants, saying prosecutors had probable cause to obtain them.

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) says the spike in migrant boats is already putting a lot of stress on Spain's insufficient migration structures. Escaping poverty and conflicts, more than 360,000 refugees and migrants arrived on European shores across the Mediterranean last year, according to the UNHCR. More than 85,000 have reached Italy so far this year. Spain's interior ministry did not return calls and emails seeking comment. While the Italian sea route remains the most popular overall with 59,000 migrants between January and May, up 32 percent from last year, the Spanish route further west has gathered steam with 6,800 migrants using it in the same period, a 75 percent increase from 2016. In June, the trend was even more pronounced as 1,900 migrants, mostly young men originating from Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gambia and Cameroon, reached the shores of the Southern region of Andalusia, quadrupling the numbers registered the same month last year. Further South, just as dramatic is the fall in the number of migrants spotted in the Agadez region of Niger, a key stop on the way to Libya from West Africa.  People are talking about going to Spain. It seems like it is safer to go through Morocco to Spain than through Libya. The difference is that Libya doesn't have a president and Morocco does – there are not guns like in Libya,  said Buba Fubareh, a 27-year-old mason from Banjul, Gambia, who tried and failed to get to Europe via Libya earlier this year. Many African migrants passing through Libya have reported having been beaten up, detained in camps with no food or water and even traded as slaves before being held for ransom, forced labor or sexual exploitation.     Unprepared? A similar reorganization has also taken place within the Western Mediterranean route itself, with the Alboran Sea, which connects North-Eastern Morocco and South-Eastern Spain, being now more popular than the previously favored Gibraltar strait or Ceuta and Melilla land borders where policing has increased. Migrant arrivals on the Spanish coastline averaged just under 5,000 a year between 2010 and 2016, according to government data, down from peak of 39,180 in 2006. It is on track to top 11,000 this year, government data shows. The country was unprepared to handle vulnerable groups such as victims of trafficking or unaccompanied minors and refugees who should be channeled through asylum procedures, the UNHCR said. Spain has so far given a lukewarm response to a request from Italy to fellow European Union countries to allow rescue boats carrying African migrants across the Mediterranean to dock in their ports and help handle tens of thousands of arrivals.  What is clear is that, they (Spain's government) have to get ready. They can't be caught unprepared. What started happening elsewhere in Europe in 2015 can't be allowed to happen here,  spokeswoman for the UNHCR in Spain Maria Jesus Vega said.      It's not yet an emergency, but you have to take into account that there are no structures here to deal with more arrivals.

France's environment minister has said the government would take steps to restrict the use of palm oil in biofuels in order to reduce deforestation in countries of origin. The plan is the latest international pressure to be put on the palm oil industry. A few months ago, the European parliament called for the European Union to phase out the use of vegetable oils in biodiesels that are produced unsustainably. The U.S. government is investigating Indonesian biodiesel exports on suspicion of dumping. Although France is not a significant export destination for Indonesian palm oil, its action could be followed by other EU members, said Fadhil Hasan, executive director at Indonesia Palm Oil Association (GAPKI).  It will be very impactful if followed by other countries, especially when their excuses are the same as those of the European parliament,  Hasan told Reuters. Indonesia exported a combined 4.37 million tonnes of palm oil to the European Union last year, its second largest market after India. A non-binding European parliament motion in April called for a single Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) scheme for Europe-bound palm and other vegetable oil exports to ensure they are produced in an environmentally sustainable way. Indonesia and Malaysia, the world's top producers, are working together to prevent implementation of the resolution. In response to the French plan, the Indonesian trade ministry secretary general, Karyanto Suprih, said the government would do everything it could to defend national interests, including bringing the issue to the World Trade Organization. France  will not stop trying  to curb palm oil use, Suprih added.  If now the issue is the environment, maybe next time it's another issue,  he said, adding that the Indonesian government has done a lot to address environmental issues.  We have done a lot and will not stop making improvements,  he said.

His appointment comes days after Finance Minister Ishaq Dar sparred with the central bank over the rupee's unexpected 3.1 percent plunge against the dollar on Wednesday. Bajwa recently retired as the top bureaucrat at the ministry and has worked closely with Dar in the past.  The President of Pakistan is pleased to appoint Tariq Bajwa as Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for a period of three years from the date he assumes office,  the finance ministry said on its official Twitter feed. Traders said SBP, run by an interim governor since May, this week effectively devalued the rupee by not propping it up as it normally does. Though the currency is meant to be freely traded, in practice SBP controls the thinly traded rupee market that works as a managed float. After the apparent devaluation, the bank put out a statement backing a weaker currency, saying it would help ease balance of payments pressures in Pakistan's $300 billion economy. But Dar, an advocate of a strong rupee, was furious and ordered an inquiry into what he termed a  mind-boggling  rupee tumble. He also said it was not the SBP's job to worry about the current account deficit.  Dar blamed the rupee's fall on a  miscommunication  between the SBP and other banking institutions. Analysts say the appointment of a civil servant governor, rather than an economist, is likely to add to doubts about the state bank's autonomy. Saad Hashmey, research director at brokerage Topline Securities, said with Bajwa's appointment  independence of the State Bank does come into question  but it also offers extra policy security for Pakistan.  (The SBP and finance ministry) have to be on the same page,  Hashmey said.  Certainty is good . The rupee, trading at 105.50/75 against the dollar on Friday, has regained some of the losses since Wednesday, when it traded as high as 108.50. Career Bureaucrat Bajwa, a former career bureaucrat, previously served as the chairman of the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR), one of the toughest jobs in Pakistan government due to an entrenched culture of tax evasion. He has a masters degree in Public Administration from Harvard University and previously served as a director at the SBP, media reports said. Deputy Governor Riaz Riazuddin was in May appointed as acting governor for three months. But Dar said a permanent chief's appointment would be brought forward after the rupee plunge. Riazuddin is expected to revert to his post as the deputy governor, according to an SBP source. Pakistan's economy has picked up speed in recent years, with a reduction in militant attacks and vast Chinese infrastructure investment spurring growth to above 5 percent for the first time in a decade. But the IMF last month warned that some of the macroeconomic gains made since the 2013 balance of payments crisis were beginning to erode, posing a risk to economic outlook.

(The SBP and finance ministry) have to be on the same page,  Hashmey said.  Certainty is good . The rupee, trading at 105.50/75 against the dollar on Friday, has regained some of the losses since Wednesday, when it traded as high as 108.50. Career Bureaucrat Bajwa, a former career bureaucrat, previously served as the chairman of the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR), one of the toughest jobs in Pakistan government due to an entrenched culture of tax evasion. He has a masters degree in Public Administration from Harvard University and previously served as a director at the SBP, media reports said. Deputy Governor Riaz Riazuddin was in May appointed as acting governor for three months. But Dar said a permanent chief's appointment would be brought forward after the rupee plunge. Riazuddin is expected to revert to his post as the deputy governor, according to an SBP source. Pakistan's economy has picked up speed in recent years, with a reduction in militant attacks and vast Chinese infrastructure investment spurring growth to above 5 percent for the first time in a decade. But the IMF last month warned that some of the macroeconomic gains made since the 2013 balance of payments crisis were beginning to erode, posing a risk to economic outlook.

Burhan Wani, a commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen militant group best known for appearing on social media in military fatigues to urge young people to join the fight against Indian forces, was killed in southern Kashmir on July 8 last year. On Friday, police halted people's movements in his hometown of Tral, in a bid to forestall gatherings and demonstrations, witnesses said.   A security alert has been enforced across the Kashmir Valley, with some preventive arrests made ahead of Saturday's anniversary, police inspector general Muneer Ahmad Khan said.      The alert is not only for unlawful assembly of people and rallies but also for militant strikes,  he said. India blames Pakistan for pushing in militants from its part of Kashmir to carry out attacks, a charge denied by Islamabad. An Indian policeman pulls concertina wire to lay a barricade on a deserted road during restrictions a day before the death anniversary of Burhan Wani, a commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen militant group, in downtown Srinagar July 7, 2017.Danish IsmailThe South Asian rivals have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part. Late on Thursday, authorities ordered internet service providers to shut down data services in Kashmir, citing the risk of anti-India forces using social media to stir up unrest. India has been struggling to restore normalcy in Kashmir, deploying thousands more soldiers, after Wani's killing appeared to breathe new life into the 28-year armed revolt that had ebbed and was drifting, with little international attention. A Pakistan-based Kashmir militant commander, whom the United States last week added to its list of global terrorists, has called for a strike on Saturday to mark Wani's killing.  Syed Salahuddin's United Jihad Council, an umbrella body of anti-India militants based in Pakistan-held Kashmir, has been incensed by the U.S. designation, vowing to continue its struggle to liberate Kashmir. Witnesses said most shops were closed in Srinagar, the region's summer capital, with traffic thin ahead of the anniversary. Authorities have restricted the movement of people in the city's old quarter, which has often erupted in violence.

The United States said this week it was ready to use force if necessary to counter the threat from North Korea, which tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea often threatens to strike the neighboring South and Japan, vowing to turn Seoul into a 'sea of fire' and 'a pile of ashes' the moment it has an order from leader Kim Jong Un. South Korea has nearly 19,000 bomb shelters throughout the country. They include more than 3,200 in Seoul, just 40 km (25 miles) from the militarized border drawn up under a truce that stopped the 1950-53 Korean War but left the combatants technically at war.  Chung Yoon-jin, a university student in Seoul, had no clue  these shelters existed.  I have never seen any signs that say ‘shelter’, although I have been to lots of places in Seoul,  the 26-year-old Chung said. The shelters are not built to protect against nuclear, chemical or biological attacks. They are mostly in subway stations or basements and parking garages in private apartments and commercial buildings designated as shelters with the consent of the owners. For a graphic on the locations of the shelters, click tmsnrt.rs/2rW8uvn In Seoul, most bomb shelters have no long-term supplies of food, water, medical kits or gas masks, an official at Seoul Metropolitan Government told Reuters. They can't be forced to stock up because no public funding is provided, said the official who declined to be identified. In Tokyo, the Japanese capital of 13.5 million people has an unknown number of bomb shelters left from World War II, but they are not useable or accessible to the public, an official at Tokyo Metropolitan Government's disaster prevention department told Reuters. Tokyo has no plans to reuse the decades-old shelters or build new ones for now.  The extent of any damage that could be caused by a North Korean missile is still unknown, and it will take time to figure out an appropriate design for a shelter,  the official said.

Picture taken on November 22, 2016.Kim Hong-Ji     Oblivious to Missile Threat While residents in Alaska and Hawaii are just waking up to the possibility of living within range of a North Korean missile, South Koreans for years have been exposed to thousands of artillery massed an hour's drive or so from the border, in addition to short-range missiles and bombs. People have grown numb to Pyongyang's unprecedented pace of missile and nuclear tests since the beginning of last year. “Every time, nothing seems to happen after (North Korea provocation), so now I feel I’m used to it. I think to myself, nothing will happen,  said Suh Yeon-ju, a 30-year-old housewife. Unlike in Japan, where sales of private nuclear shelters and radiation-blocking air purifiers have risen in recent months, South Korea has no market for private bunkers. One public bomb shelter that Reuters visited in central Seoul was in a large underground parking garage a few steps from a government complex building. A small sign posted at the entrance indicated a shelter, but people inside had no clue. A person in charge of the parking garage said one day last year he came to the office and saw a  shelter  sign posted, but he had no idea what it was. To raise awareness, Seoul has handed out 34,000 paper fans this summer with information about bomb shelters, and is in the process of creating other promotional products such as flyers and stickers, the city government official said. But it's difficult to get the buildings hosting shelters to put easily seen directional signs, he said. Shin Ji-ha, a 24-year-old university student in Seoul, said she heard about bomb shelters but didn't know where they were. It didn't matter to her anyway.  I would be dead like in less than a second (if a war broke out),  she said.  There will be no pain at all so I don’t mind that much.

While the troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in barracks across the former British colony will remain a low-key presence, more robust public engagement and displays of China's growing military capabilities are likely, according to local officials, foreign envoys and analysts.  The visit will help to stir the patriotism of Hong Kong comrades and help people to love the country and love Hong Kong more,  Ding Yi, a vice admiral of the Chinese navy, told reporters after the Liaoning steamed into Hong Kong waters flanked by two Type 52 destroyers from its strike group.  The 8,000-strong Hong Kong garrison - split between bases in the city and across the mainland border in southern Guangdong - has already embarked on more intense training and live-fire drills in recent months, including helicopter exercises. For a Graphic, click [tmsnrt.rs/2p3GE0L]  The days of visiting U.S. ships and sailors being the most obvious military figures in Hong Kong is starting to die out ... there is a sense now that Hong Kong is ready for more PLA displays,  said one foreign envoy. A recent article in the Communist Party's ideological journal Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, quoted senior PLA officers on the need to improve both combat capabilities and the  safeguarding of sovereignty through education  in Hong Kong.  An editorial in Hong Kong's pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po newspaper on Friday urged more military activities to stir national feeling locally and  promote the return of the people's hearts   We can see their (PLA) posture is starting to change and they moving to a new role,  said Zhang Baohui, a mainland security expert at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.  In part, we can see them attempting to foster a greater sense of nationality in Hong Kong.  China's aircraft carrier Liaoning sails into Hong Kong, China July 7, 2017.Greg TorodeThe Hong Kong garrison has yet to respond to Reuters' questions, while a Hong Kong government spokesmen referred inquiries to the PLA. Under Hong Kong's constitution, the Chinese government is responsible for foreign affairs and defense. Sealed Within Barracks China's aircraft carrier Liaoning sails into Hong Kong, China July 7, 2017.Bobby YipDespite living within a free and staunchly capitalist city for two decades, PLA troops remain largely sealed within their Hong Kong barracks, kept away from local media and fed a strict diet of Communist Party and military propaganda, say those familiar with the garrison. While some of the PLA's Hong Kong properties sit just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border, they live a similar existence to Chinese peacekeepers in far more potentially hostile states. Their families are kept back in mainland China, and young soldiers are kept well away from potential trouble spots and red-light areas -- a far cry from Hong Kong's reputation as a rollicking liberty port for Western servicemen dating back to the Cold War. Trevor Hollingsbee, a former naval intelligence analyst with the British Defence Ministry, said that with its helicopters, ranks of light tanks, air defense missiles and fast corvette ships the Hong Kong garrison was now stronger than the British units they replaced - even though Hong Kong was well protected by the PLA's broader southern forces.  They remain a highly symbolic presence and the whole situation is a bit odd, in military terms,  he said.  Unlike the situation under the British, there is no compelling strategic need to keep such a force in Hong Kong itself...and even if they do show themselves more, they'll ultimately be kept well away from the broader community. They'll remain deeply cautious about Western influence.  Additional reporting by William Ho, Jasper Ng, Susan Gao and Clare Jim in Hong Kong.

The Elliott purchase comes at a time when private equity firms Bain and Cinven are seeking to persuade investors to commit to accepting a new takeover offer for the group, after a 5.3 billion-euro ($6 billion) bid fell through. Only 65.52 percent of Stada's equity had signed up for Bain and Cinven's offer, missing a 67.5 percent acceptance threshold, despite the 49 percent premium offered by the buyout groups. The replacement of Stada's top management has delayed the new offer, people close to the matter said. Bain, Cinven, Stada and Elliott declined to comment. Bain and Cinven have sought to trump a takeover offer made by rival private equity firms Advent and Permira. Bloomberg reported earlier that Elliott has acquired a Stada stake of more than 5 percent.

Fessemheim 2 was shut down in June, 2016, after French nuclear watchdog ASN suspended the generator's test certificate following Areva's detection of irregularities in the manufacturing process at its Creusot unit. ASN then launched an investigation into where the potentially defective parts ended up and whether they were in use and were safe. EDF said in a note on its website that ASN's analysis of the steam generator was ongoing. An EDF spokeswoman said the new restart date was updated after the firm received some visibility from the watchdog. The two reactors at Fessenheim, France's oldest nuclear power generation plant, have a combined capacity of 1,800 MW. They have been earmarked for complete shutdown once EDF's new generation EPR reactor under construction in Flamanville is operational. France's previous government signed a decree in April that said Fessenheim will stop electricity production by April 2020 as a first step of cutting the share of atomic power in its electricity mix to 50 percent by 2025 from over 75 percent now.

Acapulco is the biggest city in Guerrero, one of Mexico's most lawless states and a center of opium poppy production that has been a major concern to U.S. officials. The prison carnage was particularly embarrassing to Mexico as it came the same day U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was visiting Guerrero, in Mexico's southwest. Guerrero state security official Roberto Alvarez told reporters the fight broke out between rival gangs in the maximum-security wing of the prison. In addition to 28 dead, three people were injured, he said. Authorities found bodies throughout the wing, inside and outside the kitchen, as well as the area for conjugal visits, he said. A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters four of the dead were decapitated. Alvarez told Reuters the prison was close to 30 percent over capacity. It was built for 1,624 inmates but had 1,951 men and 110 women behind its walls, he said. Despite reports of gunfire in the prison, all the casualties were due to wounds from sharp instruments, such as the improvised weapons that are fashioned by inmates, Alvarez said. Violent crime in Mexico has jumped in recent months and 2017 is on track to be one of its bloodiest on record. The number of murder cases in the first five months of 2017 jumped nearly 30 percent and murder investigations hit a record high in May. Soldiers stand outside a prison after a riot broke out at the maximum security wing in Acapulco, Mexico, July 6, 2017.Troy MeridaDrug gangs have been battling for control amid a power vacuum following the January deportation of Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman to the United States. The United States and Mexico are discussing how to crack down on the cartels now that most of the established capos have been killed or captured in a decade-long, military-led campaign. Kelly, one of the main links between Mexico's government and the Trump administration on migration and security cooperation, arrived in Mexico on Wednesday and has held meetings with other top officials, including President Enrique Pena Nieto. He visited a military base outside Acapulco on Thursday to meet Mexico's army and navy chiefs. Kelly discussed the military's efforts to battle drug traffickers and observed the deployment of troops to destroy opium poppy fields, the defense ministry said in a statement. Acapulco, one of Mexico's most famous beach resorts, was once a playground for Hollywood stars but in recent years has been roiled by vicious gang warfare. It is now ranked one of the most murderous cities in the world. The past week has been particularly bloody in Mexico. On Wednesday, at least 14 people were killed in a shootout in the northern state of Chihuahua, while 17 suspected gang members were shot dead by police late on Friday near Mazatlan in Guzman's home state of Sinaloa. Thursday's fight is the worst outbreak of violence inside a Mexican prison since 49 people died early last year in a battle between members of the feared Zetas drug cartel and rivals at a prison in the northern industrial city of Monterrey.

Among the raft of data, market analysts will closely watch the May industrial production figures due at 0930 GMT, expected to show 0.4 percent growth on a monthly basis. In April, industrial output grew at a tepid 0.2 percent, far lower than expectations. Sterling was 0.1 percent lower at $1.2954 in early trade. Last week, it posted its biggest weekly rise in eight months after a number of policymakers spoke out in favour of a rate hike. Surveys of purchasing managers this week pointing to a cooling economy have put some pressure on the pound this week, but it is still less than a cent away from nine-month highs reached against the dollar in May.  If industrial production does not grow compared with the April level then Q2 will see this sector become a drag on overall growth, and the same is true of construction,  RBC Capital Markets strategists wrote in a morning note.  With the April industrial production and construction weak, now may turn out not to have been the best time for some of the MPC to have turned hawkish,  they said. Sterling managed to hold on to chunky gains notched up against the Japanese yen in early trades as the Bank of Japan expanded its purchases of government bonds, easing monetary policy at a time when British policymakers are debating tightening.     The BOJ said it would buy an unlimited amount of bonds, as it sought to put a lid on domestic interest rates pushed higher by the broad sell-off in developed market bonds.

It was the first time that reserves had climbed for five months in a row since June 2014. Economists polled by Reuters had expected foreign exchange reserves to rise by $6 billion to $3.06 trillion in June. China tightened rules on moving capital outside the country in recent months as it sought to support the yuan currency and stem a slide in its foreign exchange reserves. It burned through nearly $320 billion of reserves last year but the yuan still fell about 6.5 percent against the dollar, its biggest annual drop since 1994. The yuan has been solid against the dollar in recent weeks amid tighter capital controls and broad-based weakness in the greenback.

The lender plans to launch a new wealth management unit in Japan at the start of the business year beginning April 2018, and targets 50 billion yen ($439.95 million) in annual operating profit within four to five years, Muneaki Tokunari told Reuters. MUFG's foray into wealth management comes as profitability at Japan's banks is pressured by negative interest rates and tepid corporate demand for cash during a period of weak economic growth. The new wealth management business will operate under the MUFG brand leveraging the expertise of U.S. bank Morgan Stanley, of which the Japanese lender is the single largest shareholder with a 23.4 percent stake, Tokunari said.  We would introduce some wealth management knowledge and expertise from Morgan Stanley, because they have successfully expanded their wealth management business (in the United States),  he said.  We have seconded many young recruits to Morgan Stanley to get some hints, to get some expertise from their wealth management business.  MUFG and Morgan Stanley already have a flourishing securities brokerage joint venture in Japan, stemming from a $9 billion lifeline the Japanese lender provided the Wall Street bank at the height of the financial crisis at the end of the last decade. Tokunari said the new wealth management business would mainly target MUFG's existing small and mid-sized corporate clients, offering investment products and solutions. Private wealth rose 1.1 percent last year in Japan to $14.9 trillion, and is likely to reach $16.2 trillion by 2021, showed consultancy BCG's latest Global Wealth Market report. Of the total, 59 percent is in the form of cash and deposits representing significant opportunity for wealth managers to channel dormant funds into investments, analysts said. $1 = 113.6500 yen Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Christopher Cushing","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/mufg-asia-idUSL4N1JY23R"},

U.S. monthly payrolls data is due on Friday and economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 179,000 jobs in June, above May's gain of 138,000. Investors are focused on wage growth and whether spending by U.S. consumers will be strong enough to back the U.S. Federal Reserve's intention to further tighten policy. Bets that the world's major central banks are moving closer to unwinding ultra-loose monetary policies have roiled markets and European Central Bank minutes released on Wednesday indicate its policymakers are open to further steps. This sent German government bond yields to 18-month highs, lifted the euro and weighed on stocks.  Once again, bond markets are ruling FX and having an increasing impact on equity markets,  strategists at Morgan Stanley, led by Hans Redeker, said, drawing parallels with moves seen in 2013 during the so-called  taper tantrum,  when Fed signals about withdrawing liquidity hit markets. MSCI's gauge of global stocks was at its lowest since late May's record highs and down 0.6 percent for the week. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies and hit a seven-week high against the yen after the Bank of Japan increased its government bond buying, expanding monetary policy when other central banks are moving towards tightening. The BOJ said it would purchase an unlimited amount of bonds, as it sought to put a lid on domestic interest rates pushed higher by the broad sell-off in developed market bonds. In commodity markets, Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading down 1.2 percent, at $47.55 per barrel. Oil prices are down more than 16 percent this year, muddying the outlook for inflation expectations globally.

Average house prices in the period were 2.6 percent higher than a year earlier, slowing from a 3.3 percent increase in May, Halifax said on Friday. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a 3.1 percent rise. Britain's housing market has slowed sharply since last June's vote to leave the European Union, when prices were growing by almost 10 percent a year. The slowdown contributed to a fall in consumer confidence in a survey published last month. In June alone, house prices fell by 1.0 percent from May, compared with a median forecast of growth of 0.2 percent in the Reuters poll. Halifax's survey contrasted with that of another mortgage lender, Nationwide, which said last week that house prices rebounded in June after three months of falls. Bank of England figures published last week showed the number of mortgages approved and net mortgage lending picked up a bit of speed in May. Martin Ellis, an economist with Halifax, said consumer prices rising faster than wages were putting pressure on the finances of many households.  This, combined the new stamp duty on buy-to-let and second homes in 2016, appears to have weakened housing demand in recent months,  he said.  A continued low mortgage rate environment, combined with an ongoing acute shortage of properties for sale should help continue to underpin house prices over the coming months.

Alarmed by North Korea's latest missile tests and claims that its newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) can carry a large nuclear warhead, Ward believes it is time to refurbish the tunnels as civilian shelters in case of a North Korean attack.  We've had wake-up calls before but what happened on July 3 is shaking us out of bed,  said Ward, referring to Pyongyang's latest missile test. North Korea's state media said the missile reached an altitude of 2,802 km (1,741 miles), and some Western experts said that meant it might have a range of more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles), which would put Hawaii and Alaska within striking distance. Americans from the Alaskan tundra to the tropics of Hawaii have had years to contemplate North Korea's accelerating missile program, which has generated both angst and shrugs given that the reclusive government's true capabilities and intentions remain unknown. Ward, a Republican in a Democratic-majority state, said he supports reviving state legislation that would reopen the bunkers built by the U.S. military even before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that prompted U.S. entry into World War Two. The tunnels are among many military bunkers and batteries carved into Oahu as part of a buildup that began after Hawaii became a U.S. territory in 1898 and continued through World War Two. If Hawaiians have a stronger sense of vulnerability stemming from Pearl Harbor, then some Alaskan seem largely unperturbed. Doyle Holmes, a retired U.S. Navy pilot and hardware store owner who lives about 50 miles (80 km) north of Anchorage, sums up his advice to fellow Alaskans this way:  Go back to sleep and don't keep worrying about it.  Holmes, 79, a Republican Party activist who retired in March from the Alaska State Defense Force, said his attitude is rooted in his abiding faith in the U.S. military's ability to counter any attempt by North Korea to strike American soil. An overview of Diamond Head crater seen from the National Guard command center in Diamond Head Crater in Honolulu, Hawaii, July 6, 2017.Hugh Gentry It would be self-annihilation if they launch a missile at the United States,  Holmes said.  I think we are going to be OK. I went through the nuclear fallout classes and the bomb shelter stuff in the 1950s and 1960s,  he said, referring to U.S. preparations for a potential Cold War-era Soviet attack that never came. Last week the U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee proposed $8.5 billion of funding for the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland, regional and space missile defenses. Some of this would pay for 28 missile interceptors to augment 32 already at a base in Fort Greely, Alaska, a Hill staffer said. The department already had plans to place 40 interceptors at the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) battery by the end of 2017. Slideshow (9 Images)Some experts on Northeast Asian political and security issues believe political leaders and the media have been too quick to qualify North Korea as a nuclear power, questioning whether it can genuinely delivery a functional nuclear warhead with accuracy or whether North Korea would risk certain U.S. retaliation. But Denny Roy, a senior fellow with the East-West Center think tank in Honolulu, said the public discourse had definitely changed with the latest episode.  The milestone is that Americans seem to believe that North Korea can hit the U.S. homeland, whereas up until now it was all theoretical and potential,  Roy said. Hawaiians are mindful that the islands could make an enticing target given their large concentration of U.S. military power, including the Pacific Command responsible for U.S. forces in Asia.  I'm not building a bunker yet, but we definitely have to stay vigilant,  said Reece Bonham, 24, a retail manager in the city of Kailua-Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii.  Caelen McHale, 21, a University of Hawaii business management major, was skeptical of North Korea's claims and confident in U.S. military power, but still worried how the United States might respond.  Our administration is scarier than North Korea's,  she said.

Security Council statements have to be agreed by all 15 members. The Russian mission to the United Nations said it had proposed amendments to the U.S. draft. It was not immediately clear if the United States would continue to negotiate with Russia in an effort to reach a council consensus on a statement. Moscow's resistance to defining Pyongyang's missile launch as long-range does not augur well for Washington's planned push to impose new U.N. sanctions on North Korea. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday that she plans to propose new measures in coming days. Moscow has said it believes North Korea fired an intermediate range ballistic missile on Tuesday, while China has not identified the rocket launched. North Korea said it tested an ICBM and the United States said that was likely true.  The rationale is that based on our (Ministry of Defense's) assessment we cannot confirm that the missile can be classified as an ICBM,  Russia's U.N. mission said in an email to its Security Council colleagues.    Therefore we are not in a position to agree to this classification on behalf of the whole council since there is no consensus on this issue,  the email said. Haley on Wednesday denounced Russia's reluctance to recognize that North Korea had test-launched an ICBM, which some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii.   If you need any sort of intelligence to let you know that the rest of the world sees this as an ICBM, I'm happy to provide it,  she told the Security Council on Wednesday. Possible Sanctions Haley did not give details on what sanctions would be proposed, but outlined available options. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.  The international community can cut off the major sources of hard currency to the North Korean regime. We can restrict the flow of oil to their military and their weapons programs. We can increase air and maritime restrictions. We can hold senior regime officials accountable,  Haley told the council meeting. Diplomats said Washington proposed such options to Beijing two months ago, but that China had not engaged in discussions on the measures and instead only agreed to adding some people and entities to the existing U.N. sanctions list in June. Following a nuclear weapons test by North Korea in September, while U.S. President Barack Obama was still in office, it took the U.N. Security Council three months to agree strengthened sanctions. It was not immediately clear how long U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was prepared to negotiate with China and Russia on possible new U.N. sanctions. Trump has threatened to use trade to pressure Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea and U.S. officials have said the United States might seek unilaterally to sanction more Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, especially banks.

Austria sued Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium, including Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Leonardo , in February, alleging deception and fraud linked to a near 2 billion euro ($2.3 billion) jet order in 2003. Airbus and the consortium have denied the accusations. The charges were the latest in a series of rows between Austria and the consortium, which have sparked two parliamentary inquiries and resulted in Airbus boss Tom Enders being investigated by Vienna prosecutors. The defence ministry said in a statement that Austria's 15 Eurofighter jets could be phased out from 2020. The continued use of the Eurofighter planes for 30 years - the normal life span of such jets - would cost up to 5 billion euros. Buying and operating a new fleet comprised of 15 single-seater and three twin-seater supersonic jets over the same period could be 2 billion euros cheaper than continuing its current programme, the ministry said.  It is necessary to get a grip on the overflowing costs of the Eurofighter,  Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said. The ministry said it had already been in touch with other governments, air forces and aircraft producers. Austria prefers a government-to-government deal that would see Vienna lease the aircraft from another country, rather than organising a tender that would take much longer and might jeopardise the 2020-2023 timeframe for the change of fleet. Such a government-to-government deal could involve the other country buying the jets from one of its national producers whose planes have self-defence systems, radar-guided missiles and can operate at night and at supersonic speed.

Economic output in the euro zone country is still below levels prior to the financial crisis of 2008 due to a string of problems including the decline of Nokia's former phone business and a recession in neighbouring Russia. Preliminary data from the national customs office showed the value of Finnish exports in May at 5.5 billion euros ($6.3 billion) and the value of imports at about 5.3 billion euros. From January exports were up 18 percent compared to last year.  These are strong numbers. It's the first time since 2010 that monthly exports break the 5.5 billion threshold, and only the second time since 2008 , said economist Juhana Brotherus from Hypo Bank. The figures were boosted by a cruise ship delivery from Meyer Turku shipyard to TUI cruises, unit of TUI AG, worth around 500 million euros. Both Finland's finance ministry and the central bank lifted their economic forecasts in June, citing recovering exports. The ministry expects Finnish GDP to expand 2.4 percent this year, while Bank of Finland forecasts growth of 2.1 percent. But many banks are more optimistic, expecting growth of around 3 percent.

With the biggest data set-piece of the month -- the U.S. non-farm payrolls report -- due at 1230 GMT, most currencies traded in tight ranges. The yen was the outlier, with the dollar gaining over half a percent against the Japanese currency to hit 113.835 yen, its strongest since May 16. The BOJ said it would buy an unlimited amount of bonds, as it sought to put a lid on domestic interest rates pushed higher by the broad sell-off in developed market bonds.  (T)hey’ve said they’re going to stick to their yield target and they proved today that’s what they’ll actually do,  said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt.  But the market seems to be speculating increasingly that central banks will change their monetary policy to become more restrictive, and there was even some speculation that...maybe the BOJ would also turn to this path.  The dollar edged up on Friday against its broad index and was on track for weekly gains, though investors were unlikely to push the upside significantly as they braced for the labour market data, following some downbeat jobs figures overnight. Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. employers to have added 179,000 jobs last month, above May's relatively small gain of 138,000. The dollar was bolstered by higher U.S. Treasury yields which rose even after the uninspiring jobs and service sector data, amid concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin unwinding its bond holdings sometime this year. Minutes from the Fed's June meeting released on Wednesday showed that some policymakers wanted to announce the beginning of the central bank's reduction of its massive debt portfolio by the end of August, but others wanted to wait until later in the year. The euro was flat at $1.1420, not far from 14-month highs of $1.1445 touched last week. European Central Bank policymakers are open to a further step towards reducing their monetary stimulus but are likely to move slowly out of fear of causing market turmoil, minutes of their last meeting showed on Thursday. Faster economic recovery in the euro zone is giving the ECB room to pare its extraordinary stimulus measures, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Thursday.

Its aggressive bond buying operations sent most Japanese government bond yields lower and weakened the yen. It also marked a reversal in the recent slow and stealth tapering of the bond buying operation central to its easy monetary policy.  The BOJ has sent a very strong signal that they are committed to the yield curve control policy and they are not coming to the global tightening party. The reward has been a lower currency,  said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB in Sydney. The BOJ's announcement followed a spike in 10-year Japanese government bond yields to 0.105 percent, its highest since early February and significantly higher than the zero percent it targets for that maturity under its yield-curve-control policy. The spike was in parallel to the steep rise in German, U.S. and other European bond yields over the past week and a half, spurred by concerns global central banks are moving toward reducing stimulus.  It had its origins in a string of hawkish messages from the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, furthered on Thursday by minutes from the European Central Bank's latest meeting showing it could be open to scrapping its bond-buying pledge.  The Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes this week suggested it may also soon begin paring back its large bond holdings in the coming months. But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda had said in March that it was possible the central bank won't increase its bond yield targets even as overseas long-term interest rates rise. Powerful Weapon To ensure it had a stronger shield in case increased buying was not enough, the BOJ employed its most powerful weapon -- of unconditional buying at specific yield -- only for a third time after it started its yield curve control policy in September. In a special market operation on Friday, the BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at a yield of 0.110 percent.  This came on top of an increase in the size of its regular auction-based purchase of five to 10-year maturities to 500 billion yen from the previous 450 billion yen. A Japanese flag flutters atop the Bank of Japan building in Tokyo, Japan June 16, 2017.Toru Hanai The BOJ showed its strong determination to keep the 10-year yield around zero percent and not to let it rise above 0.10 percent,  said Koichi Sugisaki, strategist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. Following the BOJ's operation announcement the 10-year yield fell to 0.085 percent while expectations of widening in yield differentials with other countries sent the yen down to 113.835 to the dollar, its lowest in a month and a half. The BOJ's offer of unlimited buying drew no selling because the market quickly recovered on the announcement, enabling any sellers to offload JGBs at better prices in the market, rather than to the BOJ. But Friday's increase in bond buying went against the central bank's attempts in recent months to reduce its massive debt purchases.  The BOJ has been slowing the pace of its bond buys as its holdings of JGBs have already topped 40 percent of the entire market, threatening the smooth functioning of the bond market. To avoid running out of JGBs to buy and for its stimulus policy to be sustainable, many analysts say the BOJ will need to further reduce the pace of its bond buying in future.  Former BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai told Reuters on Friday the Bank of Japan should steadily proceed with an  implicit tapering  of its bond purchases as any rise in yields would be temporary.  Shirai said the central bank may temporarily accelerate purchases of JGBs to contain rises in bond yields, but won't have to buy huge amounts to cap yields around its zero percent target. The BOJ has said it is aiming to increase its bond holdings by about 80 trillion yen a year. But in reality, the pace has been slowing substantially already to below 70 trillion yen by June. If the current pace of buying continues, the annual increase in its bond portfolio is expected to fall below 60 trillion yen this year. But Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics in Singapore, said:  We expect U.S. 10-year yields to climb further to 3.0 percent by year-end so chances are that the BOJ will have to conduct additional fixed purchase operations in coming months.  Takuji Okubo, principal and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors, thinks the impact of Friday's operation may not last long.  If the global bond market continues to sell off, there will come a time when the BOJ starts to feel it alone cannot hold off the tide any more and it could cause a nasty turbulence,  he said.

Euro zone growth is picking up but underlying inflation is still weak, so the European Central Bank should adjust its policy carefully and flexibly to avoid abrupt market moves, ECB board member Benoit Coeure told two European newspapers. Those comments followed a day of heavy selling that saw yields across the bloc jump as much as 12 basis points. Minutes from the ECB's latest policy meeting released on Thursday showed policymakers are open to a further step towards reducing their monetary stimulus. That has added to a growing perception that major central banks are looking to begin stepping away from their ultra-easy policy stance. On Friday, Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was flat around 0.57 percent, but held above the 0.50 percent milestone breached on Thursday that catapulted it to 18-month highs. In the space of just over a week Bund yields have doubled, with German bonds bearing the brunt of selling in euro zone debt markets.  The market is unlikely to keep selling off without fresh information...But sentiment remains bearish,  said Orlando Green, European fixed income strategist at Credit Agricole. Most other euro zone bond yields were also largely flat on the day, while Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds yields touched two-month highs. Jitters about tighter monetary policies from major central banks have rippled throughout global markets, hurting stocks and supporting the euro. U.S. Treasury yields rose on Thursday on the prospect of hawkish global central bank policies and concern that rising oil prices could spur inflationary pressures. Focus was expected to turn to U.S. non-farm payrolls data later in the day. The 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield initially reached 0.105 percent on Friday, its highest since February, before slipping back after the Bank of Japan said it would buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs. The BOJ aims to keep the 10-year JGB yield  around zero percent .

Overseas investors' holdings of Chinese treasury bonds rose 20 billion yuan ($2.94 billion) in June, bringing their total holdings of the securities to 449 billion yuan, according to Reuters' calculations based on data from China Central Depository and Clearing Co (CCDC), the official bond clearing house. Foreign investors increased their holdings of all types of Chinese debt by 29.1 billion yuan in June to 803.7 billion yuan. The purchases mean foreign holdings of Chinese debt increased 24.8 billion yuan from January through the end of June, compared with a net decrease of 4.2 billion yuan through the end of May. Market watchers say that relatively high yields on Chinese government bonds and moves by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to reduce expectations of yuan depreciation make the onshore market increasingly attractive to foreign investors.  On the currency side, we are getting more constructive,  said Pheona Tsang, head of fixed income at BEA Union Investment Management, highlighting the PBOC's introduction in late May of a  counter-cyclical  factor to determine the yuan's daily fixing.  Besides this, I think the fundamental factors are also more constructive. We see the slowing of capital outflows as well as fading U.S. dollar strength.  Yields on benchmark 10-year Chinese government bonds were at 3.592 percent on Monday, up 93 basis points from lows hit in late October 2016, but down 11 basis points from recent highs in May. The yuan rose 2.4 percent against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 2017. The increase in foreign bond holdings in June comes as China takes steps to internationalise its debt market. Earlier this week, its Bond Connect programme launched its initial  Northbound  phase, which allows overseas participants to invest in China's onshore bond market.

A mother, shattered by the gang rape of her teenage step-daughter and disillusioned by the criminal justice system, sets out for revenge. Sridevi plays Devaki, a school teacher who lives with her businessman husband Anand, their daughter Priya and step-daughter Arya (Sajal Ali). Arya isn’t fond of her step-mother and all of Devaki’s attempts to reach out to her are met with a surly stare. Their lives are plunged into turmoil when Arya is raped by four men, who are eventually let off for lack of evidence. Arya’s hostility towards Devaki only increases because she somehow holds her responsible for what happened to her. This somehow turns Devaki into a cold-blooded vigilante. With the help of buck-toothed private sleuth DK (Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a wig and with a lisp), she tracks down the four men and proceeds to destroy their lives. The screenplay, by Girish Kohli, leaves no room to explore Arya’s state of mind and how she struggles to deal with the trauma. Devaki makes it all about her – her sense of victimhood and need for revenge. Dashing police detective Matthew Francis (Akshaye Khanna) has his suspicions about what Devaki is up to, but apart from asking her a couple of awkward questions, he does nothing even though there are so many gaping holes in the latter’s modus operandi. Udyawar seems to be egging on his protagonist to be as blood-thirsty as she can be, and making Devaki’s revenge the catalyst for Arya’s change of heart towards her – almost as if murdering someone is the ultimate act of love for a parent. For all its narrative flaws, “Mom” does have some plus points, especially cinematographer Anay Goswami’s frames. The scenes leading up to Arya’s rape and the aftermath are some of the best in the movie. For her part, Sridevi plays the role of the protective mother with panache – never going overboard with the melodrama.  In her first full-fledged role after the much-loved “English Vinglish” in 2012, she proves that she is the embodiment of the new age Bollywood mother – willing to kill anyone who has wronged her family instead of meekly accepting what life hands out.

The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.1 percent, to 3,655.93 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2 percent to 3,217.96 points. For the week, CSI300 eased 0.3 percent, while SSEC gained 0.8 percent. While there were some concerns that global central banks might be moving toward tighter policy, Yang Hai, an analyst at Kaiyuan Securities, said the current tightenings by the Federal Reserve and possibly the European Central Bank later would have a limited impact pact on the China market. The mood has generally been cautious ahead of a raft of Chinese data in coming weeks, which is expected to show steady growth though government measures to rein in the housing market and debt risks are likely to drag on activity over the next few quarters.  Slower credit growth and higher funding costs due to supervisory tightening are expected to have an effect on fixed-asset investment and activities later in the year,  economists at UBS said in a research note. During the week, a wider quota for Hong Kong institutional investors and a cabinet paper promoting the use of commercial pension money in capital markets lifted sentiment, as those moves are expected to bring more long-term funds into the stocks market. While some doubt the bull run in blue chips will continue amid a correction, many analysts see little risk of a major downturn in firms with solid fundamentals. For the week, the top performing resources sector advanced 4.3 percent, posting its fifth straight week of gains, underpinned by expectations of greatly improved profitability, helped by an industry recovery and a weaker dollar. On the other hand, the defensive consumer sector slumped 4.4 percent for the week, its worst in 1-1/2 years after a robust rally this year, as investors rotated into other sectors with relatively lower valuations. $1 = 6.8013 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Luoyan Liu and John Ruwitch; Editing by Shri Navaratnam","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-stocks-close-idUSZZN2R2400"},

Mayweather hung up his gloves in 2015 with a 49-0 record but the 40-year-old American will return to the ring for a lucrative 12-round boxing match against Irish mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor in Las Vegas next month. Reports of a fight between former world light-welterweight champion Khan and Mayweather often surfaced in the media but the bout never materialized as neither camp came close to the negotiating table. Despite plenty of criticism within boxing, the 30-year-old Khan feels the crossover fight between Mayweather and McGregor will be positive for the sport, which he feels has lost ground to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) MMA promotion.  It's a business fight, one,  Khan told Reuters.  Two, what's going to happen now is it's between boxing and MMA.   At the moment, MMA and UFC is doing so many great numbers on TV, on pay-per-view. Boxing is doing OK but it took little bit of a dip. We are not getting the good pay-per-view numbers we used to.   For now to combine both sports together is going to be great for the sport of boxing (more) than MMA.  We hit a wall and we didn't really do anything. Boxing never moved forward around the world, whereas MMA kept moving forward and got bigger and bigger and bigger. Boxing kind of stalled in my opinion and we needed something like this.  Undefeated middleweight world champion Gennady Golovkin has dismissed the bout as a 'circus show' but Khan disagrees with the Kazakh fighter.  You have to respect everybody that goes into the ring, you have to respect everybody who puts the gloves on. You have to fight in front of millions... not easy,  the Briton said in an interview. Khan, who won a silver medal as a lightweight at the 2004 Athens Olympics, is also hopeful that Mayweather's return could ultimately lead to a long-awaited showdown between the two men. Nov 12, 2016; New York, NY, USA;  Conor McGregor (blue gloves) celebrates after defeating Eddie Alvarez (red gloves) in their lightweight title bout during UFC 205 at Madison Square Garden. Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports When he beats McGregor, which I think he will, that fight can still be there. It really can happen,  Khan (31-4) said.  There's still some big fights out there for me, Mayweather, (Manny) Pacquiao...  'Pacquiao Didn't Lose'  Khan was slated to fight eight-division world champion Pacquiao in the United Arab Emirates earlier this year but that deal fell through over money problems.  The Filipino instead took on little-regarded Australian Jeff Horn in Brisbane last weekend and suffered a stunning controversial points loss to the former schoolteacher.  I don't think Pacquiao lost, he lost on paper,  Khan said.  This is boxing, it's happened to me, it's happened to many fighters. You can't sulk about it. You just have to go back, have the rematch and beat him.   We all know Manny is the better fighter. I just think he should have gone in there and knocked him out. Because sometimes fighting somebody in their own backyard is quite difficult to win with the advantages he has.  Khan also did not rule out securing a bout against Pacquiao in the future.  Maybe the Pacquiao fight will happen later, it's all about timing,  he said.  Maybe Manny Pacquiao didn't feel confident to take the fight with me this time, maybe he will take it next time.  Khan has not fought since May 2016, when he moved up two divisions to take on middleweight Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, a sixth-round knockout loss that he admits was a mistake he would not be repeating any time soon.  It's now all about making the right choices for me, making sure I don't take fights that I don't need... like going up two weight categories,  he said.   It was a mistake. But if you have to do something which is not ordinary, you have to go do something crazy. That would have taken me to a different level. So you have to take big risks. But it can be damaging for your career.  Khan was in Mumbai to promote the franchise-based Super Boxing League which runs from July 7 to Aug. 12, will be televised live by Sony ESPN and is backed by the World Boxing Council (WBC).

A report by Reuters published on July 5 cited three sources with knowledge of the delivery as saying Russia had delivered electricity turbines made by Siemens to Crimea. Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and the region is subject to European Union sanctions barring EU firms from supplying it with energy technology.  We have no credible evidence about actual deliveries of our turbines to Crimea. However, we are taking these rumors seriously and have put in place a task force team to investigate the matter that is working diligently to clarify the facts,  Siemens said in a statement. Reuters was unable to determine if Siemens knew of or condoned the equipment transfer, but the move exposes the German company to potential accusations of indirect sanctions-busting and of not taking sufficient safeguards to ensure its equipment does not end up on territory most countries view as illegally annexed, say legal experts.  If there were any re-routings of recently purchased turbines to Crimea, it would constitute a clear violation of contractual agreements. Siemens has repeatedly alerted its customer that Siemens complies with all export control restrictions,  the company said.   Siemens has taken all possible legal and will take operational measures to prevent the equipment from being used in an unlawful way, e.g. it will not provide any deliveries or services for installation, commissioning support or warranty. We will continue to fully cooperate with all stakeholders.  Delivery of the turbines, intended for the two new power stations under construction in Crimea, has been delayed for over a year because the firms involved feared violating EU sanctions, people involved in the project have told Reuters.

LG, the world's No.2 television maker by sales behind Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, reported a preliminary April-June profit of 664 billion won ($574.49 million), versus a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate of 755 billion won from a poll of 18 analysts. Revenue likely rose 3.9 percent to 14.6 trillion won, the firm said, also lower than the 15.1 trillion won SmartEstimate.   It's likely that the mobile division's losses were well over 100 billion won, while profitability for both the television and appliances businesses were a bit weaker than what we had anticipated,  Dongbu Securities analyst S.R. Kwon said.  The firm's shares extended their losses following the weaker-than-expected guidance and closed down 4.2 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent fall for the broader market.  While LG did not elaborate on its forecasts, analysts said its mobile business probably saw an operating loss for a ninth straight quarter due to subdued sales and increased marketing costs for its new G6 flagship smartphone launched in March. Some analysts also said display panel prices have remained elevated during the second quarter, undermining margins for the TV business.      Earlier in the day, Samsung reported its best-ever quarterly profit, beating expectations and putting it on track for record annual earnings on the back of a memory chip super-cycle. Seasonally weaker sales of home appliances in the second half of the year could hurt LG's earnings, but year-on-year growth is expected in the third quarter, analysts said. LG's vehicle components business could turn to profit later this year, some added.

The surprisingly bullish figures are the latest in a batch of strong data that are likely to help Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservatives burnish their economic credentials before a Sept. 24 federal election in which she will seek a fourth term. Industrial output jumped by 1.2 percent on the month in May, data from the Economy Ministry showed. That was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and easily beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a 0.3 percent gain. The upturn was driven by a surge in energy production and factories producing more capital and consumer goods.  The trend in the industrial sector is clearly pointing upwards,  the ministry said, adding that the upswing in manufacturing had broadened since the beginning of the year. The bright picture was also mirrored in the less volatile three-month comparison: Industrial output rose by 2.1 percent from March to May, with construction jumping by 6.1 percent.  The sector is now set to grow by 2 percent in the second quarter - we haven't seen anything like this since 2010,  Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said. The output data comes on the heels of bullish sentiment indicators such as the Ifo index, which showed business morale hit a record high in June. A survey among purchasing managers released this week suggested German manufacturing growth reached its highest level in more than six years in June as orders surged. Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said the data supported expectations that the German economy accelerated sharply in the second quarter after expanding by 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year.  This may lead to stronger calls for policy tightening by the ECB from some quarters, but the Bank will remain wary of the lack of inflationary pressure elsewhere in the euro zone and the potential impact of any hawkish signals on financial markets,  she said. Data published on Thursday had shown strong foreign demand raised industrial orders in May, though the increase was less pronounced than expected.

Among them, it sold its external IT operations and a portfolio of properties last year and expects to sell its largely military Governmental Sales unit later this year. Volvo said the capital gain from the divestment of shares in Deutz would be booked in the third quarter. The truck maker reports second-quarter results on July 19.

A report by Reuters published on July 5 cited three sources with knowledge of the delivery as saying Russia had delivered electricity turbines made by Siemens to Crimea. Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and the region is subject to European Union sanctions barring EU firms from supplying it with energy technology.  We have no credible evidence about actual deliveries of our turbines to Crimea. However, we are taking these rumors seriously and have put in place a task force team to investigate the matter that is working diligently to clarify the facts,  Siemens said in a statement. Reuters was unable to determine if Siemens knew of or condoned the equipment transfer, but the move exposes the German company to potential accusations of indirect sanctions-busting and of not taking sufficient safeguards to ensure its equipment does not end up on territory most countries view as illegally annexed, say legal experts.  If there were any re-routings of recently purchased turbines to Crimea, it would constitute a clear violation of contractual agreements. Siemens has repeatedly alerted its customer that Siemens complies with all export control restrictions,  the company said.   Siemens has taken all possible legal and will take operational measures to prevent the equipment from being used in an unlawful way, e.g. it will not provide any deliveries or services for installation, commissioning support or warranty. We will continue to fully cooperate with all stakeholders.  Delivery of the turbines, intended for the two new power stations under construction in Crimea, has been delayed for over a year because the firms involved feared violating EU sanctions, people involved in the project have told Reuters.

The surprisingly bullish figures are the latest in a batch of strong data that are likely to help Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservatives burnish their economic credentials before a Sept. 24 federal election in which she will seek a fourth term. Industrial output jumped by 1.2 percent on the month in May, data from the Economy Ministry showed. That was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and easily beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a 0.3 percent gain. The upturn was driven by a surge in energy production and factories producing more capital and consumer goods.  The trend in the industrial sector is clearly pointing upwards,  the ministry said, adding that the upswing in manufacturing had broadened since the beginning of the year. The bright picture was also mirrored in the less volatile three-month comparison: Industrial output rose by 2.1 percent from March to May, with construction jumping by 6.1 percent.  The sector is now set to grow by 2 percent in the second quarter - we haven't seen anything like this since 2010,  Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said. The output data comes on the heels of bullish sentiment indicators such as the Ifo index, which showed business morale hit a record high in June. A survey among purchasing managers released this week suggested German manufacturing growth reached its highest level in more than six years in June as orders surged. Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said the data supported expectations that the German economy accelerated sharply in the second quarter after expanding by 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year.  This may lead to stronger calls for policy tightening by the ECB from some quarters, but the Bank will remain wary of the lack of inflationary pressure elsewhere in the euro zone and the potential impact of any hawkish signals on financial markets,  she said. Data published on Thursday had shown strong foreign demand raised industrial orders in May, though the increase was less pronounced than expected.

LG, the world's No.2 television maker by sales behind Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, reported a preliminary April-June profit of 664 billion won ($574.49 million), versus a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate of 755 billion won from a poll of 18 analysts. Revenue likely rose 3.9 percent to 14.6 trillion won, the firm said, also lower than the 15.1 trillion won SmartEstimate.   It's likely that the mobile division's losses were well over 100 billion won, while profitability for both the television and appliances businesses were a bit weaker than what we had anticipated,  Dongbu Securities analyst S.R. Kwon said.  The firm's shares extended their losses following the weaker-than-expected guidance and closed down 4.2 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent fall for the broader market.  While LG did not elaborate on its forecasts, analysts said its mobile business probably saw an operating loss for a ninth straight quarter due to subdued sales and increased marketing costs for its new G6 flagship smartphone launched in March. Some analysts also said display panel prices have remained elevated during the second quarter, undermining margins for the TV business.      Earlier in the day, Samsung reported its best-ever quarterly profit, beating expectations and putting it on track for record annual earnings on the back of a memory chip super-cycle. Seasonally weaker sales of home appliances in the second half of the year could hurt LG's earnings, but year-on-year growth is expected in the third quarter, analysts said. LG's vehicle components business could turn to profit later this year, some added.

In a move aimed at stemming a rise in yields, the central bank on Friday offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at a yield of 0.110 percent and also increased its buying of five- to 10-year JGBs through an auction to 500 billion yen from 450 billion yen. The market then trimmed the losses as the weakened yen supported overall sentiment, but investors moved past the decision and focused on major global events before the market closed. The Nikkei dropped 0.3 percent to 19,929.09, the lowest closing point since June 15. For the week, the Nikkei dropped 0.5 percent. A sharp sell-off in both U.S. and European shares overnight sapped investors' risk appetites. Wall Street retreated after disappointing labour market data clashed with the possibility of a more hawkish Federal Reserve. Markets are focused on U.S. jobs data due out later in the day. Investors also remain cautious with rising yields in Europe on bets the European Central Bank is moving ever closer towards unwinding its massive monetary stimulus.  There are fears about the end of lose monetary policy in the global market,  said Isao Kubo, equity strategist at Nissay Asset Management. Fridays notable losers domestic-demand sensitive stocks such as real estate firms and construction companies. Mitsui Fudosan Co and Mitsubishi Estate Co dropped 2.3 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. Kajima Corp shed 2.3 percent and Taisei Corp declined 1.3 percent. Also keeping investors on the back foot is simmering tension in the Korean peninsula after North Korea's launch this week of what it said was a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile. Before the G20 summit on the weekend, Japan, the United States and South Korea agreed to push for China to play a larger role in reining in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, said the geopolitical risks have cast a cloud over the Japanese market for now, with the Nikkei's put-call ratio - viewed as an indicator of investor sentiment - rising since earlier this week. The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of traded put Nikkei options by the number of traded Nikkei call options.  The rising put-call ratio reflects investors' cautious stance in the market, which reminds us about the geopolitical tensions in the region in the spring,  Kagawa said.

And the organization, aiming for its fourth division title since 2012, lost the public-relations battle that flooded the internet after the Nationals delayed the start of the game by 3 hours, 5 minutes for a downpour that never came. In fact, it didn't rain at all for most of the delay. Despite waiting nearly three hours to begin his warmups for a second time, right-handed starter Mike Foltynewicz picked up the victory, and Freddie Freeman collected his 1,000th career hit as the Atlanta Braves beat the Nationals 5-2.  It was right up our alley; we are used to that,  said Foltynewicz, noting the Braves have had several rain delays at home this year.  It is bad luck with the weather. Thankfully we got the game in. We will go from there.  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker wasn't quite as enamored with the delay, noting he heard very little from the Nationals during that time.  That was a first for me,  he said of the no-rain delay.  It has been a long couple of days for us. We got to bed at 5 (a.m. Thursday). It is what we do. There is nothing you can do about it.  To make matters worse for the Nationals, center fielder Michael A. Taylor left the game in the fourth inning with a mild oblique strain and is expected to go on the 10-day disabled list. The Nationals will bring back Chris Heisey from the DL, according to manager Dusty Baker. Related CoveragePreview: Braves at NationalsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatch It felt like a sharp pain in my side,  Taylor said.  I've kind of been dealing with it for a couple weeks now. I'm just trying to manage it. And then on that swing, that made it even worse.  Some speculated that with a weak bullpen, the Nationals didn't want to risk starter Gio Gonzalez getting pulled after a rain delay and then having to use relievers. As it was, the game was not halted once it began at 10:10 p.m. Atlanta's Ender Inciarte, who ended up with two hits, tweeted during the delay:  This No-Rain delay is something i've never seen before!!  The Nationals were taken to task on twitter, including by Braves broadcaster Chip Caray. There were a few hundred fans in the stands when the game ended. The Columbus Clippers, a Triple-A team in the International League, tweeted out a photo that read:  This is what a rain delay looks like  with the tarp covering a very wet field. Back in the majors, Freeman went 2-for-5 and drove in two runs, and Kurt Suzuki added two hits, including a home run, and scored twice for Atlanta. Foltynewicz (7-5) gave up two runs on eight hits in six innings. Suzuki hit a solo homer in the sixth to give the Braves a 3-2 edge off Gonzalez (7-4), who gave up three runs on seven hits in six innings. Gonzalez said of the delay,  That's not the excuse. I should have pitched better. I should have pitched a better game.  Freeman had an RBI double off reliever Sammy Solis to make it 4-2 in the seventh. It was the milestone hit for Freeman, who is batting .345 this season, though he missed seven weeks due to a broken left wrist. Nick Markakis hit another RBI double off Solis later in the inning for a 5-2 bulge. The second-place Braves (41-43) are 8 1/2 games behind the first-place Nationals (50-35), who had won three in a row. Relievers Sam Freeman, Jose Ramirez and Jim Johnson each pitched a scoreless inning for Atlanta. Johnson earned his 19th save, getting the last out with a runner on base and Bryce Harper on deck. Washington leadoff man Brian Goodwin had three hits, including a homer, and Ryan Zimmerman, Wilmer Difo and Anthony Rendon added two hits apiece. Johan Camargo also had two hits for the Braves. The Nationals took a 1-0 lead in the second as Rendon led off with a double and eventually scored on a sacrifice fly by Difo. Freeman had an RBI single to tie the game at 1 in the third. Atlanta took its first lead at 2-1 in the fourth as Suzuki had a leadoff double and scored on a single by Camargo. Goodwin homered on an 0-2 pitch to tie the game at 2 in the fifth.  That was a new one for me,  Goodwin said of the delay without rain.  Just do everything you can to stay prepared. They tell you you've got a chance to play, so you keep that in the back of your head and just run with it. It's not easy. You kind of have to prepare before you even hit the field, think about it in here. As long as you can keep it locked in here, then it's not so bad once you get out on the field.  NOTES: Washington RHP Max Scherzer (10-5, 1.94 ERA) and Atlanta RHP R.A. Dickey (6-5, 4.44) are scheduled to start Friday. ...

Ajay Tyagi, the straight-talking new chairman of the country's securities regulator, is cracking down on the fast-growing corporate bond market following a spate of scandals. With a large chunk of new issues coming from companies in dubious financial health, it is wise to force the market to raise standards. Tough new rules now require rating agencies to collect a monthly confirmation from issuers that they have not delayed any interest or principal repayment. This follows a recent debacle at Anil Ambani's Reliance Communications; the company only formally announced a reprieve from lenders well after the share price of the telco tanked and local newspapers had already reported its repayment woes. Rating agencies were slow to act too. The Securities and Exchange Board of India will publish a broader discussion paper on these issues in the coming month. Action is necessary. After years of sluggish volumes, new corporate debt issuance by Indian companies rose 57 percent in the first six months of the year, Thomson Reuters data shows. At the current pace, the annual total could hit a record $70 billion in 2017. One reason for the uptick is that banks are stressed and are lending less. At the same time there is a flood of liquidity as India’s rising middle class are putting more savings into conventional financial products instead of hard assets like gold and real estate.  Graphic: Indian nascent corporate debt market is growing fast: reut.rs/2tXgPmS Unfortunately the money is ending up in questionable places. One issue is that better quality industrial names are not tapping the fixed income market as India’s capital expenditure cycle has yet to pick up. Instead the majority of debt issuance in the full year ended March came from financial companies with deteriorating health, according to brokerage Ambit Capital. This includes riskier perpetual instruments that can convert into the equity of stressed public sector lenders. These issues themselves are also securing too generous ratings.  Tyagi was earlier part of a high-level committee that recommended measures to help develop the corporate bond market, so he is well-positioned to beat the nascent industry into shape. Forcing companies to become more transparent and making credit rating agencies more vigilant is critical to ensure the sustainability of any long-term diversification of funding sources for India Inc.

Core machinery orders are seen rising 1.7 percent in May from the previous month following a 3.1 percent drop in April, the Reuters poll of 17 economists found. The highly volatile data series is regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months. Analysts say a pickup in the global economy and a weaker yen should underpin core machinery orders, as companies enjoying strong earnings continue to spend on equipment. Those signs were evident in some recent solid data, helping bolster the world's third-biggest economy. The latest Bank of Japan's survey showed confidence among Japan's big manufacturers hit its highest level in more than three years in the June quarter.  In the longer term, however, business spending might remain uneven due to uncertainty over U.S. trade policies. Concerns persist about President Donald Trump's pledge to adopt protectionist trade policies, which could hurt Japan's export-driven economy.   There is an increasing demand for capital spending for labor-saving equipments due to labor shortage,  said Takumi Tsunoda, Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.  But some companies, especially small and medium-sized ones, retain their cautious stance on investment.  Compared with a year ago, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric power utilities, jumped 7.7 percent in May after a 2.7 percent gain in April. The Cabinet Office will release the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Monday (Sunday 2350 GMT). Data on the current account balance, which will be released at the same time as machinery orders, is expected to show a surplus of 1.796 trillion yen  ($15.81 billion) in May, from 1.95 trillion yen in April. The surplus is mainly seen from gains in the income balance, lifted by earnings from Japanese subsidiaries overseas thanks to a weaker yen and a strong global economy. The Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, was tipped to show an annual 2.1 percent rise in June. The data will be released on Wednesday. Reporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Shri Navaratnam","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-machinery-idUSKBN19S0RD"},

I had a lot more anxiety before going out to pitch,  Blackburn said.  I took a lot of deep breaths.  That seemed to work. The Oakland right-hander scattered eight hits in 7 2/3 innings for his first major league victory as the Athletics defeated the Seattle Mariners 7-4 Thursday night at Safeco Field. The rookie, who was acquired from Seattle in an offseason trade for first baseman Danny Valencia, walked one and didn't strike out a batter. The only run he allowed came on a solo homer by Mitch Haniger.  Your first start is kind of an out-of-body experience, and then your second start is about performance,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He throws the ball where he wants to and mixes his pitches. There's something to be said for that. It's not always about velocity. It was a really, really good performance from him.  The Athletics (38-48) earned their third consecutive win after snapping a season-high, six-game losing streak. Valencia hit a three-run homer, his ninth of the season, off A's reliever Daniel Coulombe with one out in the bottom of the ninth for the final margin. Seattle (41-46) took its eighth straight home defeat. Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at MarinersOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch Not much to say about that ballgame,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  We've got to figure it out.  Blackburn, who gave up only one unearned run on three hits in his debut Saturday against the Atlanta Braves but didn't get a decision, retired the side in order only once Thursday. He allowed hits in the first three innings but got double plays in each.  I'll definitely take a double play over a strikeout every inning,  Blackburn said. The Mariners put two runners on in the fifth before Blackburn induced cleanup hitter Nelson Cruz to ground into a fielder's choice to end the inning.  Everything was working for him,  A's catcher Bruce Maxwell said of Blackburn.  He's a bulldog on the mound. He made pitches the whole night. That's his game. He doesn't throw 98 (mph), but he keeps hitters off balance.  His first big league win, and I'm glad I got to catch it.  Blackburn (1-0) was replaced after allowing a two-out double to Segura in the eighth. Left-hander Coulombe came on to induce an inning-ending groundout from Ben Gamel, who entered the game as the American League's leading hitter. The A's struck early against Seattle starter Sam Gaviglio (3-4), scoring three runs in the first inning. Matt Joyce led off with a single, Marcus Semien walked, and Yonder Alonso, Oakland's All-Star representative, hit a run-scoring double down the right field line. An out later, Jed Lowrie smacked a two-run double to right-center field. It was Semien's first game since April 15, when he sustained a fractured scaphoid bone.  We talked about this when Marcus was coming back, and guys were really excited about it,  Melvin said.  Just ... looking at the lineup now, you know, it gets pretty deep. And there just seemed like there was good symmetry to it. And to get off to a good start where we score three runs right away ... guys were all talking about it in the dugout.  It was an exciting inning for getting Marcus back and moving some guys around a little bit and getting some production.  Oakland extended the lead to 7-0 in the fifth. Semien led off with a single and stole second. Following a walk to Alonso, Khris Davis hit his 24th home run of the season, a three-run shot to right field. Lowrie singled but was erased on a double play, and then Bruce Maxwell hit his first homer, a solo shot. It was easily the worst of Gaviglio's nine career starts. The rookie right-hander lasted just 4 2/3 innings, the first time he failed to make it through the fifth. He gave up seven runs on nine hits, including the two home runs. He walked three and struck out six, which matched his career high. The Mariners snapped the shutout on Haniger's homer with two outs in the bottom of the fifth.  Sam Gaviglio was not sharp,  Servais said,  and offensively we didn't get much going at all.  NOTES: Bob Melvin earned his 500th win as Oakland's manager. He is 500-495 with the A's, 993-1,003 overall in 14 seasons as skipper of the Mariners, Arizona Diamondbacks and Oakland. ... Seattle SS Jean Segura went 4-for-4 with a double, his fourth four-hit game of the season. ... Mariners RHP Yovani Gallardo pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings of relief. ... Seattle 3B Kyle Seager snapped an 0-for-14 drought with a single in the second inning. ... The A's placed RHP Jharel Cotton (right thumb blister) on the 10-day disabled list, clearing a roster spot for the return of SS Marcus Semien. ... Oakland LHP Sean Manaea (7-4, 3.75 ERA) is scheduled to face Seattle LHP James Paxton (6-3, 3.27) on Friday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED77PGR8ZX"},

That mentality helped the Los Angeles Dodgers rally for four runs in the ninth inning Thursday to pull out a 5-4 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Chris Taylor's fourth hit of the game scored the winning run, capping the comeback and completing a three-game sweep.  It's kind of been our bread and butter this year,  Taylor said of the ability to rally.  It feels like we're never out of the game.  Arizona closer Fernando Rodney, who blew a save for the fifth time in 26 opportunities, gave up a leadoff single to Yasiel Puig and then walked pinch hitters Joc Pederson and Cody Bellinger to load the bases. Rodney (3-3) walked Logan Forsythe on four pitches to force in a run, and Corey Seager followed with a ground-ball single up the middle to drive in two and tie the score at 4-4. Justin Turner was walked intentionally, and Rodney was removed for T.J. McFarland. Taylor lined the first pitch over the head of drawn-in left fielder Rey Fuentes for the winning run. Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at DodgersArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch I knew he had a good sinker, so I was looking for that pitch, wanted to see it up and not try to do too much with it,  Taylor said.  I've done a good job lately of staying within myself, not over-swinging. I think I fell into that. I was struggling for a couple weeks, and I think I was just trying to do too much. I've done a good job of simplifying my approach lately.  The ninth series sweep of the season moved the first-place Dodgers 5 1/2 games in front of the second-place Diamondbacks in the National League West. Jake Lamb homered twice for Arizona. Lamb, who was selected to his first NL All-Star team earlier in the week, hit a solo shot off starter Rich Hill in the fifth inning and another off reliever Luis Avilan in the eighth, each time giving the Diamondbacks a one-run lead.  Jake has been doing a really good job of working against some lefties and getting himself ready for those moments, and a credit to him and all the hard work he's doing,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  Nobody's paying attention, and he had two big homers and got us in a position to win this game.  Ketel Marte also homered in the eighth off Avilan after entering the game as part of a double switch in the seventh. Arizona starter Robbie Ray matched his career high with 13 strikeouts. He allowed one run on five hits and four walks in six innings, exiting after 106 pitches.  He has explosive stuff,  Taylor said of Ray. After Dodgers reliever Josh Fields balked in a run in the ninth, Rodney came on for the Diamondbacks to protect a 4-1 lead.  My command wasn't there tonight,  Rodney said. Hill left after seven innings, having allowed one run on two hits and no walks. He struck out nine in a 95-pitch outing. Hill blanked the Diamondbacks for 4 1/3 innings before Lamb homered on an 0-2 curveball to give Arizona a 1-0 lead. Ray gave up a homer to Logan Forsythe over the right-center-field fence with two outs in the fifth to tie the game at 1-1. Fields (4-0) allowed one run in one inning but earned the win. Earlier in the day, Turner learned he had won the NL Final Vote into the All-Star Game next week in Miami. Turner beat out Justin Bour of the Miami Marlins, Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs, Anthony Rendon of the Washington Nationals and Mark Reynolds of the Colorado Rockies to become a first-time All Star.  I'll forever be grateful to the Los Angeles Dodgers and their fans for what they did for me this week,  he said before the game. NOTES: Los Angeles LHP Grant Dayton was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a stiff neck, and OF Scott Van Slyke was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City. Van Slyke, who was demoted on May 16 after hitting .122 with two home runs through his first 28 games, pinch-hit to start the seventh inning and walked, but was picked off by C Chris Iannetta for the second out. ... Arizona LHP Rubby De La Rosa was placed on the 10-day DL due to soreness in his pitching shoulder. RHP Jake Barrett was called up from Triple-A Reno.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-dodgers-writethru-idUSMTZED77PHEI06"},

The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also assigned the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by New Lion Bridge Co., Ltd. an expected rating of 'B(EXP)' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR5'. New Lion Bridge is a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) set up to issue the offshore notes on behalf of Lionbridge Capital. The final rating on the proposed notes is contingent on the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. Lionbridge Capital is an investment holding company incorporated in Hong Kong in 2011. Bain Capital is the company's largest shareholder, with an 80% stake, followed by Wisin Capital with 20%. Lionbridge Capital's wholly owned subsidiary, Lionbridge China, which was incorporated in 2012 and headquartered in Beijing, is the main operating subsidiary and accounted for around 97% of the group's assets. Lionbridge China provides truck leasing and equipment finance in China. Receivables from truck leasing and financing for medical, manufacturing and agricultural equipment accounted for 42% and 49% of total lease receivables, respectively. Lionbridge Capital had total assets of around CNY9.5 billion at end-2016 (including Lionbridge China's CNY9.2 billion). KEY RATING DRIVERS IDR Lionbridge Capital's 'B+' IDR reflects the group's credit profile on a consolidated basis, given the high integration between Lionbridge Capital and Lionbridge China and limited capital control restrictions on funds flowing between the two companies as Lionbridge China is a foreign-funded leasing company. The rating reflects the company's short operating history, high reliance on wholesale funding, weak profitability and higher leverage than other leasing companies rated by Fitch. The ratings also take into account its focus on the niche truck leasing market, its franchise within the sector, as well as the limited maturity gap between its receivables and debt, and cash flow generation of its leased assets. Lionbridge Capital has been fine-tuning its business strategy over its short operating history. The company shifted its focus from equipment finance to the niche truck leasing sector, particularly to retail customers who are mainly freelance truck drivers working in the shipping and logistics industry. The credit profile of retail customers is traditionally weaker than that of corporate or institutional customers, but in this case, the drivers' repayment ability is supported by robust demand for their services, which is driven by the rapid growth of logistics support for the booming online shopping industry. The company has not yet experienced an economic downturn, so the sustainability of its business model is yet to be tested. Receivables also benefit from a liquid secondary market for trucks, which supports the recovery process in case of lease defaults, with the recovery rate averaging 85%. In addition, the average term for Lionbridge Capital's truck lease is about two years, which underpins cash flow compared with other leasing companies. As with other leasing companies, Lionbridge Capital is highly reliant on wholesale funding, which is more sensitive to market conditions. In addition, the company has high levels of encumbered assets and secured debt, which limits the flexibility of its funding and liquidity profile and may reduce resources available to make payments on its unsecured debt. The issuer has sought to diversify its sources of funding and access the Chinese domestic bond market, including issuing asset-backed securities (ABS) in China and a five-year yuan-denominated bond listed on the Shanghai Exchange in 2016. Lionbridge Capital's total assets increased at CAGR of around 60% over 2014-2016, outpacing the increase in internal capital generation. As a result, the company's leverage, measured by its debt-to-tangible common equity ratio, rose to 5x at end-2016, which is higher than that of most of its Fitch-rated peers. The company's profitability is also low due to high operating costs. We expect the company's leverage to remain high given its expected asset growth and modest profitability. Profitability is unlikely to improve significantly, even though the company has shifted towards higher-yielding truck leasing, because we expect tighter market liquidity conditions in China in 2017. This may raise funding costs and we do not expect the company's cost structure to improve substantially in the short term. Fitch assesses the company's management quality, credit risk systems and risk control measures as adequate. However, the management quality and stability, the efficiency of its underwriting and risk control systems and the sustainability of its financial profile have yet to be proven in an economic downturn. Senior Notes and Recovery Rating The proposed senior unsecured notes issued by New Lion Bridge are guaranteed by Lionbridge Capital and constitute general, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Lionbridge Capital. The proceeds will be used to refinance existing debt, supplement working capital and for other general corporate purposes. The notes will rank pari passu with Lionbridge Capital's other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, and be subordinated to secured debt of Lionbridge Capital and all debt obligations of Lionbridge China. The issuer also has options to redeem and repurchase notes. If there is a change of control event, where Bain Capital's shareholding in Lionbridge Capital drops to below a certain level and the bond rating is downgraded, the issuer or the guarantor will be required to offer to purchase all the outstanding notes above the face value. The notes are rated one notch below the company's Long-Term IDR, with a Recovery Rating of 'RR5', which reflects the below-average recovery prospects. This is because the debt issued by New Lion Bridge is structurally subordinated to the debt of Lionbridge China and recovery of Lionbridge Capital's equity investment in Lionbridge China will be limited in the event of liquidation as all the operating assets are on Lionbridge China's books. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDR, Senior Notes and Recovery Rating Positive rating action may arise if Lionbridge Capital can demonstrate the sustainability of its business model and financial profile through business cycles, as well as its ability to consolidate its franchise in the niche truck leasing market. Improvement in the company's funding and liquidity profile, including securing a stable funding pool, strengthening its liquidity reserve and further closing the maturity gap between its lease receivables and debt could result in a rating upgrade. Negative rating actions may result if the company's liquidity and funding profile and cash flow deteriorate to the extent that the negative maturity gap between its lease receivables and debt widen significantly. A substantial shift in its business model, increased risk appetite or a severe capital market dislocation that disrupts the company's funding could lead to a downgrade. The rating on the notes is sensitive to the same factors that drive Lionbridge Capital's IDR as it is the guarantor. In addition, the ratings on the notes would be sensitive to changes in the Recovery Rating, which depends on the size of the issuance relative to the guarantor's unencumbered assets and the underlying quality of these assets. The note rating will also depend on how Lionbridge Capital downstreams the proceeds to Lionbridge China. Any change in the mix of debt and shareholder loans at Lionbridge China that is materially different from our expectations and that reduces the recovery rate significantly will cause a rating downgrade.

GPIF on Friday reported a return of 5.86 percent in the year, on assets worth 144.9 trillion yen. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 12.8 percent last fiscal year, helped by the Bank of Japan's aggressive purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF). Global stocks also benefitted from continuing loose monetary policy, with central banks around the world keeping rates close to all-time lows. GPIF made a return of 14.89 percent on its Japanese stock holdings, and 14.2 percent on its foreign stock holdings. In 2014, GPIF made a major policy shift, increasing investments in riskier assets such as stocks for higher returns, while it reduced its reliance on low-yielding domestic bonds. Japanese stock holdings accounted for 23.28 percent of GPIF's assets, while domestic bonds made up 31.68 percent. The pension fund allocated 23.12 percent to foreign stocks and 13.03 percent to foreign bonds. The remaining 8.89 percent was held mainly in cash. Its Japanese bond portfolio made a negative return of 0.85 percent, while foreign bond holdings returned a negative 3.22 percent as yields rose, pushing bond prices down. GPIF said it had owned shares in 2,207 companies through March, while its Japanese bonds were mostly in JGBs. $1 = 113.7000 yen Reporting by Junko Fujita; Editing by Jacqueline Wong","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/gpif-japan-idUSL4N1JY1SJ"},

The S&P;/ASX 200 index dipped about a percent or 55.16 points to 5,703.60 at the close of trade. The declines were broad-based, with nine out of 10 sectors in the red. The benchmark was down 0.3 pct for the week. Wall Street fell after data showed U.S. private employers had hired fewer workers than expected in June and applications for unemployment benefits last week rose for a third straight week, pointing to some loss of momentum in job growth. Financial stocks were the biggest drag on the Australian index with the  Big Four  banks - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - all slipping. Sentiment in the market was also dented by oil prices which fell by more than 1 percent with U.S. crude futures dipping below $45 per barrel as news of a spike in U.S. production added to earlier reports that OPEC output was also on the rise. Oil major Woodside Petroleum closed down 2.6 percent. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index edged down 0.1 percent or 7.48 points to finish the session at 7,622.13. Telecom sector was the biggest drag, hurt by Spark New Zealand which fell more than 1 percent.

Erdogan accuses the protesters, marching from Ankara to Istanbul, of  acting together with terrorist groups , referring to Kurdish militants and followers of a U.S.-based cleric who Ankara says was behind last year's coup. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), hit back on Tuesday, defending his  justice march  and accusing the government of creating a one-party state in the wake of the failed putsch on July 15. On the 20th day of his march, triggered by the jailing of a CHP deputy on spying charges, Kilicdaroglu signed an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights against the election board's decision to accept unstamped ballots in the April 16 referendum.  Turkey has rapidly turned into a (one-)party state. Pretty much all state institutions have become branches of a political party,  he told reporters.  This is causing profound harm to our democratic, parliamentary system.  Kilicdaroglu, 68, wearing a white shirt and a baseball cap with the word 'justice' printed on it, then set out on the latest leg of the march from the city of Izmit, around 100 km (60 miles) along the coast to the east of central Istanbul. The protest has gained momentum as it passes through northwest Turkey's countryside and representatives of the pro-Kurdish HDP, parliament's third largest party, joined the march on Monday near the jail of its former co-leader Figen Yuksekdag. There are deep divisions among opposition parties but Yuksekdag, stripped of her parliamentary status in February, issued a statement from her cell on Monday calling for them to put those differences aside.  We must set up the shattered scales of justice again and fight for this together,  she wrote, saying justice had hit  rock bottom  with the jailing of 11 HDP lawmakers and around 100 mayors. Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu walks during the 19th day of a protest, dubbed  justice march , against the detention of the party's lawmaker Enis Berberoglu, near Kocaeli, Turkey, July 3, 2017.Umit BektasThe party rejects charges of ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, designated a terrorist group by Ankara and its Western allies, which launched an insurgency in 1984 in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.   Terror Group  Accusations As the protesters advance, Erdogan has stepped up his attacks on the march, saying the CHP was longer acting as a political opposition. Slideshow (2 Images) We can see that they have reached the point of acting together with terror groups and those powers which provoke them against our country,  he said in a speech to officials from his ruling AK Party on Saturday.  The path which you are taking is the one of Qandil, the one of Pennsylvania,  he said, referring to the northern Iraqi mountains where the PKK is based and the U.S. state where Erdogan's ally-turned-foe Fethullah Gulen lives. Kilicdaroglu launched his march in Ankara on June 15 after Enis Berberoglu was jailed for 25 years for espionage, becoming the first lawmaker from the party imprisoned in a government crackdown in the wake of the attempted coup. Since the purge began, more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial, 150,000 have been suspended or dismissed from their jobs. Ankara has also shut down 130 media outlets and some 160 journalists are in prison, according to union data. In April a referendum was held on constitutional changes that sharply widened Erdogan's presidential authority and the proposals won 51.4 percent approval in a vote, which has triggered opposition challenges including the latest CHP move. Opposition parties have said the poll was deeply flawed and European election observers said the decision to allow unstamped ballot papers to be counted had removed a main safeguard against voting fraud.

The detentions came less than a month after a court ordered the arrest of the chairman of Amnesty's Turkey branch, Taner Kilic, on the same charge in a crackdown following an attempted military coup in July 2016. Kilic remains in jail pending trial. Amnesty Turkey Director Idil Eser and the others were removed from a meeting they were holding at a hotel on Buyukada, an island just south of Istanbul, and taken to various police stations across Turkey's largest city on Wednesday evening, a lawyer for some of the detainees, Bahri Belen, told Reuters. Belen said prosecutors had decided on a seven-day detention period, which needs to be approved by a judge. Police were not immediately available for comment, but Belen said an explanation might come on Friday when the activists are transferred from the police stations to Istanbul's police headquarters. Amnesty International’s Secretary General Salil Shetty described the accusations against the 10 people, who were attending a workshop on digital security and information management, as absurd.  Their spurious detention while attending a routine workshop was bad enough: that they are now being investigated for membership of an armed terrorist organization beggars belief,  Shetty said in a statement. Eser and seven other human rights campaigners were detained along with two foreign trainers – a German and a Swedish national, Amnesty said. In an earlier statement, it also said the hotel's owner had been detained. u.s., Eu Express Concern The United States is  deeply concerned  by the arrests, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.  As with past arrests of prominent human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and activists, we underscore the importance of respecting due process and individual rights, as enshrined in the Turkish Constitution, and consistent with Turkey's own international commitments,  Nauert said.  More voices, not fewer, are necessary in challenging times.      Since the failed putsch a year ago, Turkey has jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with terrorist groups. The purge, which has also led to the closure of some 130 media outlets and jailing of 150 journalists, has alarmed Turkey's Western allies and rights groups, who say President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn, in Turkey on Thursday to discuss its performance in European Union accession talks, said he had raised the detentions with Turkish officials.  ... (But) I didn't get a sufficient answer about it. We will continue to follow this,  he told a news conference at Ankara airport. Hahn also said he had stressed the need for Turkey to respect the rule of law and the right of people to a fair trial. More than 240 people were killed in last year's coup attempt, and the government has said the security measures are necessary because of the gravity of the threats facing Turkey. Amnesty Turkey's chairman was detained in early June with 22 other lawyers over alleged links to the network of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for the failed coup.  If anyone was still in doubt of the endgame of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown, they should not be now,  Amnesty's Shetty said.  There is to be no civil society, no criticism and no accountability in Erdogan’s Turkey.

A spot in the fourth round would match his previous best showing at the All England Club but Nishikori believes this year he can  win the whole thing  to become Asia's first male grand slam singles champion. The 27-year-old has defeated his third-round opponent in all four of their previous meetings, winning 6-2 6-4 in their most recent clash on the hard courts of the Miami Masters last year. Spaniard Bautista Agut may be more at home on clay but, like his heroes David Ferrer and Juan Carlos Ferrero, never gives up without a fight and Nishikori will have to earn a victory on Court Three.  Nishikori has been in fine form in the tournament so far, though, breezing through his opening clash with Marco Cecchinato 6-2 6-2 6-0 in a baseline masterclass before dispatching dangerous Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky 6-4 6-7(7) 6-1 7-6(6). One of Nishikori biggest battles at the championships may be with his own body, however.  Injuries - variously affecting his calf, hip and ribs - have forced him to pull out of the last five grasscourt tournaments he has contested going back to 2015, including his Wimbledon fourth round tie last year and at Halle in Germany last month. The former world number four, however, said he was happy with his level of fitness coming into the year's third major.  I'm feeling very good, feeling 100 percent again,  he said earlier this week.  I hope I can stay healthy.  So will the legion of Japanese fans who have given him a hero's welcome at matches this week.

The dollar has taken a beating in 2017 as economic growth and inflation in the United States has not taken off as previously thought, and President Donald Trump's reflationary policies have hit a series of political obstacles.  The outlook for the dollar is less bullish than at the beginning of the year...given that the fiscal stimulus has not yet materialized and that the likelihood of any announcement in the second half of the year looks limited,  said Roberto Cobo Garcia, FX strategist at BBVA. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against a basket of currencies, has lost nearly 6 percent this year, marking its weakest performance for the first half of a year in well over a decade. While Reuters foreign exchange polls this year have predicted the dollar to strengthen slightly, the latest poll of around 70 strategists taken over the past week showed the outlook has broadly dimmed. A majority of strategists, 43 of 71, who answered an extra question said their dollar outlook was less bullish now compared with the beginning of the year. Seventeen said they were more bearish, only five said they were more bullish, and the remaining six strategists said they were less bearish. Speculators have also cut bets in favor of the dollar. Net long positions fell to their lowest in a year, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and calculations by Reuters. Policy Diverging Less? Improving economic growth in Europe and Canada has opened the door for a shift in monetary policy. Hints from both the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada that may happen soon have ramped up those expectations. Pushing in the opposite direction, Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how the lack of it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises.  The policy divergence trade, which created a significantly stronger dollar, is looking less and less well-grounded,  said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.   We could see less policy divergence going forward between the Fed and other central banks and that should encourage further reversal of dollar strength.  But some strategists struck a more positive note.  Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole CIB, argued that the shift in central banks' focus away from inflation and instead towards growth should help the dollar.  Several G10 central banks have dropped their easing bias of late while the Fed has remained committed to its tightening cycle. This has given rise to the FX convergence trade where investors buy currencies with an improving growth outlook and ignore their challenging inflation outlook.   (The dollar) remains a reliable long - the 'cash cow' of the convergence trade – and it should benefit from an improving U.S. growth outlook  in the second half of this year,  added Marinov in a note to clients. Euro Flavor Favored The euro has gained around 8 percent against the dollar in 2017 so far. It is predicted to hold onto those gains over the coming 12 months, trading at around $1.13, roughly where it is now, and in one and 12 months' time. That 12-month view is the strongest euro bet since a January 2015 Reuters foreign exchange poll, the month when the ECB announced that it would start buying bonds on a monthly basis. A little over half the common contributors compared with the previous month have upgraded their 12-month euro view. At the beginning of 2017, there were several forecasters calling for the euro to crash below parity to the dollar, but not a single strategist in the latest poll expects that to happen over the coming year. That is mostly thanks to ECB President Mario Draghi's more upbeat assessment on the euro zone economy. However, Reuters polls over several years have been clear that a fall below parity wasn't likely.  There is further scope for recent EUR trends to extend, but this is contingent on how ongoing ECB rhetoric unfolds from here,  noted Daniel Hui, executive director of global FX strategy at J.P. Morgan.  While EUR/USD is already very close to our year-end target of 1.15, this is not necessarily a hurdle, given that the strength in the pair is as much a manifestation of broad USD weakness, given the extreme subdued pricing for the Fed.

But they were evenly split on how views on the pound against the euro had changed, with an equal number becoming more or less bearish. There was a similar trend as to whether they were more or less bullish.  A lot of the reflationary expectations that were built into the dollar at the end of last year have been revised lower,  said Jane Foley at Rabobank.  Markets are no longer expecting (U.S. President Donald) Trump's 3 percent growth forecast to come to fruition.  We weren't forecasting that the euro zone economy would be as strong as it has been this year. We had some euro strength but not enough,  said Foley, who is now more bearish on sterling against the euro. Britons voted last June to leave the European Union, and as Reuters polls predicted beforehand, the pound fell after the referendum. A year later, sterling is still down around 10 percent against the dollar and 13 percent against the euro. But it is not expected to weaken much more.  Median forecasts in a Reuters poll of around 60 strategists taken in the past week predicted the pound would be little changed from current levels at $1.29 in a month, dip to $1.28 by end-September and then to $1.27 six months later. Those spot predictions were little changed from a June poll. Against the single currency, the pound is expected to barely move over the forecast horizon. Forecasts are one euro will be worth 88.00 pence through 2017 and 88.25p in a year's time. Soon after the referendum, the Bank of England cut interest rates and restarted its quantitative easing program to support an economy expected to slump. But until recently at least, the economy has fared better had been feared. However, sterling's slide since the vote has driven inflation well above the Bank's 2 percent target, and last month three of the Bank's eight monetary policymakers voted for a rate increase.  In the medium term, the BoE's lower tolerance for inflation means downside room for UK real yields is now much more limited. This means downside room for sterling is also more limited,  Jordan Rochester and Yujiro Goto at Nomura said in a note. One of the three policymakers has since left the BoE and few economists expect the central bank to tighten monetary policy anytime soon. Instead, they are waiting to see how the EU divorce talks progress. There has so far been little clarity on that front. After Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June, what approach the UK government will take to Brexit negotiations is even less clear.

Merkel, who is campaigning for a fourth term, can ill afford the images of chaos and disharmony that dominated news coverage of the summit. The summit, which starts in earnest on Friday, is a chance for her to polish her diplomatic credentials but would be disastrous if marred by widespread violence. She met U.S. President Donald Trump for an hour on Thursday evening, but less than an hour later police clashed with anti-capitalist demonstrators near the summit venue, firing water cannons and pepper spray at hundreds of black-clad protesters after they threw bottles. Nearly 75 police officers were injured throughout the evening, with three requiring treatment in hospital, police said. The pilots of a police helicopter sustained eye injuries when laser pointers were directed at them, police said. Protesters damaged cars, set other objects ablaze and threw bottles in roving clashes that lasted until midnight. A Reuters eyewitness saw at least one protester with blood on his face being treated.   Welcome to Hell  was the protesters' greeting for Trump and other world leaders arriving for the two-day meeting. Merkel has taken a high-risk gamble by choosing to hold the summit in the northern port city of Hamburg, partly to show the world that big protests are tolerated in a healthy democracy. Before meeting Trump, she struck a consensual tone, holding out hope for agreement on the divisive issue of climate policy and pledging to broker compromises. She promised to represent German and European interests at the summit, but added: Related Coverage'Welcome to hell' - protesters vow to disrupt G20 summitTrump says 'never give up' when asked about U.S. relationship with China On the other hand, as hosts we - and I - will do all we can to find compromises.  Trump faces a testy confrontation at the summit with leaders of the other big Group of 20 economies after deciding last month to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate deal.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel cited  many commonalities  on foreign policy after a meeting that included Merkel, Trump, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Trump family members and advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. But he told German broadcaster that  clear differences  on climate change and trade continued to divide the two allies. Merkel said there were  various options  that could be discussed, noting that nearly all other G20 countries besides the United States stood by the accord. U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrive for the G20 leaders summit in Hamburg, Germany July 6, 2017.Axel SchmidtAs the leaders began holding informal meetings, thousands of protesters from around Europe, who say the G20 has failed to solve many of the issues threatening world peace, poured into Hamburg to join the main demonstration. Police expected around 100,000 protesters in the port city, some 8,000 of whom are deemed by security forces to be ready to commit violence. At least 13,000 protesters joined the main march on Thursday, including around 1,000 black-clad and masked  anarchists, police said. Up to 20,000 police officers from across Germany are on hand. Delicate Balance As summit host, Merkel must seek consensus among the G20 leaders not only on the divisive issue of climate policy but also on trade - an area fraught with risk as Trump pursues his 'America First' agenda. Slideshow (19 Images)Indonesian finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said Merkel must be careful not to allow acrimony to undermine the summit.  There is quite a delicate balance that Angela Merkel will have to navigate in a way, because it is not clear that being confrontational won't just create even more of a credibility problem for G20 cooperation,  she told Reuters. Merkel earlier said she was committed to an open international trading system, despite fears of U.S. protectionism under the Trump administration.   We're united in our will to strengthen multilateral relations at the G20 summit ... We need an open society, especially open trade flows,  Merkel said in Berlin. She and Trump discussed G20 themes, North Korea, the Middle East, and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, according to German and U.S. government officials. Later, Merkel met with Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan, who this week sharply criticized the German government's rejection of  his plans to address Turkish citizens outside the G20 event. Trump, who earlier in Poland called again on NATO partners to spend more on defense and said he would confront the threat from North Korea, will also meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time on the sidelines of the summit. Their meeting, scheduled for Friday, will be closely watched at a time when mutual ties remain strained by U.S. allegations of Russian election hacking, Syria, Ukraine and a U.S. dispute over Trump associates' links to Moscow. Ahead of the meeting, Putin threw his weight behind the Paris accord.  We see the Paris Agreement as a secure basis for long-term climate regulation founded on international law and we want to make a comprehensive contribution to its implementation,  he told German business daily Handelsblatt.

The ECB has already begun to adjust its stance when it cut asset buys last year but given weak inflation there is no reason now to change strategy, Coeure told France's Le Monde and Italy's La Stampa in a joint interview. ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door to policy tweaks last week, sending bonds yields and the euro sharply higher as markets now expect the central bank to announce a tweak of asset buys as soon as September.  If needed, the Governing Council will continue to adjust its instruments both qualitatively and quantitatively,  Coeure was quoted on Friday as saying.  But when this is needed, it should do so carefully and flexibly, and based on what matters for us within the framework of our mandate: the inflation outlook.   We must be transparent in our communications on these developments,  he said.  Otherwise we run the risk of a more abrupt adjustment for the markets when the decisions are actually taken.  Coeure noted that while growth is accelerating and becoming broad based, this was mostly a result of ultra-easy ECB policy, not yet backed up with structural policies that would sustain the expansion.  The recovery has finally arrived. It has spread to virtually all sectors and countries. This is excellent news,  Coeure said.  But it would be unwise to let our guard down, because this recovery is of a cyclical nature and builds on significant support from monetary policy.  But Coeure also warned euro zone governments, which enjoyed ultra-low borrowing costs, that cheap financing may be coming to an end.  The increase in long-term interest rates is the result of consolidating growth. Governments and financial players must prepare themselves for it. They are aware of that,  he added.

The dollar has taken a beating in 2017 as economic growth and inflation in the United States has not taken off as previously thought, and President Donald Trump's reflationary policies have hit a series of political obstacles.  The outlook for the dollar is less bullish than at the beginning of the year...given that the fiscal stimulus has not yet materialized and that the likelihood of any announcement in the second half of the year looks limited,  said Roberto Cobo Garcia, FX strategist at BBVA. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance against a basket of currencies, has lost nearly 6 percent this year, marking its weakest performance for the first half of a year in well over a decade. While Reuters foreign exchange polls this year have predicted the dollar to strengthen slightly, the latest poll of around 70 strategists taken over the past week showed the outlook has broadly dimmed. A majority of strategists, 43 of 71, who answered an extra question said their dollar outlook was less bullish now compared with the beginning of the year. Seventeen said they were more bearish, only five said they were more bullish, and the remaining six strategists said they were less bearish. Speculators have also cut bets in favor of the dollar. Net long positions fell to their lowest in a year, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and calculations by Reuters. Policy Diverging Less? Improving economic growth in Europe and Canada has opened the door for a shift in monetary policy. Hints from both the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada that may happen soon have ramped up those expectations. Pushing in the opposite direction, Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers were increasingly split on the outlook for inflation and how the lack of it might affect the future pace of interest rate rises.  The policy divergence trade, which created a significantly stronger dollar, is looking less and less well-grounded,  said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.   We could see less policy divergence going forward between the Fed and other central banks and that should encourage further reversal of dollar strength.  But some strategists struck a more positive note.  Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole CIB, argued that the shift in central banks' focus away from inflation and instead towards growth should help the dollar.  Several G10 central banks have dropped their easing bias of late while the Fed has remained committed to its tightening cycle. This has given rise to the FX convergence trade where investors buy currencies with an improving growth outlook and ignore their challenging inflation outlook.   (The dollar) remains a reliable long - the 'cash cow' of the convergence trade – and it should benefit from an improving U.S. growth outlook  in the second half of this year,  added Marinov in a note to clients. Euro Flavor Favored The euro has gained around 8 percent against the dollar in 2017 so far. It is predicted to hold onto those gains over the coming 12 months, trading at around $1.13, roughly where it is now, and in one and 12 months' time. That 12-month view is the strongest euro bet since a January 2015 Reuters foreign exchange poll, the month when the ECB announced that it would start buying bonds on a monthly basis. A little over half the common contributors compared with the previous month have upgraded their 12-month euro view. At the beginning of 2017, there were several forecasters calling for the euro to crash below parity to the dollar, but not a single strategist in the latest poll expects that to happen over the coming year. That is mostly thanks to ECB President Mario Draghi's more upbeat assessment on the euro zone economy. However, Reuters polls over several years have been clear that a fall below parity wasn't likely.  There is further scope for recent EUR trends to extend, but this is contingent on how ongoing ECB rhetoric unfolds from here,  noted Daniel Hui, executive director of global FX strategy at J.P. Morgan.  While EUR/USD is already very close to our year-end target of 1.15, this is not necessarily a hurdle, given that the strength in the pair is as much a manifestation of broad USD weakness, given the extreme subdued pricing for the Fed.

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu had been asked to interpret a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court that revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning people from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent extremist attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Watson said in Thursday's ruling he  declines to usurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court to interpret its own order.  Hawaii said late on Thursday it would appeal against Watson's ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, according to a court filing. The Justice Department said in a statement it was pleased with the ruling.  We are confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will again vindicate the president and his constitutional duty to protect the national security of the United States,  it said. The government said after last month's Supreme Court ruling that a  bona fide relationship  meant close family members only, such as parents, spouses, fiancés, siblings and children. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would still be banned. The state of Hawaii asked Watson last week to clarify the Supreme Court's ruling, arguing the government's definition of  bona fide relationship  was too narrow.  Justice Department lawyers said its definition  hews closely  to language found in U.S. immigration law, while Hawaii's attorney general's office said other parts of immigration law included grandparents as close family. The government reversed its position on fiancés before the ban went into effect last week, saying they could also qualify for exceptions.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week compared to January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

The company made the decision following mounting international criticism of the trade, a Rakuten spokesman said, with trading to be phased out over the next month.  While China has pledged to shut down its domestic ivory trade by the end of this year, ivory imported before 1989 can be legally traded in Japan, with the government denying a link to illegal poaching.   Both the government and e-commerce sellers have been tightening monitoring of sellers, who are legally required to register their stock, amid criticism from wildlife groups that not enough is being done to prevent rule breaking.  Ivory trading continues on Yahoo Japan, the country's biggest online auction site.   We don’t think that the legal ivory trade in Japan has any impact on African elephant numbers,  said a Yahoo Japan spokesman.  It is important to recognize there are cultural differences between different countries,  he added.  Elephant numbers fell 30 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to a census funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, with illegal poaching thought to be the primary reason for the decline.

But they were evenly split on how views on the pound against the euro had changed, with an equal number becoming more or less bearish. There was a similar trend as to whether they were more or less bullish.  A lot of the reflationary expectations that were built into the dollar at the end of last year have been revised lower,  said Jane Foley at Rabobank.  Markets are no longer expecting (U.S. President Donald) Trump's 3 percent growth forecast to come to fruition.  We weren't forecasting that the euro zone economy would be as strong as it has been this year. We had some euro strength but not enough,  said Foley, who is now more bearish on sterling against the euro. Britons voted last June to leave the European Union, and as Reuters polls predicted beforehand, the pound fell after the referendum. A year later, sterling is still down around 10 percent against the dollar and 13 percent against the euro. But it is not expected to weaken much more.  Median forecasts in a Reuters poll of around 60 strategists taken in the past week predicted the pound would be little changed from current levels at $1.29 in a month, dip to $1.28 by end-September and then to $1.27 six months later. Those spot predictions were little changed from a June poll. Against the single currency, the pound is expected to barely move over the forecast horizon. Forecasts are one euro will be worth 88.00 pence through 2017 and 88.25p in a year's time. Soon after the referendum, the Bank of England cut interest rates and restarted its quantitative easing program to support an economy expected to slump. But until recently at least, the economy has fared better had been feared. However, sterling's slide since the vote has driven inflation well above the Bank's 2 percent target, and last month three of the Bank's eight monetary policymakers voted for a rate increase.  In the medium term, the BoE's lower tolerance for inflation means downside room for UK real yields is now much more limited. This means downside room for sterling is also more limited,  Jordan Rochester and Yujiro Goto at Nomura said in a note. One of the three policymakers has since left the BoE and few economists expect the central bank to tighten monetary policy anytime soon. Instead, they are waiting to see how the EU divorce talks progress. There has so far been little clarity on that front. After Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in a snap election in June, what approach the UK government will take to Brexit negotiations is even less clear.

Most Asian currencies have got the better of the dollar which has taken a beating on growing concerns over the U.S. administration's inability to deliver on promises made. The Chinese yuan, a major focal point for global markets in the past few months as authorities scrambled to stabilise it and flush out speculators betting on a steep fall, looked set to end the year in better shape than previously thought. The Taiwan dollar was among the best performers in Asia, up nearly 6 percent this year. The Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollar and Thai baht have gained more than 4 percent. The latest poll consensus of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists surveyed over the past week showed many of the major Asian currencies are likely to hold onto most of their gains made this year over the coming 12 months. That is in contrast to a poll in January, which predicted a steep fall against the dollar on expectations for fiscal stimulus and a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes.  There has been some disappointment in lack of progress in the U.S. in terms of pushing through fiscal reforms and tax reforms, which is one of the reasons why the dollar hasn't done that well,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.  We still do expect a small fiscal package at some point probably in the next year but the market has started to question (President Donald) Trump's ability to get as much done and I don't expect any kind of major fiscal stimulus to help the dollar jump higher.  The Chinese yuan and Indian rupee have gained over 2 percent against the dollar this year, with half of those gains made over the last two months. The yuan is predicted to trade at 6.95 per dollar by the end of this year, compared to 7.2 forecast at the beginning of the year. The Indian rupee is tipped around 65.5 to the dollar by end-2017 compared to 69.5 seen in January poll. While the outlook has definitely brightened for Asian currencies, it is mainly due to the loss of momentum in the dollar with country-specific factors playing second fiddle. Bets in the latest poll have turned less bullish for the dollar as much of the Federal Reserve's policy tightening plan has already been priced-in and the real risk now is that the central bank may be pushed off its path. But a separate Reuters poll on positioning showed speculators trimmed their bullish bets in most of the Asian currencies, even as they increased their long positions in the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht. [ASIA/FXP] The outlook for the regional currencies was also supported by better economic performance and some reforms undertaken in recent months. China's economy grew a solid 6.9 percent in the first quarter on a year earlier, supported by significant government infrastructure spending. A string of curbs on capital outflows by Beijing, and the introduction of a different methodology to calculate the mid-point reference rate for the yuan by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has also helped restore market confidence in the currency.  We have revised our USD/CNY forecast and the reason is that the dollar has not been stronger than we expected. The other reason is the Chinese economy has stabilized and that should be good for CNY,  said Irene Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at ANZ. Separately, the strength in the Indian rupee has been driven in part by confidence the government will likely pass through major reforms and on expectations for better economic growth. The implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) by the government, touted as the biggest tax reform since independence, has bolstered the view on the Indian economy as well as the outlook for its stocks. [EPOLL/IN]   We are still quite constructive on the INR and the reason is reforms,  added ANZ's Cheung.

Japan and Saudi Arabia last October agreed to raise the storage capacity in Okinawa, an island southwest of Japan, from 1 million kl to 1.3 million kl (8.2 million barrels) by the summer of 2017, an official from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said, without commenting on a detailed timetable for the launch of the new tanks. Currently the work is under way to have the additional storage ready at a storage facility in Uruma City in Okinawa prefecture, the official added. Saudi Aramco has stored crude in Okinawa since February 2011 at no cost, and has used the facility to supply oil to China, Japan and South Korea and others. Japan has a similar deal with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), under which ADNOC can store up to 6.29 million barrels (1 million kilolitres) at Kiire oil terminal in Kagoshima, in southern Japan, at no cost. ADNOC does not use the storage for commercial purposes, the trade ministry official said. Japan treats the crude oil stored by Aramco and ADNOC as quasi-government oil reserves, counting half of the barrels as national crude reserves. In return for providing free storage space to them, Japan gets a priority claim on the stockpiles in case of an emergency.

The agency simultaneously affirmed Asahi Life's USD350 million cumulative perpetual subordinated bonds, with interest deferral options issued in January 2017, at 'BB-'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Outlook revision reflects the improvement in Asahi Life's capitalisation and leverage, as well as its resilient financial performance and earnings backed by steady growth in the profitable third (health) sector. The company's financial leverage improved to 37% at end-March 2017 from 42% a year earlier, due to its continued accumulation of core capital and sustained efforts in restructuring its debt. Fitch views financial leverage as the main reason for keeping Asahi Life's ratings in the 'BB' category. However, we expect financial leverage to continue to improve to below 35%, which is the median for the 'BBB' category, within the next 12 to 24 months. Asahi Life's statutory solvency margin ratio (SMR) also improved to 743% at end-March 2017 from 692% a year earlier, mainly because of accumulated capitalisation through an increase in its core capital and a perpetual hybrid debt issuance. Fitch expects the company to maintain or strengthen its capital adequacy through the company's stable underwriting results and its continuous efforts to accumulate core capital. Nevertheless, the insurer's capital position remains weaker than its peers, which had an average SMR of more than 900%. In addition, Asahi Life had a large negative spread burden of JPY62 billion in the financial year ended March 2017 (FYE17) (FYE16: JPY65 billion), which continues to offset gains from better-than-projected mortality and morbidity rates. Fitch expects the insurer's negative spread burden to continue to shrink over the medium term along with declining average guaranteed yields. Asahi Life's underwriting business has been stable due to an effective focus on the third sector. The core profit margin remained adequate at 6% in FYE17. The segment's annual premiums of in-force policies increased by 8% yoy in FYE17, which is stronger than most of its peers, due partly to effective sales promotion via alternative distribution channels. Fitch believes its efforts in marketing third-sector products through alternative distribution channels, such as telephone marketing, are likely to further sustain the segment's strength. RATING SENSITIVITIES Further strengthening of capitalisation and a decline in financial leverage to below 35% on a sustained basis may result in an upgrade. Sustainable growth in the third-sector business while maintaining profitability would also be regarded as positive. A rating downgrade may arise from major erosion of capitalisation, financial leverage above 45%, and a significant deterioration in profitability, such as core profit margin falling below 5%, on a sustained basis.

The ECB has already begun to adjust its stance when it cut asset buys last year but given weak inflation there is no reason now to change strategy, Coeure told France's Le Monde and Italy's La Stampa in a joint interview. ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door to policy tweaks last week, sending bonds yields and the euro sharply higher as markets now expect the central bank to announce a tweak of asset buys as soon as September.  If needed, the Governing Council will continue to adjust its instruments both qualitatively and quantitatively,  Coeure was quoted on Friday as saying.  But when this is needed, it should do so carefully and flexibly, and based on what matters for us within the framework of our mandate: the inflation outlook.   We must be transparent in our communications on these developments,  he said.  Otherwise we run the risk of a more abrupt adjustment for the markets when the decisions are actually taken.  Coeure noted that while growth is accelerating and becoming broad based, this was mostly a result of ultra-easy ECB policy, not yet backed up with structural policies that would sustain the expansion.  The recovery has finally arrived. It has spread to virtually all sectors and countries. This is excellent news,  Coeure said.  But it would be unwise to let our guard down, because this recovery is of a cyclical nature and builds on significant support from monetary policy.  But Coeure also warned euro zone governments, which enjoyed ultra-low borrowing costs, that cheap financing may be coming to an end.  The increase in long-term interest rates is the result of consolidating growth. Governments and financial players must prepare themselves for it. They are aware of that,  he added.

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu had been asked to interpret a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court that revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning people from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent extremist attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Watson said in Thursday's ruling he  declines to usurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court to interpret its own order.  Hawaii said late on Thursday it would appeal against Watson's ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, according to a court filing. The Justice Department said in a statement it was pleased with the ruling.  We are confident that the U.S. Supreme Court will again vindicate the president and his constitutional duty to protect the national security of the United States,  it said. The government said after last month's Supreme Court ruling that a  bona fide relationship  meant close family members only, such as parents, spouses, fiancés, siblings and children. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would still be banned. The state of Hawaii asked Watson last week to clarify the Supreme Court's ruling, arguing the government's definition of  bona fide relationship  was too narrow.  Justice Department lawyers said its definition  hews closely  to language found in U.S. immigration law, while Hawaii's attorney general's office said other parts of immigration law included grandparents as close family. The government reversed its position on fiancés before the ban went into effect last week, saying they could also qualify for exceptions.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week compared to January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

The company made the decision following mounting international criticism of the trade, a Rakuten spokesman said, with trading to be phased out over the next month.  While China has pledged to shut down its domestic ivory trade by the end of this year, ivory imported before 1989 can be legally traded in Japan, with the government denying a link to illegal poaching.   Both the government and e-commerce sellers have been tightening monitoring of sellers, who are legally required to register their stock, amid criticism from wildlife groups that not enough is being done to prevent rule breaking.  Ivory trading continues on Yahoo Japan, the country's biggest online auction site.   We don’t think that the legal ivory trade in Japan has any impact on African elephant numbers,  said a Yahoo Japan spokesman.  It is important to recognize there are cultural differences between different countries,  he added.  Elephant numbers fell 30 percent between 2007 and 2014, according to a census funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, with illegal poaching thought to be the primary reason for the decline. The WWF says about 415,000 African elephants remain today, compared with the 3 million to 5 million in the early 20th century.

The development underscores difficulties for the sector in navigating a turbulent market after a Chinese crackdown on online imports last year resulted in new regulations requiring foreign vendors including formula makers to register by 2018. The rules have prompted some makers of infant formula to dump their product in China as they gave up on registering, which in turn forced Bellamy's to cut prices and issue a profit warning. Since then, the infant formula maker has replaced its leadership and a month ago announced it was buying the China-registered Camperdown formula cannery in the state of Victoria to ensure it followed the rules by the 2018 deadline. The company said in a statement it was still determining the reason for the suspension and asked for trade in its shares to be halted.  It shows that regulatory risk is real,  said Chris Kallos, a Morningstar analyst who covers companies which export health products to China.  It pays to have good relationships in those areas.  A list published on Thursday by China's CNCA, which oversees product safety certification, showed that it had suspended the licence of a Camperdown facility. It didn't give a reason for the suspension and CNCA officials were not immediately available for comment. The body had previously suspended the licence of a different Camperdown facility in August after inspectors found high levels of colon bacillus bacteria in pasteurised dairy products. Bellamy's stock last traded at A$6.74 on Thursday, sharply down from a peak around A$15 last August and giving the company a market value of A$693 million ($526 million). Australian and New Zealand formula makers were investor favourites for years amid hopes they would capitalise on high demand from Chinese consumers seeking overseas product after a safety scandal at home. A rival joint venture owned by Bega Cheese Ltd and Blackmores Ltd also saw weaker-than-expected sales last year due to the increased competition in China as rivals dumped product. But New Zealand formula rival A2 Milk Co Ltd has seen its stock soar 82 percent this year as it benefits from a strategy of letting unofficial shopper-resellers, known as  daigou , buy its product domestically then on-sell it on the mainland. China accounts for a third of Bellamy's revenue and a third of its pre-tax profit, according to its half-yearly earnings update in February.

Its aggressive bond buying operation sent most Japanese government bond yields lower and weakened the yen. It also marked a reversal in the recent slow and stealth tapering of the bond buying operation central to its easy monetary policy.  The BOJ has sent a very strong signal that they are committed to the yield curve control policy and they are not coming to the global tightening party. The reward has been a lower currency,  said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB in Sydney. The BOJ's announcement followed a spike in 10-year Japanese government bond yields to 0.105 percent, its highest since early February and significantly higher than the zero percent it targets for that maturity under its yield-curve-control policy. The spike was in parallel to the steep rise in German, U.S. and other European bond yields over the past week and a half, spurred by concerns global central banks are moving toward reducing stimulus. It had its origins in a string of hawkish messages from the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, furthered on Thursday by minutes from the European Central Bank's latest meeting showing it could be open to scrapping its bond-buying pledge. The Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes this week suggested it may also soon begin paring back its large bond holdings in the coming months. Powerful Weapon To ensure it had a stronger buffer in case increased buying was not enough, the BOJ employed its most powerful weapon -- of unconditional buying at specific yield -- only for a third time after it started its yield curve control policy in September. In a special market operation on Friday, the BOJ offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs at a yield of 0.110 percent. It also boosted the size of its regular auction-based purchase of five to 10-year maturities to 500 billion yen from the previous 450 billion yen.  The BOJ showed its strong determination to keep the 10-year yield around zero percent and not to let it rise above 0.10 percent,  said Koichi Sugisaki, strategist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. Following the BOJ's operation announcement the 10-year yield fell to 0.085 percent while expectations of widening in yield differentials with other countries sent the yen down to 113.835 to the dollar, its lowest in a month and a half. But Friday's increase in bond buying went against the central bank's attempts in recent months to reduce its massive debt purchases. The BOJ has been slowing the pace of its bond buys as its holdings of JGBs have already topped 40 percent, threatening the smooth functioning of the bond market. Former BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai told Reuters on Friday the Bank of Japan should steadily proceed with an  implicit tapering  of its bond purchases as any rise in yields would be temporary. Shirai said the central bank may temporarily accelerate purchases of JGBs to contain rises in bond yields, but won't have to buy huge amounts to cap yields around its zero percent target. Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics in Singapore, said:  We expect U.S. 10-year yields to climb further to 3.0 percent by year-end so chances are that the BOJ will have to conduct additional fixed purchase operations in coming months.

A Reuters poll of 52 analysts predicted the Australian dollar at $0.7600 in one month, up from earlier expectations of $0.7400. It was trading at $0.7585 on Friday after hitting a 3-1/2 month high of $0.7712 last week.  The currency was seen at $0.7500 in three months, up 1 cent from the May survey. It will stay at that level over the next six months before edging lower to $0.7470 on a one-year horizon, the survey shows.     The Aussie has been on an uptrend since early May, as a bull run in the U.S. dollar - which began when Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November - ended. The antipodean currency is already up more than 5 percent so far this year, becoming one of the best performing major currencies.  We are looking for a firmer Australian dollar largely because of an improvement in global economic activity which is supportive of commodity prices like iron ore,  said Elias Haddad, senior currency strategist at CBA. CBA sees the Aussie at 78 U.S. cents in 12 months.   Australia's current account deficit is the smallest since the late 1970s and is only 6 percent of the country's economic output. That would continue to underpin the fundamental value of the Australian dollar,  he added. The commodity driven currency is finding support from higher prices for Australia's major exports - iron ore and coal - which have delivered seven straight months of trade surpluses after years of deficits. However, analysts expect further upside to be capped as the Aussie's yield advantage narrows with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) staying pat on interest rates at the same time that the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy.  Central banks in England, Europe and Canada are also sounding unexpectedly hawkish. In contrast, markets assume policymakers in Australia and New Zealand will keep their rates at record lows for a long time to come.  The premium paid by Australian two-year debt over its U.S. counterpart has dwindled to just 33 basis points, the smallest since early 2001 and down from 119 basis points this time last year. The New Zealand dollar was seen at $0.7200 in one month, up 2.8 cents from the April poll, but slipping to $0.7100 in three months. It was last at $0.7286, not far from a five month top.

The central banks of both countries in recent weeks removed long-held easing bias from their interest rate outlook, prodded in part by a U.S. Federal Reserve rate increase and the European Central Bank's hardening its dovish stance. Norway's crown appeared poised for the biggest moves in the next 12 months. It was forecast to gain 5.5 percent from current levels against the dollar and 5.6 percent against the euro, the poll showed. The Swedish crown was expected to rise by 4.0 percent against the dollar and 4.4 percent against the euro over the coming year.  The Norwegian crown is too weak compared to the underlying fundamentals. The economy is improving, the oil price has picked up and the currency hasn't fully incorporated these developments,  Nordea Markets economist Erik Bruce said.  As for Sweden, the central bank is done with rate cuts, and we believe the economy will be strong enough to accommodate an increase in rates next year,  he said. The Norwegian crown was forecast to strengthen to 8.99 against the euro and 7.91 versus the dollar in the next 12 months from its current 9.52 and 8.37. The Swedish crown was expected to rise to 9.20 against the euro and 8.13 versus the dollar during the next year from 9.62 and 8.46 currently.

Most Asian currencies have got the better of the dollar which has taken a beating on growing concerns over the U.S. administration's inability to deliver on promises made. The Chinese yuan, a major focal point for global markets in the past few months as authorities scrambled to stabilise it and flush out speculators betting on a steep fall, looked set to end the year in better shape than previously thought. The Taiwan dollar was among the best performers in Asia, up nearly 6 percent this year. The Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Singapore dollar and Thai baht have gained more than 4 percent. The latest poll consensus of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists surveyed over the past week showed many of the major Asian currencies are likely to hold onto most of their gains made this year over the coming 12 months. That is in contrast to a poll in January, which predicted a steep fall against the dollar on expectations for fiscal stimulus and a faster pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes.  There has been some disappointment in lack of progress in the U.S. in terms of pushing through fiscal reforms and tax reforms, which is one of the reasons why the dollar hasn't done that well,  said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.  We still do expect a small fiscal package at some point probably in the next year but the market has started to question (President Donald) Trump's ability to get as much done and I don't expect any kind of major fiscal stimulus to help the dollar jump higher.  The Chinese yuan and Indian rupee have gained over 2 percent against the dollar this year, with half of those gains made over the last two months. The yuan is predicted to trade at 6.95 per dollar by the end of this year, compared to 7.2 forecast at the beginning of the year. The Indian rupee is tipped around 65.5 to the dollar by end-2017 compared to 69.5 seen in January poll. While the outlook has definitely brightened for Asian currencies, it is mainly due to the loss of momentum in the dollar with country-specific factors playing second fiddle. Bets in the latest poll have turned less bullish for the dollar as much of the Federal Reserve's policy tightening plan has already been priced-in and the real risk now is that the central bank may be pushed off its path. But a separate Reuters poll on positioning showed speculators trimmed their bullish bets in most of the Asian currencies, even as they increased their long positions in the Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht. [ASIA/FXP] The outlook for the regional currencies was also supported by better economic performance and some reforms undertaken in recent months. China's economy grew a solid 6.9 percent in the first quarter on a year earlier, supported by significant government infrastructure spending. A string of curbs on capital outflows by Beijing, and the introduction of a different methodology to calculate the mid-point reference rate for the yuan by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has also helped restore market confidence in the currency.  We have revised our USD/CNY forecast and the reason is that the dollar has not been stronger than we expected. The other reason is the Chinese economy has stabilized and that should be good for CNY,  said Irene Cheung, senior Asia FX strategist at ANZ. Separately, the strength in the Indian rupee has been driven in part by confidence the government will likely pass through major reforms and on expectations for better economic growth. The implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) by the government, touted as the biggest tax reform since independence, has bolstered the view on the Indian economy as well as the outlook for its stocks. [EPOLL/IN]   We are still quite constructive on the INR and the reason is reforms,  added ANZ's Cheung.

RBI was due to sell a 15 percent stake in an IPO to fulfil a commitment to the Polish regulator, which demands lenders are listed to ensure better transparency and safety of Poland's banking sector. On Thursday Raiffeisen decided to postpone the offering. According to sources demand was weak even at a hefty discount of 0.6 to the book value, pricing the stake at 126 million euros ($143.83 million).  KNF is concerned with the information that the Raiffeisen Bank Polska shares' sale failed,  KNF said in a statement.  KNF will take necessary steps to ensure that bank shares are floated on the Warsaw stock exchange with free float at 15 percent or higher,  it said. Raiffeisen pushed last month for the listing to be postponed, arguing there was insufficient demand for a stake in a bank that is forced to set a large amount of capital aside for a portfolio of mortgages denominated in Swiss francs. It also wanted more time for a cost-cutting programme to take effect. But the regulator stuck by its demand that the listing take place, having already granted Raiffeisen a one-year extension last year.

A.P. Moller-Maersk, Danish owner of the world's biggest container shipping line, operates 76 ports via its APM Terminal division and was one of the many firms hit by the ransomware virus along with Russia's Rosneft and advertising agency WPP. For the shipping sector, this was among the biggest-ever disruptions given Maersk handles one out of seven containers shipped globally.  Our first priority has not been to look at the financial impact,  Robbert van Trooijen, Maersk's Asia Pacific chief executive told reporters on a call.   It is too early to predict what the impact will be on the quarter-two, or potentially the quarter-three result.   The attack did not impact Maersk's physical loading of goods, but disrupted data-reliant processes such as creating arrival notices and obtaining customs clearance - leading to congestion at some of its ports, including in the United States, India, Spain and the Netherlands.  Van Trooijen said all ports Maersk worked with were now back on stream and releasing cargo.  Over the last 48 hours we are basically ensuring that just about every port in the world is able to receive and release cargo again.   He said it was unclear how many bookings had been canceled due to the attack which spread globally on June 28, but the firm was now seeing a rebound in bookings as systems recovered. He added Maersk would discuss settlement and liability issues with individual shippers who had been affected.  The cyber virus is believed to have first taken hold in Ukraine before spreading globally where it locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely. Van Trooijen said the company did not believe Maersk was deliberately targeted, given the virus' geographic reach, and that it would continue to work with cybersecurity and software firms to ensure it was as protected as it could be. He, however, warned it would be difficult to guard against new, random viruses.   There was nothing in terms of patches that we missed, there was no cyber security measures that we didn't take, so we were already in quite a strong position,  he said.

Police in the southern city of Guangzhou detained Liu Shaoming in May 2015 and he was arrested soon after on a charge of  inciting subversion of state power , said a Hong Kong-based advocacy group, the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. Liu will appeal against Friday's decision by Guangzhou's Intermediate Court, his lawyer, Wu Kuiming, told Reuters by telephone.  He's already been detained for two years ... the sentence is too heavy,  he said.  He is innocent ... he hasn't committed any crime.  Liu's son and wife were in court when the decision was handed down, Wu added.  Wu said Liu spoke briefly in the courtroom, maintaining his innocence and saying authorities had misinterpreted his writings on the overseas democracy movement and his involvement in the Tiananmen protests of 1989 in Beijing. Liu had shared these writings over various social media and online channels in 2014 and 2015, rights groups said. Telephone calls to the court in Guangzhou went unanswered. Western countries have expressed repeated concerns about a widening campaign under President Xi Jinping to quash dissent among activists, rights lawyers, journalists, academics and others.  All that Liu Shaoming is guilty of is the legitimate exercise of his freedom of expression,  said William Nee, a China researcher at rights group Amnesty International.  He is a prisoner of conscience and must be immediately and unconditionally released,  he said in a statement. Liu had campaigned through the years on issues such as labor rights, besides helping to found  Labour Defense Volunteers , a group to assist blue-collar workers in southern China, rights groups said. Elsewhere in China, Nobel Peace laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo is battling late-stage liver cancer after being released on medical parole. Liu's deteriorating condition has stoked international concern and is expected to throw a spotlight on China's rights abuses as Xi attends a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Germany.

Police in the southern city of Guangzhou detained Liu Shaoming in May 2015 and he was arrested soon after on a charge of  inciting subversion of state power , said a Hong Kong-based advocacy group, the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. Liu will appeal against Friday's decision by Guangzhou's Intermediate Court, his lawyer, Wu Kuiming, told Reuters by telephone.  He's already been detained for two years ... the sentence is too heavy,  he said.  He is innocent ... he hasn't committed any crime.  Liu's son and wife were in court when the decision was handed down, Wu added.  Wu said Liu spoke briefly in the courtroom, maintaining his innocence and saying authorities had misinterpreted his writings on the overseas democracy movement and his involvement in the Tiananmen protests of 1989 in Beijing. Liu had shared these writings over various social media and online channels in 2014 and 2015, rights groups said. Telephone calls to the court in Guangzhou went unanswered. Western countries have expressed repeated concerns about a widening campaign under President Xi Jinping to quash dissent among activists, rights lawyers, journalists, academics and others.  All that Liu Shaoming is guilty of is the legitimate exercise of his freedom of expression,  said William Nee, a China researcher at rights group Amnesty International.  He is a prisoner of conscience and must be immediately and unconditionally released,  he said in a statement. Liu had campaigned through the years on issues such as labor rights, besides helping to found  Labour Defense Volunteers , a group to assist blue-collar workers in southern China, rights groups said. Elsewhere in China, Nobel Peace laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo is battling late-stage liver cancer after being released on medical parole. Liu's deteriorating condition has stoked international concern and is expected to throw a spotlight on China's rights abuses as Xi attends a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Germany.

The softer data comes on the heels of Wednesday's release of the minutes from the Fed's June meeting, which showed policymakers were increasingly split on the inflation outlook and how it might affect the pace of rate increases.      Markets are mixed, bit more on the negative side. I think for now we are still in the risk-off mood. We do not really want any surprises from the U.S. Fed and this (market movement) is because of the Fed,  said Mikey Macainag, an analyst with Sunsecurities Inc.     Meanwhile, developed market bonds were sold off afresh on Thursday on bets the European Central Bank is inching closer towards unwinding its massive monetary stimulus.     The prospect of the ECB turning off the flow of easy money has been a dominant global market theme since President Mario Draghi's hawkish comments last week, pushing bond yields higher and hurting equities.     Malaysia, one of the biggest oil and natural gas exporters in Asia, led losses in the region as sentiment was hit by a fall in oil prices early on Friday.     Energy major IOI Corporation Bhd fell as much as 3.3 percent, posting its biggest intra-day percentage fall since Nov. 2016.     Singapore edged down 0.3 percent, dragged by declines in financial shares.     DBS Group Holdings and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp fell 0.6 percent each.     Thai shares dropped 0.1 percent hurt by industrial stocks like Airports of Thailand, down as much as 1.5 percent.     Indonesian shares were marginally lower, dragged by consumer stocks such as Unilever Indonesia Tbk, which slipped as much as 0.8 percent.

Spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE to open 0.25 percent lower, Germany's DAX to open 0.3 percent lower and France's CAC to open down 0.2 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4 percent, after the Dow lost 0.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1 percent on Thursday, partly as higher Treasury yields dimmed the appeal of equities. Japan's Nikkei was down 0.5 percent, South Korea's KOSPI dropped 0.3 percent and Australian stocks declined 0.9 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.4 percent. The prospect of the ECB turning off the flow of easy money has been a dominant global market theme since President Mario Draghi's hawkish comments last week, pushing bond yields higher and hurting equities. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell to an 11-week low the previous day and the German 10-year bund yield rose above 0.5 percent to an 18-month high after the ECB's June meeting minutes showed the central bank opening the door to dropping a long-standing bond buying pledge.  It is natural for risk assets in developed markets to adjust lower on prospects of curbed liquidity, as easy money has allowed them to rise far out of proportion with their underlying real economies,  said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.  For the ECB, tapering of easy policy and hiking rates are two totally different things, and it is likely to make this clear. But right now the markets are having a hard time believing the ECB's intentions.  The 10-year Treasury note yield stood near a two-month high of 2.391 percent. With more focus on the euro zone bond market's rise in yields, Treasuries brushed off Thursday's weaker-than-expected U.S. ADP employment data.  Expectations that the European Central Bank and other central banks joining the Federal Reserve in moving towards tighter policies are causing a diversification of funds away from Treasuries,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  The key point is that higher U.S. yields also tend to weigh on high-tech sectors by increasing their funding costs.  The 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield initially reached 0.105 percent, its highest since February. But the rise prompted the Bank of Japan to act, pushing the 10-year JGB yield back to 0.090 percent. The central bank, which has tasked itself to control the yield curve as a part of its easy policy, offered to buy an unlimited amount of 10-year JGBs on Friday in order to cap yields. In currencies, the euro was little changed at $1.1418 after gaining about 0.6 percent overnight as Thursday's soft U.S. employment data weighed on the dollar. The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 113.665 yen as the BOJ's bond-buying operation weakened the Japanese currency. The dollar index was a shade higher at 95.904. The markets looked ahead to the closely watched U.S. non-farm jobs report due later in the day. Much focus was on the wage component of the employment report and whether spending by U.S. consumers would be strong enough to back the Fed's intention to further tighten policy. Crude oil prices slipped after a sharp but short-lived boost from a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. inventories of crude and gasoline faded. U.S. crude fell 1.3 percent to $44.65 a barrel and Brent declined 1.2 percent to $47.52 a barrel. Gold and silver extended their decline with higher U.S. yields denting the allure of non-yielding precious metals. Spot gold was 0.3 percent lower at $1,220.45 an ounce. Silver was down 0.6 percent at $15.89 an ounce after momentarily dropping to $14.86. Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-idUSL4N1JY06H"},

Worries that China's economic growth could slow in the second half has also curbed risk appetite. The Hang Seng, the Hong Kong benchmark that ranked among the best-performing major indexes in the first half, dropped 0.4 percent, to 25,373.80 points by the lunch break, extending its weekly decline to 1.5 percent. The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 0.6 percent, to 10,281.13. Yang Hai, an analyst at Kaiyuan Securities said tightening by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank  would have a negative impact on liquidity situations in Hong Kong.  However, he expects the impact on the China market would be limited. The market's upward momentum also appears to be losing steam, amid signs that the pace of Chinese money inflows - a major source of strength - is slowing. Net inflows from the mainland via  Connect  schemes slumped by more than half in June, while monthly selling of Hong Kong stocks through the cross-border links rose to a record this year, according to the China Securities Journal, showing Chinese investors are increasingly cautious. Risk apatite appears waning on the mainland as well. China's blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.5 percent, to 3,642.39 points on Friday morning, on track to post a weekly decline of 0.7 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, to 3,205.25 points. The mood has generally been cautious ahead of a raft of Chinese data in coming weeks, which is expected to show steady growth, but government measures to rein in the housing market and debt risks are likely to drag on activity over the next few quarters.  Slower credit growth and higher funding costs due to supervisory tightening are expected to have an effect on fixed-asset investment and activities later in the year,  economists at UBS said in a research note. Most sectors fell in Hong Kong and China on Friday. Hong Kong-listed IT shares fell sharply after the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1 percent overnight, and as bellwether Tencent Holdings weakened 0.7 percent. Bucking the trend, Hong Kong shares in COSCO Shipping Holdings, the world's fourth-largest container shipping line, surged to a 23-month high on robust profit forecast.

The central bank started cutting interest rates in 2008 to help the economy after the global financial crisis and gathered pace as a series of debt crises hit the euro zone in 2011 and 2012. The monetary easing stepped up a gear when the ECB embarked on a trillion euro bond-buying scheme in March 2015 which pushed borrowing costs even lower. This punished German savers by driving interest rates to record lows but helped countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal manage a sharp increase in their debt loads. It was also good news for the 16 regions and city-states including Lower Saxony, North Rhine Westphalia and Berlin, collectively known as the  Laender . The regions have had their debt servicing costs cut by an average 40 percent in eight years, according to ratings agency S&P; Global, and have been able to issue long-dated bonds and fix costs at extremely low levels.  Most German states are running a surplus now and one of the reasons for this improvement is certainly the lower interest rate environment besides robust tax revenue increases,  said Thomas Fischinger, a director at S&P; Global. The ECB's deposit rate -- a closely watched interest rate set by the central bank -- has fallen from 3.25 percent in 2008 to minus 0.40 percent. It has been negative since 2014. Then in 2015 it started to buy billions of euros of bonds every month. This brought down yields and interest payments on government borrowing dropped sharply. Short-dated bond yields even went negative for countries with higher credit ratings such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, so investors were effectively paying to lend to them. This pushed German regional bond yields lower as investors bought German state debt as an alternative to Bunds. Budgetary Surprise While German national debt is among the lowest in the euro zone, regional debt is among the highest. The sixteen have average debts of around 160 percent of revenues. This compares with 5-100 percent for Austrian states and around 20-50 percent for Russian regions, while for Swiss cantons 200 percent would be at the very high end, according to S&P; Global's Fischinger. In 2009, they were running deficits of around 9 percent. In 2016, all but one of them ran a surplus partly because of low interest rates. This helped fulfil a national directive to balance their budgets four years earlier than the 2020 goal. Preliminary numbers show North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) ran a surplus in 2016 for the first time since 1973.  Our budgetary performance has come as a surprise to some people,  said Axel Bendick, head of funding for NRW. Numbers from the ministry show a 3.88 billion euro increase in tax revenues and a 563 million euro fall in interest payments helped the state shrink its budget by 1.567 billion euros in 2016. With worries increasing over a scarcity of eligible government bonds to buy under QE, the ECB in 2016 expanded its purchase programme to include bonds issued by government-related entities, including regional debt. Germany's regional benchmark bond market is the biggest beneficiary, being the largest in Europe. UniCredit analysts calculated the size of the state bond market at 364 billion euros at the end of 2016, seven times the size of the next biggest regional bond market, that of Spain, and comparable to the national debt of Belgium and the Netherlands. The yield on the March 2025 bond of North Rhine Westphalia -- with around 52 billion euros of outstanding euro benchmark bonds -- fell from 1.19 percent two years ago to 0.40 percent. New Lenders The easing has also allowed German states to issue longer-dated bonds as investors look to buy longer bonds for the extra yield in a low interest rates environment.  We printed our first 30-year benchmark in 2016, and certainly this part of the curve became attractive on the back of the QE programme and inclusion,  said Bendick of the NRW finance ministry.  We usually have a programme of around 20 billion; this has shrunk because of the extension of the portfolio. We don't have to fund as much in any given year as a result of this.  Also, regions' higher market profile has helped the state increase its borrowing in other currencies: in 2015, it met close to 20 percent of its funding needs in dollars. This increases the borrower's funding options and provides access to a new set of investors in case of more challenging times. The boomtime for German states looks set to continue. NRW and Berlin both received strong demand for recent 30-year bond sales and with the ECB increasingly struggling to find German Bunds to buy, this demand may even increase.  Given the scarcity of German Bunds, we think that the ECB does not have any chance other than becoming even more active in the German sub-sovereign market,  said Citi strategist Michael Spies.

Sayuri Shirai, a former BOJ board member, said the central bank may temporarily accelerate purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGB) to contain rises in bond yield, but won't have to buy huge amounts to cap yields around its zero percent target. The BOJ has already been slowing its JGB purchases to around 50-60 trillion yen ($440-528 billion), despite a loose pledge to buy at a pace that increases its holdings by 80 trillion yen per year, Shirai said.  What the BOJ is now doing is implicit tapering. That was probably the BOJ's key aim in revamping its policy framework last year. The BOJ knew it was getting more difficult to maintain the current pace of bond buying,  Shirai said.  The BOJ may briefly increase its bond buying when yields are rising as is the case now. But I don't think it will be forced to keep buying at a pace well above 80 trillion yen to control yields as there's always strong appetite for JGBs in the market,  she told Reuters. Expectations of tighter monetary policies in Europe and the United States have pushed up global bond yields, including JGBs, forcing the BOJ to buy additional amounts of 10-year bonds on Friday to keep yields low. Shirai said the BOJ's yield curve control policy may run into trouble with inflation still well off its target, forcing the bank to maintain its stimulus program longer than originally hoped for. The BOJ now expects inflation to hit its 2 percent target by March 2019, but Shirai said the central bank is now likely to push back the timing at a quarterly review of its long-term projections this month or October.  The BOJ should come up with a realistic estimate on when inflation would hit 2 percent. Based on that, it should lay out a sustainable framework on the pace of tapering,  said Shirai, who served a five-year BOJ term until March 2016. Shirai said the BOJ will probably aim to slow its bond buying to around 50-trillion-yen per year this year.  It should continue to taper but very carefully and slowly, to prevent market disruption,  she said.

Minnesota used a six-run third inning to support Jose Berrios' six innings on the mound and beat Baltimore 6-4 on Thursday in the opener of a four-game series. Miguel Sano, Max Kepler and Eduardo Escobar each had run-scoring hits in the big frame against Orioles right-hander Dylan Bundy. Escobar had two hits in the game, including a two-run triple, as the Twins won for the third time in four home games following a disappointing end to their recent road trip.  Offensively, we struggled a lot tonight, but we put together one really nice inning,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  We found a way to put up a big number and make it stand. You like your club to find a way to maybe add on along the way, but the pitching held up.  Berrios (8-2) recovered from back-to-back tough outings to beat Baltimore for the second time this season. He allowed four runs (three earned) on seven hits and no walks while striking out four. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at TwinsBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchBrandon Kintzler notched his 23rd save in 26 chances. The Twins have won each of the teams' four meetings this season. Mark Trumbo hit a two-run homer, but the Orioles left the bases loaded twice and stranded 10 baserunners in losing for the sixth time in seven games.  It was better,  Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said of his team's offense, which has struggled recently.  That's a good pitcher we're facing and a good bullpen. We created some good opportunities for ourselves, just couldn't finish it off. We were a big hit away.  Bundy (8-8) had another difficult outing in his last start before the All-Star break. He gave up six runs, five hits and two walks while striking out four in five innings. Over his past six starts, Bundy has surrendered 27 earned runs in 31 1/3 innings. Trumbo's homer opened the scoring in the second inning. Adam Jones reached after first baseman Sano couldn't handle a routine throw from shortstop Jorge Polanco on a ground ball. Trumbo followed with a towering shot to straightaway center field for his 13th homer of the season.  I had everything I needed,  Berrios said.  I had my velocity. But I fell down early and the hitters were able to pick me up. I just think it was more of a climate thing. I think that kind of got me a little tired.  In the third, Trumbo grounded out, leaving the bases loaded. Minnesota took advantage in the bottom of the inning with its own bases-loaded situation. Sano lined an RBI single to right field, and Kepler followed with a two-run single to left. Escobar plated two more runs with a triple off the wall that caromed away from right fielder Seth Smith. The sixth run of the inning scored on Polanco's fielder's choice.  That's horrible,  Bundy said.  To give up six runs in one inning, that's pretty pathetic. Got to limit those, and that's kind of unacceptable.  Baltimore got a run back in the fourth on Paul Janish's run-scoring groundout to make it 6-3, then added a run in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Hyun Soo Kim. NOTES: Minnesota 1B Joe Mauer was out of the lineup for the second straight night due to back spasms. Manager Paul Molitor wasn't sure when Mauer would be ready to return. ... Baltimore called up INF Johnny Giavotella from Triple-A Norfolk. He took the roster spot vacated when LHP Jayson Aquino was optioned following Wednesday's game. INF David Washington was designated for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster for Giavotella. ... Molitor said the MRI for LHP Hector Santiago came back  fairly clean  and Santiago is just dealing with inflammation. Santiago went on the disabled list Wednesday with upper thoracic back pain. RHP Felix Jorge will be recalled from Triple-A Rochester to start Friday in place of Santiago. ... RHP Chris Tillman is expected to be activated from the paternity list Saturday, but Orioles manager Buck Showalter wasn't sure if Tillman would start Saturday. ...

Yingluck, whose government was ousted in a 2014 military coup, faces up to 10 years in prison if she is found guilty of negligence over her role in the scheme, which proved popular with rural voters but was a disaster for state coffers. The former prime minister and opposition say the trial is politically motivated and is aimed at undermining the populist movement that has won every election since 2001. The movement is opposed by Thailand's powerful military and conservative elite. Around 500 supporters showed up outside the court on Friday, police said, the largest turnout in many months. One wrote  Love the prime minister  on his hand, while others shouted:  fight, fight . Yingluck has denied the charges against her. The military has said it will deploy troops to maintain security on July 21, when a final hearing in the case is expected. Yingluck's critics see the rice case as a litmus test of the junta's sincerity in tackling corruption in politics, one of its promises after it seized power in 2014. Closing statements in the case will be delivered within 30 days of the final hearing, court officials said.     I'm confident in the witnesses we've presented,  Yingluck told crowds outside the court. Ousted former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra greets supporters as she arrives at the Supreme Court for a trial on criminal negligence, which looks into her role in a debt-ridden rice subsidy scheme during her administration, in Bangkok, Thailand July 7, 2017.Chaiwat Subprasom The encouragement I've been given is still good ... this is a strong characteristic of the Thai people,  she said. Street Protests Successive Thai governments have supported farmers since the 1980s, but none of the schemes has proved as popular with rural voters as the rice programs pioneered by Yingluck's brother, ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Slideshow (5 Images)Yingluck's government went a step further, promising to buy rice from farmers at some 50 percent above the market price.  The scheme helped her to sail to victory in a 2011 general election, making her the country's first female prime minister. However, public losses from the scheme fueled street protests against Yingluck that eventually saw her removed from power just weeks before the 2014 coup. The scheme also saw Thailand lose its crown as the world's top rice exporter as other countries, notably Vietnam and India, filled the void when Thailand held back rice stocks it had bought from farmers. The military government has managed to sell off most of about 18 million tonnes of rice accumulated during the rice scheme, some of it for industrial purposes, according to the commerce ministry. Yingluck said on Friday she was not sure when she would deliver her closing statement.

Martin had three hits, including a home run, and Liriano pitched into the seventh inning, boosting the Blue Jays to a 7-4 victory. The Blue Jays (40-45) have won three in a row, while the Astros (58-28) had their four-game winning streak halted.  We pitched very well and shut down a great hitting team, a hot-hitting team,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  The last three games that we've won, we've played some pretty good baseball, we'll see where it takes us.  Liriano (5-4) allowed nine hits, one walk and three runs while striking out four in six-plus innings.  Everything went well, the offense was there today and we played great defense,  Liriano said.  They have a great lineup. But you've got to stay positive, we played well. It's very important for us to keep that going, to finish very strong in the first half.  Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect ninth to earn his 22nd save of the season and the 21st in a row. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at Blue JaysHouston Astros - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchMarwin Gonzalez homered for the Astros in the second inning and was ejected in the sixth inning after striking out. Houston's Carlos Beltran hit his 11th homer of the season to lead off the eighth against Ryan Tepera. Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr. (7-2) allowed six runs (five earned), nine hits and two walks while striking out three in 4 1/3 innings.  Everyone's allowed a bad day at work,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  He didn't have a horrible day. Obviously, it didn't end well for him and they piled together a couple of hits. Hung a couple of breaking balls and they put together a good plan against him.  I think he, uncharacteristically, didn't have his stuff. I don't think his breaking ball was as good as it usually is. His command, I think he had a little trouble with the mound. Just finding his rhythm, finding his release point.   We were facing one of the top pitchers in the game,  Gibbons said.  We battled him, we had him on the ropes early (bases loaded with one out in the first) and he got out of it. I thought we kind of kept the pressure on.  Martin hit his ninth homer of the season to greet the third Astros pitcher, Dayan Diaz, in the sixth inning. The blast increased Toronto's lead to 7-2. Tepera replaced Liriano after Alex Bregman led off the seventh with a double, his third hit and second double of the game. Tepera struck out his first two batters before Jose Altuve broke his bat on an RBI single. Gonzalez led off the second with his 15th homer of the season, a drive to left on a 3-1 two-seam fastball for a 1-0 lead. The Blue Jays tied the game in the fourth on a two-out RBI single by Steve Pearce. It scored Kendrys Morales, who reached first base on an error by third baseman Bregman, took second on a wild pitch, and moved to third on Troy Tulowitzki's groundout to shortstop. Houston regained the lead in the fifth on an RBI single by Altuve that followed a leadoff double by Bregman and a one-out single by George Springer. The Blue Jays scored five runs in the bottom of the fifth to take a 6-2 lead. Josh Donaldson ended an 0-for-15 slump with a two-run single. It scored Jose Bautista, who led off the inning with a single, and Martin, who followed with a single. A passed ball put runners at second and third for Donaldson. Donaldson scored on a one-out double by Morales. Tulowitzki snapped an 0-for-22 drought with runners in scoring position with an RBI single.  I just didn't execute that inning,  McCullers said.  I wanted to throw a purpose pitch and left it over the plate and up where (Bautista) got a hit. The inning kind of snowballed from there. ... I had a chance there with Morales up, with two strikes, to keep the damage as minimal as I could and I couldn't do it.  Michael Feliz replaced McCullers and walked Pearce. Feliz was charged with a throwing error on an attempted force out at second on Kevin Pillar's comebacker to the mound, loading the bases. Ryan Goins hit an RBI double to center. NOTES: Astros SS Carlos Correa (left thumb) returned to the lineup Thursday after sitting out the game Wednesday in Atlanta after jamming his thumb on a slide Tuesday. He singled in the first inning Thursday to extend his hit streak to a career-best 14 games, and he finished 1-for-4. ... Astros OF George Springer has 25 homers, the third most by a Houston player before the All-Star break. 1B Lance Berkman set the franchise mark in 2002 with 29. 1B Jeff Bagwell was the other. ...

The presidential race went into a run-off after none of the three candidates won a majority late last month. A populist former martial arts star, Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party won the most votes, but fell short of the required majority. Voters regard Battulga as a resource nationalist who is suspicious of China. He faces the candidate of the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP), Miyeegombo Enkhbold, who came second. Enkhbold has stood behind the current government and prime minister, pledging to stay the course for economic recovery following a $5.5-billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund and partners in May. Battulga has captured the attention of voters who feel Mongolia has got a bad deal on investments, promising greater government control of strategic mines, such as Rio Tinto's, Oyu Tolgoi copper mine.Enkhbold, for his part, has promised to deliver money owed from a universal child welfare fund. Some voters who spoke to Reuters in Ulaanbaatar, the capital, expressed disappointment in the candidates.

They make their promises to get people's votes, but afterwards won't keep them.  Slideshow (3 Images)Results are expected sometime on Saturday.  The race has been clouded by allegations of corruption and voter fraud by all sides, with many voters dismayed by their choice of candidates and the government's inability to bring them prosperity. But the country's 1.9 million voters also have a third option, according to the so-called  White Ballot  campaign, to leave their votes blank.    Our goal is to have every voter know they have an option to vote for none of the above,  said spokesman Mogi Badral Bantoi. For many voters, handing in blank ballots is a last-ditch effort to deny either candidate a majority, so forcing a re-run of the poll from scratch, with selection of fresh candidates.  Mongolia is a parliamentary democracy. The government is run by a prime minister, but the president has powers to veto legislation and make judicial appointments.
