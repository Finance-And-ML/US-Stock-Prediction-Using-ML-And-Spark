Lee. The group was guarded by scores of police and outnumbered by hundreds of counter-protesters who waved signs denouncing racism. Anti-KKK protesters raised their voices in chants and shouts, drowning out speeches from the white supremacists, live video feeds on social media showed. There were no initial reports of violence at the rally that lasted less than an hour. The Klan group that brandished Confederate flags and signs with anti-Semitic messages was separated from crowds by a ring of fencing and a heavy police presence. Later police fired tear gas cannisters when some protesters refused orders to disperse. Twenty-three people were arrested, but officials could not confirm their affiliations. In February, the Charlottesville City Council voted 3-2 to remove the statue from the park once named for Lee and make plans for a new memorial to remember the southern city's enslaved population, The Daily Progress, the local newspaper reported.

Supporters say they represent an indelible part of U.S. history and part of regional heritage.

Torch-wielding white nationalists rallied in the college town that is home to the University of Virginia's flagship campus in May to protest the move.

The band, led by 57-year-old singer Bono, is playing the entire record to 2.4 million fans on their 2017 tour, including hits  With or Without You  and  I Still Haven't Found What I'm looking For . But they started the London show with early songs  Sunday Bloody Sunday ,  New Year's Day ,  Bad , and the Martin Luther King Jr-inspired  Pride (In the Name of Love) , which Bono dedicated to the  Rainbow people of London  who took part in the annual Pride LGBT march in the city earlier on Saturday.  The Joshua Tree  was played in sequence against a backdrop of video of U.S. landscapes such as Death Valley, and Americans standing in front of the Stars and the Stripes, shot by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn who created the imagery on the original record. The group's best-selling album was released in 1987 when Ronald Reagan was U.S. President and his ideological soul mate Margaret Thatcher was in power in Britain. The tracks  Bullet the Blue Sky  and  Mothers of the Disappeared  were inspired by trips Bono made to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where he saw the impact of U.S. foreign policy, while  Red Hill Mining Town  was about the impact of the socially divisive miners' strike in Britain in the 1980s. Lead guitarist The Edge said in an interview with Rolling Stone in January that politically  things have kind of come full circle .  U2 perform during their U2: The Joshua Tree Tour, at Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain, July 8, 2017.Dylan Martinez It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago',  he told the magazine.  Bono largely let the music speak for itself on Saturday, although a character called  Trump  was called a liar by the  good guy cowboy  in a Western movie-style clip.  The Joshua Tree , which sold more than 25 million copies, marked the pinnacle of the band tackling social and political issues through rock music.  Slideshow (19 Images)Their next album,  Rattle and Hum , did not match its success critically or commercially, and the band reinvented themselves in the 1990s by incorporating electronic and alternative rock into their sound. Seven of their later songs, including  Ultraviolet  and  One , were played as an encore, before Bono invited support act Noel Gallagher back on stage to sing  Don't Look Back in Anger , a song he wrote for his band Oasis.  The track became an anthem for Manchester after 22 people were killed by a suicide bomber in the city in May, and Gallagher also dedicated it to the victims of further attacks and a devastating tower block fire in London in June. U2, Gallagher and thousands of fans united in singing the anthem, ending a show that proved the enduring relevance and appeal of 1980s and 1990s rock music.    The Joshua Tree  tour plays seven other European cities before returning to the United States in September.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet gave the go-ahead last month for the government to try to sell the airline, after successive governments spent billions of dollars in recent years to keep the airline going. Air India - founded in the 1930s and known to generations of Indians for its Maharajah mascot - is saddled with a debt burden of $8.5 billion and a bloated cost structure. The government has injected $3.6 billion since 2012 to bail out the airline. Once the nation's largest carrier, its market share in the booming domestic market has slumped to 13 percent as private carriers such as InterGlobe Aviation's (INGL.NS) IndiGo and Jet Airways (JET.NS) have grown. Previous attempts to offload the airline have been unsuccessful. If Modi can pull this off, it will buttress his credentials as a reformer brave enough to wade into some of the country's most intractable problems. His office has set a deadline of early next year to get the sale process underway, the officials said, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans. The timeline is ambitious and the process fraught, with opinion divided on the best way forward: should the government retain a stake or exit completely, and should it risk being left with the unprofitable pieces while buyers pick off the better businesses, officials said. Already, a labour union that represents 2,500 of the airline's 40,000 employees has opposed the idea of a sale even though it is ideologically aligned to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Related CoverageFactbox: Air India subsidiariesOfficials who have to make it happen are grappling with the sheer scale of the exercise. Air India has six subsidiaries – three of which are loss-making – with assets worth about $4.6 billion. It has an estimated $1.24 billion worth of real estate, including two hotels, where ownership is split among various government entities. No one has properly valued the company's various businesses and assets before, two officials with direct knowledge of the process said. Earlier this month, about $30 million worth of art, including paintings by artist M. F. Husain, went missing from its Mumbai offices, chairman Ashwani Lohani said.  The exercise is complex and there is no easy way out,  said Jitendra Bhargava, operational head of Air India in 1997-2010.  At this juncture, selling even part of Air India is far from certain.  Lohani declined to comment on the sale process. The prime minister's office and the civil aviation ministry also declined to comment. An Air India aircraft takes off from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad, India, July 7, 2017.Amit DaveBack to Tata? A committee of five senior federal ministers, led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is expected to meet this month and begin ironing out the finer details of the plan. Besides deciding about the size of the stake sale, the panel will set the bidding norms. It will also take a call on the carrier's debt, demerger and divestment of its three profit-making subsidiaries. Modi's office has said the government has no business being in hospitality and travel, suggesting the prime minister wants to sell as much of Air India as possible, the officials said. Analysts say the government may prefer to keep the airline in Indian hands. At least two potential Indian suitors – the Tata Sons conglomerate and IndiGo - have shown early interest. Slideshow (2 Images)In recent weeks, officials in Modi's office and from the civil aviation ministry met Ratan Tata, the patriarch of the $100 billion-a-year Tata Sons, to gauge the company’s interest in a deal, a close aide to Modi said. Tata would be an attractive buyer for the government. The company founded and operated Air India before it was nationalised in 1953.  Seems like Tata will come forward and make the best offer,  the aide said, adding the government would be keen to see that jobs are not lost. Tata, however, already has two other airline joint ventures in India, and it's not clear what parts of Air India it would be interested in. A Tata spokeswoman declined to comment. IndiGo said on Thursday it was interested in the international operations and in Air India Express, a low-cost carrier. Modi's office has told officials to work out exactly how much each of Air India's subsidiaries are worth to make it easier to break up the carrier if needed, two of the officials said. The government is expected to appoint outside consultants to help with the exercise. Anshuman Deb, aviation analyst at ICICI Securities, said splitting the airline will maximize value for the government.  Let us be realistic. It's very clear that a single buyer cannot buy an entire state-owned company,  said a senior aviation ministry official involved in the process.

Australia selected French naval contractor DCNS in April 2016 to build its fleet of 12 submarines, ahead of other offers from Japan and Germany, sealing one of the world's most lucrative defense contracts. At a joint press briefing with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, Turnbull said he would open the project office at the DCNS Cherbourg shipyard.  This is the largest and most ambitious military project in Australia’s history,  Turnbull told reporters at Élysée Palace in Paris on Saturday. Macron said France would do everything necessary to meet the requirements of the contract, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. DCNS was left reeling after details from more than 22,000 pages of documents relating to submarines it is building for India were published in The Australian newspaper, leading to concerns about its ability to protect sensitive data. Australia's new fleet of submarines is the centerpiece of its defense strategy unveiled in February 2016, which called for an increase in military spending of nearly A$30 billion over the next 10 years to protect strategic and trade interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The first submarines are expected to enter service in the early 2030s, with the remainder commissioned by 2050. Construction will be done primarily in the southern Australian city of Adelaide. Turnbull, whose visit to France came after a G20 summit in Hamburg, also suggested a free trade agreement could be struck between the Australia and the European Union (EU) by the end of 2019. “That is a realistic but ambitious objective,” he said. Australia and the EU agreed in November 2015 to start the process towards a comprehensive trade pact. Two-way trade between Australia and the EU was AU$95.6 billion in 2015-16, making it Australia’s second largest trading partner as well as its largest source of foreign investment. A removal of trade barriers would be a boon to Australian exporters, including its growing services sector which did business with Europe to the value of $10.4 billion in 2015–16.

Kirk expanded her lead to four shots with a 7-under-par 65 in the third round that left her at 20-under 196. Ashleigh Buhai of South Africa moved into solo second place at 16 under through 54 holes after matching Kirk's 65. Ayako Uehara of Japan also shot a third-round 65 and was tied for third with Jodi Ewart Shadoff of England, who posted a 66. The 35-year-old Kirk couldn't match her career-best 63 from Friday but remained on a roll. After a birdie-bogey start and another bogey at No. 5, she birdied eight of her final 13 holes and saved par on the closing hole by making a long putt.

The meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan on June 9, 2016, was the first confirmed private meeting between members of the president's inner circle and a Russian national, the newspaper reported, citing confidential government records and interviews with people familiar with the documents. Donald Trump Jr. confirmed the get-together in a statement, describing it as  a short introductory meeting  that focused mainly on the issue of child adoption. He said he also asked Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort to take part in the meeting. A lawyer for Kushner said Trump's son-in-law  briefly attended  the meeting. A federal special counsel and several congressional committees are investigating possible contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian representatives, as part of a larger probe into allegations that Moscow meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The Times article appeared a day after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the allegations of election meddling during the summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg, Germany.  Donald Trump Jr. said the meeting was held primarily to  discuss a popular program to help Americans adopt Russian children, which the Russian government had ended.

The Times said the Russian lawyer at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is known for campaigning against a U.S. law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law enraged Putin, who retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children, the newspaper reported.

Most of the last six months on his desk calendar is marked green, indicating visits to the 12 plants of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, where Desai is a senior quality control executive. Only one day is red - a day off. That's what is needed these days to satisfy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that standards are being met.  In this sector, you're only as good as your last inspection,  Desai said in his office in suburban Mumbai.      Often dubbed  the pharmacy of the world , India is home to the most FDA-approved plants outside of the United States and supplies about 40 percent of the $70 billion worth of generic drugs sold in the country. But sanctions and bans have badly damaged India's reputation and slowed growth in the $16 billion sector. Drug exports fell in the fiscal year ending in March 2017. More than 40 plants have been banned by the FDA for issues ranging from data fraud to hygiene since India's then-largest drugmaker Ranbaxy was pulled up for serious violations in 2008.  Drug companies have spent millions of dollars on training, new equipment and foreign consultants. Yet the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance of the top 20 firms says its members still need at least five more years to get manufacturing standards and data reliability up to scratch. The case of Lupin, whose shares are down about 27 percent since 2015 compared to a 13 percent drop in the Nifty pharma index, shows why. The FDA is in the next few months expected to clear Lupin's Goa plant, which supplies around a third of its U.S. sales, of problems found in 2015, Desai said.  However, the agency also published a new notice just last week citing issues with data storage at its plant in Pithampur, central India. If companies want to continue to sell into the world's biggest health care market, they must keep constant vigilance. Many in the industry expect to see consolidation among manufacturers after a wave of mergers among U.S. drug distributors and increasing price pressures.  A lot of companies will struggle to meet the requirements that are the need of the day, and I would expect to see additional consolidation on the supply side,  Lupin’s Chief Executive Vinita Gupta told analysts last month. Asked about Lupin's case, the FDA said in a statement it did not  comment on compliance matters , but said generally:  India’s regulatory infrastructure must keep pace to ensure that relevant quality and safety standards are met.   Form 483  India has its own standards body, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which maintains that its quality controls are stringent enough to ensure drugs are safe. Employees work at the pharmaceutical plant of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, in Verna, in the western state of Goa, India, June 9, 2017. Picture taken June 9, 2017.Danish Siddiqui India's standards are different,  CDSCO head G.N. Singh said in an interview in his New Delhi office.  Indian companies are compliant with our manufacturing standards. We cannot regulate them according to the U.S. standards.  The FDA has taken matters into its own hands and gradually expanded in India to more than a dozen full-time staff. Inspections are frequent and increasingly unannounced. If the agency finds problems, it issues a Form 483 – a notice outlining the violations - which if not resolved can lead to a  warning letter  and in worst case, a ban. Violations range from hygiene, such as rat traps and dirty laboratories, to inadequate controls on systems that store data, leaving it open to tampering. None of the violations the FDA has cited in India have explicitly said the drugs are unsafe, and when companies are banned by the FDA they can sell into other markets, including in the developing world, until the bans are lifted. There are also no studies showing that the drugs have harmed anyone in the world. But by definition, the notices are issued when the FDA finds conditions that might harm public health.      Slideshow (3 Images)Don't Tell Anyone Industry watchers say Lupin, which specializes in oral contraceptives and drugs for diabetes and hypertension, is doing better than most. So far none of its infractions have extended to a ban.  On a recent visit by Reuters to its Goa plant, blue-uniformed employees could be seen working on giant machines, then making notes in hardbound registers. These are being phased out as Lupin transitions to more secure e-files. Employees are often videotaped to ensure they follow standard operating procedure. Manufacturers have cut back to focus on quality over quantity: five years ago, Lupin was making one billion pills a month at one of its Goa plants. Now it makes just 450 million. Both the company and employees needed to be willing to acknowledge errors, Desai said. The first impulse in the past was often  don't tell anyone , he said.  We're humans after all, not robots. We make mistakes,   said Amol Kolatkar, a production head at the Goa site.     As recently as three years ago, training was a  formality , Desai said. Now, when an error is traced to an employee, the entire team undergoes fresh training.   I have worked at a pharma company before, but this is the first time I went through such a training,  said another Lupin quality control officer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  They told us a lot about the Lupin culture and quality, and also stressed on good manufacturing practices.  The quality control role is key.   They (Lupin) have had a practice where company’s quality heads report directly to Nilesh Gupta (the managing director),  said Amey Chalke, an analyst at HDFC Securities.  Some other companies have also started doing that now.       The companies also have to be willing to spend big. Lachman, PwC and Boston Consulting conduct mock audits at the Goa plant every three to six months, at a cost of up to $400 an hour.  These days the FDA is giving us 483 on small, small things,  a third quality control officer said.  So we are always auditing.

The interest rate could be a lot higher after three years, but there's also a chance that the interest would still be cheap because finance companies are competing fiercely,  said Fu, who works in Hong Kong's financial services industry.  There's risk but there's also an upside. It's a good investment opportunity.  With traditional financing drying up in Hong Kong at a time when property prices are at a record high, home buyers like Fu are looking to non-bank lenders, many of them the financing arms of developers, to get in on the boom. Under Hong Kong law, these  shadow banks  can loan legally as long as interest rates do not exceed 60 percent per annum, according to industry officials and an official document seen by Reuters.  The system is a life-saver for those who have found it harder to secure loans, particularly mortgages, due to curbs imposed by the central bank to dampen home prices, which are up 137 percent since the start of the financial crisis in 2008.  But it also puts the broader system at risk if property prices turn around or borrowers start to default, because many of these lenders have themselves raised financing by borrowing from big banks or selling bonds. Because they are not banks -- they do not take deposits -- shadow lenders in Hong Kong are monitored by the police, and not financial regulators.     The manager of one such lender said his firm, founded by a mainland Chinese entrepreneur, lends on average HK$8 million to HK$10 million for a first mortgage and up to HK$300 million for a villa, with down payments much smaller than a regular bank.  I can lend you 90 percent for a property, for example, no problem,  he told Reuters from his office in the Central business district, asking not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The share of shadow banks in Hong Kong's mortgage business is still small - in the low single digits - but industry officials say it is growing fast, up at least 30 to 40 percent a year over the last couple of years. That's no surprise given that mainstream lenders like HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) have capped mortgages at just 51 percent at the end of last year, according to Standard & Poor's. That was after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) gradually lowered the property financing ratio, raised interest rates, hiked the risk capital buffer for new loans and discouraged banks from making large loans to developers with big mortgage lending operations.  Regulators have got us to this situation,  said Richard Wong, a professor in the Hong Kong University's school of economics and finance.  The money lenders are not deposit-taking companies ... but that doesn't mean there is no risk because the (property) market could correct.  Monitoring Closely While non-bank financing companies play a major role in mortgage lending in many developed economies, regulators have been tightening their scrutiny of these lenders, especially after the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States. Visitors look from a balcony at a new flat in Park Yoho Genova, developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties, in Hong Kong, China July 3, 2017. Picture taken July 3, 2017.Bobby YipThe Hong Kong regulator, the HKMA, told Reuters it had given guidance to banks to ensure they boost their  credit risk management  when it comes lending to property developers.  The HKMA will continue to monitor the property and mortgage markets closely, and will introduce appropriate measures to safeguard the stability of the banking system as necessary,  it said in a statement.      In addition to the financing units of developers, another 1,800 entities have a license to operate in Hong Kong as money lenders, the bulk of them in mortgages, double the number five years ago, according to the official Companies Registry data.  Another 100 firms had applied for a money lender's license as of end-May this year, according to a review of data at the Hong Kong Companies Registry. Mortgage loans granted by the dozen or so financing units of Sino-Land Company Ltd (0083.HK) more than doubled in 2016 from the year before to HK$1.02 billion, according to its annual report, in a year when turnover nearly halved and profit dived by nearly 25 percent. Other top developers, including Cheung Kong Property Holdings Ltd (1113.HK), controlled by Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd (0016.HK) and Henderson Land Development Co Ltd (0012.HK) also have financing units. Loans from one of Sun Hung Kai financing arms for its latest development in the New Territories started at 80 percent of the property price and went up to 120 percent for people who already had a home and wanted to upgrade, according to its price list. About 5,000 people applied to buy the 234 units put on sale on July 1 in the first phase of the development, where a 721-sq-feet unit costs as much as HK$10 million. Interest rates from shadow lenders vary widely, but typically start at around 5 percent and go up to 20 percent or higher, versus 2-3 percent at regular banks, which also lend for longer terms of 25-30 years, industry sources said. Sun Hung Kai told Reuters it was always  prudent :  While the package helps our buyers, it does not affect the company's financial position as the loan exposure is very small and well-secured.  Sino-Land, Cheung Kong and Henderson did not respond to requests for comment.  The Hong Kong police, the de-facto regulator, said it did not have any data on buyer complaints against non-bank financing companies, but added that it maintained a  close liaison  with the financial industry.  Enforcement action will be taken by the police if there is evidence implicating any money lender engaged in illegal practices,  it said in a statement. Some bankers and analysts say the growth of shadow banking in the mortgage sector could be a ticking time bomb, especially if there's a correction in the market, as is widely expected.  The potential for defaults was also a concern although the  delinquency ratio in the main banking sector, at least, remains low at just 0.03 percent in May, unchanged from April, according to the HKMA's latest available data.

Desjardins, the largest association of credit unions in North America, on Friday temporarily suspended lending for such projects and may make the decision permanent, spokesman Jacques Bouchard told Reuters by telephone.  He said the lender would make a final decision in September. Dejardins, a backer of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd's high-profile expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline, has been evaluating its policy for such lending for months, Bouchard said.          If it makes the decision permanent, that would likely mean Desjardins would not help finance other major Canadian pipelines projects, including TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL and Energy East and Enbridge Inc's Line 3. Such a move would follow that of Dutch lender ING Groep NV, which has a long-standing policy of not funding projects directly related to oil sands, and is the latest sign that pipelines could have a harder time getting funding as banks face increasing pressure to back away. Patrick Bonin, a campaigner with the environmental group Greenpeace, praised Desjardins for temporarily halting pipeline funding, but called on the lender to make it permanent and reconsider its C$145 million ($113 million) commitment to Trans Mountain. Desjardins is among 24 financial institutions that agreed to lend money to a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Kinder Morgan Inc of Houston, according to regulatory filings. A coalition of more than 20 indigenous and environmental groups, including Greenpeace, in June called on 28 major banks to pull funding for Trans Mountain, citing the risk of pipeline spills and their potential contribution to climate change. ING, which was targeted by the coalition, clarified it will not fund any of the major Canadian pipelines. The same month, Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, sold investments in six companies that it says violate the Paris climate agreement, including TransCanada, in a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind.

{"news_time":"2017-07-08 21:03:00","news_title":"U.S. corn yields cannot fall too far if heat is a no-show -Braun","keywords":"United States,US,USA,CORN,BRAUN,Commentaries,Corn,Precipitation,Wind / Hurricanes / Typhoons / Tornadoes,Disasters / Accidents,Soybean,English,Graphics,Temperature,Grains,Embargoed,Reports,United States","sector":"","content":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Corn traders have been back and forth for a month now on whether the weather forecasts are threatening to the U.S. crop, but potentially damaging hot temperatures have been absent since mid-June. The forecast for the next two weeks is largely devoid of heat but is also lacking rainfall, which is not viewed favorably by the market as many areas of the Corn Belt have had below-normal precipitation in recent weeks. But without a significant heat event in the forecast through the first three weeks of July, when corn is pollinating, national corn yield is unlikely to fall too far below the long-term trend - despite the expected dryness. Most of the U.S. Corn Belt has not dealt with unseasonable heat since the first half of June and notably cooler temperatures have prevailed ever since. Weather forecasts as of Wednesday call for the continuation of average-to-cooler conditions for the next two weeks – but without abundant rainfall. The situation in the Dakotas is different, though, as farmers there are dealing with a significant drought that has been laced with frequent bouts of extreme heat. And unfortunately, considerable relief may not be on its way anytime soon. Some weather forecasters have been calling for widespread heat to return – and possibly stick around – at some point this month. But weather models have not yet validated the forecasters since the heat has remained on the western fringe of the Corn Belt, and Chicago corn futures have struggled to move much higher as a result.       How Far Below? Assuming that for the next month or two significant heat remains largely absent from the core Corn Belt - which extends roughly from the Dakotas in the west to Ohio in the east - national yield in the vicinity of 167 or 168 bushels per acre is plausible even if it remains dry.  Final corn yield has fallen below the U.S. Department of Agriculture's initial trend yield 10 times since 1993. July and August temperatures were average or below average in only three of those years, one being 1993, which is among the country’s worst corn harvests.  Further investigation and some hindsight re-evaluation of USDA’s past trend yields would suggest that given the state of the 2017 corn crop and the weather forecasts as of early July, final yield would be unlikely to fall more than 3 or 4 percentage points below USDA’s trend of 170.7 bpa – everything else being equal. A loss of 4 percent would place 2017 yield at 164 bpa, well off last year’s record of 174.6 bpa, though the comfortable domestic carryout levels north of 2 billion bushels would certainly limit the impact of a lower yield.  But a yield in the mid-160 bpa range would surely cut down on the new-crop carryout and place just a little more pressure on the 2018 harvest to perform in order for the stocks to avoid being pared down even further.      2017 Wild Cards North and South Dakota have undoubtedly drawn the short straw this year in terms of weather, and national yield could be further affected based on how far the Northern Plains crop falls. South Dakota grows 6 percent of the U.S. corn crop and North Dakota accounts for just over 3 percent. South Dakota corn yields typically come in around 9 percent below the national figure while yields in North Dakota land closer to 20 percent below. Aside from the hot and dry forecast that continues to plague the Dakotas, the soil moisture situation is already fairly dire. North Dakota soils are among the driest since August 2008 and South Dakota has not been this dry since May 2013. A freeze event also moved through late in June, piling on the problems for the young corn. As of July 2, some 42 percent of the South Dakota corn crop was rated in good or excellent condition. In North Dakota, it was 55 percent, well below the national rating of 68 percent.    Another unknown right now is in the Eastern Corn Belt, where good-to-excellent ratings have been well below previous years from the start. Indiana in particular – which grows 7 percent of the national crop – has had particularly low ratings despite having what has seemed like decent weather. Some 47 percent of the Indiana corn is in good or excellent condition, up slightly from 46 percent in the week prior. Ratings have climbed more notably in No. 2 Illinois and Ohio, but are still below last year’s levels.  Many farmers in Illinois have wanted a good rain for a while now. Showers and storms have been moving through the state over the past several weeks, but the sporadic and localized nature of the events means that while some growers have finally received the needed relief, a lot of others have not been so lucky. The issue of variable rainfall has also prevailed in parts of the Western Belt, as June precipitation fell short of normal in many spots across top grower Iowa.  If the dry pockets within the Corn Belt add up to a sufficiently large area, lower yields potentially observed in those areas may drag another bushel or two out of national yield if the impact becomes severe enough (reut.rs/2sMIiT0).

Back in May funds were beating a collective retreat from the London zinc market after a second failed attempt at the big-number $3,000-per tonne resistance level. The London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month price troughed at $2,427.50 on June 7, since when it has bounced back to a current $2,783.00.  Funds have returned with a vengeance, according to LME broker Marex Spectron, which estimates they have gone from net short at the start of June to net long. Indeed at over 20 percent of open interest speculative length is back to levels last seen in January.  What's caused this sharp shift in positioning?  The short answer is LME stocks. While the headline number continues to tick lower, now down by 146,600, or 34 percent, on the start of the year,  live  on-warrant tonnage has slumped to levels not seen since 2007.  There were 109,100 tonnes of net new cancellations over the course of June, leaving on-warrant inventory standing at a depleted 70,350 tonnes.  LME time-spreads have tightened accordingly, the benchmark cash-to-three-months period trading close to level after being in relatively comfortable $19-per tonne contango just a month ago.  Disappearing visible inventory has rekindled zinc's stop-start bull narrative of supply shortfall.  Fooled Again?  LME inventory levels have been a false friend for zinc's many bull admirers in recent times.  Stocks have for years now been highly concentrated in New Orleans, a location that has seen mass movement between on- and off-market storage driven not by physical market but by financing drivers.  The most recent manifestation was the appearance of 22,100 tonnes of zinc in LME sheds in New Orleans at the start of May.  Since then, however, total inflow into the LME storage system has amounted to just 125 tonnes and that at Port Klang in Malaysia.  There are still grounds for caution, particularly in the form of the large short position sitting on the LME's July prime prompt date (July 19).  Representing between 30 and 40 percent of open interest <0#LME-FBR>, will it be closed out, rolled or physically delivered?  We won't have to wait long to find out, but countering the potential for more smoke and mirrors is a real tightening in the zinc supply chain in the North American market Although it's dropped out of the headlines, the strike at the CEZ refinery in Canada, North America's second-largest producer of refined zinc, is rumbling on into its fifth month.  CEZ is majority owned by the Noranda Income Fund (NIF_u.TO) but is in essence a tolling plant for Swiss powerhouse Glencore and members of Canada's United Steelworkers union were making their views heard at Glencore's annual meeting on May 24.  Noranda Income Fund has been tight-lipped about the impact. Its last official comment in March, one month into the strike, was that it was maintaining production at 50-60 percent of 275,000-tonne per year capacity.  First-quarter production, only partly reflecting the impact of the Feb. 12 walk-out, slid to just over 50,000 tonnes from 73,000 tonnes in the previous quarter.  Second-quarter results are now pending but the ongoing loss of units is somewhere in the mix at New Orleans, which holds the only LME-registered zinc stocks in the United States.   Shanghai Stocks Slump There's more in the mix as well.  Everyone's watching China. As the world's largest processor of mined concentrates into refined zinc, the country is on the front-line of the tightening in the raw materials segment of the supply chain.  The collective betting is that it is only a matter of time before China's import demand heats up as domestic production fails to keep pace with demand.  That hasn't happened yet.  Refined zinc imports are running at subdued levels. Despite an acceleration in April and May, the cumulative year-to-date tally is 138,700 tonnes, down 46 percent on last year's levels and 2016 wasn't a bumper import year either.  That said, there are signs of stress in China's zinc market.  Stocks held in Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) warehouses have, like the LME, been rapidly depleted since the start of the year.  Despite a small week-on-week bounce to 66,947 tonnes, the headline figure has fallen by 85,877 tonnes since January. The last time ShFE stocks were this low was all the way back in 2009, when the Shanghai zinc contract was still in its infancy. National refined metal production was down by almost 10 percent in May with several large operators taking maintenance downtime.  Zinc concentrate imports have surprised on the upside with inbound flows up 25 percent so far this year.  That partly reflects strong imports from Peru (up 40 percent) but also higher imports from second-tier suppliers such as Russia (up 218 percent), Myanmar (up 149 percent) and Iran (up 55 percent).  The overall impression is of a smelter sector that is actively thrifting and simultaneously trying to tap new sources of supply.  Hoarding physical metal in anticipation of stronger Chinese zinc import demand is the other dimension of the LME stocks picture.  Pendulum Swings The zinc pendulum has swung from poor technicals to constructive fundamentals over the space of the last month and the funds are responding by getting back in on the long side.  There is still a lot of uncertainty out there as to the real state of play in the physical market and LME stock levels are only one component of the puzzle and an historically unreliable one at that.  But at current levels the London zinc market is starting to look like an increasingly tight space, particularly for short-position holders.  But there is one in particular, that one sitting on the July date, that merits attention. Its actions will determine the next swing of the funds-fundamentals pendulum.

The country has been for years battling contamination from fertilizer run-offs, heavy metals and untreated sewage. A survey in 2015 showed nearly two thirds of China's underground water and a third of its surface water was unfit for human contact.  To reverse this, China has pledged to lay 126,000 kilometers of new sewage pipes by 2020, enough to circle the globe three times, and raise urban wastewater treatment by 50 million cubic meters a day, equal to 20,000 Olympic-size pools. This has opened the floodgates to sewage specialists, like Israel's Emefcy (EMC.AX), RWL Water - controlled by Ron Lauder from Estee Lauder (EL.N) and France's Veolia (VIE.PA), who want to grab a share of the market with China's annual environmental spend estimated at 3 trillion yuan ($441 billion) over the next five years.  Right now the problem of wastewater from agriculture and the countryside is very serious and wastewater treatment work is a weak link,  said Tong Weidong, vice-chairman of the legal work commission of China's parliament. Recently, there were reports of villages dumping sewage into the reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam, the world's biggest power station spanning the Yangtze River in central Hubei province. But change is afoot, Tong said. Local officials will be forced to improve sewage capacity under new legislation that make them directly responsible for water quality. Cities need to hike treatment rates to 95 percent by 2020 from 92 percent in 2015, while rural regions in central and western China need to reach 50 percent.  The market is massive,  said Wong-Jin Yong, China CEO for Emefcy, which estimates the potential market opportunity in Beijing and nearby provinces at over $1 billion. Foreign players have been in China for a while, such as Veolia that has water projects across the country, but the focus on a large-scale clean-up has gained impetus recently. China's latest five-year plan released in 2016 emphasizes tackling pollution, while in an action plan published in 2015 the government vowed to improve water quality nationwide by 2030, pledging to spend billions of dollars.

Firms Rush in Emefcy plans to put eight small-scale sewage treatment units into operation in China by the end of this year and is currently building a local factory. It has installed a mobile plant around the size of a van at a school in southern Changzhou and runs another at a sewage works in Wuxi. Emefcy says its small-scale units can treat 20,000 liters a day, take two months to install and have significantly lower energy costs, making them ideal for the rural market.

They will be competing with local players such as state-run Beijing Enterprises Water Group and China Water Investment, and others like Beijing Sound Environment (0967.HK) and Kangda International (6136.HK). Stricter environmental standards are drawing in companies of all sizes, but big state-owned firms still dominate major projects, said Xue Xiaohu, general manager at Jiangsu Greenway that sells water treatment technology to the textiles industry. China has promised to give environmentally friendly projects a leg up by providing banks more incentives to lend and encouraging green financing. Offshore players have the added hurdle of navigating local rules and typically also need to team up with local partners.  There are challenges in dealing with local governments and that's why our partners kick in,  said Yong from Emefcy, which has a number of Chinese partners including Zhejiang Provincial Energy Group and Jiangsu Jinzi.  Technology is our core skill and we will focus on that.

Most of the last six months on his desk calendar is marked green, indicating visits to the 12 plants of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, where Desai is a senior quality control executive. Only one day is red - a day off. That's what is needed these days to satisfy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that standards are being met.  In this sector, you're only as good as your last inspection,  Desai said in his office in suburban Mumbai.      Often dubbed  the pharmacy of the world , India is home to the most FDA-approved plants outside of the United States and supplies about 40 percent of the $70 billion worth of generic drugs sold in the country. But sanctions and bans have badly damaged India's reputation and slowed growth in the $16 billion sector. Drug exports fell in the fiscal year ending in March 2017. More than 40 plants have been banned by the FDA for issues ranging from data fraud to hygiene since India's then-largest drugmaker Ranbaxy was pulled up for serious violations in 2008.  Drug companies have spent millions of dollars on training, new equipment and foreign consultants. Yet the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance of the top 20 firms says its members still need at least five more years to get manufacturing standards and data reliability up to scratch. The case of Lupin, whose shares are down about 27 percent since 2015 compared to a 13 percent drop in the Nifty pharma index, shows why. The FDA is in the next few months expected to clear Lupin's Goa plant, which supplies around a third of its U.S. sales, of problems found in 2015, Desai said.  However, the agency also published a new notice just last week citing issues with data storage at its plant in Pithampur, central India. If companies want to continue to sell into the world's biggest health care market, they must keep constant vigilance. Many in the industry expect to see consolidation among manufacturers after a wave of mergers among U.S. drug distributors and increasing price pressures.  A lot of companies will struggle to meet the requirements that are the need of the day, and I would expect to see additional consolidation on the supply side,  Lupin’s Chief Executive Vinita Gupta told analysts last month. Asked about Lupin's case, the FDA said in a statement it did not  comment on compliance matters , but said generally:  India’s regulatory infrastructure must keep pace to ensure that relevant quality and safety standards are met.   Form 483  India has its own standards body, the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which maintains that its quality controls are stringent enough to ensure drugs are safe. Employees work at the pharmaceutical plant of Lupin, India's No. 2 drugmaker, in Verna, in the western state of Goa, India, June 9, 2017. Picture taken June 9, 2017.Danish Siddiqui India's standards are different,  CDSCO head G.N. Singh said in an interview in his New Delhi office.  Indian companies are compliant with our manufacturing standards. We cannot regulate them according to the U.S. standards.  The FDA has taken matters into its own hands and gradually expanded in India to more than a dozen full-time staff. Inspections are frequent and increasingly unannounced. If the agency finds problems, it issues a Form 483 – a notice outlining the violations - which if not resolved can lead to a  warning letter  and in worst case, a ban. Violations range from hygiene, such as rat traps and dirty laboratories, to inadequate controls on systems that store data, leaving it open to tampering. None of the violations the FDA has cited in India have explicitly said the drugs are unsafe, and when companies are banned by the FDA they can sell into other markets, including in the developing world, until the bans are lifted. There are also no studies showing that the drugs have harmed anyone in the world. But by definition, the notices are issued when the FDA finds conditions that might harm public health.      Slideshow (3 Images)Don't Tell Anyone Industry watchers say Lupin, which specializes in oral contraceptives and drugs for diabetes and hypertension, is doing better than most. So far none of its infractions have extended to a ban.  On a recent visit by Reuters to its Goa plant, blue-uniformed employees could be seen working on giant machines, then making notes in hardbound registers. These are being phased out as Lupin transitions to more secure e-files. Employees are often videotaped to ensure they follow standard operating procedure. Manufacturers have cut back to focus on quality over quantity: five years ago, Lupin was making one billion pills a month at one of its Goa plants. Now it makes just 450 million. Both the company and employees needed to be willing to acknowledge errors, Desai said. The first impulse in the past was often  don't tell anyone , he said.  We're humans after all, not robots. We make mistakes,   said Amol Kolatkar, a production head at the Goa site.     As recently as three years ago, training was a  formality , Desai said. Now, when an error is traced to an employee, the entire team undergoes fresh training.   I have worked at a pharma company before, but this is the first time I went through such a training,  said another Lupin quality control officer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  They told us a lot about the Lupin culture and quality, and also stressed on good manufacturing practices.  The quality control role is key.   They (Lupin) have had a practice where company’s quality heads report directly to Nilesh Gupta (the managing director),  said Amey Chalke, an analyst at HDFC Securities.  Some other companies have also started doing that now.       The companies also have to be willing to spend big. Lachman, PwC and Boston Consulting conduct mock audits at the Goa plant every three to six months, at a cost of up to $400 an hour.  These days the FDA is giving us 483 on small, small things,  a third quality control officer said.  So we are always auditing.

The investigation was ordered by President Donald Trump in April under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and could clear the way for restrictions on steel imports. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross is expected to announce the outcome of the steel inquiry after Trump has spoken with G20 leaders at the July 7-8 summit in Germany. A decision that results in a material reduction in the current level of domestic steel imports could provide a near-term boost to shares of U.S. steel companies, according to Wall Street analysts. Recent trading data in options on top steel companies, including United States Steel Corp, Nucor Corp and AK Steel Holding Corp show traders are counting on some good news.  Everything looks pretty bullish. Every factor you would look at is sort of aligned in the same direction,  said Jim Strugger, MKM Partners derivatives strategist.  Traders have shown a marked preference for loading up on call options. Calls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future and usually are used to place bets on shares rising, while put options convey the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. For U.S. Steel Corp, there are 1.1 calls open for each open put contract, close to the most in more than five years, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data. Other steel stocks also exhibit similarly elevated positioning in call contracts.  They are not trying to pick a winner within the industry. It seems like it is more of a sector bet,  said Steve Claussen, vice president of trade strategy at E-Trade Financial in Chicago. Much of the bullish positioning is concentrated in contracts set to expire over the next two weeks.  The implied expectation is that you are expecting a short-term move very quickly. These are definitely event-driven trades in my opinion,  Claussen said. Several of these steel companies are set to report quarterly results before the end of July. Trump's election initially boosted steel stocks, with the S&P; 1500 steel index surging 36 percent in the month after the Nov. 8 vote. The index has given up most of those gains and is up 10 percent since the election.

State oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) has proposed selling a 9 percent stake in the San Cristobal field to ONGC Videsh (OVL), a subsidiary of India's state-owned top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.NS), the sources said this week. ONGC Videsh already holds a 40 percent stake in the field, which produces around 22,000-23,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil. While the amount of the sale would be relatively modest, according to analysts, any extra income would be welcome for PDVSA. Venezuela, struggling under triple-digit inflation and Soviet-style product shortages as its socialist economy unravels, has been hit hard by the falling price of oil, its economic lifeline. The OPEC nation's oil output has slipped and PDVSA PDVSA.UL is struggling to maintain investment in its oilfields, which hold the world's largest crude reserves.  The state company already offered Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) a stake in a joint venture in an extra-heavy crude project in the Orinoco Belt, sources told Reuters in March. The sources, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak about the negotiations, said PDVSA was still negotiating with ONGC and no deal was certain.  Under Venezuela's hydrocarbon law, the state must maintain more than 50 percent of all oil ventures, hence PDVSA can only offer up to 9 percent to the Indian firm.   ONGC is still evaluating the options,  one of the sources said, adding the purchase could be challenging given the Indian company's revenues are suffering due to lower oil prices. ONGC Videsh managing director N. K. Verma declined to comment. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Legal Quandary Another potential complication is Venezuela's murky legal framework during a power struggle between the opposition and the unpopular leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro.  A controversial decision by the Supreme Court in April gave the government the right to cut oil deals but the constitution mandates that the National Assembly, controlled by the opposition, must approve contracts of  national public interest.   Opposition lawmakers say oil deals which bypass the legislature are therefore null. They have been warning foreign companies away from what they say are firesale deals that throw a lifeline to Maduro's government.  Any change to the shareholding structure of a joint venture should be approved by (congress),  wrote Jose Guerra, president of the congressional finance committee, in a message to Reuters.  Asked if such a change would be approved by the legislature, he responded  I don't think so. The government has refused to present those issues to (Congress).  The business climate remains poor in the volatile and violent South American country, which is laboring under shortages of food and medicine. More than three months of protests have left at least 90 people dead.  Recent comments by a Socialist Party candidate about a new legislative superbody created by Maduro have also spooked some in the oil sector. Hermann Escarra, a constitutional lawyer, suggested during a speech at PDVSA that the future constituent assembly could rewrite parts of the constitution that allow joint ventures with foreign oil companies.  Still, as Maduro's government has no easy sources of financing beyond the oil sector, foreign oil companies stand to get a good price for assets on sale.  The second source said there was no clear figure for the potential deal, although a decision was expected this year.  Although it is tricky to estimate a price without full details, a 9 percent stake in San Cristobal could be worth $50 million to $100 million, estimated Luisa Palacios, senior managing director at Medley Global Advisors. She based her estimate on Rosneft paying $500 million to raise its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture last year.  The number is likely to be on the lower end of that range due to Venezuela's political turbulence and business climate, she added.  Boost to Bilateral Relations?  The potential deal could also help once closer relations between Caracas and New Delhi that have taken a hit as Venezuela's economy unraveled. PDVSA spent at least a decade trying to build business ties and boost shipments to refineries in India.  But the Caracas-based company was forced to abandon the fight for coveted market share there because of its declining output and heavy obligations under oil-for-loan deals with China and Russia, a Reuters analysis showed in March. Changing trade routes, triggered by rising shale oil production in the United States, turned New Delhi to cheaper oil from Africa and the Middle East. Venezuela's downward spiral also hurt Indian oil companies, which are owed late dividends.  There are signs the situation may be improving, however.      After years of negotiations, PDVSA last year agreed to clear a pending dividend of $540 million on ONGC Videsh's investment in San Cristobal. In return, the first source said, ONGC Videsh was now aiming to arrange a $325 million loan for development of the block this year.

Desjardins, the largest association of credit unions in North America, on Friday temporarily suspended lending for such projects and may make the decision permanent, spokesman Jacques Bouchard told Reuters by telephone.  He said the lender would make a final decision in September. Dejardins, a backer of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd's high-profile expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline, has been evaluating its policy for such lending for months, Bouchard said.          If it makes the decision permanent, that would likely mean Desjardins would not help finance other major Canadian pipelines projects, including TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL and Energy East and Enbridge Inc's Line 3. Such a move would follow that of Dutch lender ING Groep NV, which has a long-standing policy of not funding projects directly related to oil sands, and is the latest sign that pipelines could have a harder time getting funding as banks face increasing pressure to back away. Patrick Bonin, a campaigner with the environmental group Greenpeace, praised Desjardins for temporarily halting pipeline funding, but called on the lender to make it permanent and reconsider its C$145 million ($113 million) commitment to Trans Mountain. Desjardins is among 24 financial institutions that agreed to lend money to a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Canada, majority owned by Kinder Morgan Inc of Houston, according to regulatory filings. A coalition of more than 20 indigenous and environmental groups, including Greenpeace, in June called on 28 major banks to pull funding for Trans Mountain, citing the risk of pipeline spills and their potential contribution to climate change. ING, which was targeted by the coalition, clarified it will not fund any of the major Canadian pipelines. The same month, Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, sold investments in six companies that it says violate the Paris climate agreement, including TransCanada, in a decision environmentalists believe is the first of its kind.

But the at-bat that impressed his manager, Brian Snitker, was the grind-it-out appearance that became a run-scoring single in the ninth as the Atlanta Braves crushed the first-place Washington Nationals 13-0 on Saturday. It was the first time this year the Nationals were shut out.  He's a pro. He's a pro's pro,  Snitker said of Markakis, who had three hits, scored four runs and made a diving catch in right field.  He does everything the right way, regardless of the situation. That was a really good at-bat.

Kurt Suzuki (two hits) had an RBI single in the second before Teheran followed with one of his own to give the Braves a 2-0 lead off Strasburg. Nationals nemesis Freddie Freeman had an RBI double in the third to make it 3-0. Two batters after Strasburg was hit by a comebacker, Suzuki had an RBI single and later in the inning Teheran slashed a two-run single to make it 6-0. Strasburg allowed four runs (one earned) in the third and was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the inning. Atlanta All-Star Ender Inciarte delivered an RBI single in the sixth off Tanner Roark for a 7-0 advantage. Markakis lined that homer into the Nationals bullpen in right off Roark to make it 8-0 in the seventh. Inciarte drove in a run with a groundout in the eighth. Markakis had that impressive RBI single in the ninth and Matt Adams crushed a 0-2 pitch from Sammy Solis for a three-run homer to make it 13-0. Johan Camargo was 3-for-4 and Matt Kemp also had two hits for the Braves, who are 4-2 in Washington this year. The Braves also got strong defensive play from second baseman Brandon Phillips.  You know how he is. He showed it today,  Markakis said.  Couple of big plays right there. We made some good defensive plays. Julio threw one of his best games this year.  Roark made his first relief outing of the year after 17 starts. He took over in the fourth and gave up three runs in five innings. The second-place Braves improved to 42-44 while the Nationals fell to 51-36.  Everyone is good to go tomorrow,  said Snitker, whose team has won two of three in the series.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Alex Cobb had spectacular defense behind him -- on one play, his own glove, literally, behind him -- and held the Boston Red Sox to two hits as the Tampa Bay Rays held on for a 1-0 win on Saturday afternoon at Tropicana Field.  What the defense was able to do behind me -- Hechy (shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria) was making two of the top 10 plays of the night for (ESPN's) SportsCenter,  Cobb said. Cobb (7-6) pitched a gem, giving up only two singles while striking out three to outduel defending Cy Young Award winner Rick Porcello. Tampa Bay (46-43) is assured of a winning record at the All-Star break while Boston (50-38) lost to its division rival for the second time in three days, with the series finale coming Sunday. Rays closer Alex Colome came in for the final four outs for his 24th save, matching Minnesota's Brandon Kintzler for the American League lead. Colome gave up a walk and a double in the ninth -- the first time the Red Sox had runners in scoring position -- but got out of the jam, first by striking out Hanley Ramirez. After an intentional walk to load the bases, Colome got Chris Young to pop out to shallow left-center field to end the game with the tying run at third. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RaysBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchCobb held the Red Sox to two hits in 7 2/3 innings -- Xander Bogaerts had an infield single in the first inning, and Mookie Betts had a single up the middle in the third. From there, Cobb retired 11 batters in a row until Mitch Moreland reached on an error in the seventh. He fielded a comebacker behind his back, getting a key out to help his own cause.  I think his determination has been the most impressive,  manager Kevin Cash said of Cobb's recovery from 2015 Tommy John surgery.  You find out a lot about a guy when they're coming through an injury and how they handle that. He was determined he was going to get it right.  After giving up runs in five straight appearances entering this series, Colome earned saves in both wins by Tampa Bay. Cobb had his second dominant outing in three starts -- he had eight shutout innings on June 27 in what ended up a 10-inning win over the Pittsburgh Pirates, but he had allowed six earned runs in his last start before bouncing back nicely. Porcello (4-11) nearly matched Cobb, holding Tampa Bay to one run in eight innings. The Rays scrapped together their only run in the second -- Steven Souza and Brad Miller singled to start off the inning and Shane Peterson was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Jesus Sucre's sacrifice fly made it 1-0, but Porcello got Mallex Smith to strike out to end the inning.  Hats off to Alex Cobb. He threw an incredible ballgame,  Porcello said.  When their guy is throwing that well, runs are at a premium. It was a tough one, but we'll get back at it tomorrow.  The Red Sox dropped to 2-22 this season when scoring less than three runs -- they've been shut out seven times in 2017. The Rays got just their second shutout of the season, following a May 25 game against the Los Angeles Angels.  It was a great game from both sides,  Boston's Mookie Betts said.  You can't ask for a better pitcher's duel than that.  The two teams split the first two games of the series with lopsided wins.

The blazes were scattered across hundreds of kilometers of the interior portion of the province, burning through bone-dry forests used for logging and rolling grasslands that are home to ranches. High temperatures and winds complicated firefighting efforts.   The weather situation is not favorable,  said John Rustad, provincial minister in charge of firefighting operations.

The spate of wildfires began on Friday, when 138 new fires were reported, most of them sparked by lightning in dry electrical storms. No injuries or deaths were reported. Provincial officials said they did not know how much damage had been caused, though evacuees said they had left behind farm animals and witnessed destruction of homes and other buildings.

The San Diego Padres were stymied by starter Aaron Nola for much of Saturday, but the two runs they scored in the seventh inning made the difference in a 2-1 win over the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park.  No offense again,  Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.  It was a tough loss.  The Phillies (28-58), who set a club record with 23 one-run losses before the All-Star break, have lost five in a row while the Padres (38-49) have won five of six. San Diego will try for a sweep Sunday before Major League Baseball pauses for the All-Star break. Nola (6-6) was staked to a 1-0 lead thanks to a fifth-inning solo homer by Maikel Franco. The right-hander was cruising through six innings, having thrown just 74 pitches through the shutout frames with six strikeouts and one hit allowed. At one point, he retired 12 straight between the second and sixth innings. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at PhilliesSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchHunter Renfroe doubled down the right-field line to start the seventh. Two batters later, Carlos Asuaje laced a two-out double off the wall in right-center field to tie the game at 1-1. Austin Hedges, who homered twice in San Diego's 4-3 win in Philadelphia Friday, singled home Asuaje for the eventual winning run. While Nola had his afternoon spoiled by a few mistakes, the late-inning magic for San Diego gave starter Jhoulys Chacin (8-7) a deserved victory. The righty allowed one run on just three hits in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two.  He was really good,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  He located when he needed to locate, made one mistake all day to Maikel Franco. ... Outside of that, he kept us in the game and he was getting matched pitch-for-pitch with Nola over there.  The Phillies, after Nola surrendered the lead in the top of the inning, put runners on second and third with one out on a Tommy Joseph double in the bottom of the seventh. But reliever Kirby Yates got Franco to pop out to shortstop and induced an inning-ending lineout to left field off the bat of Andrew Knapp to escape trouble. Lefty Ryan Buchter shut down the Phillies in the eighth, paving the way for Brandon Maurer to earn his 19th save. Chacin didn't allow a hit for the first three innings and faced the minimum through 4 1/3 before Franco stepped into the box in the fifth and launched his 13th homer on a no-doubt blast to left field. Chacin then retired the next six batters he faced before a walk to Nick Williams and Joseph's double ended his outing.  I didn't feel my stuff was that (good) today but I made some good pitches,  Chacin said.  Keeping the ball down was the biggest thing. Nola was pitching a really good game so I knew it was going to be a close game. I was trying to keep my team in there and give them a chance to score some runs for me.  Nola had his fourth straight positive outing. Just three weeks ago he had a 4.76 ERA. His ERA dropped to 3.59 after allowing two runs, four hits and nine strikeouts in eight innings. Going into the All-Star break, it's as good a finish to the first half as he could have hoped.  Nola was as sharp as I've seen anybody all year,  the opposing manager Green said. Said Mackanin:  Nola was great. What a performance. He's been good for a while now.  Saturday, though, it wasn't enough.

Miley overcame his recent issues -- mainly control of his pitches -- to provide a boost for Baltimore on Saturday. Jonathan Schoop hit a towering two-run homer, Manny Machado reached base three times and Miley bounced back with a strong effort on the mound in the Orioles' 5-1 win against the Minnesota Twins.  It's a good way to end it,  Showalter said of Miley.  That's why these guys are what they are, they don't run away from their struggles. They want to get back and make the contributions that they're asked to make. That's very typical of Wade.  Mark Trumbo added a solo homer for Baltimore. Machado had two hits, a walk, two runs scored and an RBI a day after his four-hit, two-homer performance on Friday as the Orioles snapped a five-game losing streak and beat Minnesota for the first time in six games this season. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at TwinsBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchMiley (4-7) earned his first win in four starts, giving up eight hits and three walks. The only blemish on his line came from a solo homer by All-Star slugger Miguel Sano. Miley had allowed 29 earned runs and passed out 16 walks in 22 1/3 innings in his previous six starts after starting the season with a 2.82 ERA after 11 starts.  Definitely a lot better, something to build on,  Miley said.  Felt like I was in a way better place out there mechanically. Staying back over the rubber longer and it allowed me to do more out front. Definitely, it's something positive.  Adalberto Mejia (4-4) allowed four runs on five hits and three walks in 6 2/3 innings for the Twins. He struck out six batters.  Mejia had a good day,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said.  He hung the changeup to Schoop there, but other than that I thought he pitched fairly well. He got us deep into the game. We couldn't solve their pitching enough to get enough runs to get back into the game.  Miley wasn't particularly sharp but managed his way out of big innings. Minnesota left 10 runners on base through the first six innings and was 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position. The Twins had at least two runners on base in four of Miley's innings. Sano's homer with two outs in the third opened the scoring and Robbie Grossman and Kennys Vargas followed with singles, but Miley got Eddie Rosario to ground out to end the threat. Vargas grounded out in the fifth after Miley walked Sano and Grossman. On the other side, Mejia might have deserved a better fate. He retired nine batters in a row before Machado singled in the fourth. Schoop, named an All-Star for the first time this week, followed with his 18th homer to the third deck in left field, an estimated 455 feet.  Everything worked today,  Schoop said.  We're looking for it to work tomorrow. Win tomorrow and then get a little bit of a break, and come into the second half stronger. Better than the first half so we got to push for the playoffs.  Joey Rickard and Machado hit back-to-back doubles to open the sixth against Mejia. Machado plated Rickard and came around to score when Trumbo's ground ball went off third baseman Eduardo Escobar's glove.  He says he feels a lot better,  Mejia said through an interpreter.  That's what his work is for. He's listening to coaches. He prepared himself really good. That's why he's getting stronger every day, and everything's coming together.

Hours after his pre-dawn transfer from the Ramo Verde military jail, Lopez appeared over a wall of his Caracas house, waving the Venezuelan flag and punching the air before a crowd of supporters who cheered and cried upon seeing him. In a message released by his party, the 46-year-old hardliner urged opposition supporters to continue street protests against President Nicolas Maduro, which are in their fourth month and have led to at least 90 deaths.   If maintaining my fight for freedom means running the risk of returning to a cell in Ramo Verde, I am more than happy to take it,  he said in the message read by Freddy Guevara, the No. 2 in Lopez's Popular Will party.  Today, I am a prisoner in my house, but so are the Venezuelan people. What kept me going in the toughest days was knowing that whatever suffering I endured was nothing compared to our people.  Lopez's release, aided by foreign pressure, gave some rare cheer to Venezuela's opposition who have otherwise seen Maduro give few concessions in their demands for freedom of activists, general elections and fixes for an economic crisis.  Despite being under house arrest, he showed his face to the country,  said Maria Garcia, 36, a business consultant, outside his house.  What we need to do now is stay in the street, because we need to achieve not just the freedom of Leopoldo but also the freedom of the Venezuelan people.  Fresh opposition street rallies were planned for Sunday. Presidential Ambition A photogenic, Harvard-educated former mayor and economist, Lopez would likely be a popular opposition presidential candidate if able to run in any future vote.  Related CoverageVenezuela's Lopez waves to supporters outside home: witnessesHe is serving a sentence of nearly 14 years. While the socialist Maduro may be calculating Lopez's return home will ease pressure on him, opposition leaders presented it as a triumph for their protest strategy and a sign the government was caving.   It was not clear, however, how Lopez's presence at home could materially weaken Maduro, who is plowing ahead with a plan to create a parliamentary superbody that will be able to rewrite the constitution and even dissolve state institutions. The opposition has long called Lopez a political prisoner, and leaders around the world, including U.S. President Donald Trump, had been pressing for his full freedom. The U.S. State Department called the decision a  significant step in the right direction,  while urging full freedom for Lopez and another 400 opposition prisoners. Maduro for years opposed measures to release Lopez, describing him as a dangerous terrorist who sought to overthrow him through street violence. Government supporters also often note Lopez's role in a short-lived 2002 coup against the late former leader Hugo Chavez when he helped arrest a minister. Venezuela's opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, who has been granted house arrest after more than three years in jail, salutes supporters, in Caracas, Venezuela July 8, 2017.Andres Martinez CasaresOn Saturday, Maduro extended an olive branch of sorts.  I as head of state accept the (Supreme Court's) decision, and what's more, I support the decision. And you all know my absolute and profound differences with LL,  Maduro said, referring to Lopez only by his initials.  God willing this decision ... will be understood, and Mr. LL, after almost four years in Ramo Verde, will give a message of rectification and peace.  Venezuela's Supreme Court said Lopez had been given the measure due to health problems, but his family countered that he is in good shape and he looked robust as he waved enthusiastically. The release was aided in part by the involvement of former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who has for years maintained talks with the Maduro government, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Venezuelan officials said. Slideshow (16 Images)At Maduro's behest, Venezuela on July 30 will elect a controversial Constituent Assembly.  The opposition says that is a power grab meant to keep the socialists in office and annul the existing opposition-controlled legislature against the will of the people.    Supporters Thrilled Several hundred supporters rallied through the day outside Lopez's home in the upscale Caracas neighborhood of Los Palos Grandes, some wearing shirts emblazoned with Lopez's face.  They waved Venezuela's flag, chanted slogans and set off fireworks to celebrate.  I think this is the first day of the transition,  said Maria Antonieta Witzka, 57, a physical therapist.  The government is realizing that we are the majority.  Though a hero to many, Lopez has also faced criticism from some within the opposition for at times being headstrong and domineering. He founded the Popular Will party after splitting with the First Justice party that he had also helped found. Though Lopez had publicly called for peaceful resistance to Maduro in 2014 and was behind bars during most of the unrest that year which killed 43 people, prosecutors said his speeches sent subliminal messages and constituted a call to violence.  One of the prosecutors who led the case later fled the country and said the proceeding had been a mockery of justice. Lopez is the scion of wealthy families and a direct descendant of the sister of Latin American independence hero Simon Bolivar as well as of Venezuela's first president, Cristobal Mendoza. Pro-government critics paint him as a dangerous radical in the pocket of Venezuela's wealthy elite and the U.S. government.

He did both Saturday, leading the Blue Jays to a 7-2 victory over the Houston Astros. Donaldson started a double play in the third inning after spearing a line drive and hit the go-ahead three-run home run in the fifth as the Blue Jays assured themselves of at least a split in the four-game series.  I've always considered myself to be good on both sides of the ball,  Donaldson said. Troy Tulowitzki added a three-run homer in the seventh for the Blue Jays (41-46) and Marcus Stroman held the Astros to one run over seven innings.  The Donaldson homer and us not being unable to break through against Stroman (determined) the outcome,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. Marwin Gonzalez hit his 16th home run of the season for the Astros (59-29) in the ninth off Joe Biagini, who has returned to the Toronto bullpen after a stint as a starter. Houston shortstop Carlos Correa was 0-for-3 with a walk to end his hitting streak at a career-best 15 games, but extended his streak of reaching base safely to 24 straight games. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at Blue JaysHouston Astros - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchStroman (9-5) allowed six hits, three walks and one run while striking out six to earn his second win in his last five starts. He left his start Monday after five innings because of a raw spot on his finger.  They're a very good team over there,  Donaldson said.  In all phases of the game, they're pretty solid and it's important for us to play well to beat those guys. So far in two of the three we've played pretty well, and let one kind of get away from us early (a 12-2 loss Friday). We were able to bounce back, which is important, especially after a loss like (Friday).  Houston starter Mike Fiers (5-4) allowed five hits, four walks and three runs in six innings. The right-hander struck out six.  He had a short leash, I wasn't going to let him go too long, but he came up with the big double play to end his outing,  Hinch said.  He was throwing the ball better at the end of his outing.   Overall, I thought I threw well and one big at-bat from Donaldson changed the game,  Fiers said.  Other than that, I pitched well and Stroman pitched better. No matter what the average says, (Donaldson, who is batting .252) can hit no matter what, so I'm always going to be careful with him. I walked him early on but, I was in counts to get him out, but just didn't make the right pitch. I ended up walking him and he got me in the fifth.  George Springer hit an RBI double in the third inning to give the Astros a 1-0 lead. It followed a leadoff walk to Norichika Aoki. Josh Reddick singled after Springer's double to put runners at the corners. Stroman avoided further trouble when Donaldson made a leaping catch at third base of a line drive by Correa and threw to first to double up Reddick.  It was huge,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  They had a run and that could open it up. But I've seen him do that many a time. ... After that I thought Stroman really settled in.  The Blue Jays took the lead in the fifth on Donaldson's ninth homer of the season. It scored Jose Bautista, who was hit by a 3-and-2 pitch from Fiers, and Russell Martin, who followed with a single for Toronto's second hit of the game. Fiers' first pitch to Donaldson was high and inside and sent the Blue Jays third baseman reeling. Donaldson answered by belting a 2-and-2 changeup over the left-field fence.  That was a situation where I don't think the guy was trying to do it intentionally,  Donaldson said.  By the same token, it was up around the head area and I didn't appreciate it. At the end of the day I was glad to help our team win.  Donaldson missed more than five weeks because of a calf injury and did not return until late May.  I felt like I've been able to see the ball better and slow the game down, and ultimately have better at-bats,  Donaldson said.  Defensively I've begun to do that as well.  Chris Devenski replaced Fiers in the seventh and allowed a one-out single by Martin, a walk to Donaldson and an RBI double to Justin Smoak. With two out, Tulowitzki hammered his seventh home run of the season to increase the lead to 7-1. Danny Barnes replaced Stroman and pitched a perfect eighth. NOTES: Astros RHP Chris Devenski was added to the American League All-Star team on Friday, giving Houston a franchise-record six players selected for the game to be played Tuesday in Miami. It also is the most by an American League team this season. ... Toronto relievers pitched 7 1/3 innings on Friday, the sixth time this season they have been used for more than seven innings in a game (including one extra-inning game).

Once Frazier touched the plate, the celebration was on for the Yankees. Frazier hit a three-run homer with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Yankees rallied for a dramatic 5-3 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday.  You don't really know what's going on until you cross third base and you see all them standing there with the Gatorade, with their hats off, (and) screaming,  Frazier said.  It's a real cool moment.  A week after hitting a home run in his major league debut at Houston, Frazier went 3-for-4 with four RBIs as his average went from .188 to .300. Frazier gave the Yankees their seventh win in 24 games since June 24 by staying back on a 1-0 fastball from Corey Knebel (0-2), and there was little doubt he cleared the left field fence.  That's a big win,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  Clint's at-bats all day were good and to hit a three-run walk-off homer, we needed that.  Frazier said it was his first walk-off home run since becoming a professional as a first-round pick of the Cleveland Indians in 2013, and it occurred with his mother and girlfriend in the stands. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at YankeesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchAt 22 years, 305 days, he became the youngest Yankee to hit a game-ending homer since Melky Cabrera (21 years, 341 days) did it in the 11th inning on July 18, 2006, against Seattle's Julio Mateo.  We went wild, I went wild,  Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said.  I almost tripped over the rail right there. It's awesome to see him succeed.  Before Didi Gregorius and Jacoby Ellsbury drew walks off Knebel, the Yankees succeeded little offensively against soft-tossing left-hander Brent Suter. Only Frazier experienced success against a pitcher who didn't throw one pitch over 90 mph. Frazier broke up Suter's no-hit bid with a single to right in the fifth and added an RBI triple in the seventh after Suter allowed a run on a throwing error during a pickoff attempt. While Frazier succeeded all day at the plate, Yankee pitching did enough to set up the comeback. Luis Severino allowed a three-run homer to Domingo Santana in the first but little else in seven solid innings. Aroldis Chapman (0-2) struck out the side in the ninth after Dellin Betances fanned two in the eighth. When Knebel walked off the mound after blowing his fourth save, Milwaukee's five-game winning steak had ended and the Brewers lost a chance to go 10 games over .500. The Brewers lost for the second time in 10 games and were handed their fifth walk off loss.  All of it,  Knebel said when asked how much of his outing was based on poor location. Before Knebel faltered, Suter allowed two earned runs and five hits in a career-high 6 1/3 innings while working so quickly that the Yankees rarely had chances to step out of the batter's box between pitches.  He pitched wonderfully,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  It was fun to see, and it was really important moving forward that we found a guy who can fill in that spot and did a really nice job.  The Brewers started quickly when Eric Thames doubled with one out in the first and Travis Shaw was awarded first base when a pitch grazed his jersey. After the Yankees challenged, the call was upheld following an 80-second review. Two pitches later, Santana lifted a 1-and-0 fastball into the right field seats for his 15th home run. The Yankees ran themselves out of the second inning. Gregorius, who reached on a fielding error by shortstop Orlando Arcia, was tagged out between second and third. Headley, who hit the soft grounder to Suter, was tagged out by Thames after rounding first. NOTES: The Yankees played the game with nine relievers after recalling RHPs Ben Heller and Jonathan Holder from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre. New York optioned RHP Luis Cessa and LHP Jordan Montgomery, who started Friday, to Triple-A. ... 1B Jesus Aguilar got the start as the designated hitter for Milwaukee after setting the team's rookie record with seven RBIs on Friday. ... Yankees' DH Matt Holliday (viral infection) is slated to begin a rehab assignment Saturday night. ... Milwaukee LF Ryan Braun exited the game because of left calf tightness. He also saw his nine-game hitting stopped, although he was robbed of hits by 3B Chase Headley and 1B Ji-Man Choi in his final two at-bats.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-brewers-yankees-writethru-idUSMTZED78SFXN6O"},

Zverev was billed as an intriguing conundrum for Federer and a potential third-round banana skin with his old-school style harking back to a bygone era of the grasscourt game.  Yet, unfortunately for the German, the seven times champion has a flair for such puzzles and, after a testing opening set, swept home 7-6(3) 6-4 6-4 in Saturday's Centre Court clash. That saw Federer safely into the second week at the All England Club for the 15th time and gave him a few days to recover from a head cold that has been bothering him before he takes on Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16 on Monday.  I had more problems with my cold than my opponents,  he said after a third successive match without dropping a set.   Perhaps the only positive for Zverev was that it was not as bad as the first time he played Federer on grass four years ago when he lost without winning a game.  The result on Saturday, however, never really looked in doubt for Federer, who is seeking a record eighth Wimbledon men's singles title. Zverev's relentless charging of the net posed few issues for third seed Federer, who stayed on course for a record eighth Wimbledon title by using the German as a target and relentlessly picking him off. Federer hit 61 winners to Zverev's 20, while the German won only 55 percent of points at the net, usually a prime position of strength.

He did, however, have a minor wobble in the first set that sent it to a tiebreak.  Slideshow (8 Images)Having broken for a 3-1 lead, Federer failed to pick a volley off his shoelaces to hand Zverev a break point that the German took when the Swiss shanked a forehand.  Any frustration Federer may have felt was channelled in a clinical tiebreak, which he won without dropping a point on his serve.  From then on it was easy going for Federer, who did not face a break point in the remainder of the encounter.  He broke for a 2-1 lead in the second set with a clinical forehand put-away and again at the same point in the third, when 27th-seeded Zverev double faulted. Having not been pushed to his brilliant best, Federer at least finished with a flourish, wrapping up the match after an hour and 49 minutes with his 13th ace.  Thirteenth seed Dimitrov, now aged 26, may provide a sterner challenge, although he is another player who has never beaten Federer in five previous efforts.  Grigor is stronger every time I play him, he's at the perfect age right now, understands his game and is physically strong...

Egypt faces an Islamist insurgency led by the Islamic State group in the restive Sinai Peninsula, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013. At least two policemen were killed and nine wounded when their armored vehicle was hit by an explosion in the Sinai on Saturday, Egypt's state news agency MENA said. Saturday's attack came a day after at least 23 soldiers were killed when suicide car bombs tore through two military checkpoints in the region in an attack claimed by Islamic State. It was one of the bloodiest assaults on security forces in years.[nL8N1JY1M6] The Interior Ministry said that gunmen had opened fire on police as they approached a desert training camp for militants in Ismailia. The officers returned fire, killing 14 militants, five of whom have been identified so far. The camp was used to  subject (recruits) to military training programs on the use of various types of firearms and manufacture explosive devices...,  the ministry said in a statement.  In a separate statement the ministry also said its forces killed two men described as fugitive terrorists in an exchange of gunfire in the city of Giza. The men, who were inside an apartment, opened fire on security forces as soon as the officers approached to arrest them, it said. The ministry said the pair were members of a newly emerged militant group called Hasm, which claimed responsibility for the killing of a homeland security officer outside his home in Qalubiya, a province just north of Cairo, while on his way to prayers on Friday. Hasm has claimed several attacks around Cairo targeting judges and policemen since last year. Other militant groups such as Hasm, which the government says are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, are active in Cairo and other cities where they have targeted security forces, judges and pro-government figures. The Brotherhood was outlawed in 2013 after the military ousted one of its leaders, Mohamed Mursi, from the presidency following mass protests. It maintains that it is a peaceful organization.

We were immediately slow, starting yesterday,  said technical head Paddy Lowe.  It was obvious that the pace wasn't in the normal ranking.  We changed the balance of the car but we didn't actually make it any quicker.  We tried a few more things going into qualifying which also didn't make it quicker. So the honest answer is we are not quick here but we don't know why.

Froome leads Sky team mate and compatriot Geraint Thomas by 12 seconds and Italian Fabio Aru (Astana) by 14. The top contenders are all within a minute of Froome, but the time gaps should be much bigger on Sunday night. And by then some will already have lost the Tour.  Those who want to be on the podium in Paris must be in the top three in the GC on Sunday night after a very hard, very selective stage,  Nairo Quintana's team manager at Movistar, Eusebio Unzue, told Reuters.   It was a very hot first week, with long stages. the conditions are hard.  Contador Factor Froome's outfit have had a relatively smooth build-up to the much-feared stage and the Briton will hope that his team mates will be in control as attacks are likely to come from all sides. Aru, who won the first summit finish at La Planche des Belles Filles, should be the main threat for Froome, but twice champion Alberto Contador, Quintana, in-form Australian Richie Porte and last year's runner-up Romain Bardet are all aggressive riders and cannot be discarded.  The strongest will win,  Bahrain-Merida sports director Philippe Mauduit, who managed Contador in 2014, told Reuters.  Maybe a team will invent something unexpected. There will be a clear hierarchy between the top favorites.  The one who will lose more than 15 seconds will probably not win the Tour.  According to Mauduit, Contador could be a real danger despite his ageing legs.  He's less sharp than he was but he has had no troubles so far. Not a crash, not a mechanical problem, and he had not been spared from bad luck for a very long time,  the Frenchman said.  He's a force to be reckoned with. Until they sweep him aside for good, he'll be there for the win, it's sure.

The German was handed a 10 seconds stop-and-go penalty during the race in Azerbaijan last month for deliberately banging wheels with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton while they were behind the safety car. Vettel was summoned to an FIA hearing in Paris last Monday, which then decided to take no further action after he apologized and accepted full responsibility. It was the second time in a matter of months that Vettel   faced possible sanction for his on-track behavior, with the Ferrari driver warned in Mexico for abusing race director Charlie Whiting over the team radio.

Todt dismissed a suggestion that Formula One had a different approach to other sports such as cycling, with Slovakia's world champion Peter Sagan kicked out of the Tour de France for sending Briton Mark Cavendish crashing to the ground. The Frenchman said it was  irrelevant  to compare that incident, as some have done, with what happened in Baku. Todt also expressed some sympathy for Vettel's refusal to apologize on the day, with ample opportunity to do so in television interviews.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, keen to show off her skills as a mediator two months before a German election, achieved her primary goal at the meeting in Hamburg, convincing her fellow leaders to support a single communique with pledges on trade, finance, energy and Africa. But the divide between Trump, elected on a pledge to put  America First , and the 19 other members of the club, including countries as diverse as Japan, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, was stark. Last month Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark international climate accord clinched two years ago in Paris.  In the end, the negotiations on climate reflect dissent – all against the United States of America,  Merkel told reporters at the end of the meeting.  And the fact that negotiations on trade were extraordinarily difficult is due to specific positions that the United States has taken.   The summit, marred by violent protests that left the streets of Hamburg littered with burning cars and broken shop windows, brought together a volatile mix of leaders at a time of major change in the global geo-political landscape. Trump's shift to a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has left a void in global leadership, unsettling traditional allies in Europe and opening the door to rising powers like China to assume a bigger role. Tensions between Washington and Beijing dominated the run-up to the meeting, with the Trump administration ratcheting up pressure on President Xi Jinping to rein in North Korea and threatening punitive trade measures on steel.

Putin said at the conclusion of the summit on Saturday that Trump had quizzed him on the alleged meddling in a meeting that lasted over two hours but seemed to have been satisfied with the Kremlin leader's denials of interference. Trump had accused Russia of destabilizing behavior in Ukraine and Syria before the summit. But in Hamburg he struck a conciliatory tone, describing it as an honor to meet Putin and signaling, through Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, that he preferred to focus on future ties and not dwell on the past. Delegates attend the official dinner at the Elbphilharmonie Concert Hall during the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 7, 2017.Kay Nietfeld It was an extraordinarily important meeting,  Tillerson said, describing a  very clear positive chemistry  between Trump and the former KGB agent. In the final communique, the 19 other leaders took note of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and declared it  irreversible . For its part, the United States injected a contentious line saying that it would  endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.  French President Emmanuel Macron led a push to soften the U.S. language.  There is a clear consensus absent the United States,  said Thomas Bernes, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.  But that is a problem. Without the largest economy in the world how far can you go?   Slideshow (15 Images)Jennifer Morgan, executive director at Greenpeace, said the G19 had  held the line  against Trump's  backward decision  to withdraw from Paris. On trade, another sticking point, the leaders agreed they would  fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices and recognize the role of legitimate trade defense instruments in this regard.  The leaders also pledged to work together to foster economic development in Africa, a priority project for Merkel. Violent Protests Merkel chose to host the summit in Hamburg, the port city where she was born, to send a signal about Germany's openness to the world, including its tolerance of peaceful protests. It was held only a few hundred meters from one of Germany's most potent symbols of left-wing resistance, a former theater called the  Rote Flora  which was taken over by anti-capitalist squatters nearly three decades ago. Over the three days of the summit, radicals looted shops, torched cars and lorries. More than 200 police were injured and some 143 people have been arrested and 122 taken into custody. Some of the worst damage was done as Merkel hosted other leaders at for a concert and lavish dinner at the Elbphilharmonie, a modernist glass concert hall overlooking the Elbe River.  Merkel met police and security force after the summit to thank them, and condemned the  unbridled brutality  of some of the protestors, but she was forced to answer tough questions about hosting the summit in Hamburg during her closing press conference.

It is by opening up to each other, by working closely with those who share the same values that we will shape and harness globalization,  the joint declaration said. The agreement will enter definitively into force once all 28 EU member states and parliaments ratify it. The EU had not been satisfied that Canada would effectively open up its markets to 17,700 additional tonnes of EU cheese and provide guarantees for the patents of European pharmaceuticals.

The French woman's comments came just two hours after American Bethanie Mattek-Sands had been carried off a different court on a stretcher, screaming in pain with a serious knee injury after stumbling while approaching the net.  Obviously we listen to players, because their feedback is important. But the data shows to us those courts that are in question are within range of the other courts, and they are within the range of previous years,  said All England Club head groundsman Neil Stubley.  That's all we can work to, is the data that we feel is best for the health of the courts  We set them up to the exact standard that we've done in many previous years. So I'm not quite sure.   They (the players) have their reasons why they're saying that. More slippery? I don't know if there's been more slips this year or there's just been a couple of high-profile ones. I'm not sure,  he added. Conditions in SW19 have been hotter and drier than for many years and the roof on Centre Court was closed before play on Friday in a bid to protect the turf from the blazing sun. Stubley said that they had plans established to deal with the temperatures.  Obviously we're dealing with the extreme heat, which we're not used to every single championships. So from one championships to another you will get variations in temperatures which will actually have an effect on how you manage the courts.  We go into the championships with as healthy of grass as we possibly can so we can endure those extremes.   So if we get extreme heat, or last year with the extreme wet, we can deal with it. We have the mechanisms in place that we can add water, we can dry them a little bit more. We can actually be in control of how the plant is surviving.

Trump's pledge came during a working session of the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, providing a  godsend  to the United Nations' World Food Programme, the group's executive director, David Beasley, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting.  We're facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two,  said Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by Trump to head the U.N. agency fighting hunger worldwide. The new funding brings to over $1.8 billion aid promised by the United States for fiscal year 2017 for the crises in the four countries, where the United Nations has estimated more than 30 million people need urgent food assistance.  With this new assistance, the United States is providing additional emergency food and nutrition assistance, life-saving medical care, improved sanitation, emergency shelter and protection for those who have been affected by conflict,  USAID said in a statement. Rob Jenkins, acting head of the USAID's bureau of democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance, said of the funding, over $191 million would go to Yemen, $199 million to South Sudan, $121 million to Nigeria and almost $126 million for Somalia. Conflict in all four countries had made it difficult to reach some communities in need of food, he noted.  We're in a dire situation right now,  said Jenkins, adding that USAID was also concerned with the situation in southern Ethiopia.  The situation in southern Ethiopia fortunately does not rise to the dire situation of the other four, but the situation is deteriorating and might very well be catastrophic without additional interventions,  he said, adding that Washington had already provided some $252 million this year to Ethiopia,  but the needs continue to grow.  Beasley said the U.S. funding was about a third of what the WFP estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries in crisis as well as in other areas. The WFP estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst-affected zones stemming from wars and  man-made  crises, Beasley said.  We estimated that if we didn't receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months,  he said. Trump's announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the U.S. State Department and other humanitarian missions as part of his  America First  policy. Beasley said the agency had worked hard with the White House and the U.S. government to secure the funding, but Trump would insist that other countries contributed more as well. A WFP spokesman said Germany recently pledged an additional 200 million euros for food relief.

The Spaniard, who thrashed Romania's Sorana Cirstea 6-2 6-2  on Saturday, will meet Angelique Kerber in the fourth round on Monday in a battle of the last two Wimbledon runner-ups. Like Kerber, she was felled by Serena Williams in the final but the fact that she even got a chance to play the title match in 2015 continues to amaze her.  I never feel that comfortable in grass. Every time I start the grass season, I'm like, 'how the hell did I (reach) that final? This kind of feeling,  said the 2016 French Open champion.  The experience I have now ... for sure helps me. But it's tough.  Her grasscourt know-how has certainly been in evidence this week as she has reached the second week without dropping a set. Cirstea, who reached the third round after American opponent Bethanie Mattek-Sands suffered a horrible knee injury on Thursday, matched Muguruza for power but made too many errors to pose a serious threat to the 14th seed. The Romanian held on to her opening service game with an ace but Muguruza was quickly into her groove and reeled off the next five games before Cirstea managed to stem the tide briefly.

Cirstea again held in the opening game with a backhand winner, before Muguruza changed gear and went on a five-game streak. Muguruza, 23, showed there was more to her game than power with some silky dropshots as she cruised to victory in a little over an hour on Court Two. Slideshow (3 Images)While Muguruza has avoided any on-court drama this week, the same cannot be said about her cooking skills. On Friday she thought she was in danger of being hauled out of her rented accommodation near the All England Club after setting off the smoke alarm in the house.   I love red meat. We were doing nice steaks. I did a lot of steaks. It was so much smoke that the ... alarm (went off),  she said laughing.   It was like this for 20 minutes. We didn't know what to do ... I felt scared. I'm like 'Are they going to come just because of steak?'  While the Spaniard plans to enjoy a more chilled out Sunday, on Monday she will be back hoping that it will be her smoking groundstrokes that will put Kerber off her stride.  I'm motivated. I have toughest rounds to come. I'm just looking forward for it,  added Muguruza.

Speaking at the end of his trip to Hamburg for the G20 meeting, Pena Nieto told reporters that the relationship with the United States, Mexico's top trading partner, should instead focus on more positive ends - a view that he believed Trump also shared.   Given what happened after this meeting (with Trump), clearly our bilateral relationship cannot be defined by murmurs like those that took place yesterday,  Pena Nieto said.   Our relationship needs to be based on searching for ways to generate mutual respect, build confidence and work with a positive attitude. I can say that I saw that willingness in President Trump.  For the first time since becoming president in January, Trump met Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday. Trump has accused Mexico of stealing U.S. jobs, and complex talks over renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are due to begin on August 16. The meeting at the Hamburg leaders' summit of the Group of 20 economies was keenly anticipated in Mexico, and officials were quick to stress talks had been productive, despite Trump repeating that Mexico would pay for his planned border wall. In response to a shouted question from a reporter about whether he still wants Mexico to pay for the border wall, which aims to keep out illegal immigrants, Trump said,  Absolutely.  Disputes over immigration, Trump's border wall - which Mexico has repeatedly said it would not pay for - and his claim that free trade with Mexico costs jobs in the United States, have strained relations between the two neighbors. Trump has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican goods to protect U.S. industry, and to pull out of NAFTA altogether if he cannot rework it in the United States' favor. Pena Nieto also met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday, according to a readout of the meeting, in which Pena Nieto said he was working closely with Canada to come up with a better, mutually beneficial update to NAFTA. Pena Nieto also said he met with Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi and agreed to possibly making a trip to the Asian nation next year, with a view to deepening trade links.

Vandeweghe, who hired Cash as her coach in the leadup to the tournament after splitting with Craig Kardon, stormed into the last 16 with 6-2 6-4 win over fellow American Alison Riske. In women's draw in which all 16 survivors will fancy their chances, Vandeweghe's credentials stack up well. The 24th seed has yet to drop a set in her three opening matches and hits winners for fun -- 87 so far. She had a brief wobble against 46th-ranked Riske but was comfortably in control on Saturday. While her form this year has swung between the extremes of a semi-final run to the Australian Open in January and a first round exit at the French Open in May, she has some pedigree on grass, having reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2015. She has hired Cash hoping he can give her an extra edge, three decades since the head-band wearing Australian lifted the trophy at the All England Club and after her build-up to Wimbledon was marred by a split with Kardon. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 8, 2017   USA’s Coco Vandeweghe waves during her third round match against USA’s Alison RiskeTony O'Brien He's (Cash) present at all my practices, all my matches. He's made a commitment to the working team. So I think a pretty big impact,  she told reporters on Saturday.  Vandeweghe has many of the tools needed to succeed on grass, principally a booming serve that regularly approaches the 120mph mark. In her three victories at Wimbledon this year, she has won 88 percent of points on her first serve. She also has form when it comes to causing an upset as she showed by beating world number one Angelique Kerber at the Australian Open in January. Against Riske, she broke twice to race through the opening set and twice more at the start of the second to take a 4-0 lead. The wheels threatened to come off at that stage as her compatriot fought back to level at 4-4.  Vandeweghe, however, steadied her nerves to break again and set up three match points with an ace before checking out with another service winner. With the pregnant Serena Williams missing this year's Wimbledon and many of the other top women's players struggling for form or fitness, the draw is opening up.  I think there is some very solid depth (in the women's game) of players that can make an impact against a top player,  she said.  I'm an example of that myself.

The central bank, faced with accelerating inflation, on Thursday raised its key interest rates by 200 basis points for the second policy meeting in a row, wrongfooting economists who had forecast no change.  We expect the interest rate decision to be a temporary measure to target inflation,  Meait told Reuters.  We expect inflation to fall in early 2018 and thus (we can) begin cutting interest rates.  Egypt floated the pound in November, and since then the currency has roughly halved in value, sending inflation surging. Although the core inflation rate slipped in May, it remains at almost 30 percent year-on-year. Meait also said the two increases in base lending rates this year were not taken into account in the state budget for the 2017/18 fiscal year, which parliament passed last week. The interest on current and future debt was calculated at 381 billion pounds, said Meait, who expected adjustments to that figure in the light of the change in borrowing costs. The budget has yet to be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The central bank raised interest rates by three percentage points after the currency flotation, which helped Egypt clinch a three-year $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending programme tied to reforms such as tax hikes and subsidy cuts. The IMF has said lowering inflation is crucial to keeping the reform programme on track and that raising interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so. The central bank has said it aims to cut inflation to 13 percent by the end of next year. The government last week increased fuel and electricity prices by up to 50 percent for the second time since November in another step towards narrowing its budget deficit. More rises are expected.  The average interest rate on domestic borrowing rate is currently between 19 and 20 percent and this average may fall in the second half of 2018 to 18 percent,  Meait said. Interest on debt costs for 2016-2017 had exceeded the target but cannot be announced at the moment,  he added. Thursday's move drew criticism from businessmen working in different industrial sectors who say they still haven't recovered from May's interest rate hike. The interest rate increase  will have a devastating impact on industry (in general) and the pharmaceutical sector,  said Hossam Aboul El Enein, SEDICO Pharmaceutical Company chief executive officer. He told Reuters that the cost of borrowing had increased and energy prices had risen while the prices of medicines could only be changed by ministerial decision.  I expect a shortage of medicines in the coming period,  he said, adding that he wondered how drug companies would make a profit given current prices.

We are going to do it without increasing taxes in 2017,  Philippe told a convention of LREM, President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Republic on the Move party.  We will therefore, thanks to savings measures to control the spending, keep commitments imposed on France by Brussels,  he added.

Taxes will fall starting from 2018 by about seven billion euros by reining in spending and implementing the president's commitments coherently and over time starting with the 2018 budget bill,  Philippe said.

The 28-year-old Bacsinszky, playing on Centre Court for the first time, mixed up the pace of her shots well to take the first set, but had to call a medical time-out at the end of the second set and received heavy strapping on her thigh. The injury, picked up when sprinting to the net, clearly affected the Swiss in the third set.   It's quite frustrating, because I think I played a great first set. I was putting so much strength as well in my shots and I could go for the winners and I was able to really plant my feet solidly,  said Bacsinszky.

I was struggling a lot to get low in my knees and which had helped me very much in my first two rounds. I'm pretty sad that happened,  she said. Radwanska though clearly felt that the momentum had already turned in her direction.  I had a great match, especially (given) she's a really tricky opponent. She can do everything on court and you can expect everything. Playing aggressive and then also slices, mixing up all the things. I think it was a great match from the beginning till the end.  After the second set I just found my game and I was trying to be more aggressive. I think, as well, I was serving better in the third set,  she added. Kuznetsova has proved a tough opponent for the Pole, who last beat the Russian on clay at Madrid in 2014 although she did triumph at Wimbledon in 2008.  We have played so many matches, so many good ones, so many three-setters. Playing her is always very challenging. You know, every ball is going to go to your side over and over again. You're not going to have any free points,  said Radwanska.

Vettel had to make a public apology after accusing his rival  of 'brake-testing' him after the Ferrari driver drove into the back of the Mercedes and then banged wheels while they were behind the safety car. Although Hamilton has accepted the apology and said he still has  the utmost respect  for Vettel, he refused to play along when asked to shake hands with his rival in post-qualifying interviews. Television images showed, however, that he and Vettel had done so unprompted after they stepped out of their cars in the pit lane.  The car was really good. I was hoping for the last run but it was a bit of an anti climax with the yellow flags,  said Vettel, who will fancy his chances of a fourth win of the season.  It's a great track, the car has been phenomenal.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow, it should be a good race.  Red Bull's Dutch teenager Max Verstappen starts fifth with Grosjean sixth. Hamilton will split Force India's feuding duo of Sergio Perez, seventh, and Esteban Ocon in ninth.

You'd think with Judge and Sanchez, the guys he came up through the system with, doing so well up here he'd want to be a part of this. Apparently not.  Bird has had a few setbacks since going on the DL May 2 and is scheduled to see a doctor on Monday. Both manager Joe Girardi and Bird refuted the claim.  He's done everything that we've asked him do to try and get him on the field and being productive and getting him back on track,  Girardi said.  It just hasn't happened.   Said Bird:  I want to play.  I've always wanted to play since I can remember. I love baseball. For me, I'm doing everything I can to get back. That's pretty much all I know. I love it and I want to play with these guys. I would hope people see that but obviously I've just got to take care of what I can take care of.  2B Starlin Castro (strained right hamstring) is feeling better but will not play in the All-Star game on Tuesday. Castro was placed on the DL after getting injured running out a ground ball June 27 in Chicago. He will appear in a rehab game or two and could return next weekend in Boston. RF Aaron Judge joined Mark McGwire as the second player in major league history to hit at least 30 homers by the All-Star break when he hit a two-run homer in the fifth inning off LHP Josh Hader Friday night. McGwire hit 33 of his 49 homers by the All-Star break in 1987 for Oakland. Judge also set a club record for homers by a rookie. The previous mark was held by Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who hit 29 in 1936. DH Matt Holliday (viral infection) took a few rounds of early batting practice Friday but was not activated from the disabled list. Holliday will play two rehab games this weekend and be the designated hitter. If there are no problems, he could be activated next weekend in Boston.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-playerwatch-idUSMTZED78S79P30"},

By Brian Ellsworth and Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS, July 8 (Reuters) - Venezuela's best-known jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was out of prison and hugging his family on Saturday after being granted house arrest following three years in jail for leading anti-government protests. Lopez's return to his Caracas home comes as Venezuela is once again convulsed by demonstrations against socialist President Nicolas Maduro, struggling with an economic crisis and global censure for overriding the powers of the country's opposition-led congress. Lopez, 46, a photogenic, Harvard-educated former mayor who has been barred from holding elected office, left the Ramo Verde military jail before dawn and was reunited with his wife and two young children, relatives said.  A few days ago they had punished him with solitary confinement without light or water for three days,  said his father, of the same name, in an interview with Spanish radio.  (Now) he's hugging his children, he's with his wife ... I'm happy, he's happy of course,  he added, adding that his son was wearing an electronic tag for authorities to track him. The opposition has long called Lopez a political prisoner, and leaders around the world, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have pressed for his release. Maduro, who for years refused to pardon Lopez, has described him as a dangerous terrorist who sought to overthrow him through street violence. Government supporters often note Lopez's role in a short-lived 2002 coup against the late former leader Hugo Chavez when he helped arrest a minister. Venezuela's Supreme Court said Lopez had been granted house arrest due to health problems, but his family members were unable to identify what those were. Opposition leaders applauded Lopez's return home, but said he should be granted complete freedom, along with several hundred other jailed opponents of Maduro. The government says all imprisoned activists are being held on legitimate charges, including coup-plotting. State ombudsman Tarek Saab said in an interview with CNN that the measure was the result of efforts by a state-backed truth commission, which he said is also studying the release of other citizens detained amid protests. The release was aided in part by the involvement of former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who has for years maintained talks with Venezuela's government, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told reporters at the G20 meeting in Hamburg. Supporters Gather The president could be seeking to ease pressure with Lopez's return to home, but there was no sign of concessions to the opposition on other fronts. At Maduro's behest, Venezuela on July 30 will elect a legislative superbody that can rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions, a move the opposition calls a naked power grab meant to keep the socialists in office against the will of the people. Dozens of supporters stood outside Lopez's home in the upscale Caracas neighborhood of Los Palos Grandes, some wearing shirts emblazoned with Lopez's face. Lopez's mother Antonieta arrived, beaming and dressed in white. About 100 people were gathered outside the house, waving Venezuela's flag, chanting slogans and setting off fireworks to celebrate.  I think this is the first day of the transition,  said Maria Antonieta Witzka, 57, a physical therapist.  The government is realizing that we are the majority.  Lopez has faced criticism even within the opposition for at times being quick-tempered and domineering. He founded the Popular Will party after splitting with leaders of the First Justice party, which he also helped found. Though Lopez had publicly called for peaceful resistance to Maduro in 2014 and was behind bars during most of the unrest that year which killed 43 people, prosecutors said his speeches sent subliminal messages and constituted a call to violence. He was sentenced to nearly 14 years. One of the prosecutors who led the case later fled the country and said the proceeding had been a mockery of justice. The case has long been a cause celebre for opposition supporters over what they deem the Maduro government's trampling of human rights. Lopez is the scion of wealthy families and a direct descendant of the sister of Latin American independence hero Simon Bolivar as well as of Venezuela's first president, Cristobal Mendoza. Pro-government critics paint Lopez as a dangerous radical in the pocket of Venezuela's wealthy elite and the U.S. government. He has ambitions to become Venezuela's president and would likely be one of the most popular opposition aspirants in any future election.

In a court filing late on Friday, Hawaii's attorney general asked a Honolulu judge to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible  bona fide relationship  with a U.S. person or entity. The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancés and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred.  Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Earlier this week Hawaii had asked a Honolulu judge for a court order clarifying the Supreme Court's ruling to allow grandparents into the United States. The judge, along with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that the lower courts did not have the power to simply clarify the Supreme Court's opinion. However, the 9th Circuit on Friday said the courts could issue an injunction against Trump's policy in the future, if the government misapplied the Supreme Court's ruling to a particular person or entity harmed by the travel ban. Hours after that ruling, Hawaii made such an injunction request in a Honolulu federal court. Hawaii said the state itself, along with resettlement agencies, are harmed by Trump's guidelines because they are prevented from helping refugees move there. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

The four, who the army said had died due to chronic illness, were among several hundred people arrested in a raid at Syrian refugee camps in the Arsal area of northeastern Lebanon. The Lebanese Center for Human Rights said torture had led to the deaths of at least four detainees. The Syrian National Coalition -- a Turkey-based opposition group -- said 10 people had died in custody, some as the result of torture, and 19 others had died in the raid around Arsal town. A military source denied the allegations, which prompted Lebanon's human rights minister to call for an investigation into the deaths this week. New York-based Human Rights Watch also demanded an independent probe, saying anyone responsible for wrongdoing should be held to account. Judge Dany Zeeny said on Saturday three doctors appointed by military prosecutor, Judge Sakr Sakr, had taken samples from the bodies on Friday to a medical laboratory in Beirut. The army said five suicide attackers blew themselves up while attacking soldiers during last week's raid, killing one civilian. Lebanon's military has received hundreds of millions in military assistance from the United States and Britain in recent years, as part of efforts to bolster Lebanon against a threat from militants across the Syrian border. The Lebanese army says it regularly stages operations targeting Islamic State and former al Qaeda-linked militants in the mountainous border region near Arsal. A U.S. State Department official said Washington was committed to helping the army  secure Lebanon's borders... and maintain overall security.   We have seen reports of Syrians who recently died while in custody of the Lebanese army and look forward to an official investigation into these deaths,  the official added. More than one million registered refugees fleeing the six-year Syrian war have poured into Lebanon, a quarter of its population, according to the U.N. refugee agency.

The 38-year-old man is accused of crimes of international terrorism and is now in prison in the south Italian town of Foggia, a police statement said.  The man, called Eli Bombataliev according to a court document, is believed to be linked with 2014 clashes in the capital of Russia's southern province of Chechnya, in which media offices and a school were burnt and which left at least 20 dead, the police said. The investigations started out of a collaboration with Belgium, where the man was part of a network of people who recruited foreign fighters.   The moment (he) left (Russia) he started wandering in Europe, counting on the fact that he had a refugee status... he then reached Syria where he fought between 2014 and 2015,   prosecuting magistrate Giuseppe Gatti, who worked on the case, said in a televised news conference.   Some 450 people have left Belgium to fight in Syria and Iraq, the highest country contribution in Europe on a per capita basis. Returning Syria fighters have also been involved in militant attacks in Belgium, France and elsewhere in Europe. Bombataliev, based at an Islamic cultural center in Foggia,  was involved in indoctrinating and radicalizing potential new foreign fighters, the document added.   The police also expelled from the country two Albanian brothers, aged 26 and 23, and a 49-year-old Russian woman, who then later became Bombatiliev's second wife.

Reuters exclusively reported earlier this week, citing sources with knowledge of the delivery, that Russia had delivered Siemens-made turbines to Crimea for use in two power plants under construction there. Siemens has denied it supplied any turbines to Crimea. In a statement issued on Friday, it said that if one of its customers had, in violation of the sales contract, re-routed any turbines to Crimea, the company  will not provide any deliveries or services for installation, commissioning support, or warranty.  However, the three sources said that one of the firms involved in the installation and commissioning of the turbines in Crimea is Russian-registered ZAO Interautomatika. Siemens has a 45.7 percent stake in the firm, according to public records. According to its website, the systems that Interautomatika offers to clients  are based on the use of technology that is produced by Siemens, or under license from Siemens.   On Siemens' Russian language website, Interautomatika is described as a  Solution Partner  to the German firm. Asked about the involvement of Interautomatika in the Crimea power plants project, a Siemens spokesman said in a statement provided to Reuters:  Siemens stands by its earlier position that no gas-turbine warranty, installation and commissioning support services will be provided.   We are investigating the involvement of Interautomatika in the commissioning of gas turbines and any other services and if proven true, we will take all necessary and available steps to terminate any activities as soon as possible.  Technopromexport, the Russian state-owned firm which is building the two power plants, declined to answer questions about the issue. Interautomatika did not immediately respond to Reuters questions. Reuters has not been able to determine if Siemens knew of or approved of the delivery of the turbines, or the role of Interautomatika in the power plant projects. The turbines, and the role of Interautomatika, expose the Germany company to potential accusations of insufficient safeguards to ensure its equipment does not end up on territory most countries view as illegally annexed, some legal experts say. In its statement on Friday, Siemens said it had no credible evidence about actual deliveries of its turbines to Crimea but had set up a task force to clarify the facts. It said it had taken all possible legal measures and would take operational steps to prevent the equipment from being used unlawfully. Prestige Project  The Kremlin wants to get the two Crimean power plants up and running to fulfill a promise, made by President Vladimir Putin, to ensure a stable power supply for the region's residents after it was annexed by Moscow from Ukraine in 2014. The Siemens-made turbines are a vital component because they are the only ones that fit into the foundations already laid for the power plants, and Russian firms are not able to manufacture comparable equipment on their own. Technopromexport, the main contractor on the project, said on Thursday that it bought the turbines on the secondary market. It did not disclose the seller or the manufacturer of the turbines. It said they had been modernized by specialized Russian factories and engineering companies which it did not name. Delivering the turbines to the site of the power stations is only the start of a complex process to get them running. They are highly sophisticated pieces of equipment packed with electronics and running off specialist software. They therefore require specialist engineers to install and commission them.  One of the three sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said a contract had been signed under which Interautomatika, together with other Russian firms, would provide commissioning services for the turbines in Crimea.  The source did not say when the contract with Interautomatika was signed, or who awarded the contract.  Reuters was not able to find documents on the award of such a contract.  EU sanctions bar European individuals and companies from providing energy technology to Crimea or from taking any actions designed to circumvent those rules due to the bloc's view that the peninsula was illegally stolen from Ukraine.  Legal experts say there are no court precedents to say whether Siemens could be held responsible if a third party supplied the technology to Crimea.  The European Commission did not respond to a request for comment on the delivery of the turbines. An EU source with knowledge of the issue said the EU has little ability to ensure compliance, leaving much of that to national governments. When asked about the delivery of the turbines on Wednesday, a spokesman for German's Ministry for Economic Affairs said he had no immediate comment. The other Interautomatika shareholders apart from Siemens are Technopromexport, with 17 percent, and VTI, a Russian power sector research institute, with 37 percent, according to the company's website.

And he is threatening to take punitive trade measures in the steel sector which would hit China, Germany, Canada and a host of other countries. Climate Conundrum Envoys have been working for weeks to bridge differences, and European sources said they came up with new language on the climate issue on Thursday which would be put to the leaders for approval. Slideshow (28 Images)The latest draft communique sticks with language about the Paris climate accord being  irreversible  but removes a reference from an earlier version to a  global approach  that some countries felt could suggest there was a parallel track to Paris. It also includes a new paragraph which says the United States will  work closely with other partners to help their access to and use of fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently . Some experts were skeptical whether leaders would approve the reference to fossil fuels, which would be a clear nod to Washington. As the leaders met on Friday, police said they were sending reinforcements from other parts of Germany to cope with thousands of anti-capitalist protesters who set fire to cars, rubbish bins and wooden pallets in violence that Hamburg's interior minister called  frightening . Merkel chose Hamburg, the port city where she was born, to send a signal about Germany's openness to the world, including its tolerance of peaceful protests. The summit is being held only a few hundred meters from one of Germany's most potent symbols of left-wing resistance, a former theater called the  Rote Flora  which was taken over by anti-capitalist squatters nearly three decades ago. Police said 196 officers had been injured, 83 protestors temporarily detained and another 19 taken into custody.

Dozens of Iraqi soldiers celebrated amid the rubble on the banks of the Tigris river without waiting for a formal victory declaration, some dancing to music blaring out from a truck and firing machineguns into the air, a Reuters correspondent said. The mood was less festive, however, among some of the nearly one million Mosul residents displaced by months of combat, many of whom are living in camps outside the city with little respite from the blazing summer heat.  If there is no rebuilding and people don't return to their homes and regain their belongings, what is the meaning of liberation?  Mohammed Haji Ahmed, 43, a clothing trader, told Reuters in the Hassan Sham camp to the east of Mosul.  Earlier on Saturday, a military spokesman said the insurgents' defense lines were collapsing, state television reported.  We are seeing now the last meters (yards) and then final victory will be announced,  a presenter said, citing correspondents embedded with security forces fighting in Islamic State's redoubt in the Old City by the Tigris.  It's a matter of hours,  she added. But Islamic State's Amaq news agency reported  fierce fighting  around the riverside district of Maydan and said its fighters  were holding onto their fortified positions.   Related CoverageWith Mosul victory at hand, displaced residents ponder uncertain future The fighters of Islamic State are collectively pledging (to fight to the) death in Maydan,  Amaq said in another online post. Artillery explosions and gunfire could still be heard during Saturday afternoon and a column of smoke billowed over the Old City riverside, the Reuters correspondent said. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the eight-month campaign to wrest back Mosul, by far the largest city seized by Islamic State (IS) in 2014.  Almost exactly three years ago, the ultra-hardline group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared from Mosul a  caliphate  over adjoining parts of Iraq and Syria. 'Fighting for Every Meter' Members of the Emergency Response Division celebrate in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 8, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniDozens of IS insurgents were killed on Saturday and others tried to escape by swimming across Tigris, state TV said. Most of those making a last stand were foreigners, it added. Iraqi commanders say the militants were fighting for every meter with snipers, grenades and suicide bombers, forcing security forces to fight house-to-house in the densely populated maze of narrow alleyways.  The battle has reached the phase of chasing the insurgents in remaining blocks,  the Iraqi military media office said in a statement.  Some members of Daesh have surrendered,  it added, using an Arab acronym of Islamic State. The road where the soldiers celebrated was scarred with gaping holes from explosions and rubble from a flattened multi-storey shopping mall.  Slideshow (9 Images)Rubbish and ammunition boxes were strewn around and the only civilians seen were a group of about 15 women, children and elderly, some of them wounded, sheltering in a damaged petrol station. Security forces medics were giving them first aid.   Months of urban warfare has displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's  state of falsehood  a week ago, after security forces took Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up. Stripped of Mosul, Islamic State's dominion in Iraq will be reduced to mainly rural, desert areas west and south of the city where tens of thousands of people live. The militants are expected to keep up attacks on selected targets across Iraq. The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. In some of the worst-affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said. The fall of Mosul also exposes ethnic and sectarian fractures between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories or between Sunnis and the Shi’ite majority that have plagued Iraq for more than a decade..  During their impromptu victory celebrations, some of the Iraqi soldiers waved pictures of Hussein, the grand son of prophet Mohammed who is immensely revered by the Shi'ites. Mosul is a majority Sunni city who has long complained of being marginalized by the Shi'ite-led governments installed after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Meanwhile, Iraq's regional Kurdish leader said this week that the government in Baghdad had failed to prepare a post-battle political, security and governance plan.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in China's northeastern city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer and the hospital said it had invited doctors from the United States and Germany to help with Liu's treatment. In a short statement, the hospital said Joseph M. Herman of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Markus W Büchler of Germany's University of Heidelberg had seen Liu on Saturday with the Chinese experts treating him. The team listened to his medical history, heard a report on his treatment, visited Liu and met his relatives and then discussed his illness, the hospital said.  The U.S. and German experts fully approved of the treatment by the national experts group and what they had done,  it said. The hospital said Liu had late-stage liver cancer which had  spread and was in its final stages, adding that it was looking at the medical options to improve his chances of survival. Calls have grown from rights groups, international bodies and western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife Liu Xia to be treated overseas. FILE PHOTO: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoA source with knowledge of the consultation and friend of the family told Reuters that Liu was compos mentis and spoke to the U.S. and German doctors in English.  He told them he still hoped to go abroad for treatment, but the government has been very clear they won't allow this,  the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Asked how serious Liu's condition is at present and how long he might have to live, the source said:  It's very serious. I'm extremely worried .  The hospital's website posted four pictures of the consultation with the U.S. and German doctors, one of which showed both men bending over to talk to Liu as he lay in his sick bed. He gestured back to them with his left hand. A separate hospital statement cited both doctors as saying they hoped Liu could be treated abroad. A Chinese doctor, who it did not identify, responded that moving him would not be safe and asked what better treatment could be offered.  The U.S. and German experts answered: 'We also do not have a better way, you are already doing very well',  the statement said. In an emailed statement on behalf of Herman, the MD Anderson Cancer Center confirmed he was in Shenyang to participate in the consultations on a visit facilitated by the U.S. State Department. It gave no details on Liu's condition. Büchler did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  The hospital did not answer telephone calls seeking comment on Saturday evening.

Hamed Abdel-Dayem told Reuters production should rise to 1.4 million qintar (160 kg) in the 2017-18 fiscal year that started in July from 700,000 qintar a year earlier. All the cotton will be exported. The government aims to increase the price of the long staple cotton to more than 3000 Egyptian pounds ($168.07) per qintar, which will all be exported, the spokesman said. Production of the cotton, used in luxury bedding, has fallen sharply since 2011, a year of political upheaval that coincided with looser regulations that degraded the quality of local cotton. Egypt's sunny skies and superior seed help it grow a cotton known for unusually long fibres that produce a light durable fabric with an attractive sheen and soft touch. Long-staple sells at 155 U.S. cents per lb, about twice the price of common short-staple cotton. Its return to world markets could provide a lucrative export opportunity at a time when Egypt has a huge trade deficit and is seeking to relaunch its stagnant economy. In 2016 Egypt banned all but the highest quality cotton seed, dramatically shrinking the area under cultivation but restoring quality, in a bid to save its historic crop. This year Egypt grew about 220,000 acres (89,000 hectares) of long-staple cotton compared with 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares) in 2016-2107, Abdel-Dayem said. Farmers, spinners, and exporters say the weakness of the Egyptian pound following its flotation in November and a scandal over the alleged sale of falsely labelled Egyptian cotton have increased demand for the real thing, injecting life into a historic industry on its deathbed.

The International Automobile Federation (FIA) said the aim was to carry out a first full track test at Italy's Monza circuit in September. Silverstone will allow drivers to give initial feedback early in the development process, however. The shield is an open canopy in front of the driver and made from polycarbonate, a tough but see-through thermoplastic polymer. The aim is to protect the driver's head from flying debris without obstructing his vision. The FIA has been focusing on that concept rather than a previously tested 'halo' cockpit protection system that was extensively tested last season to a mixed response from teams and drivers. Cockpit protection is seen as a key area following fatalities in other series where drivers were hit by wheels and flying debris. While the FIA said in January that the safety benefit of the halo had been established, some leading F1 figures were wary about dramatic changes to the look of the cars.  A possible geometry has been developed and the FIA is currently working with teams in Formula One on further defining its geometry,  the FIA said, with an image of the shield published on its website.

Dozens of Iraqi soldiers celebrated amid the rubble on the banks of the Tigris river without waiting for a formal victory declaration, some dancing to music blaring out from a truck and firing machineguns into the air, a Reuters correspondent said. The mood was less festive, however, among some of the nearly one million Mosul residents displaced by months of combat, many of whom are living in camps outside the city with little respite from the blazing summer heat.  If there is no rebuilding and people don't return to their homes and regain their belongings, what is the meaning of liberation?  Mohammed Haji Ahmed, 43, a clothing trader, told Reuters in the Hassan Sham camp to the east of Mosul.  Earlier on Saturday, a military spokesman said the insurgents' defense lines were collapsing, state television reported.  We are seeing now the last meters (yards) and then final victory will be announced,  a presenter said, citing correspondents embedded with security forces fighting in Islamic State's redoubt in the Old City by the Tigris.  It's a matter of hours,  she added. But Islamic State's Amaq news agency reported  fierce fighting  around the riverside district of Maydan and said its fighters  were holding onto their fortified positions.   Related CoverageWith Mosul victory at hand, displaced residents ponder uncertain future The fighters of Islamic State are collectively pledging (to fight to the) death in Maydan,  Amaq said in another online post. Artillery explosions and gunfire could still be heard during Saturday afternoon and a column of smoke billowed over the Old City riverside, the Reuters correspondent said. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the eight-month campaign to wrest back Mosul, by far the largest city seized by Islamic State (IS) in 2014.  Almost exactly three years ago, the ultra-hardline group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared from Mosul a  caliphate  over adjoining parts of Iraq and Syria. 'Fighting for Every Meter' Members of the Emergency Response Division celebrate in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 8, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniDozens of IS insurgents were killed on Saturday and others tried to escape by swimming across Tigris, state TV said. Most of those making a last stand were foreigners, it added. Iraqi commanders say the militants were fighting for every meter with snipers, grenades and suicide bombers, forcing security forces to fight house-to-house in the densely populated maze of narrow alleyways.  The battle has reached the phase of chasing the insurgents in remaining blocks,  the Iraqi military media office said in a statement.  Some members of Daesh have surrendered,  it added, using an Arab acronym of Islamic State. The road where the soldiers celebrated was scarred with gaping holes from explosions and rubble from a flattened multi-storey shopping mall.  Slideshow (9 Images)Rubbish and ammunition boxes were strewn around and the only civilians seen were a group of about 15 women, children and elderly, some of them wounded, sheltering in a damaged petrol station. Security forces medics were giving them first aid.   Months of urban warfare has displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared the end of Islamic State's  state of falsehood  a week ago, after security forces took Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque - although only after retreating militants blew it up. Stripped of Mosul, Islamic State's dominion in Iraq will be reduced to mainly rural, desert areas west and south of the city where tens of thousands of people live. The militants are expected to keep up attacks on selected targets across Iraq. The United Nations predicts it will cost more than $1 billion to repair basic infrastructure in Mosul. In some of the worst-affected areas, almost no buildings appear to have escaped damage and Mosul's dense construction means the extent of the devastation might be underestimated, U.N. officials said. The fall of Mosul also exposes ethnic and sectarian fractures between Arabs and Kurds over disputed territories or between Sunnis and the Shi’ite majority that have plagued Iraq for more than a decade..  During their impromptu victory celebrations, some of the Iraqi soldiers waved pictures of Hussein, the grand son of prophet Mohammed who is immensely revered by the Shi'ites. Mosul is a majority Sunni city who has long complained of being marginalized by the Shi'ite-led governments installed after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Meanwhile, Iraq's regional Kurdish leader said this week that the government in Baghdad had failed to prepare a post-battle political, security and governance plan.

Despite being planned months ago, the U.S. missile defense test will gain significance in the wake of North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 4 that has heightened concerns about the threat from Pyongyang. The test will be the first of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) to defend against a simulated attack by an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), one of the officials said. The THAAD interceptors will be fired from Alaska. The United States has THAAD interceptors in Guam that are meant to help guard against a missile attack from a country such as North Korea. The officials who disclosed to Reuters the precise nature and timing of the upcoming test spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked by Reuters, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) confirmed that it aimed to carry out a THAAD flight test  in early July.  Chris Johnson, an MDA spokesman, said the THAAD weapon system at the Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska in Kodiak, Alaska, would  detect, track and engage a target with a THAAD interceptor.   The test is designated as Flight Test THAAD (FTT)-18,  Johnson said. He did not elaborate.  Still, in recent testimony to Congress, Vice Admiral James Syring, then the director of the Missile Defense Agency, said  FTT-18 would aim to demonstrate THAAD's ability to intercept a separating IRBM target. MDA said THAAD had a 100 percent successful track record in its 13 flight tests since 2006. After previous tests, the U.S. military has publicly disclosed the results. South Korean Deployment THAAD is a ground-based missile defense system designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor is seen in Seongju, South Korea, June 13, 2017. Picture taken on June 13, 2017.Kim Hong-JiLockheed Martin Corp, the prime contractor for the THAAD system, said it has the ability to intercept incoming missiles both inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere. This year's U.S. deployment of THAAD in South Korea to guard against North Korea's shorter-range missiles has also drawn fierce criticism from China, which says the system's powerful radar can probe deep into its territory. Earlier this month Moscow and Beijing, in a joint statement, called on Washington to immediately halt deployment of THAAD in South Korea. The statement said Washington was using North Korea as a pretext to expand its military infrastructure in Asia and risked upsetting the strategic balance of power in the region.   THAAD's success rate in testing is far higher than the one for America's Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD), the system specifically designed to shoot down an ICBM headed for the U.S. mainland. That GMD system has only a 55 percent success rate over the life of the program. But advocates note that the technology has improved dramatically in recent years.  In a key development, the GMD system successfully shot down an incoming, simulated North Korean ICBM in a test in May.   That led the Pentagon to upgrade its assessment of America's ability to defend against a small number of ICBMs, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. MDA told Congress in June that it plans to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, for a total of 210 since May 2011. In a sign of U.S. congressional concern about missile defense, several lawmakers filed amendments to a sweeping defense policy bill on Friday that addressed North Korea. Republican Representative Don Young, whose home state Alaska is seen as especially vulnerable to the North Korea threat, asked for more ground-based interceptors for his state, and a study of potential additional sites on the East Coast or Midwest. Democratic Representatives John Conyers and Sheila Jackson Lee, along with Republican Walter Jones, filed an amendment to the annual National Defense Authorization Act saying that nothing in the bill should be construed as authorizing the use of force against North Korea. The full House of Representatives is due to consider the bill, and its amendments, next week.

The state budget is not enough to fund President Joko Widodo's ambitious plan to expand infrastructure in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, a sprawling archipelago where the costs of moving goods around are among Asia's highest.  Widodo told Reuters this week that he had instructed ministers to market the country aggressively to investors, capitalizing on Standard & Poor's May 19 upgrade of its credit rating to investment grade. Indonesia is hoping to attract the likes of Canada Pension Plan, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) and other institutional investors, Thomas Lembong, chairman of Indonesia's investment coordinating board, told Reuters.  We can't just sit back and wait for people to come because competition to attract capital flows is ferocious,  Lembong said.  Everything from toll roads to power plants to airports to ports should be securitized to capital markets.  Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg on Thursday that the government plans to securitize projects that are  already active and revenue-generating . That way, pension funds will not be involved in  the nitty-gritty of the new project or a project already being built so they can see the risk in a much better way,  she said. Under a securitization model, a company typically issues a trust-like investment structure that is backed by future revenue from a project or an asset, with investors earning a certain rate of return.

Antara Foto/Aloysius Jarot Nugroho via REUTERSIndonesia's biggest toll road operator, PT Jasa Marga Tbk (JSMR.JK), has begun working to securitize about half of the 4 trillion rupiah ($298.4 million) in revenue expected over five years from a road linking Jakarta to cities in West Java province. The securities - expected to offer annual returns of 8-9 percent over five years - have received a positive initial response from potential investors including pension funds, said Donny Arsal, Jasa Marga's finance director.   State-controlled electricity firm Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) is issuing securities backed by the projected five-year income of 10 trillion rupiah from a power plant operated by its unit. Cars pass through a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Semarang, Central Java province, Indonesia June 15, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Aditya Pradana Putra  via REUTERSPLN [PLNEG.UL] decided on this new investment structure as it had already raised funds from bonds, bank loans and other sources, finance director Sarwono Sudarto said.  There is already a limit to the existing models of funding,  Sudarto said, adding that under asset securitization, there is no transfer of ownership of its physical asset. There's no guarantee the securitization plans will succeed. Andre Varian, a portfolio manager at BNI Asset Management, said the securities issued by state firms are relatively new in Indonesia and their returns are not much higher than those offered by other fixed-income assets.  The lack of liquidity in the domestic market may also deter foreign investors, Varian said.  Foreign demand would be very limited since there is no liquidity.    Varian added, however, that liquidity may be boosted over time partly because domestic pension funds and insurance firms are required to have a certain portion of investments in government bonds or infrastructure-linked securities.

The pair of B-1B Lancer strategic bombers flew from a U.S. base on Guam and were joined by U.S. and South Korean jet fighters to conduct the simulated destruction of an enemy ballistic missile launcher and underground facilities, the South's air force said. North Korea announced on Tuesday it successfully test-launched an ICBM, saying the missile was capable of carrying a large and heavy nuclear warhead. Some experts believe the missile has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and the test signaled a significant advance in the North's declared intent to build a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the U.S. mainland.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the test indicated a quicker than expected pace of the North's ICBM program. The B-1B bombers conducted the live-fire exercise at a range in South Korea's eastern Gangwon province, dropping weapons in a simulated attack on a missile launcher, the South Korean air force said in a statement. South Korean and U.S. fighter jets conducted precision strike drills aimed at attacking enemy targets hidden underground, it said. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the bombers then flew west, hugging the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) border between the two Koreas, before leaving South Korean airspace.

The American, speaking at the Austrian Grand Prix, added that he had conveyed that opinion to the commercial rights holders. The British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), which owns the former World Two airbase, is expected next week to activate for financial reasons a break clause in its contract to host the race.  My view is Liberty should buy Silverstone,  said Brown, a sports marketing expert who joined McLaren last year after former boss and shareholder Ron Dennis was ousted.  I have voiced my views on that (to Formula One Management). They listen and they will be quick to tell you if they disagree and they didn’t disagree with the logic,  he added.  But I wouldn’t want to put words in their mouths that that means they are going out and buying it now because I have no idea.  The BRDC fears that the current contract, with an annual rise in hosting fees agreed with previous F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, exposes them to a  potentially ruinous risk . They have argued that the break clause would allow for a renegotiation under more favorable terms. But there is also a risk that the race could fall off the calendar in 2019 and go elsewhere.   Silverstone, which hosted the first world championship grand prix in 1950, has a contract to 2026 with a break clause from 2019 that must be exercised two years in advance. Practice for this year's race starts next Friday.  I think Silverstone’s a great track,  said Brown, whose team is one of a majority in Formula One to be based in Britain.  I sympathize if with the escalator they can’t make money. We need to figure out a way for them to make money to either create new revenue streams or re-cut the deal.  But I think there should be a Formula One Hall of Fame, you could do racing schools, eSports. If you owned the property yourself there’s a lot of incremental activities.  Testing. Maybe instead of it all being in Barcelona for eight days, you could move forward to Silverstone and really open it up to the fans.  Brown suggested the sport could follow the example of Nascar and end up owning several circuits, but that would be a longer term proposition.  Nascar owns 22 of the races that they compete at which I think is made up of 12 circuits. Indianapolis owns the Motor Speedway.

The American, speaking at the Austrian Grand Prix, added that he had conveyed that opinion to the commercial rights holders. The British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), which owns the former World Two airbase, is expected next week to activate for financial reasons a break clause in its contract to host the race.  My view is Liberty should buy Silverstone,  said Brown, a sports marketing expert who joined McLaren last year after former boss and shareholder Ron Dennis was ousted.  I have voiced my views on that (to Formula One Management). They listen and they will be quick to tell you if they disagree and they didn’t disagree with the logic,  he added.  But I wouldn’t want to put words in their mouths that that means they are going out and buying it now because I have no idea.  The BRDC fears that the current contract, with an annual rise in hosting fees agreed with previous F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, exposes them to a  potentially ruinous risk . They have argued that the break clause would allow for a renegotiation under more favorable terms. But there is also a risk that the race could fall off the calendar in 2019 and go elsewhere.   Silverstone, which hosted the first world championship grand prix in 1950, has a contract to 2026 with a break clause from 2019 that must be exercised two years in advance. Practice for this year's race starts next Friday.  I think Silverstone’s a great track,  said Brown, whose team is one of a majority in Formula One to be based in Britain.  I sympathize if with the escalator they can’t make money. We need to figure out a way for them to make money to either create new revenue streams or re-cut the deal.  But I think there should be a Formula One Hall of Fame, you could do racing schools, eSports. If you owned the property yourself there’s a lot of incremental activities.  Testing. Maybe instead of it all being in Barcelona for eight days, you could move forward to Silverstone and really open it up to the fans.  Brown suggested the sport could follow the example of Nascar and end up owning several circuits, but that would be a longer term proposition.  Nascar owns 22 of the races that they compete at which I think is made up of 12 circuits. Indianapolis owns the Motor Speedway. But I think you’ve got to buy one before you buy three or four,  he said.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in China's northeastern city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer and the hospital said it had invited doctors from the United States and Germany to help with Liu's treatment. In a short statement, the hospital said Joseph M. Herman of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Markus W Büchler of Germany's University of Heidelberg had seen Liu on Saturday with the Chinese experts treating him. The team listened to his medical history, heard a report on his treatment, visited Liu and met his relatives and then discussed his illness, the hospital said.  The U.S. and German experts fully approved of the treatment by the national experts group and what they had done,  it said. The hospital said Liu had late-stage liver cancer which had  spread and was in its final stages, adding that it was looking at the medical options to improve his chances of survival. Calls have grown from rights groups, international bodies and western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife Liu Xia to be treated overseas. FILE PHOTO: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoA source with knowledge of the consultation and friend of the family told Reuters that Liu was compos mentis and spoke to the U.S. and German doctors in English.  He told them he still hoped to go abroad for treatment, but the government has been very clear they won't allow this,  the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Asked how serious Liu's condition is at present and how long he might have to live, the source said:  It's very serious. I'm extremely worried .  The hospital's website posted four pictures of the consultation with the U.S. and German doctors, one of which showed both men bending over to talk to Liu as he lay in his sick bed. He gestured back to them with his left hand. A separate hospital statement cited both doctors as saying they hoped Liu could be treated abroad. A Chinese doctor, who it did not identify, responded that moving him would not be safe and asked what better treatment could be offered.  The U.S. and German experts answered: 'We also do not have a better way, you are already doing very well',  the statement said. In an emailed statement on behalf of Herman, the MD Anderson Cancer Center confirmed he was in Shenyang to participate in the consultations on a visit facilitated by the U.S. State Department. It gave no details on Liu's condition. Büchler did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  The hospital did not answer telephone calls seeking comment on Saturday evening.

The firm's biggest domestic rival, Suez (SEVI.PA), announced the $3.4 billion purchase of GE Water from General Electric (GE.N) in March. Asked whether Veolia could spend as much on an acquisition, its boss Antoine Frerot told Reuters the size of the group's balance sheet  would allow it .  Frerot, who earlier this year said he would favor organic growth for the business, laid out two conditions for any future large acquisition.  It would need to create new large-size activities for the company and over a long period of at least 10 to 15 years,  Frerot said in an interview at a business conference in the southeastern city of Aix-en-Provence.   If we found this, then obviously we'd have the means to do it,  he said, declining to elaborate on possible targets. Veolia, which also cleans up nuclear facilities and treats low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste, could also benefit from a 50-billion-euro ($57 billion) upgrade of French nuclear sites operated by energy provider EDF (EDF.PA), Frerot said.  EDF's upgrade is scheduled for 2014-2025 and aims to extend the life expectancy of its nuclear installations by more than 40 years.

The state budget is not enough to fund President Joko Widodo's ambitious plan to expand infrastructure in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, a sprawling archipelago where the costs of moving goods around are among Asia's highest.  Widodo told Reuters this week that he had instructed ministers to market the country aggressively to investors, capitalizing on Standard & Poor's May 19 upgrade of its credit rating to investment grade. Indonesia is hoping to attract the likes of Canada Pension Plan, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) and other institutional investors, Thomas Lembong, chairman of Indonesia's investment coordinating board, told Reuters.  We can't just sit back and wait for people to come because competition to attract capital flows is ferocious,  Lembong said.  Everything from toll roads to power plants to airports to ports should be securitized to capital markets.  Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told Reuters ahead of the G20 summit in Hamburg on Thursday that the government plans to securitize projects that are  already active and revenue-generating . That way, pension funds will not be involved in  the nitty-gritty of the new project or a project already being built so they can see the risk in a much better way,  she said. Under a securitization model, a company typically issues a trust-like investment structure that is backed by future revenue from a project or an asset, with investors earning a certain rate of return. Positive Initial Response An official drives a motorcycle during an inspection at a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Salatiga, Central Java province, Indonesia June 8, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto.  Antara Foto/Aloysius Jarot Nugroho via REUTERSIndonesia's biggest toll road operator, PT Jasa Marga Tbk (JSMR.JK), has begun working to securitize about half of the 4 trillion rupiah ($298.4 million) in revenue expected over five years from a road linking Jakarta to cities in West Java province. The securities - expected to offer annual returns of 8-9 percent over five years - have received a positive initial response from potential investors including pension funds, said Donny Arsal, Jasa Marga's finance director.   State-controlled electricity firm Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) is issuing securities backed by the projected five-year income of 10 trillion rupiah from a power plant operated by its unit. Cars pass through a new toll road Salatiga-Bawen section in Semarang, Central Java province, Indonesia June 15, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Aditya Pradana Putra  via REUTERSPLN [PLNEG.UL] decided on this new investment structure as it had already raised funds from bonds, bank loans and other sources, finance director Sarwono Sudarto said.  There is already a limit to the existing models of funding,  Sudarto said, adding that under asset securitization, there is no transfer of ownership of its physical asset. There's no guarantee the securitization plans will succeed. Andre Varian, a portfolio manager at BNI Asset Management, said the securities issued by state firms are relatively new in Indonesia and their returns are not much higher than those offered by other fixed-income assets.  The lack of liquidity in the domestic market may also deter foreign investors, Varian said.  Foreign demand would be very limited since there is no liquidity.    Varian added, however, that liquidity may be boosted over time partly because domestic pension funds and insurance firms are required to have a certain portion of investments in government bonds or infrastructure-linked securities.

That is the theory of Bill Norris, the ATP's former Director of Medical Services who spent 35 years patching up the broken and sore bodies of top players from Ken Rosewall and Arthur Ashe to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Tomic was fined $15,000 by the International Tennis Federation on Thursday after admitting he was  bored  and had faked an injury during a listless first-round defeat at Wimbledon.  This young man (Tomic) not trying in his match at Wimbledon is not a good thing,  Norris, who turns 75 next month, told Reuters in a telephone interview from his home in Boca Raton, Florida.  If I got called out to court (and realized) some guy just wants to buy time, it is gamesmanship.   I would say it out really loud so that the umpire and spectators could hear and say (to the player): 'You called me out for this? That’s very unfair of you and it’s unfair to your opponent'.   So I would embarrass the player.   Legal Cheating  Tomic's behavior was condemned as  legal cheating  by his fellow Australian Pat Cash, and while it has created an uproar at Wimbledon, Norris felt that the rapport he had built up with the players allowed him to read them the riot act if they  misbehaved .   Over 35 years I had a unique relationship with the players. They were all like my children. And when they misbehaved, I would call them on it,  said Norris, who has been around professional athletes since the age of 12 after working with the medical team of the Pittsburg Pirates baseball team.   That guy who has faked an injury, after the match he will have to face his peers in the locker room. He will have to face me. And they didn’t like that,  Norris said  Hopefully the fine will set Tomic straight and he will not do that again. It’s certainly a lack of professionalism.  So how often did he get called out to treat fake injuries?  Very little. Very low percent of players have tried that.  The amount of prize money on offer these days appears to have its downside as during this year's championships, there were seven first-round retirements in the men's draw.  Some players such as Martin Klizan and Alexandr Dolgopolov were criticized for taking to court for their matches against Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer respectively as it was clear from the outset they were too injured to finish.  The back-to-back retirements on Centre Court angered many fans but Norris felt the players could not be blamed for trying to earn a living when an  average career is probably five to six years .   In the early days the game wasn’t as physical as it is now. When I first started they played with wooden rackets so you had to have more finesse. We had some injuries for our time but we never had the rotator tears of the muscle,  said Norris, who added that injuries increased by 10 to 15 percent during his time on the tour from 1973 to 2008.  Money Motivation  Money is a motivator so a lot of players play in events when they should be recovering. You can’t help that.  The worst injury seen this week, however, occurred mid match. American Bethanie Mattek-Sands howled in agony after she slipped and suffered a horrific knee injury during a second round match. Norris, however, has seen worse.  In 1975 New Zealander Jeff Simpson was playing doubles in an indoor tournament on carpet. He was playing at the net and he caught a smash into his neck,  recalled Norris, who has chronicled his life on the tour in the book 'Pain, Set and Match'.   The impact of that ball that hit Jeff's neck threw him to the ground. When he fell, he hit his head and had a concussion. It also triggered a convulsion.   Luckily I have a lot of emergency medical experience so I was able to resuscitate him and revive him. It was scary... and that was the worst one.  In those days there was no time limit on medical time outs and hence, astonishingly, Simpson had a day off and came back to win the doubles title in Washington. Norris, who now passes on his knowledge to juniors at the Evert Academy, feels rather than on-court injuries, the biggest threat to a player's health is  heat illness .   We have to educate the kids at the academies from an early age to properly hydrate. Heat exhaustion is a killer,  added the grandfather of four.

Self-ruled Taiwan, which is claimed by China and was governed by Japan from 1895-1945, is another sensitive issue, and a maritime territorial dispute over small islands in the East China Sea has deepened mutual suspicion in recent years. Beijing complained to Tokyo in March after a Japanese minister visited Taiwan, and China has also told Japan not to get involved in the dispute over the South China Sea.

The Brewers followed up an 11-2 rout of the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on Thursday with a 9-4 victory over the Yankees in the series opener. Milwaukee has won five in a row and eight of nine to open up a 4 1/2-game lead in the National League Central, and they are averaging seven runs a game during the 8-1 surge. Jesus Aguilar had a pair of homers - including the tiebreaking grand slam in the seventh inning - in Friday's win, and his franchise record-tying seven RBIs helped Milwaukee snap a 10-game losing streak in Yankee Stadium. New York had a 4-2 lead in the opener before its beleaguered bullpen gave up seven runs in 4 2/3 innings to contribute to the club's 17th loss in 23 games.

He has 13 strikeouts in nine frames over his last three outings (one start). The 27-year-old, who has never faced the Yankees, owns a 4.79 ERA in 10 career games (three starts) on the road, compared to 1.64 at home. Severino has given up at least four runs in three of his last four starts, including a rocky showing at Houston on Sunday in which he was reached for six runs in 5 1/3 innings. The 23-year-old does have 24 strikeouts against only three walks over a span of three outings, and he entered Friday ranked fourth among qualified hurlers in the American League in strikeout-to-walk ratio (4.56). Severino is 2-0 with a 0.47 ERA in four games (two starts) in interleague play, allowing 10 hits in 19 1/3 innings. Walk-Offs 1.

Minnesota took the first two in the series and four of its last five overall to pull within 1 1/2 games of the Indians in the Central. The Twins pounded out 15 runs on Thursday and Friday against the Orioles and totaled 22 hits in the two contests as Max Kepler has scored three runs and collected three RBIs, while Byron Buxton stayed hot while improving to 8-for-16 with five runs scored in the last four games.

Shortstop Elvis Andrus (paternity leave) and corner infielder Joey Gallo (hamstring) did not start on Friday, but second baseman Rougned Odor played though a hand injury and joined Adrian Beltre, Nomar Mazara and Jonathan Lucroy to supply Texas with all of its run production in a 10-0 rout in the opener. In addition to winning consecutive games for the first time in nearly two weeks, the Rangers (42-44) pulled into a virtual tie with the Angels (44-46) for second place in the American League West. Los Angeles has dropped four of five and failed to score more than three runs for the seventh time in 10 games - a stretch which includes three shutouts.

The 33-year-old hasn't been particularly sharp on the road in nine trips to the mound either, going 2-5 with a 6.17 ERA. Beltre is 2-for-14 while Odor is 5-for-11 with a pair of home runs against Chavez, who is 2-5 with a 6.00 ERA in 18 appearances (five starts) against the Rangers. Ross was unable to build on his best outing of the season but settled for a no-decision Sunday at the Chicago White Sox despite giving up four runs on four hits and five walks over five innings. The California native enjoyed the finest of his four turns since coming off the disabled list on June 27, holding Cleveland to one run on two hits and two walks across six frames. Pujols is 1-for-10 against Ross, who is 1-1 with a 1.98 ERA in nine appearances (five starts) versus the Angels. Walk-Offs 1.

Housing prices in Germany - relatively cheap compared with other European countries in the past - have risen sharply in recent years, prompting the Bundesbank to warn in May about the risk of a dangerous bubble developing.  We very closely watch the real estate market in Germany because we know that in over-valued real estate prices there might be a risk to financial stability,  Buch told an economic conference in southern France.  We don't see an immediate risk because prices are increasing, but there is not a lot of borrowing going on, so it's not a credit-financed increase in prices.  But Buch, who is in charge of financial stability at the Bundesbank, said it had less information about loan contract terms than other countries like France and was therefore less aware of credit standards. Average real estate prices in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt have increased by more than 60 percent since 2010, the Bundesbank estimates, reflecting solid growth, low unemployment and low borrowing costs. Buch said that the Bundesbank was generally concerned about low interest rates spurring risk taking at a time when asset valuations are already high.

Trump, a Republican who called it an  honor  to meet with the Russian president, drew swift criticism from Democrats at home, who accused him of dismissing U.S. intelligence and giving Putin's denial, reiterated on Friday, of Russian interference too much weight. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters at a summit of leaders of the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg that Trump had  positive chemistry  with Putin during the meeting, which lasted some two hours and 15 minutes. He opened their discussion by pressing Putin about  the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election  and had a robust exchange, Tillerson said. The Russian president has denied any meddling in the U.S. democratic process last year and Moscow has asked for proof that it took place. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Trump accepted Putin's assertions that the allegations, backed by U.S. intelligence agencies, were false. Tillerson said they both sought to move on.  The presidents rightly focused on how do we move forward from what may be simply an intractable disagreement at this point,  Tillerson said. That explanation did not sit well with Democrats. “Working to compromise the integrity of our election process cannot and should not be an area where ‘agree to disagree’ is an acceptable conclusion,  said U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a statement. On Thursday in Poland Trump gave lukewarm support to the view that Moscow interfered in the 2016 U.S. political process.

Trump says his team did not collude with Russia. Tillerson said they agreed to work on commitments of  non-interference in the affairs of the United States and our democratic process as well as those in other countries.  Andrew Weiss, a former National Security Council official responsible for Russia, said Trump had sent the wrong signal with upbeat body language and by not pushing Putin harder on alleged Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election.  The atmospherics were chummy,  said Weiss, who is now at Washington's Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington.  The clear push from Trump to normalize U.S.-Russian relations was on display in the meeting.

The face-to-face encounter was one of the most eagerly anticipated meetings between two leaders in years. Trump and Putin spoke through translators with their respective foreign ministers present for six minutes before reporters were allowed into the room for their statements. Afterwards the reporters were ushered out and the meeting continued.  President Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well,  Trump told reporters, sitting alongside the Russian leader. Slideshow (14 Images) We've had some very, very good talks. ... We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States and for everybody concerned. And it's an honor to be with you.  Putin, through a translator, said:  We spoke over the phone with you several times,  adding:  A phone conversation is never enough.   I am delighted to be able to meet you personally, Mr. President,  he said, noting that he hoped the meeting would yield results. Both men sat with legs splayed. Trump listened intently as Putin spoke. The encounter went longer than expected, and first lady Melania Trump came in at one point to urge them to conclude, Tillerson said. The two men later joined other G20 leaders at a concert. Mrs. Trump sat next to Putin at dinner. Before the get-together, some feared the U.S. president, a political novice whose team is still developing its Russia policy, would be less prepared for the talks than Putin, a former KGB agent who has dealt with previous U.S. presidents and scores of other world leaders. Amid criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine and Syria and the investigations into its role in the U.S. campaign, Trump has come under growing pressure to take a hard line against the Kremlin. On Thursday, Trump delivered some of his sharpest remarks about Moscow since becoming president, urging Russia to stop its  destabilizing activities  and end its support for Syria and Iran. But Trump stopped short on Thursday of any personal criticism of Putin and declined to say definitively whether he believed U.S. intelligence officials' assertion that Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  I think it was Russia but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure,” Trump said on a visit to Poland.

Standing in the ice queue, some camp residents said they would be happy to see the back of the militants, who subjected them to three years of violence and privation, but questioned how they would rebuild their lives in a ravaged city.  Most have lost their livelihoods, many have lost homes and relatives too.     There is nothing they (Islamic State) didn't take from us,  said Mohammed Haji Ahmed, who arrived at the camp just five days ago from the Souq al-Shaareen neighborhood in Mosul, where Iraqi forces are fighting to dislodge the last militants.     The clothes trader lost his house, his car, his business and 15 members of his extended family as a result of Islamic State's occupation of Mosul.      If there is no rebuilding and people don't return to their homes and regain their belongings what is the meaning of liberation?  he said. 'Safer Here Than There' After three weeks of fighting in the narrow streets of the Old City where Islamic State is making its last stand, state TV said on Saturday that Iraqi security forces expected to take full control of Mosul in the coming hours. Displaced children play with ropes in Hassan Sham camp, east of Mosul, Iraq, July 7, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniThe final phase of the battle has proved the bloodiest, with Islamic State trapped in a shrinking corner of the city. For displaced inhabitants, the ordeal may soon be over but the future remains uncertain.     There is no work there (in Mosul) and the situation is still not stable,  said Hussein, 18, who has fled Mosul twice this year.

It's safer here than there,  he said.     Many at the Hassan Sham camp are from the eastern half of the city, even though it was retaken in January and normal life has to some extent returned there.     Aziz Ahmad, 43, said he would return to Mosul if he could, but cannot afford the fare back to Mosul, let alone rent a place to live in the city, where increased demand for housing has pushed up prices.     Younis Idrees, 20, fled the Aden district four months ago fearing Islamic State sleeper cells and bombings.  Unless the situation improves we won't return,  he said.  It's not clear what will happen.      ($1 = 1,167.0000 Iraqi dinars) Editing by Helen Popper","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-refugees-idUSKBN19T0F7"},

It would be one of the first major structural changes in Gambia following the end of President Yahya Jammeh's more than 20-year rule in January. State-owned China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) (601800.SS) says one of its subsidiaries has made a bid for a  140 million euro ($159.91 million) contract Gambia has launched to redevelop the port. France's Bollore Group (BOLL.PA) has also submitted an offer to develop the port for hundreds of millions of dollars, sources told Reuters, and was part of a recent delegation of French investors to the country. The port was run by a state agency during Jammeh's rule. It is considered to have strategic potential thanks to its easy access to Atlantic shipping lanes.  Abdoulie Tambedou, managing director of the Gambia Ports Authority said there had already been several offers.  The Chinese are interested in investing in the infrastructure for an overall envelope of 140 million euros,  he told Reuters in an interview.  We hope to agree the financing in the next six months.  An official at CCCC confirmed that one of its subsidiaries was bidding for the contract, without specifying which. In a sign of their interest, a witness saw a Chinese delegation visiting the port last week. Tambedou confirmed Bollore's offer, without giving the price, and said this included both infrastructure costs and the rental concession. Chinese interest in the project follows China's resumption of diplomatic ties with former Taiwan ally Gambia last year under the  one China  policy, which states that self-ruled Taiwan is part of China.

Gambia is nonetheless seen as a key transit country for reaching remote areas of Guinea, Mali and Senegal that are easier to access from Banjul than from the countries' own ports and capitals.

Since the departure of Jammeh, Tambedou said that trade was picking up, with shippers sending imports such as sugar in bigger volumes than before.

More than 200 firefighters and 40 engines were sent to the 24-storey Grenfell Tower on June 14, rescuing 65 people from the devastated building. But the BBC said there were radio problems and a shortage of  extended duration  breathing apparatus, which allow firefighters to work for longer. A high ladder, which might have given the fire crews a better chance of stopping the blaze from engulfing the building, did not arrive for more than 30 minutes. Crews also cited problems with water pressure, the BBC said, although water firm Thames Water told the broadcaster that  any suggestion there was low pressure or that Thames Water did not supply enough water to fire services during this appalling tragedy is categorically false . London Fire Brigade, which could not immediately be reached to comment, told the BBC it had changed its procedures since the fire and its response would be reviewed. Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered a public inquiry into the blaze, the worst in the British capital since World War Two, although survivors and locals have expressed unhappiness with the government's choice of chairman for the probe, saying they were skeptical he would uncover wider issues. British police have also launched a major investigation into the fire and are considering a range of possible criminal offences including manslaughter. Meanwhile, Law firm Leigh Day confirmed on Saturday that it had suspended two members of staff after the Times newspaper reported that they had been touting for business by putting up posters offering help to survivors.  As soon as the posters were brought to our attention, a full internal investigation was commenced under formal protocols,  Leigh Day said in a statement.

Heavily armed police commandos moved in after activists had spent much of the day attempting to wrest control of the streets from more than 15,000 police, setting fires, looting and building barricades. With meetings between leaders of the club of 20 largest global economies finished for the day, police stormed the last holdouts, who had gathered in the Schanzenviertel district, an area known for its left-wing activism and culture of squatting. With two months to go before she seeks re-election, Chancellor Angela Merkel had hoped to cement Germany's growing global leadership role with a demonstration of its unwavering commitment to free speech, assembly and dissent by holding the summit in the center of a city with a proud radical tradition. Protesters torched cars and lorries, smashed windows in banks, looted retail stores and hurled paving slabs and other objects before police managed to restore order. Some 197 officers were injured after two days of clashes in the port city. Police made 19 arrests and detained dozens more. Standing in a nearby falafel restaurant, Mohammad Halabi, 32, a Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee some 18 months before, surveyed the scene with disbelief.  They are crazy. I can't believe my eyes,  he said.  They have such a beautiful country and they're destroying it.  But G20 participants said they had never seen protesters closer to such a summit than in Hamburg and praised the work of police in keeping the event safe, suggesting Merkel's gamble had paid off.

But in the night's most dramatic scenes, police pursued members of the radical Black Bloc movement, which wants to overthrow capitalism, across scaffolding as they sought refuge on rooftops. Below, burning barricades billowed thick smoke. Despite the chaos that threatened to overwhelm parts of the city during much of the day, the summit, with thousands of participants from dozens of countries, was largely unaffected. Police declined to clear U.S. first lady Melania Trump's motorcade to leave her hotel for a tour of the historic harbor, and protests delayed buses taking visitors away from the state dinner that concluded the meetings.

The host of the G20 summit addressed her counterparts on Friday in a hall at the Hamburg convention center, after video footage showed Trump shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the first face-to-face encounter between the two men. Merkel was shown talking casually with Putin as the leaders entered the hall, then joining French President Emmanuel Macron in a three-way discussion with Trump, who was seated between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Britain's Theresa May.  We all know the big global challenges and we know that time is pressing,  Merkel told the group.  And so solutions can only be found if we are ready for compromise and move toward each other, but without - and I stress this - bending too much, because of course we can also state clearly when there are differences.  Trump later held bilateral talks with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Putin. The meeting with the Russian leader is drawing intense scrutiny because of Trump's election campaign pledge to seek a rapprochement with Moscow. So far he has been unable to deliver on that promise amid accusations from U.S. intelligence services that Russia meddled in last year's presidential election and investigations into the Trump campaign's links to the country. Merkel, who is gearing up for a parliamentary election in September, faces the daunting task of steering the G20 toward a consensus on trade, climate change and migration - all issues that have become more contentious since Trump entered the White House half a year ago promising an  America First  approach. Last month he pulled the United States out of a landmark international agreement aimed at combating climate change. And he is threatening to take punitive trade measures in the steel sector which would hit China, Germany, Canada and a host of other countries. Related CoverageOfficials thrashing out G20 communique face long night: MerkelAngry and agile - anarchists give police hard time at Hamburg G20Police gain upper hand after Hamburg's day of G20 clashesThe Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported that President Xi had called on G20 nations to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and forestall risks in financial markets.  Xi also urged G20 members to develop financial inclusion and green finance to make the financial sector truly drive the development of the real economy,  Xinhua added. Envoys have been working for weeks to bridge differences, and European sources said they had come up with new language on the climate issue on Thursday which would be put to the leaders for approval. The latest draft communique sticks with language about the Paris climate accord being  irreversible  but removes a reference from an earlier version to a  global approach  that some countries felt could suggest there was a parallel track to Paris. It also includes a new paragraph which says the United States will  work closely with other partners to help their access to and use of fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently . Some experts were skeptical whether leaders would approve the reference to fossil fuels, which would be a clear nod to Washington.

Frightening  As the leaders met, police said they were sending reinforcements from other parts of Germany to cope with thousands of anti-capitalist protesters who set fire to cars, rubbish bins and wooden pallets in violence that Hamburg's interior minister called  frightening . U.S. First Lady Melania Trump was prevented from leaving her hotel to join a harbor tour because of security concerns, her spokeswoman said. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble canceled an appearance in downtown Hamburg. Slideshow (22 Images)Police said 160 officers had been injured, 45 protestors temporarily detained and another 15 taken into custody.  We have to expect everything, and we are expecting everything,  Hamburg Interior Minister Andy Grote said.  Merkel chose Hamburg, the port city where she was born, to send a signal about Germany's openness to the world, including its tolerance of peaceful protests. The summit is being held only a few hundred meters from one of Germany's most potent symbols of left-wing resistance, a former theater called the  Rote Flora  which was taken over by anti-capitalist squatters nearly three decades ago. Steel Threat On the policy front, sources said that Washington was backtracking on language condemning trade protectionism that Trump agreed to at a Group of Seven meeting in Sicily in May. The BRICS countries pushed back in a statement saying:  We firmly support a rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system, implementation and enforcement of existing WTO rules and commitments and oppose protectionism.  Hanging over the trade discussions is a threat by Washington to use a Cold War-era law to restrict steel imports based on national security concerns, a step that would hit the Chinese as well European producers. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday morning in Hamburg that the EU would respond  immediately and adequately  if the U.S. took action on steel. After sessions on terrorism, the global economy and climate on Friday, the leaders will be joined by their spouses for dinner at the Elbphilharmonie, a striking new glass concert hall perched atop an old warehouse building overlooking the Elbe River.

India has joined top buyers China and Japan to scour new markets after a powerful cyclone hit Australia that knocked out rail lines carrying coking coal to ports for export, causing a surge in prices. Steel Minister Chaudhary Birender Singh will be in Canada on Sunday along with executives of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) (SAIL.NS) for talks with Vancouver-based Teck over long-term, formula-based price deals, a top official in the steel ministry said, declining to be identified as the talks have not been made public.  Coking coal prices went haywire because of the natural calamity in Australia. There is every reason for India to not depend on only one source for coking coal,  the official said, adding the Canadian government had called upon the Indian minister to visit the country's mines. SAIL and Teck may explore signing a preliminary agreement, the official said.  At present, SAIL meets a little over three-fourths of its needs from BHP Billiton (BLT.L), (BHP.AX), the world's biggest shipper of coking coal, according to a second government official. India needs about 56 million to 57 million tonnes of coking coal every year, of which about 85 percent is imported. According to the government's newly-drafted National Steel Policy, India's coking coal requirements will more than double by the fiscal year ending in 2031. Executives from Teck Resources had visited India last month for preliminary discussions, said the two government officials.  Diversification is essential otherwise we are dependent on Australia and their supply sometimes becomes very volatile because of cyclones,  said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at India's biggest steel producer, JSW Steel (JSTL.NS).     JSW sources 60 percent of its coking coal supplies from Australia and the rest from Mozambique, the United States and  Canada. The steel minister's office and SAIL did not respond to Reuters' queries for comment. Steel plants use coking, or metallurgical, coal to fire blast furnaces and any shortfall can potentially close down production and risk damaging the furnaces.    In 2016, India imported 46.7 million tonnes of coking coal, higher than China's 35.7 million tonnes but lower than Japan's imports of 53.4 million tonnes, according to Clarksons Research. India's steel policy, which aims to nearly triple the country's production capacity by fiscal year 2031, has also recommended measures to reduce the dependence on imported coking coal and develop domestic washeries.

The groups argue the UNESCO designation will allow Chinese authorities to remove residents from the area, known as Hoh Xil in Qinghai province, and threaten its environment and nomadic culture.  The (UNESCO) Committee ignored the reality that Tibetans, and nomads in particular, are stewards of the landscape whose role is essential to sustaining the wildlife,  said Kai Mueller, executive director of the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT). The area has an elevation of more than 4,500 metres (14,764 feet) and is home to several endemic species as well as the entire migratory route of the endangered Tibetan antelope.  The designation of protected areas does not give UNESCO any powers of enforcement, but has proved to be controversial in areas plagued by conflicting territorial claims.  On Friday, UNESCO also designated an ancient shrine in the occupied West Bank, revered by both Jews and Muslims, as a  Palestinian World Heritage Site in Danger , angering Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who called the decision  delusional . The Tibetan rights groups argue the UNESCO designation could accelerate Chinese efforts to move nomads into settled villages.  UNESCO is supposed to uphold and safeguard the world's culture, but this shameful decision will do exactly the opposite and will ultimately assist China in denying Tibetans their fundamental rights,  Pema Yoko, executive director of advocacy group Students for a Free Tibet, said in a statement. At a U.N. forum in March, China was pressed by members to ease its clamp-down on Tibet, in a rare show of direct criticism from member countries. There are also large Tibetan communities in neighboring provinces like Qinghai and Sichuan. China's foreign ministry and did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. China rejects criticism from rights groups and exiles who accuse it of trampling on the religious and cultural rights of the Tibetan people, saying its rule has brought prosperity to a once-backward region. Chinese representatives argue the new UNESCO status is designed to help protect the area and will not impact traditional culture.  According to the ICT, Chinese representatives on Friday circulated a statement saying they would fully respect the herders and their culture. A UNESCO spokeswoman said the Chinese government had made a commitment that no forced relocation would be undertaken.  They also commit to work with the communities and other stakeholders to ensure protection and management of this site,  the spokeswoman told Reuters. The latest decision brings the number of UNESCO world heritage sites in China to more than 50.

Chase Utley drove in the 1,000th run of his 15-year career during the Dodgers' 4-1 win over the Kansas City Royals on Friday, but he didn't bother asking anyone to save the baseball -- it took one of the coaches to get the ball back from Royals catcher Salvador Perez. Yasiel Puig was less impressed with the home run he hit, a 429-foot blast off Jason Hammel (4-8) through the thick, humid air, than the fact he got finally saw a slider that wasn't in the dirt. It all added up to the Dodgers' 24th win their last 28 games, and their 15th win at home in 16 games that pushed their home record to an audacious 37-11. And it came against the hottest team in the American League. Puig's home run in the sixth pushed a Dodger lead to 3-1, which was enough for Kenta Maeda (7-4) and three relievers to snap Kansas City's four-game winning streak. Even with the loss, the Royals are 18-7 in their last 25 and in contention in the AL Central. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at DodgersLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch He pitched well,'' Puig said of Hammel.  But we were able to pick up on what he was throwing. He hung a slider. He threw so many in the dirt, one had to stay up.'' Puig was looking for the slider, moving up in the batter's box on the 2-2 pitch.  I'm going to hurt my shoulder if I keep going after sliders in the dirt,'' he said after his 16th home run of the season, three shy of his career-high 19 in 2013.  I just have to use my wrists more.''  Yasiel doesn't need the marine layer,'' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said about the airless evening.  When he hits it good, it's not coming back.'' Utley didn't come out for an ovation after his 1,00th RBI, and ducked in and out of the clubhouse in a flash.  Sorry guys, fireworks,'' he said, referring to the postgame entertainment.  You don't see much emotion with Chase,'' Roberts said.  But 1,000 is a great milestone. We've been anticipating this for a while.'' Royals manager Ned Yost, whose bullpen has been overworked the last week, chose to leave Hammel in for the sixth after giving up seven hits and walking three in the first five innings.  He was coming off a good inning,'' the manager said.  He made a good pitch and he (Puig) went down and got it. We had a chance to get to Maeda early and didn't take it.'' Maeda went five innings, allowing four hits and striking out five in addition to delivering a single that scored a run in the fourth inning. He handed the game to the bullpen, Scott Fields working an inning, Brock Stewart two perfect innings and Kenley Jansen the ninth for his 21st save. Mike Moustakes doubled and scored on an Alcides Escobar single to give the Royals a 1-0 lead in the fourth, but the Dodgers got two back on singles by Utley, Maeda, Logan Forsythe and Corey Seager. Puig homered in the sixth and Utley drove in Joc Pederson with his double in the eighth. NOTES: Dodgers 1B Chase Utley, 38, drove in the 1,000th run of his career, making him one of nine active players with 1,000, joining Albert Pujols, Adrian Beltre, Miguel Cabrera, Carlos Beltran, Matt Holliday, Adrian Gonzalez, Robinson Cano and Victor Martinez. ...

Denard Span's one-out homer ended Straily's shutout bid and his night, but not before he set a career high for innings pitched (8 1/3) and run his career record against the Giants to 4-0. Giancarlo Stanton and J.T. Realmuto hit home runs, and Dee Gordon had four hits, as the Marlins evened their record at 4-4 on a 10-game trip. The loss snapped the Giants' three-game home winning streak and saw them lose one of their top hitters, left fielder Austin Slater, along the way. The rookie injured his right hip trying to run out a ground ball, and is expected to be placed on the disabled list Saturday. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at GiantsMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch That's a bad break for the kid, and for us,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  I mean, he was doing a nice job out there. But he's going to be down for a little while. I can't tell you how long.  Straily (7-4) pitched into the ninth inning for the first time in 94 career starts before leaving having allowed one run and four hits. He struck out three and did not walk a batter en route to his third consecutive win.  We were joking (in the dugout) about maybe I wouldn't get any strikeouts,  Straily noted.  Being a fly-ball pitcher in the (San Francisco) Bay, I experienced it on the other side of the Bay (while with the Oakland Athletics). You get the marine air here at night. Just keep throwing strikes and hope they hit it in the air.  Straily is now 2-0 with a 1.13 ERA in two starts in San Francisco. Stanton gave Straily all the offensive support he needed with a two-run homer in a four-run first inning off Giants left-hander Matt Moore (3-9). The All-Star added a double in the fourth inning, coming within a couple of feet of scaling the 25-foot right field wall at AT&T; Park for the second time in one game.  That was impressive,  Straily said of his teammate's opposite-field power display.  He's a lot of fun to watch on a daily basis.  Only 40 balls hit by right-handers have cleared the wall in the 18-year history of the ballpark. Realmuto had three hits, and Stanton, Christian Yelich, Justin Bour and JT Riddle added two hits apiece for the Marlins, who will return home after the series to host the All-Star Game festivities beginning Monday. Span's homer landed in the San Francisco Bay beyond the right field wall, his third career  Splash Hit  and the 74th in Giants history. Joe Panik had two doubles for the Giants, who began a stretch of 21 of 29 at home. The Marlins out-hit the Giants 16-5. Moore was pulled after 3 1/3 innings, having allowed a career-high-tying 12 hits and five runs. He struck out one and did not walk a batter.  That's a lot of hits there in 3 1/3 (innings),  Bochy said.  It was just one of those nights where it wasn't going well for him, but he actually was pounding the strike zone well. He just didn't expand a few times when he needed to. The stuff was fine; he just made too many mistakes.  Stanton's homer, his 24th of the season, came on Moore's seventh pitch of the game. It followed a game-opening infield single by Gordon. Moore got the next two Marlins out but then served up four consecutive singles, including a bases-loaded, two-run hit to Riddle that made it 4-0. Bour's second hit, a two-out single in the second, plated Gordon for a 5-0 lead. Realmuto made it 6-0 in the fifth with his eighth homer of the year, a solo shot off Cory Gearrin. NOTES: Marlins RF Giancarlo Stanton's home run was the first over the right field wall at AT&T; Park by a right-handed hitter since Giants INF/OF Kelby Tomlimson accomplished the feat in October 2015. There has never been a  Splash Hit  by a right-handed batter in the history of AT&T; Park. ... The homers by Stanton and J.T. Realmuto gave the Marlins 100 for the season. It's the fourth time they've reached the century mark before the All-Star break, the first time since 2008. ... The career-high-tying 12 hits allowed by Giants LHP Matt Moore equaled the number he allowed to the Baltimore Orioles while pitching for the Tampa Bay Rays on June 9, 2013. He has allowed 10 or more hits six times in his career, three of them this season. ... Marlins LHP Chris O'Grady is slated to make his major league debut in the second game of the series Saturday. He was promoted from Triple-A New Orleans on Friday, taking the place on the active roster of RHP Edinson Volquez (tendinitis in left knee), who was placed on the disabled list. ... The Giants made two transactions before the game, promoting INF Miguel Gomez from Double-A Richmond and reinstating 3B Conor Gillaspie (back spasms) from the DL while demoting RHP Chris Stratton to Triple-A Sacramento and placing 3B Ryder Jones (bruised right wrist) on the DL.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-marlins-giants-writethru-idUSMTZED78RAWYZC"},

Like everyone using Jean Segura's walk-up music,  El Que Fue,  by Mexican pop star Samo. There was some method behind the madness, as the Seattle shortstop was coming off three consecutive multi-hit games, including a four-hit effort in the series opener Thursday against Oakland.  (Thursday night) he told us we should all hit to that song,  Mariners designated hitter Nelson Cruz said.  In the hitter's meeting (Friday), I told them to play it all night.  The move worked, especially for the All-Star cleanup hitter. Cruz hit his 300th career home run and drove in five runs as the Mariners defeated the Athletics 7-2. Cruz had run-scoring singles in his first two at-bats, then cranked a three-run homer in the bottom of the eighth inning off A's reliever Liam Hendriks. Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at MarinersOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch Some guys are already tired of it,  Cruz said of Segura's taste in music.  I'm going to dream that song.  Cruz received a standing ovation after his milestone homer and popped back up to the top step of the dugout to tip his helmet to the fans. He said it was the first time he's ever had a curtain call.  It's special,  said Cruz, who is tied for the major league lead with 68 RBIs this season.  It's a long way from the Dominican. Never in my dreams would I hit 300 home runs in the big leagues.  Cruz's big night overshadowed a strong performance by left-hander James Paxton (7-3), who allowed just two runs on two hits in seven innings and tied his season high with nine strikeouts. Paxton won his second straight decision after a three-game losing streak.  Paxton was really good. He turned up the dial,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  That's what ace-type pitchers do.  Oakland's Sean Manaea (7-5) nearly matched Paxton but left after seven innings with his team trailing 3-2. The left-hander, who was 6-1 with a 2.84 ERA in nine starts since suffering a loss May 15 at Seattle, allowed three runs on eight hits. He walked one and struck out three.  All things considered he gave us seven innings when it looked like he might give us four, and really should have given up one run,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  There are times when he doesn't have his good stuff, and he ends up pitching like that. For a young kid, he's come a long way and now he's able to battle and get through tough stretches. He pitched well enough to win that game, for sure.  The Mariners teed off on Hendriks, the Australian right-hander, in the eighth. Danny Valencia led off with a double down the right-field and Robinson Cano walked. Cruz hit the next pitch 433 feet into left-center field to make it 6-2.  I don't know what the exit velocity on that, but it was a rocket,  Servais said. Mitch Haniger followed with a one-hop double off the center-field fence. That was all for Hendriks, who didn't retire any of the four batters he faced. Haniger advanced to third on a wild pitch from Zach Neal and scored on Kyle Seager's sacrifice fly for the final margin. The Mariners took the lead in the first as Valencia and Cano singled with one out and Cruz hit a run-scoring single to left field. The A's responded with two runs in the third. With one out, Matt Joyce singled to right and moved to second on a throwing error following Ryan Lavarnway's flyout. After a walk to Rajai Davis, Marcus Semien hit a two-run double down the left-field line. The Mariners regained the lead in the bottom of the inning as Segura and Valencia led off with singles. Cano grounded into a fielder's choice to put runners at first and third, and Segura scored on another run-scoring single by Cruz, making it 2-2. A single by Haniger loaded the bases and Cano scored the go-ahead run on Seager's sacrifice fly to center field.  Pitching, defense and timely hitting is a good recipe for us,  Servais said. NOTES: Mariners 2B Robinson Cano was named an injury replacement for the American League in next Tuesday's All-Star Game in Miami. ... Seattle made a roster move, sending starting RHP Sam Gaviglio, who suffered the loss Thursday, to Triple-A Tacoma and calling up RHP Emilio Pagan. ...

Greinke threw seven scoreless innings in the Diamondbacks' 6-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Chase Field, stopping a three-game losing streak marked by three one-run losses to the National League West-leading Dodgers. Arizona failed to hold a 4-1 lead in the ninth inning of a 5-4 loss Thursday.  I felt like it was a big win,  Greinke said.  It was a bad series in L.A. We played close but just didn't get any wins. It's nice to get a win and have some positive thoughts again.  Greinke (11-4) gave up four hits, struck out seven and walked one while extending his home dominance. He is 9-0 with a 2.41 ERA in 11 home starts this season, the first pitcher to win his first nine home decisions since Jose Fernandez and Jordan Zimmermann in 2013. Greinke had two runners on base in only one inning, the seventh, but struck out Jose Peraza on a slider after giving up a two-out walk to Eugenio Suarez and a single to Scott Schebler. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at DiamondbacksCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch We had the right guy step up,  Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.  When a No. 1 guy is on board, you really appreciate these moments. He was the right guy for us at the right time. He did exactly what he is supposed to do.  I know nothing changes to his approach, but I think he had the weight of 24 guys on his shoulders and he carried all of it.  Paul Goldschmidt hit his 20th homer and Greinke singled in a run as the Diamondbacks (53-34) extended the best start in franchise history. Arizona is 33-13 at home, the second-best home record in the majors. Greinke had a busy night all the way around. He was hit by a pitch in the left forearm in a two-run second inning and drove in a run with a two-out single in the fourth for a 3-0 lead.  It didn't affect anything,  Greinke said of the spot where he was hit.  It was no big deal.  The Diamondbacks led 6-0 before the Reds scored three in the ninth inning. All-Star Joey Votto hit a two-run homer with no outs off T.J. McFarland and Schebler added a bases-empty homer off Jake Barrett with two outs. After Peraza beat out an infield single, Fernando Rodney entered and got the final out for his 22nd save. Rodney did not retire any of the six batters he faced while giving up four runs in the ninth inning Thursday.  We lost a few in a row, but it was not the first time,  Goldschmidt said.  That was really behind us. Zack pitched great. We got those two runs early and then we were able to add on and close it out.  The Reds (37-49) are 14-29 on the road. Only the Phillies have fewer road wins. Brandon Drury had two doubles, two walks and an RBI and Goldschmidt had his 67th RBI, tied with teammate Jake Lamb and Miami left fielder Marcell Ozuna for second in majors to Colorado's Nolan Arenado (68). Drury doubled in a run and scored in the second, and doubled and scored in the fourth. Goldschmidt homered to make it 4-0 in the fifth, and David Peralta doubled in a run in a two-run seventh and scored the other when he stole third and came around on an errant throw. Adam Duvall had two hits for the Reds.  We have the ability to score runs, as we saw there late in the game,  Cincinnati manager Bryan Price said.  We didn't do much with Greinke.  NOTES: Cincinnati signed No. 1 draft pick Hunter Greene, the second overall selection in the June draft, for a $7.23 million bonus on the final day draftees could sign.

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2uxKwbb By John Kemp LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - U.S. independent oil and gas producers came close to breaking even during the first quarter of 2017 thanks to aggressive cost cutting and improvements in well productivity. Some shale producers claim they can drill wells profitably at prices well below $50 per barrel and in some cases below $40. But Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources , a major producer in North Dakota and Oklahoma, has said oil prices need to be above $50 to be sustainable. Prices below $40 would force producers to idle rigs again, he said in a recent interview (“Harold Hamm warns oil prices below $40 will idle U.S. drilling”, CNBC, June 28). The renewed drop in oil prices, unless quickly reversed, looks set to put these conflicting claims to the test. Fifteen independent producers with operations focused on the United States reported a combined net loss of $3.7 billion in the first three months of 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2uxKwbb). But most of the losses were attributable to Marathon Oil, which reported a net loss of $4.9 billion, mostly as a result of an impairment charge linked to its Canadian oil sands businesses. The other fourteen companies in the sample reported total net income of almost $1.3 billion, up from a loss of $9.9 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Ten companies in the sample reported positive net income during the first quarter, up from just two in the previous quarter and none in the first quarter of 2016. Financial performance for the companies in the sample has been steadily improving since losses peaked at $23 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Shale producers have benefited from a combination of cost reductions, improvements in drilling efficiency and well productivity, and a significant increase in oil and gas prices. The average price of WTI, the domestic benchmark, rose from $33 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 to $52 in the first quarter of 2017. The average price of gas delivered to Henry Hub rose from just $2 per million British thermal units to $3.07 over the same period. But benchmark oil prices fell by 7 percent in the second quarter, though gas prices were up 2 percent. Both oil and gas prices have slid so far in the third quarter. Given the precarious profitability of oil producers in the first quarter when oil prices were above $50, the slide in WTI during the second and third quarters will renew the pressure on drilling firms. Unless there are further exceptional write-downs, the sample group may be able to increase their net income in the second quarter despite the fall in prices. Many, though not all, shale producers have hedged the price of their output for the remainder of 2017 which gives them some protection in the short-term against the downturn. But very little production has been hedged so far for 2018. The current calendar strip means hedging is only possible for 2018 at a WTI price of around $47 - and many shale producers will actually receive less.

Colorado scored four runs in the first inning and added two more in the second while pounding the Chicago White Sox 12-4. The four-run first was the Rockies' biggest inning since they scored four runs in the bottom of the ninth on June 18 to beat San Francisco. The victory was just fourth in 16 games for the Rockies, who had averaged 3.2 runs per game during their 3-12 slide. They matched their season high in runs scored. It's the fourth time they have scored 12 runs. Colorado also reached a season-high with 17 hits, 11 coming with two strikes.  I think we are more of that team that we saw tonight than what we've seen in the last couple weeks,  Rockies manager Bud Black said. The win was Black's 700th as a major league manager. While grateful for the milestone, Black didn't want to call any personal attention to it. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at RockiesChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch Hopefully, there's more of these from a team standpoint to come,  Black said. DJ LeMahieu, Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado, who had three hits and a season-high five RBIs, homered for the Rockies, who added to the recent misery of White Sox starter Derek Holland. Blackmon had three hits, as did Gerardo Parra, who was reinstated Friday from the 10-disabled list after missing 28 games.  It was good to get off to a start like that,  Arenado said.  I felt we hadn't done that in a long time. I feel like we've been behind or it's taken us five or six innings (to get rolling) ...It was nice to win like that after what we've been going through lately.  Pitcher German Marquez, who had two career hits in 25 at-bats, matched that total with a double, his first extra-base hit, and a single. He scored two runs, one more than he had scored in his career, trotting home on the two-run shots by LeMahieu and Arenado. Arenado has five games with five or more RBIs. More importantly for the Rockies, Marquez (6-4) pitched well. After pitching six innings in just one of his past seven starts, Marquez worked seven innings -- his longest outing since he pitched a career-high eight innings May 10 against the Chicago Cubs -- and threw 73 of 102 pitches for strikes. Marquez gave up nine hits and three runs in seven innings with no walks for the first time this season and five strikeouts. He gave up a run in the first when Todd Frazier doubled and moved up on a fly ball and a grounder and yielded a two-run homer to Tim Anderson in the seventh.  (No walks) was the key,  Marquez said.  My (fastball) location was amazing, and my curve was really good today.  Holland (5-9) is 1-6 with an 8.76 ERA in his past eight starts with 12 home runs allowed in 37 innings and is 0-4 with an 18.44 ERA in his past four road starts. Coming off a losing start against Texas when he yielded five hits and five runs in 5 1/3 innings, Holland surrendered eight hits and seven runs in four innings, The first six Rockies reached base against him. Arenado singled home a run after Blackmon walked and LeMahieu singled. With the bases loaded, Parra drove in a run with an infield single that ricocheted off Holland's glove toward second base. Trevor Story followed with a two-run single. After the White Sox manufactured a run in the second, Marquez doubled down the left-field line to open the second inning and scored on LeMahieu's fourth homer.  Today was just flat-out embarrassing,  Holland said.  I don't even know where to begin. I put my teammates in a hole, gave up four runs right out of the gate. Then they put up a run for me, and of course, I go back out there and give up another run. It's a frustrating thing on my part.  I'm not doing my job. I need to be a lot better than I was for this start and my last start. The only positive is I've gotten through half the year so far healthy. That's a big plus.

The pair of B-1B Lancer strategic bombers flew from a U.S. base on Guam and were joined by U.S. and South Korean jet fighters to conduct the simulated destruction of an enemy ballistic missile launcher and underground facilities, the South's air force said. North Korea announced on Tuesday it successfully test-launched an ICBM, saying the missile was capable of carrying a large and heavy nuclear warhead. Some experts believe the missile has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and the test signaled a significant advance in the North's declared intent to build a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the U.S. mainland.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the test indicated a quicker than expected pace of the North's ICBM program. The B-1B bombers conducted the live-fire exercise at a range in South Korea's eastern Gangwon province, dropping weapons in a simulated attack on a missile launcher, the South Korean air force said in a statement. South Korean and U.S. fighter jets conducted precision strike drills aimed at attacking enemy targets hidden underground, it said. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the bombers then flew west, hugging the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) border between the two Koreas, before leaving South Korean airspace. The drill follows a joint artillery and missile exercise by South Korean and U.S. forces a day after the North's ICBM test.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday in Hamburg, where the leaders of G20 nations are meeting, there would not be many good options left on North Korea if the peaceful pressure campaign failed. Slideshow (2 Images)U.S. President Donald Trump vowed on Thursday to confront the North  very strongly  and said  Washington was considering  severe things  for the isolated state following the ICBM test.     The United States, Japan and South Korea agreed on Friday to push for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution to put new sanctions on North Korea.  On the sidelines of the G20 summit, Trump, Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to apply  maximum pressure  to counter the North nuclear threat. North Korea has hailed the ICBM test as marking the completion of is strategic weapons capability that it says includes atomic and hydrogen bombs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a mausoleum honouring state founder Kim Il Sun on Saturday, the anniversary of his grandfather's death, the North's official KCNA news agency reported. He was joined by military officials who contributed to the success of the ICBM test, the news agency said.

Hours after visiting Monument Park, Aguilar hit his first career grand slam onto the netting above the attraction beyond the left-center field wall to give Milwaukee an 8-4 lead. He hit the homer on 3-2 fastball against Tyler Clippard to cap a seven-pitch at-bat. Aguilar's grand slam marked the 11th seven-RBI game in team history and first since Ryan Braun on Aug. 6 at Arizona. It also was the most by any rookie in team history. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at YankeesMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchAguilar became the first rookie to get seven RBIs since San Diego's Hunter Renfroe on Sept. 27 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also was the second rookie with at least seven RBIs against the Yankees, joining Walt Dropo, who did it for the Boston Red Sox on July 1, 1950. Before connecting off Clippard, Aguilar hit a two-run homer on a full count in the third inning off Jordan Montgomery and lifted a sacrifice fly to put the game in a 4-4 deadlock. Aguilar's second homer also occurred after Aaron Judge made some history of his own with a solo shot off Josh Hader (1-0) in the fifth. Judge's latest blast gave him 30 for the season and broke the mark he shared with Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who hit 29 as a rookie in 1936. Judge's home run became an afterthought for the Brewers thanks to Aguilar's big night. He entered the game second among rookies in batting average and increased it 13 points to .299.  I'm very very happy. I'm happy I tied Braun's record, but most important I'm happy that we got the win,  Aguilar said through a translator.  That's all that matters. As long as we keep winning. We just got to keep playing the way we've been playing and just try to keep winning. I'm happy to be able to help the team.  The Brewers continued playing well despite committing five errors for the first time on the road since July 21, 1984, at Oakland.  I'm pretty sure that doesn't happen,  Aguilar said.  The most important thing is We came back from it. We put our heads up. We kept having good at-bats, we kept having a good game and, we were able to win.  Coincidentally, Aguilar made the last of those errors as he dropped a throw from Junior Guerra right before a 51-minute rain delay. Before the delay, right fielder Domingo Santana and second baseman Jonathan Villar made two fielding errors apiece, but the Yankees only scored three runs on a sacrifice fly by Clint Frazier and a two-run homer by Ji-Man Choi. By not being able to stop Aguilar from producing the best game of his brief career, the Yankees lost for the 17th time in 23 games since June 12. New York lost a game when its opponent made five errors for the second time since 1962 (also July 9, 1995 at Texas).  It's really disappointing, but we didn't have many hits,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  They gave us some opportunities through their errors and we scored some runs, but we didn't have a lot of hits tonight.  Before allowing Aguilar's grand slam, Clippard (1-5) threw a wild pitch that scored Braun ahead of the game-tying sacrifice fly. He also walked Villar and Santana in the seventh and the Yankees opted to intentionally walk left-handed third baseman Travis Shaw.  I was trying to throw a good fastball down and away and didn't execute,  Clippard said.  I was trying to go down and away and it leaked middle-middle.  Guerra was lifted with a right shin contusion after allowing three runs (one earned) and two hits in 3 1/3 innings. Hader struck out seven in three innings after Judge homered off him. Before New York's bullpen faltered again, Montgomery allowed two runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings. He came out after the rain delay but was lifted after allowing consecutive hits to Orlando Arcia and Villar.

Hildenberger did his job. Four others relievers matched him and the Twins' offense finally broke through against Kevin Gausman. Kennys Vargas had three hits and drove in two runs in his return from the minors, Eddie Rosario added three hits and the Twins' bullpen supplied 6 1/3 scoreless innings in Friday's 9-6 comeback win against the Orioles.  I think the best part of it was the big comeback,  Hildenberger said after his first major league win.  Being in the dugout for those two big rallies was really, really fun. It kind of makes me want to be in the dugout all the time. It wasn't just me. The whole bullpen put up zeroes all game. (Ryan) Pressly came in and picked me up after that. (Matt) Belisle with some big outs, and (Taylor) Rogers and (Brandon) Kintzler have been nails all year.  Vargas returned from Triple-A Rochester after Joe Mauer went on the disabled list with back issues and hammered two balls off the outfield wall, including a two-run double in the go-ahead fifth inning. Minnesota has now won all five games against Baltimore this season. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at TwinsBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatch We just have to battle every pitch, and try and get back in the game run by run,  Vargas said.  We're just still fighting, taking good at-bats. We got those hits at the right moment. That was the key.  Hildenberger (1-0) gave up two hits and struck out three batters in 2 1/3 innings in relief of starter Felix Jorge. On the day he was named an All-Star, Brandon Kintzler finished off his American League-leading 24th save in 27 chances. Miguel Castro (1-1) took the loss in relief of Gausman. Castro allowed one run on two hits in one inning of work. Manny Machado had four hits, including two homers. Seth Smith added a solo home run for the Orioles, who've lost five games in a row and seven of their past eight.  They're a good team over there and you got to give them credit for what they're doing,  Machado said.  It's baseball. We all struggle some way or another. We go 0 for 30, pitchers can get rocked all day, it's just part of the game. This is what we're going through right now, and it's just going to make us stronger down the line.  Jorge's second career start wouldn't go as well as his debut last week when he earned a win against the Kansas City Royals. Smith opened the game with his ninth homer of the season and the seventh of his career leading off a game. Machado followed with a home run for the Orioles' sixth set of back-to-back homers this season. It was the first time since May 20, 2016, against the Angels that Baltimore had done so leading off a game. Jorge walked No. 9 hitter Ruben Tejada leading off the third and the top of the Orioles' order again went to work. Smith singled and Machado followed with a three-run homer. It was the 11th multi-homer game of Machado's career and the second this season. Trey Mancini added an RBI single to end Jorge's night. Meanwhile, Gausman was controlling the Twins on the other side. The right-hander had thrown 12 1/3 scoreless innings in his previous two starts and didn't allow a run until unraveling in the fourth. Miguel Sano and Max Kepler had infield singles with one out. Vargas singled to right field to load the bases. Rosario plated one run with a single to center and the bases remained loaded. Chris Gimenez was hit by a pitch to bring another run but two strikeouts got Gausman out of the jam. Brian Dozier started the fifth with a triple, followed by Robbie Grossman's RBI double. Machado's throwing error allowed Sano to reach base. Kepler added an RBI single, Vargas knocked a two-run double and Gimenez laced an RBI single off Castro for a 7-6 lead.  I wanted to be the guy to kind of right the ship, turn us around tonight and then have two more games of this series,  Gausman said.  Hopefully we kind of gain some momentum and get some momentum going into the break. We got to off to a great start offensively, six runs in the first couple innings just what a starting pitcher wants.  I just tried to battle as much as I could. I left a couple key pitches in bad spots. Unfortunately, those infield hits kind of came around and scored. You just got to try to minimize.  NOTES: Minnesota signed RHP Bartolo Colon to a minor league contract. Colon will report to Triple-A Rochester. ... RHP Felix Jorge was optioned to Double-A Chattanooga after the game as the Twins recalled OF Zack Granite. ... Baltimore announced LHP Wade Miley (3-7, 5.20 ERA) will start Saturday's day game. ...

The process of reflation is a long one that remains highly dependent on accommodative monetary policy.

LOUIS -- Jacob deGrom said it wasn't fun to give up four homers in a game for the first time in his career. But because it occurred as part of a win, the ignominious feat went down a little bit easier for the New York Mets' ace. Overcoming the St. Louis Cardinals' barrage of long balls, deGrom picked up his fifth consecutive victory Friday night, working seven innings in the Mets' 6-5 decision. In upping his record to 9-3, deGrom allowed eight hits and four runs, walking none and fanning five. The four homers were St. Louis' first four hits of the game, so deGrom never worked from the stretch until Paul DeJong's leadoff single in the fifth.  It was not fun, but at least they were solo shots,  deGrom said.  Our guys kept putting up runs for me, so I had to figure it out. I had to start getting the ball down. You just try to forget about the bad ones.  After retiring the first six men he faced, deGrom coughed up a 419-foot blast to Randal Grichuk and a 418-foot shot to DeJong to start the third. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at CardinalsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchTo begin the fourth, deGrom surrendered the Cardinals' second pair of back-to-back jacks in as many innings, as Dexter Fowler and Jedd Gyorko both drilled pitches over the right field wall. Jose Reyes and Jay Bruce unloaded solo shots for New York before the fifth inning was done on a night where normally pitcher-friendly Busch Stadium might as well have been Coors Field. The six combined homers were one off the record for a game at the 12-year old ballpark.  You could feel it tonight -- the ball was jumping,  St. Louis second baseman Matt Carpenter said.  You'd stand on second and the wind would blow in your face.  But deGrom, who got two extra days of rest because of a rainout in Washington on Wednesday night and an off-day Thursday, survived. He induced two 5-4-3 double plays to work out of trouble in the fifth and sixth innings, and handed a 6-4 lead to the bullpen.  It goes back to what we talk about all the time -- he's a competitive kid,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  He had great velocity with the extra rest, but his location was off.  Fortunately for New York (39-45), Cardinals ace Carlos Martinez (6-8) endured a second straight five-inning, five-run outing. Working without his top stuff or command, Martinez permitted seven hits and three walks, fanning four.  I didn't feel too great about it,  Martinez said through an interpreter.  I was trying my hardest, but for some reason, my pitches weren't (going) where I wanted them to.  Martinez walked the first two batters of the game and hit T.J. Rivera with the bases loaded later in the first, giving the Mets a cheap run. Reyes made it 2-0 to start the second with his ninth homer. After St. Louis' first set of consecutive homers, New York regained a two-run lead. Travis d'Arnaud singled home Reyes, and Curtis Granderson laced a 3-0 pitch down the right field line to score deGrom, on base after forcing out d'Arnaud. In the fifth, Bruce whacked his 22nd homer on a 1-2 breaking ball that drifted over the plate's middle. The 401-foot shot was his fourth career hit against Martinez, doubling his total before the game.  We were hitting mistakes,  Bruce said.  He left some balls out over the plate.  Rivera's RBI double in the seventh scored Yoenis Cespedes, who reached on Carpenter's third error in five games, with what proved to be the winning run. Gyorko's sacrifice fly in the eighth drew the Cardinals (41-45) within one, but closer Addison Reed sailed through a clean ninth on 11 pitches for his 15th save in 17 chances.

The left-hander, who shaved his beard and showed off a new mustache, allowed just three singles in 7 2/3 innings as the Texas Rangers pounded the Los Angeles Angels 10-0 on Friday night. The victory gave the Rangers consecutive wins for the first time since June 24-25 and they reached double figures in runs for just the second time since June 23. The Angels have dropped four of their last five games and six of eight. Hamels (4-0) matched his season high with six strikeouts and has posted 13 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings, the longest streak by a Texas starter this season. He got all the run support he'd need in the first when Texas scored three times off Ricky Nolasco (4-10), which was more than enough for Hamels and two relievers as the Rangers notched their fourth shutout of the season. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at RangersLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatch I was just being aggressive in the strike zone,  Hamels said.  That's something I was really trying to focus on in the last start. I'm still working on it but at the same time if I can still make hitters uncomfortable and try to get the count in my favor, throw a lot of pitches that might not be strikes but look like strikes and get some good swings to be my advantage, it definitely eases everything.  So does a bunch of offensive support, which Texas had in winning by double digits for the second time this year. Rougned Odor's RBI single gave Texas its first run and Jonathan Lucroy followed with a two-run double to left. Nolasco, who hadn't allowed a run in his last two starts, didn't make it out of the second inning as the Rangers tacked on five more runs to build an 8-0 lead. Nomar Mazara's RBI single increased the Texas lead to 4-0 before Adrian Beltre hit a three-run homer to left. Odor followed with a solo homer to right to give Texas its first back-to-back homers on the season. That ended the night for Nolasco. He was charged with eight runs on seven hits in 1 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out two.  It was a pretty terrible game,  Nolasco said.  I put us in a huge hole, just a bad game. All around I wasn't hitting any of my spots. I have to shake it off and be ready for the next one. It's just one start. You say it's just one of those days. Shake it off and keep going forward.  It didn't help that the Angels weren't able to avoid the big inning after getting two outs. Texas scored all eight of its runs off Nolasco with two outs in the inning. He retired the first two batters in the bottom of the first before Mazara got the Texas offense going with a walk. It was downhill for him and the Angels from there.  Two quick outs in the first inning, then those guys backed up hit after hit,  Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia said.  Then in the just, just begging behind guys and then, when he (Nolasco) did get ahead, just didn't put guys away. His stuff wasn't as crisp today. Those guys had a good offensive day. We've got to turn the page on it.  Texas finished with 12 hits, including two from Beltre. His homer was part of a 2-for-4 night and the three RBIs moved him past Mike Schmidt and into a tie with George Brett for 32nd on the all-time list with 1,596.  I'm seeing the ball OK,  Beltre said.  It's a work in progress. Obviously, I could be better. I'm surprised I'm able to catch those guys. I'm glad it happened obviously. It means that I've been playing for a long time. That's it.  Odor also had three hits and two RBIs. Mazara blasted a two-run homer to right-center in the sixth inning and finished with two hits, three RBIs and three runs scored. Delino DeShields also had two hits. Los Angeles didn't have a runner reach second base in the game. Albert Pujols singled twice and accounted for two of his team's three hits as the Angels were shut out for the eighth time this season, with three of those coming in the last 10 games.

It was plenty good enough, though, as Hedges' sacrifice fly in the ninth inning lifted the Padres to a 4-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on a rainy Friday night at Citizens Bank Park. Despite coming through with the game-winning RBI, Hedges afterward was lamenting the fact he didn't do what he was originally supposed to -- lay down a suicide squeeze to try and drive the winning run home. Instead of getting the bunt in play, Hedges whiffed on the first two attempts, forcing him to get it done a different way.  I should have gotten the safety squeeze down. I would have been a lot more excited about it -- well, that's false, I was excited about the sac fly,  he said.  Obviously, I wish I got the sac (bunt) down but to still go out and win the at-bat, that's tough to do after you screw up what you're supposed to.  The sacrifice fly capped off a powerful offensive night for Hedges, who earlier hit two solo home runs for his first multi-homer game in the major leagues. It was the last at-bat that most impressed his manager, however. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at PhilliesSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatch You've got a strikeout pitcher on the mound with a very good split and a very good high fastball and if you're evaluating where (Hedges') strengths and weaknesses reside, that's not the greatest matchup,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  Which is great credit to him that even with two strikes he managed to get the job done today. That was a great job after not getting the safety squeeze down.  A 94-minute rain delay midway through the seventh inning helped the Phillies get right back into a game they had trailed to that point. San Diego starter Clayton Richard had limited his opponents to five hits and one run in six innings before the storm forced the Padres to go to the bullpen.  He was outstanding,  Hedges said.  First couple of innings he was on point, he was as good as he's been, and he lost a little bit of command later but he's such a good competitor that we made an adjustment and he was able to give us six great innings.  The Phillies put runners on second and third against reliever Phil Maton, and pinch-hitting Daniel Nava made it a one-run game with a ground ball to the mound. Freddy Galvis then tied it up with a single through the gap at short off left-hander Brad Hand, scoring rookie outfielder Nick Williams, who had doubled in a pinch-hitting appearance. Hand (2-4), the Padres' only All-Star selection, ran into more trouble in the eighth, walking Tommy Joseph and giving up a single to Odubel Herrera to put men on first and second with one out. But he struck out Andres Blanco and Cameron Rupp to end the inning. San Diego got to Phillies reliever Hector Neris (2-3) immediately thereafter. Cory Spangenberg singled and advanced to third on a one-out base hit by Carlos Asuaje before Hedges brought him home with a fly ball to center. Brandon Mauer pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 18th save of the year.  Very resilient from our group of guys,  Green said.  I know we've had our fair share of getting blown out, but when it's close our guys have figured out a way to win the game.  Hedges, who had missed the two previous games with some neck tightness, had the Padres in good shape before the delay. A solo shot to left in the third inning put the Padres up 2-0 and his follow-up at-bat in the fifth inning ended the same way, with Hedges rounding the bases after the ball landed in the right-field seats to make it 3-1.  It was good to see him swing the bat well,  Green said.  He's been working hard in the cage. He's been kind of scuffling a bit lately. I'm sure the two days (off) helped him reboot the system, too.  Hedges wasn't the only Padres' hitter to go deep against Phillies starter Nick Pivetta. Jose Pirela got the scoring underway in the first inning with a homer to left, his fourth of the season. Philadelphia's first run also came on a solo shot, off the bat of Joseph in the fourth inning. That was the 15th of the season for the first baseman, who hit 21 in 107 games as a rookie last year.  Still some things I'm working on,  Joseph said,  but I've done a better job of putting the ball in the air, which helps with extra-base hits.  The home runs were the only problem for Pivetta, who went seven strong innings, giving up five hits while striking out nine Padres along the way.  I'll take three solo shots over walking anybody,  he said.  I'm finding my consistency and keep moving forward.

Both had been on the disabled list since May. The similarity ended there, however, because Morton was on and Sanchez was not. The Houston Astros gave Morton ample support, led by George Springer's two home runs and five RBIs, which matched his career best, in a 12-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Springer's four hits included a three-run homer and a solo blast. He became the first leadoff hitter to hit 27 home runs before the All-Star break in major league history.  He can wow you even when you're around him every day,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  What a great tone-setter. He's a difference maker. Getting him the most at-bats is pretty awesome. He's using the middle of the field and the opposite field. No park can hold him right now.  Springer said,  We've all hit the ball hard the last four or five games. You've got to have a plan. Develop a plan and approach, then adjust from there depending on what he's doing. He (Sanchez) has got good stuff over there, a lot of those guys do.  Morton, meanwhile, allowed one run in six innings Sanchez allowed eight runs (five earned) in 1 2/3 innings. Carlos Correa added a two-run homer and Evan Gattis had a solo shot for the Astros (59-28), who have split in the first two games of the four-game series. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at Blue JaysHouston Astros - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchTroy Tulowitzki and Ezequiel Carrera homered for Toronto (40-46). Morton (6-3), starting for the first time since May 24 because of a right lat strain, allowed four hits and two walks.  For the offense to come through like that early, it's great because it gives me a chance to just go out there and compete,  Morton said.  A little less stress, a little less worry. We were going in on righties, that was the most we've been doing that all year. It seems like it was working ... getting those ground balls.  Sanchez (0-2) allowed seven hits and four walks in his first start since May 19. He had been on the disabled list with a blister and split nail on his right middle finger.  If he could have thrown that curveball over a little bit more that would have helped, but that will come,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  But he looks strong and they're swinging. If you make a mistake, they're hitting it. I don't think the line was as bad as it looked because I thought he was close.  Gattis started the seventh with his seventh homer of the season. Springer homered with two outs in the seventh. James Hoyt replaced Morton and had a perfect bottom of the seventh and Tony Sipp had a perfect eighth. In the eighth, Toronto's Jeff Beliveau replaced Mike Bolsinger, who allowed six hits and four runs while striking out seven in 5 1/3 innings of relief. Beliveau allowed one hit in two innings. Francis Martes pitched the ninth for the Astros and gave up the sixth homer of the season by Carrera, who replaced Jose Bautista in right field in the seventh. Sanchez allowed two runs in the first inning when Correa hit his 18th home run of the season after Springer and Jose Altuve led off with singles and Josh Reddick grounded into a double play. The Astros added six runs in the second. Springer's 26th homer of the season followed walks to Gattis and Norichika Aoki to bump the lead to 5-0. An error by Tulowitzki at short on his flip to second base on Correa's potential double-play grounder loaded the bases for Houston. Marwin Gonzalez had an RBI groundout to second, Carlos Beltran chopped an RBI infield single to second and Gattis hit an RBI double. Bolsinger replaced Sanchez.  I felt great,  Sanchez said.  I think the best part about tonight is that I didn't think about my finger once. I went out there, I was aggressive, I felt like I was who I was before all this stuff happened. l think that's s a plus.  A double by Springer and an infield single by Altuve set up an RBI single by Reddick for a 9-0 Houston lead in the third. Alex Bregman led off the fifth with a double and scored from third on Springer's sacrifice fly.  I understand who's up behind me,  Springer said.  If I can get to first for guys like Altuve, Correa, Beltran, I understand that there's a good chance I'm going to score. If I can spark us, great. If not, I know who's up behind me.
