GS -0.20%       and netted one investor a $300 million windfall in less than a week, according to a government lawsuit and people familiar with the investigation.Investigators allege that the investor was an important player in the scandal involving Malaysian government-investment fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB. Goldman earned hundreds of millions in fees arranging $6.5 billion worth of bond deals for 1MDB.Investigators in the U.S. and other countries have said several billion dollars was misappropriated from 1MDB.The U.S. Justice Department, in an asset seizure lawsuit dated Wednesday, provided detailed allegations that in 2013 and 2014 funds allegedly stolen from 1MDB were funneled via a series of bank accounts and shell companies to partly finance the purchase of Coastal Energy, a Houston firm controlled at the time by legendary Texas oilman Oscar Wyatt Jr. The lawsuit seeks to seize proceeds from the Coastal deal, but not Coastal assets.The Coastal deal involved many people believed by investigators to be involved in the alleged schemes to defraud 1MDB: The buyer was a joint venture between a company owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund International Petroleum Investment Co., or IPIC, and a shell company controlled by Jho Low, a Malaysian financier, according to the Justice Department asset seizure lawsuit. Goldman advised the IPIC unit that paid nearly all of the purchase price.Last summer, the Justice Department filed a $1 billion asset seizure lawsuit against properties controlled by senior executives of IPIC and against Mr. Low. In a complaint dated Wednesday, the Justice Department expanded the lawsuit to include property in London allegedly purchased with money it claims was taken from 1MDB and fraudulently washed by Mr. Low and his family through the purchase of Coastal Energy.Mr. Low, who was being informally advised by Goldman at the time, first approached Coastal in 2012 about a possible acquisition, people familiar with the matter said. Skeptical that Mr. Low could come up with the cash necessary, Coastal executives told him to find a bigger partner, a person familiar with the matter said. He returned with IPIC\u2019s Spanish energy unit, Compa\u00f1\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola de Petr\u00f3leos SAU, or Cepsa, the people said.Mr. Low invested $50 million in the deal, with Cepsa funding the remainder of the $2.2 billion purchase, according to the Justice Department lawsuit and statements announcing the acquisition.One week later, Cepsa transferred $350 million to Mr. Low\u2019s shell company, according to the lawsuit. \u201cThe commercial basis for this nearly immediate 600% return on investment is not immediately apparent,\u201d the Justice Department lawsuit said.\u00a0 IPIC and Cepsa didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Before an agreement with the U.S. energy company could be reached, Goldman\u2019s compliance department told its bankers to stop working with Mr. Low or his entity on the deal, citing concern over Mr. Low\u2019s wealth, people familiar with the matter said. Goldman recently had turned down a request by Mr. Low to open a private bank account for the same reason, according to the people.Mr. Low remained a participant, though, through a shell company called Strategic Resources (Global) Ltd, according to deal documents. Goldman advised Cepsa, which was paying nearly all of the deal\u2019s purchase price, according to the complaint, merger documents and statements announcing the deal. PricewaterhouseCoopers was a financial adviser to both Cepsa and SRG. PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment.Goldman said in a statement that neither Mr. Low nor any firm controlled by him was a Goldman client in the Coastal deal. \u201cPrior to reading the government filing, Goldman was not aware of, and had no involvement in, any transaction in which SRG sold its stake in a joint venture back to Cepsa,\u201d the firm said.Goldman had roughly $600 million in revenue from 1MDB in 2012 and 2013 for selling $6.5 billion in bonds. Much of the money raised by Goldman was taken out of 1MDB by Mr. Low and IPIC executives and used to purchase mansions, pay gambling debt and fund a Hollywood movie company, the Justice Department lawsuits claim. Goldman has also said it has no knowledge of any fraud at 1MDB.A January 2014 press release issued by Coastal Energy, Cepsa and SRG announcing the deal\u2019s completion referred to Strategic Resources as a firm controlled by Mr. Low\u2019s father, Larry Low. When executives and advisers met for dinner to mark the deal\u2019s close, Szen Low, Mr. Low\u2019s brother, joined the celebration, one person said.Jho Low, whose whereabouts are unclear, has denied wrongdoing. 1MDB has consistently denied wrongdoing and said it would cooperate with the investigations. The Justice Department lawsuit cited Mr. Low as saying Cepsa bought out his stake because it \u201cwanted full control and ownership of the business.\u201dThe Justice Department is interested in the Coastal deal because it says the $50 million Mr. Low invested originally came from 1MDB. The Justice Department on Tuesday moved to seize London property that it says was bought with some of the $350 million proceeds of the Coastal deal. The Justice Department has questioned people involved in the deal in recent months, according to people familiar with the investigation.Coastal was represented in the deal by             Citigroup Inc.,       which advised its clients to tread carefully, one person said. The $2.2 billion purchase price for Coastal Energy was at a 28% premium to the company\u2019s stock price, earning Mr. Wyatt more than $500 million for his quarter stake in the company.\u00a0 An attorney for Mr. Wyatt didn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.

This month he announced a preliminary deal with Mexico on sugar imports that generated some gripes from U.S. sugar producers as well as consumers of sweeteners but didn\u2019t lead to an industry revolt or major backlash in Congress.Failure to reach a deal would have opened the way for U.S. tariffs on Mexican sugar, with the possibility of Mexican retaliation on U.S. corn syrup.Mr. Ross, speaking at the WSJ CFO Network in Washington late\u00a0Monday, cited the sugar deal as an example of one that was reached without creating acrimony. Such disputes are resolvable if the parties involved \u201care willing to make reasonable compromises.\u201dHe said\u00a0he\u2019s bringing that approach to wide-ranging trade and investment talks with China. The Trump administration already announced a mini-deal with Beijing meant to help put the finishing touches on several long-running disputes\u2014including beef exports to China\u2014and get the ball rolling toward more substantial market openings.But Messrs. Trump and Ross along with other top officials have\u00a0more negotiating\u00a0ahead to make progress on their preferred yardstick\u2014reducing the U.S. trade deficits.Most economists say the trade deficit has more to do with broad economic factors. Still, Mr. Ross sees structural factors at work that can be addressed through high-stakes talks with trading partners.\u201cIt\u2019s not inherent in free trade, in my view, that one country, namely us, has to absorb the entire cumulative trade surplus of the entire world,\u201d Mr. Ross said.China, for instance, could reduce its $347 billion merchandise trade deficit with the U.S. if it purchased less cattle, soybeans and industrial goods from third countries and substituted more from American producers, he said. U.S. officials\u00a0on Monday\u00a0said they achieved technical progress in the beef dispute with China. U.S. exports could resume in 10 days, Mr. Ross said.Although he touted the Trump administration\u2019s ability to solve trade disputes, Mr. Ross also defended the use of unilateral tariffs to block imports when trading partners are found to have \u201cdumped\u201d goods at below market value, or even when a flood of imports is seen as hurting U.S. national security or economic health.This month Mr. Ross is expected to submit recommendations on whether steel imports are a national-security risk, opening the way to broad tariffs under the \u201cSection 232\u201d provision of trade law,\u00a0which enables his department to investigate the national-security implications of imports and gives the president the option of restricting them when the investigation is complete.\u201cThat to me is a legitimate national security issue,\u201d he said.Write to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 21:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ross-confident-administration-can-negotiate-better-trade-terms-1497318196", "news_title": "Ross Confident Administration Can Negotiate Better Trade Terms", "keywords": "beef,commerce,investment,merchandise,nafta,national security,steel,sugar,trade,North American Free Trade Agreement,Wilbur Ross,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,dairy cattle markets,livestock,meat markets"}, {"content": "Long Island Rail Road will cancel or reroute more than 30 trains each weekday during the morning and evening rush hours this summer when Amtrak closes several tracks at New York Penn Station to carry out emergency repair work.Veronique Hakim,        interim executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the LIRR, said\u00a0Monday\u00a0that the disruption would affect 9,600 passengers daily and create \u201ca difficult and challenging summer.\u201d In the morning, 15% of trains will be canceled or diverted to a different station. In the evening, 19% will be canceled or originate elsewhere.Amtrak will close several tracks at Penn Station from\u00a0July 10 through Sept. 1\u00a0while engineers repair rails and switches following two low-speed derailments at the terminal earlier this year. Without the track closures it would take several years to complete the work during evenings and weekends, Amtrak says.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced in May that during the disruption all NJ Transit Morris and Essex Lines Midtown Direct trains would be diverted to Hoboken, where commuters would take a ferry or the PATH rail system to Manhattan.Mr. Christie said those commuters would be offered deeply discounted tickets for July and August. The Morris and Essex Lines Midtown Direct trains carry 7,400 people into New York each morning rush hour.The MTA isn\u2019t offering discounts to LIRR passengers, but they will be able to transfer free onto the subway. \u201cWe have chosen to focus on providing service,\u201d Ms. Hakim said.Of the 98 LIRR trains that terminate at Penn Station during peak morning times:2 canceled5 diverted to Atlantic Terminal5 terminate at Jamaica3 diverted to Hunterspoint Avenue3 new services added16 trains to have additional carsOf the 86 LIRR trains that originate at Penn Station during peak afternoon times:7 canceled4 to originate from Jamaica3 to originate from Atlantic Terminal3 to originate from HunterspointAvenue2 new trains added13 trains to have additional carsThe LIRR will add 36 cars to existing trains into Penn Station during the morning and evening rush hours, as well as by running several new trains on the edge of peak times. Ms. Hakim said that was sufficient to make up for the lost 9,600 seats.Only a handful of trains would be canceled, she said. Rerouted trains will terminate at Hunterspoint Avenue, in Queens, and at Atlantic Terminal, in Brooklyn, where passengers would transfer to the subway.Ms. Hakim said the MTA is adding additional capacity by providing ferry services to 34th Street in Manhattan from Long Island City and Glen Cove on Long Island by running 200 buses from eight park-and-rides.New York state Sen.       Elaine Phillips,        in a statement\u00a0Monday, said LIRR passengers deserve a fare cut. \u201cIf commuters are getting reduced service, they should get reduced fares too,\u201d she said.New York Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       has criticized Amtrak\u2019s stewardship of Penn Station and in a statement\u00a0on Monday called the disruption \u201cAmtrak\u2019s summer of hell,\u201d repeating an earlier description.In an effort to ease road congestion during the disruption, Mr. Cuomo said the MTA would expedite construction at bridges and tunnels so major crossings would offer cashless tolls and all available lanes would be open.On Monday evening, many commuters were unaware that a revised summer timetable had been released. No notices were visible at Penn Station. People consulted smart phone apps that relayed no updated information. The MTA\u2019s mobile website had no information either. \u201cI am still looking for more information,\u201d said Audrey Malone, who usually takes the train to Ronkonkoma or to Huntington.Crista Bovenzi, who rides the Port Washington line, said she knew that the summer would be difficult, but she accepted that the repair work had to be done otheriwise the tracks would deteriorate further. \u201cI say that now,\u201d she said, \u201cbut after a couple of months I am sure I will lose my patience.\u201dMs. Hakim said the MTA would hold Amtrak\u2019s \u201cfeet to the fire\u201d to ensure it completed the repair work on time.\u201cWe know that the work we\u2019re undertaking this summer will cause inconvenience and we appreciate the efforts our commuter partners are making to support this work and minimize the disruptions to their passengers,\u201d Amtrak said Monday in a statement. Amtrak passengers will suffer too.During the disruption, Amtrak will cut six trains on its Northeast Regional service between Washington and New York.The national passenger railroad has made no changes to its Acela Express service.

Other co-chief investment officers have left the firm in recent years.The New York firm has promoted       Ben Jacobs       and       Ning Jin       to co-chief investment officers.Viking\u2019s planned downsizing is one of the largest one-time returns of money in the hedge-fund industry. Other hedge-funds, including       David Tepper\u2019s       Appaloosa Management LP and Seth Klarman\u2019s Baupost Group LLC, have given back smaller sums to investors periodically.Viking told clients it plans to return money to investors because \u201csmaller, more liquid positions will give us greater operating flexibility as we respond to attractive opportunities.\u201d It said its \u201cstrong investment staff combined with a reduction in assets under management is a potent mix.\u201dThe moves come after Viking\u2019s hedge fund lost 4% last year, according to a prior letter to investors. It was the fund\u2019s worst-ever loss, according to people familiar with the matter, in a year that challenged stock picking funds broadly.Despite that loss, Viking\u2019s long-term record remains one of the strongest among stock hedge funds. Its annualized 5-year return for the period ending December 2016 is 10.2%, according to a person familiar with the matter. It was up 7.1% through May, according to a person familiar with the matter, compared with a 8.7% total rise for the S&P 500.Bloomberg News earlier reported the changes at Viking.Some investors have said size can be the enemy of returns. Because firms collect management fees based on how much they have in assets under management, their focus can shift from posting outsize returns to gathering more money, they have said.On the other hand, managers who voluntarily return client money are giving up a steady revenue stream.Viking\u2019s plan to return money wasn\u2019t related to a lack of investment opportunities, according to a person close to the firm. Viking wouldn\u2019t be making the move if Mr. Sundheim, who managed much of its capital, were staying, the person said.Viking\u2019s decision follows similar moves by some of the industry\u2019s biggest names in recent years.       Daniel Loeb\u2019s       Third Point returned $1.4 billion, about 10% of its money then, at the end of 2013, saying in a 2013 letter to investors it wanted to \u201cmoderate\u201d its funds\u2019 growth.Appaloosa has returned billions of client money over the years to avoid getting too large, said a person familiar with the matter.Seth Klarman\u2019s Baupost returned about $4 billion to investors at the end of 2013, saying in a letter that year it wanted to \u201cbetter match\u201d its size to \u201cthe opportunity set we see for new investments.\u201d The Boston firm was holding roughly $10 billion, or a third of its portfolio then, in cash as of mid-February, to be able to move quickly should markets reverse, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.At Viking, the \u201cone-time liquidity option\u201d the firm is giving its clients means investors can submit a redemption notice by July 13 to withdraw money without penalty.If Viking doesn\u2019t get to the $8 billion figure through the redemption requests, it would give cash back to clients who haven\u2019t asked for money back, said a person familiar with the matter.Viking plans to give the $8 billion back in early August and has already sold off positions, according to the letter.The new co-chief investment officers, Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Jin, joined Viking in 2009 and 2007 and were mentored by Mr. Sundheim, the letter said. Mr. Jin started as an industrials analyst and opened and ran Viking\u2019s Hong Kong office. Mr. Jacobs started as a consumer and materials analyst and built Viking\u2019s energy and materials practice, the letter said. They collectively managed more than a third of Viking\u2019s assets.Viking said Mr. Sundheim, 40, is leaving to pursue \u201centrepreneurial interests.\u201d\u201cHe is in a league of his own as a stock picker and portfolio manager and has earned the respect of every Viking and many others,\u201d according to the letter.Write to Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Viking Set To Return $8 Billion.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 20:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/viking-global-investors-to-return-8-billion-to-clients-1497282914", "news_title": "Viking Global Investors to Return $8 Billion to Clients ", "keywords": "cios,hedge funds,Viking Global Investors,Appaloosa Management,Baupost Group,Daniel Sundheim,Ben Jacobs,Ning Jin,Seth Klarman,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,financial investments,investment advice,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "French and Italian bonds rose in value and the British pound continued its fall on Monday, with investors taking very different views of the politics currently affecting three of Europe\u2019s largest economies.Weekend ballots in France and Italy showed signs that the popularity of the antiestablishment parties that had spooked investors earlier this year continues to wane. But the pound has been falling since the U.K.\u2019s ruling Conservative Party failed to secure a parliamentary majority in last Thursday\u2019s election, spurring investors\u2019 concern that this will make Brexit negotiations even harder for Britain.The yield on French 10-year government bonds dropped around 0.05 percentage point to 0.595%, according to Tradeweb, its lowest close since November. That came after French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique en Marche party won the first round of parliamentary elections Sunday, putting the upstart centrist party on course to secure a sweeping majority. Yields fall as prices rise.The yield on Italy\u2019s 10-year government bond fell about 0.09 percentage point to 2.00%, its lowest close since January, after no candidates from the antiestablishment 5 Star Movement made it through to the runoff vote for any of the main cities contested in Italian municipal elections.But sterling was down 0.8% against the dollar in late afternoon trading in Europe, on the heels of the currency\u2019s 1.7% decline against the U.S. currency Friday. In late New York trading on Monday, the pound was 0.6% lower on the day at $1.2660, compared with $1.2741 late Friday.The yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds fell 0.03 percentage point to 0.977%, however, as investors sought havens amid the continuing political uncertainty.\u201cIn the near term, the risk of populism across Europe is in retreat,\u201d said Nicola Mai, global sovereign credit analyst at Pacific Investment Management Co. \u201cBoth on the macro side, where the data are really strong in Europe, and on the politics side, things have been quite encouraging for markets.\u201dThere are early signs also that the U.K. and eurozone\u2019s economies are taking divergent paths, which will influence where investors put their money. Analysts have become increasingly bullish on the eurozone\u2019s economy just as Britain\u2019s\u2014typically Europe\u2019s second or third largest\u2014has slowed after years of outperforming its neighbors.The eurozone economy grew at its quarterly fastest rate in the first three months of 2017 since the first quarter of 2015. Britain\u2019s economic growth was revised lower to 0.2% in the first quarter of the year, according to figures released last month.Investors dumped French bonds earlier this year on concerns that far-right candidate       Marine Le Pen       could clinch the French presidency. Ms. Le Pen favored pulling France out of the euro, a move many feared would presage a messy breakup of the currency bloc.But Mr. Macron won a convincing victory in May and Sunday\u2019s vote in France has put his party and its centrist ally, MoDem, on course to win a majority of as much as 455 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly in the second-round vote on Sunday, according to polling firm Ipsos Sopra-Steria. That would strengthen Mr. Macron\u2019s hand in efforts to loosen France\u2019s rigid labor laws.\u201cPolitical risk in France has disappeared, and it\u2019s good for structural reforms over the long term,\u201d said Thomas Page-Lecuyer, a strategist at CPR Asset Management.In Italy, the euroskeptic 5 Star Movement failed to reach the second round of voting for any of the major cities in local elections\u2014a contrast with its victories in Turin and Rome last year.Italian government bonds had already been boosted last week after the risk of a snap general election receded when Italy\u2019s largest political parties failed to agree on a new electoral law. The European Central Bank on Thursday reaffirmed its commitment to keep in place its huge bond-buying program, which has supported Italian debt in recent years, lending further support to the market.The 5 Star Movement\u2019s \u201cimpetus seems to have lost some momentum,\u201d Fabio Fois, an economist at             Barclays,       wrote in a note to clients.Still, Mr. Fois said he expected the 5 Star Movement to keep polling neck-and-neck with the ruling center-left Democratic Party at the national level. Meanwhile, the risk of no party securing enough seats in parliament to win an outright majority remains high ahead of the country\u2019s next general elections, he said.Pimco\u2019s Mr. Mai said the risk of populism in Europe hasn\u2019t gone away. \u201cWhile populism might be on the decline while the macro [economy] improves in Europe, at the next crisis there is going to be significant risk again of populism rising,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, in the U.K., investors are scrambling to assess what Thursday\u2019s election means for Britain\u2019s negotiations with Brussels. Some investors say reduced Conservative Party influence could lead to a softer Brexit, which could be good for the economy, but others argue that the increased uncertainty will make the divorce even more tortuous and unpredictable.In the meantime, though, the direction has been lower for the pound, which is the main barometer of investor sentiment toward the U.K.\u201cThe bit of opacity is around what happens in the negotiations\u201d with the European Union, said Stephen Macklow-Smith, a portfolio manager at J.P.

SHCAY 0.58%       has sued China\u2019s             Hisense Electric Co.        600060 2.49%      , which licensed the Sharp brand for televisions sold in the U.S., accusing Hisense of putting the Sharp name on poor-quality TVs and deceptively advertising them.The court action is the latest effort by Osaka-based Sharp to retrieve the right to use its own name when selling TVs in one of the world\u2019s largest markets. Sharp is trying to recover its position as a global maker of consumer electronics.Hisense rejected the allegations and said it was selling high-quality televisions under the Sharp name.The dispute illustrates the risks when the owner of a well-known brand name gives up control over products sold under that name.In 2015, Sharp signed a deal with Hisense giving the Chinese company the right to use the Sharp name on TVs sold in the U.S. through 2020. At the time, Sharp was in financial distress and selling assets to raise cash. In 2016, Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn Technology Group, formally known as             Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.      , took a controlling stake in Sharp for \u00a5388.8 billion ($3.52 billion), and Foxconn has sought to put the Japanese company back on a growth track.In a complaint filed to a California state court in San Francisco, Sharp lawyers said the Japanese company\u2019s brand and trademark \u201care at risk of being destroyed\u201d by the time the five-year term of the Hisense agreement expires.It said that under Hisense\u2019s management, the televisions are \u201cshoddily manufactured\u201d and \u201cin many cases, perceived by consumers as cheap.\u201d It said it wanted Hisense to stop using the Sharp name.Sharp said its testing found the Sharp-brand televisions made by Hisense violated U.S. Federal Communications Commission standards. It said Hisense gave consumers deceptive information about the size and brightness of the TVs, violating other federal standards.Hisense said it did nothing wrong.\u201cHisense categorically denies Sharp\u2019s claims in the litigation and looks forward to presenting its case in the appropriate forum,\u201d a company representative told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cHisense is in full compliance with the trademark license agreement and Sharp\u2019s attempt to terminate the agreement is of no effect. Hisense will continue to manufacture and sell quality televisions under the Sharp licensed brands.\u201dWaseda Business School professor       Atsushi Osanai,        who used to work at             Sony Corp.\u2019s       TV unit, said the case was important to Sharp\u2019s efforts to restore itself as a global brand.\u201cIf it wants to revive as a global consumer-electronics maker, Sharp should make every possible effort to retrieve the U.S. TV license because the product, which still occupies the center of the living room, remains an important marketing tool,\u201d Mr. Osanai said.Write to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Sharp Sues to Use Name in U.S..'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 19:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sharp-to-americans-you-dont-want-to-buy-a-sharp-brand-tv-1497241004", "news_title": "Sharp to Americans: You Don\u2019t Want to Buy a Sharp-Brand TV", "keywords": " foxconn, hisense, hisense electric,sharp,sharp license,sharp television, sharp tvs,Sharp,6753.TO,JP:6753,Sony,6758.TO,SNE,Hon Hai Precision Industry,2317.TW,Hisense Electric Co.

Yields on short-term Treasurys are highly sensitive to the Fed\u2019s rate policy outlook.The yield on the two-year Treasury note settled at 1.359%, compared with 1.338% Friday. Yields rise as bond prices fall. It was the yield\u2019s highest close since March 14, when it settled at 1.380%, the highest close since June 8, 2009.Hectic new debt sales also weighed down bond prices. The Treasury Department sold more than $100 billion new debt Monday in four offerings, with maturities spanning from three months to 10 years. A $12 billion sale of 30-year bonds along with a four-week bill auction are due Tuesday.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.215% Monday, compared with 2.201% Friday.The Fed\u2019s expected increase in rates comes after it did so last December and in March. For bond investors, the key question is what the Fed would do beyond June, along with any update on its plan to start unwinding a balance sheet that includes more than $2 trillion of Treasury bonds.The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen from this year\u2019s peak\u2014slightly above 2.6% in March. Signs of slowing inflation in recent months have bolstered some investors\u2019 expectations that the June increase may be the last one this year. The yield settled at 2.147% on June 6, the lowest level since November.The view of a slowly moving Fed boosted demand for the $24 billion sale of three-year notes on Monday to the highest since December 2015. The highlight was 65.6% indirect bidding, a proxy for foreign demand, which was the highest since a record of 68.6% in November 2009.\u201cThe market continues to price in a lower trajectory of rate hikes than the path predicted by the Fed in prior meetings,\u201d said Michael Lorizio, senior trader at Manulife Asset Management.Robust demand for haven bonds also reflects some concerns about the U.S. stock market. Technology shares sold off Friday and softened Monday. The tech-oriented Nasdaq Composite has outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 stock indexes this year, fueling some concerns on whether valuation is getting stretched. For some investors, buying Treasurys offers some protection if stocks see a larger downturn.The strong three-year sale pushed down the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.187%, but the yield rose after the 10-year Treasury auction. Overall demand was solid, and the indirect bidding of 66.1% was the highest since January. Yet the auction was sold at a yield of 2.195%, slightly higher than where it traded right before the auction. That means demand was softer than bond dealers anticipated, which prompted some to sell bonds to book profits.The risk for bond investors is that the Fed doesn\u2019t make big adjustments to their rate policy projections despite slowing inflation, which may disappoint investors looking for a more dovish tone, said Jeffery Elswick, director of fixed income and portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors LLC.Mr. Elswick said he expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to 2.5%-2.6% at the end of this year, driven by the Fed\u2019s reduction of its balance sheet.Matt Freund, co-chief investment officer and head of fixed-income strategies at asset manager Calamos Investments, said a slowly moving Fed reduces the risk of a big rise in Treasury-bond yields.Write to Min Zeng at min.zeng@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 19:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-bond-prices-fall-on-new-supply-fed-decision-1497280072", "news_title": "Treasurys Slip Before Fed Decision", "keywords": "fed,interest rates,treasurys,u.s. bonds,Federal Reserve,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,unit trusts,mutual funds,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "NBC anchor       Megyn Kelly\u2019s       plan to air an interview with right-wing provocateur       Alex Jones       has caused a firestorm to erupt on social media, but so far advertisers have remained quiet\u2014with at least one notable exception.J.P.

The school shooting four and a half years ago left 20 children and six staffers dead.On his radio program Monday, Mr. Jones said that he thinks Sandy Hook happened, or at least that children died, though there are anomalies about the event. However, he said that was edited from the NBC promotion. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being misrepresented,\u201d Mr. Jones said.

The company said it has received consent from two of its largest debtholders but needs support from additional lenders for the transactions to proceed.The company, which is carrying more than $2 billion in debt, has been negotiating with lenders to refinance its debt while paying its interest payments in kind\u2014essentially swapping debt for new debt. In December, it moved its intellectual property out of the reach of lenders, prompting litigation against the company.If accepted, the new proposal would give J.Crew Group\u2019s incoming CEO, James Brett, two additional years to turn around the business. A week ago, the company said longtime Chief Executive Mickey Drexler would step down from the post in favor of the outsider. Mr. Drexler will remain chairman of the board.The company hopes that debtholders will accept new notes and equity in exchange for pushing back the due date on its most pressing debt to September 2021. Holders of at least 95% of that debt must accept the proposal for it to proceed. As a separate proposal, the company is offering additional incentives to dismiss pending litigation relating to its transfer of intellectual property.\u201cThe transaction lowers J. Crew\u2019s leverage, but at the same time, cash flow will decline because the company would to have to pay IP licensing fees in cash, instead of accruing interest on the old notes,\u201d said Raya Sokolyanska, an analyst at Moody\u2019s.Meanwhile, the privately held company reported that comparable sales fell 9% in its latest quarter, while retreating 12% for its eponymous brand. \u201cWhile we are disappointed with our first-quarter earnings, we are optimistic regarding the work we have underway to improve our business,\u201d Mr. Drexler said in a news release.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last month, Mr. Drexler, who redefined             Gap Inc.       in the 1990s and then revitalized J.Crew, admitted that he was surprised by how quickly technology had upended fashion retailing and he promised to revamp J.Crew. He said the brand would begin emphasizing lower prices, invest in digital marketing and adopt a more accessible image.In April, the company cut 250 jobs, primarily from headquarters, and said it would part ways with       Jenna Lyons,        the group\u2019s longtime creative chief. Mr. Drexler is one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders, along with private-equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners.J.Crew Group has about 600 stores, including about 460 J.Crew locations, a smaller footprint than many other chains. Still, it has struggled as shoppers compare prices online and buy less-expensive trendy clothes.J.Crew\u2019s total revenue fell 6% to $532 million for the latest quarter.

Her addition widens the number of voting board members to eight, and unlike the other directors, she isn\u2019t an insider nor an investor in Uber.Mr. Kalanick, however, remains protected in his position because of his shared-based voting power\u2014which, along with co-founder and Chairman       Garrett Camp       and early employee       Ryan Graves      \u2014gives him a large majority.The other board members all have stakes in the company: private-equity billionaire       David Bonderman       of TPG; Ms. Huffington; venture capitalist       Bill Gurley       of Benchmark; and       Yasir Al Rumayyan,        an official from a Saudi Arabian government investment fund.Mr. Kalanick also had proposed to the board that he step aside for a period amid a string of scandals at Uber.The CEO recently faced a personal tragedy when his mother died in a boating accident that left his father seriously injured. He has been spending time with this father in the Los Angeles area.Directors left it to Mr. Kalanick to decide if he will take the leave, according to a person familiar with the matter.A leave of absence, coupled with Mr. Michael\u2019s exit, would create a serious leadership void. Uber\u2019s head of finance is set to leave in July, and the company is seeking a new CFO, COO and general counsel.In recent weeks, Uber has lost it senior executives for product, engineering, marketing, communications, operations and self-driving vehicle development.At the same time, a pause by Mr. Kalanick could help Uber refresh its workplace and adopt new human-resources processes and training programs recommended by Covington. Mr. Kalanick is known for his tight grip on the company and obsessive will to win, even in the face of regulatory obstacles.Mr. Michael has been a controversial figure at Uber since he joined in 2013 from Klout Inc., which helps evaluate people\u2019s social-media influence. He described to BuzzFeed a plan in 2014 to spend millions to investigate journalists critical of Uber, though he ultimately condemned the comments, as did Mr. Kalanick.Mr. Michael also was aware the company\u2019s head of Asian operations, Eric Alexander, had obtained the medical records of a rape victim in an Uber car in India while pursuing a theory that local competitor Ola had pushed the story to damage Uber\u2019s reputation, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Alexander was fired last week after reporter inquiries. Mr. Alexander didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment and Uber confirmed he was no longer at the company.Mr. Michael was also instrumental in landing big corporate names for several Uber funding rounds and was considered a skilled businessman by many at the company.Amid the workplace disarray, Uber, valued by investors at $68 billion, also is contesting a lawsuit by Google parent         Alphabet Inc.       over the alleged theft of self-driving-car trade secrets, facing a federal probe into its business practices, and contending with two accounting mishaps that shortchanged drivers in New York City and Philadelphia by tens of millions of dollars.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Uber\u2019s Leadership Shake-Up Escalates.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 19:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-to-names-nestle-executive-wan-ling-martello-to-board-1497256327", "news_title": "Uber\u2019s Leadership Crisis Intensifies", "keywords": "uber executive,uber female hire,Covington & Burling,BuzzFeed,Apple,AAPL,Uber Technologies,Alibaba Group,BABA,Wal-Mart Stores,WMT,Alphabet Cl C,GOOG,Alibaba Group Holding,Nestle S.A.,CH:NESN,TPG,Benchmark,Travis Kalanick,Ryan Graves,Arianna Huffington,Yasir Al Rumayyan,Bill Gurley,David Bonderman,Emil Michael,Frances Frei,Garrett Camp,Bozoma Saint John,Wan Ling Martello,Eric Holder,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,food,beverages,tobacco,retail,wholesale,etailing,legal services,internet search engines,business,consumer services,consumer goods,e-commerce,food products,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "General Electric Co.        GE 0.19%       Chief Executive       Jeff Immelt       will step aside this summer, ending a 16-year run atop a conglomerate that he significantly reshaped but whose shares have vastly underperformed the stock market during his tenure.GE said Monday that Mr. Immelt would be succeeded on Aug. 1 by the head of the company\u2019s health-care business,       John Flannery,        and retire as chairman of the board on Dec. 31. Mr. Flannery, 55 years old, is a 30-year veteran of GE who spent much of his career in the company\u2019s once-sprawling financial business.\u201cI felt like 15 or 16 years was plenty of time to be CEO,\u201d Mr. Immelt, who turned 61 earlier this year, said in an interview Monday. \u201cDoing it until I\u2019m 65 didn\u2019t make sense for the company and didn\u2019t make sense for me.\u201dThe change comes as GE has been under pressure by activist investor Trian Fund Management LP to slash costs and boost profits in the company\u2019s core industrial business. Mr. Immelt recently laid out a two-year cost saving target and revamped GE\u2019s bonus program under pressure from Trian.When Mr. Immelt took over in 2001, GE got about half its annual profit from its finance arm, GE Capital, and was one of the country\u2019s biggest lenders. Now, the company relies on selling and servicing jet engines, power turbines, hospital machines and oil-and-gas equipment for nearly all of its profit.Mr. Flannery, in a meeting for employees Monday that was broadcast on Facebook, said he would be taking a look at the conglomerate\u2019s entire portfolio of businesses.\u201cI want to start with a fresh look around the company overall,\u201d he said, expecting to come back in the Fall with a set of recommendations. \u201cI want to go through a deep review with a sense of urgency.\u201dSome Wall Street analysts have openly wondered about when Mr. Immelt might retire, but the CEO gave no public sign he was ready to step aside and swatted away succession questions. Mr. Immelt and an independent GE director said Monday that he had decided in 2013 to step aside at some point this year as part of a long-term succession process.The timing was \u201ccompletely unaffected by what was going on with Trian and their criticism,\u2019\u2019 said       Shelly Lazarus,        a longtime GE director and a former CEO of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. \u201cThere was no reason to divert from the path.\u201dTrian executives weren\u2019t involved in the process and weren\u2019t briefed on the change, people familiar with the matter said. Trian had voiced support for Mr. Immelt when it initially disclosed its investment in 2015, but had recently become frustrated with the company\u2019s performance, people familiar with the matter said. Trian declined to comment Monday on Mr. Flannery\u2019s selection.Mr. Immelt sold off GE\u2019s media unit and divested the bulk of the company\u2019s massive lending division after the financial crisis. The conglomerate has refocused on its industrial businesses, shedding low-margin units like home appliances and striking a big oil-and-gas deal with Baker Hughes Inc. last fall.But the company\u2019s shares have lagged behind peers and the broader stock market during Mr. Immelt\u2019s tenure, leaving it the worst performing current member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock has fallen about 27% since Mr. Immelt took over days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Including dividends, GE gained 21% with Mr. Immelt at the helm, compared with a 207% rise in the S&P 500.GE shares rose 3.6% to $28.94 Monday.Mr. Flannery is the former head of GE\u2019s India business and former leader of its deals team.On Mr. Flannery\u2019s watch, GE spun off its consumer credit business,             Synchrony Financial                  ; sold its appliance business; and purchased the energy business of Alstom SA.He stepped in to lead the health-care business in 2014 when the unit was struggling and some analysts called for GE to spin it off or sell it. Instead, Mr. Flannery and GE have doubled down. The unit, which makes imaging and diagnostic equipment, has been expanding into life sciences. GE Healthcare\u2019s revenue rose to $18.29 billion in 2016, back to levels it sustained at the beginning of the decade, while increasing operating profits.Although Mr. Flannery spent much of his career in GE Capital and business development, he said he also had experience working abroad in emerging markets like India and running large business units. \u201cI\u2019m not coming to the table cold, if you will, about the company,\u201d he said on a conference call with analysts.GE\u2019s succession planning process, which included external candidates, was narrowed to four internal candidates in about 2015: Mr. Flannery, finance chief       Jeff Bornstein,       Steve Bolze,        who leads the power business, and the head of the oil and gas business,       Lorenzo Simonelli.Mr. Bornstein, who has been finance chief since 2013, will remain in that role and become a vice chairman. Mr. Flannery will take over as chairman of the board on Jan. 1. Mr. Simonelli will run a publicly traded oil and gas business that is being merged with         Baker Hughes Inc.,       GE has previously said. It is unclear what role Mr. Bolze will play. Messrs. Bolze and Simonelli weren\u2019t available for comment.Jack Brennan,        the GE board\u2019s lead independent director, recently helped directors reach a consensus about Mr. Flannery. Over the past few weeks, Mr. Brennan called each board member and requested their preferred pick to succeed Mr. Immelt, according to Ms. Lazarus.\u2018I want to start with a fresh look around the company overall.\u2019\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to give an answer,\u2019\u2019 she said.Ms. Lazarus said she endorsed Mr. Flannery because she liked his extensive international experience, humility and willingness to consider significant changes, including selling off big business units.The other internal contenders \u201cdidn\u2019t know they didn\u2019t get it\u201d until after Friday\u2019s board meeting ended, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Immelt said the company didn\u2019t plan to make any changes to its executive compensation plans to retain other top executives and was sticking to its recent financial forecasts.Mr. Bornstein said he and Mr. Flannery have worked closely for more than 20 years and have a similar view in terms of return and capital allocation.\u201cHe grew up as a corporate finance guy and has a deep understanding of value and value creation,\u201d Mr. Bornstein said on Monday\u2019s analyst call.GE also said that       Kieran Murphy,        one of Mr. Flannery\u2019s lieutenants, would take over as CEO of the Healthcare unit. Mr. Murphy joined the company in 2008.Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com, Joann S.

The proposals would affect activities ranging from mortgage lending to Wall Street trading.If Mr. Trump\u2019s regulatory appointees eventually implement them, the recommendations would pare back restrictions advanced by former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       administration, which argued they were necessary to guard against excessive risk-taking and a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Trump\u2019s team said those rules, many of which were part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, have become overly restrictive, unnecessarily preventing banks from activities that help the economy function and grow.\u201cWe tried to have the right balance between eliminating undue, burdensome regulations while not putting taxpayers at risk,\u201d Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said.The report drew praise from the financial industry and Republicans and sparked criticism from consumer groups and many Democrats.The report is an \u201cimportant step towards modernizing America\u2019s financial regulatory system so both economic growth and consumer protection are advanced,\u201d Tim Pawlenty, chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable trade group, said in a statement.Marcus Stanley, policy director for the advocacy group Americans for Financial Reform, which represents unions and consumer groups, said \u201cevery recommendation\u201d in the report \u201cweakens systemic or consumer protections.\u201d\u201cThis would take things that have already been weakened by industry lobbying and dilute them away to nothing,\u201d he said.The report responds to a Feb. 3 executive order from Mr. Trump, and a senior official said the GOP president signed a copy of it on Monday in the Oval Office.It focuses on lending, and is expected to be followed by further reports covering other topics, such as the money-management and insurance industries. To prepare it, the administration met with dozens of industry representatives in recent weeks, as well as consumer advocates, financial regulators and other groups.Administration officials said their focus was on helping small and midsize lenders, as opposed to larger ones that might be considered \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d without a taxpayer bailout. But the report\u2019s recommendations include issues affecting firms of all sizes.Regulators would re-examine a litany of capital and liquidity rules affecting banks. Those rules limit lenders\u2019 risk-taking. Officials would re-examine lending standards for so-called leverage loans to already-indebted companies, a big business for large banks.Small banks would have more flexibility in making mortgage loans. Officials would open certain regulatory exams, such as \u201cstress tests\u201d and \u201cliving wills,\u201d to a formal notice-and-comment process\u2014a change that officials in Mr. Obama\u2019s Democratic administration resisted because they thought it would limit regulators\u2019 flexibility.Fewer banks would take those exams, and less often.Regulators also wouldn\u2019t adopt new rules unless they meet a stricter cost-benefit analysis than some bank overseers currently use.Among the most controversial recommendations are at least a dozen changes at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a central part of Dodd-Frank.\u00a0The report proposes the bureau lose its authority to examine financial firms on a continuing basis and not be able to set its own budget.In other areas, the report avoids weighing in on controversial debates. It hedges on whether the consumer bureau should continue to be led by a single director, as opposed to a multimember board, though it says the former would be \u201cthe most straightforward\u201d approach. It recommends the $50 billion asset threshold at which big banks face stricter rules under Dodd-Frank be raised, but it doesn\u2019t say by how much.It endorses some changes approved by House Republicans in legislation last week, such as giving regulatory relief to well-capitalized banks. But it also takes a different approach in some areas, for instance by endorsing the principles behind the so-called Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, limiting certain types of bank trading. The House Republicans\u2019 bill would throw out that rule.Mr. Mnuchin said the administration is \u201cvery supportive\u201d of the Republican bill and it was focused on what the administration could\u200bdo without congressional approval.\u201cWe are fine if the House and the Senate want to repeal the Volcker rule...We\u2019re more focused on what are the changes we can make to fix it,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.In one surprising development, the report recommends that a multi-regulator council created as part of Dodd-Frank be expanded, saying Congress should give the Financial Stability Oversight Council of senior regulators the authority to \u201cappoint a lead regulator on any issue on which multiple agencies may have conflicting and overlapping regulatory jurisdiction.\u201dThe report marks the beginning of what will likely be a yearslong review of financial rules.Some recommendations, including exempting small banks from the Volcker rule, limiting the consumer bureau\u2019s authority, or expanding FSOC authority, would require congressional action\u2014a potentially\u200bhigh bar amid deep partisan tensions on Capitol Hill.Other changes would need regulatory approval from officials who might not be in place for months. Many bank rules must be approved by the boards of the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., but the leaders of those agencies have terms that haven\u2019t expired yet. Mr. Trump also hasn\u2019t nominated anyone to a number of significant regulatory roles, including the top bank oversight post at the Fed.A senior Treasury official said most of the report\u2019s recommendations could be carried out by regulators without help from Congress. The only current bank regulator appointed by the new administration, acting Comptroller\u200bof the Currency\u200bKeith Noreika, said Monday the report will inform his agency\u2019s work aimed at reducing regulatory burdens at the federally chartered banks it oversees.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com and Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Treasury Proposes Loosening Bank Rules.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 19:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-proposes-wide-ranging-changes-to-financial-sector-regulations-1497304932", "news_title": "Trump Team Proposes Broad Rethink of Financial Rulebook", "keywords": "financial sector,regulation,triump administration,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,political,general news,mortgage planning,trends,personal finance,politics,international relations,domestic politics,real estate,property,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "In recent months, tension between             General Electric         GE 0.19%      Co. and activist investor Trian Fund Management LP had been gradually building as the industrial conglomerate\u2019s results and share price languished.Now, with the planned departure of GE\u2019s longtime chief executive officer,       Jeff Immelt,        the chance of a public clash soon is greatly diminished.Investors sent the stock climbing 3.6%\u00a0to $28.94 on the news\u00a0Monday, adding nearly $9\u00a0billion in market value,as new leader       John Flannery       promised a broad review of the business \u201cwith a sense of urgency.\u201dMr. Flannery is described by analysts and others close to the company as an executive who is in sync with Trian\u2019s thinking: He has a record of hitting financial targets, he is likely to focus on cash management, and he is driven by metrics that activists champion such as return on spending and total stockholder returns.But the Boston-based company didn\u2019t consult Trian on the move\u2013GE said it was in the works for four years\u2013one that could narrow Trian\u2019s options if it is still discontented.One option that has been available to Trian was to fight for a board seat at GE\u2019s annual meeting next year. But other shareholders may be less likely to go along with such an effort as they give Mr. Flannery time to boost the stock and improve performance, making an already tough-to-win\u00a0vote significantly more difficult.Trian has historically been loath to walk away from investments, and currently has no plans to do so in the case of GE, according to a person familiar with the matter.\u00a0The fund is already up by at least $250 million since it disclosed the $2.5 billion bet in 2015, though the shares are still far below the $45 share price it targeted.Even if it didn\u2019t force the CEO change, Trian will likely continue to wield influence. It could even find a new ear in Mr. Flannery\u2019s.The activist and its co-founder and Chief Investment Officer       Ed Garden       had increased the pressure on Mr. Immelt this year. That led to an unusual disclosure in\u00a0March\u00a0in which GE said it had, in conjunction with Trian, pledged to lower annual spending by $2 billion in the next two years and tie executive bonuses to the effort.But last month, Mr. Immelt raised concerns about GE\u2019s forecasts, increasing the odds Trian could push for a CEO change.The chance for a public brawl was always smaller than in most activist situations in part because the relationship started friendly. Mr. Immelt had been looking for support as he shed GE\u2019s towering finance business. Trian originally said the stock wasn\u2019t well understood and applauded Mr. Immelt\u2019s transformation, though it suggested more cost cuts and disciplined spending were needed.Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Change May Ease Tensions With Trian.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 19:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/change-at-ge-likely-to-head-off-fight-with-trian-1497310202", "news_title": "Change at GE Likely to Head Off Fight With Trian ", "keywords": "activist investor,ge,general electric,jeff immelt,john flannery,trian fund management,General Electric,GE,Trian Fund Management,Jeff Immelt,management,management moves,shareholder activism,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,diversified holding companies,alternative investments,business,consumer services,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Emmanuel Macron       is looking like more than a one-election wonder. On Sunday the new French President\u2019s upstart political party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, swept the first round of elections for the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. If the results continue through the second round Sunday, Mr. Macron will have a sturdy mandate to repair France\u2019s broken economy.Turnout was a historic low 49%, but En Marche and its smaller centrist ally, Modem, qualified for the second round in nearly every constituency where they fielded candidates. Mr. Macron\u2019s party came first with 32% of the vote overall, thumping the center-right Republicans (22%), the hard-right National Front (13%) and the center-left Socialists (10%). Smaller far-left parties divided the rest of the ballots.These results could translate into some 400 En Marche seats out of 577 once the second round is complete. This is an astonishing feat for a party that didn\u2019t exist a year ago as well as a rebuke to the country\u2019s traditional political class.The legislative election is inoculating Mr. Macron against the antireform left\u2019s accusation that he is in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace only because the French wanted to keep out his far-right rival, the National Front\u2019s       Marine Le Pen.       The legislative races suggest voters prefer Mr. Macron\u2019s reform vision over what the traditional parties are offering. So when labor unions hit the barricades and set tires alight to protest his reforms, Mr. Macron can point out that they represent an unpopular special interest.A big majority in the National Assembly will also permit Mr. Macron to enact his reform agenda via legislation rather than relying on brittle Presidential decrees. With more than two-thirds of the Assembly in his camp, he could be more ambitious in tackling France\u2019s job- and growth-killing taxes and regulations.Start with the 35-hour workweek. Mr. Macron during the campaign vowed to keep the law intact while giving firms more room to negotiate overtime. But abolition is the real cure for a measure that discourages job creation, and the former investment banker should make the case for it.Mr. Macron\u2019s meteoric rise in politics is impressive, but the real test will be whether he can put France\u2019s 10% unemployment rate on a downward trajectory and accelerate a GDP growth rate stuck at zero to 1%.

Mac Thornberry (R., Texas), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which held the hearing, wrote Monday in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.The budget hearing, which ran until late Monday evening, covered a gamut of issues, from troop recruitment and pay to missile defense, sexual harassment, base closures, the wars overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Mr. Mattis spoke to the diplomatic rift in the Gulf, Russia and a host of other issues. Mr. Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joe Dunford, were also asked repeatedly about ships and shipbuilding.Mr. Trump frequently talked about the need to \u201crebuild the military\u201d after casting President       Barack Obama       as having weakened the military by restraining funding. Mr. Trump pledged during his campaign to build more ships and expand the U.S. naval fleet to as many as 350 ships.Rep. Joe Courtney (D., Conn.) said Mr. Trump\u2019s current budget proposal calls for too few ships. \u201cWe\u2019re living off a legacy fleet in terms of the ships we have out there,\u201d Mr. Courtney said to Mr. Mattis, asking why the current budget proposal contained \u201chesitation\u201d on the issue.Mr. Mattis acknowledged the budget didn\u2019t contain enough ships but said the Pentagon needed more time to review its shipbuilding plans.\u201cAs you know, ships are expensive and we have to make sure we have the budget to support it.\u201dThere were other questions about global threats. Mr. Mattis, who stated that North Korea was the \u201cmost urgent threat to peace and security,\u201d was also asked about Russia and Russian President       Vladimir Putin.Mr. Mattis said he saw no evidence that Mr. Putin wants a positive relationship, he said. \u201cHe\u2019s chosen to be a strategic competitor with us and we\u2019ll have to deal with that as we see it,\u201d Mr. Mattis said.But most lawmakers were focused on bread-and-butter spending issues.

More than half of the Navy\u2019s aircraft can\u2019t fly because they are awaiting parts or maintenance, and the Air Force is short about 1,500 pilots and 3,000 mechanics.Mr. Mattis, who has been traveling the world to reassure allies in Asia, the Middle East and Europe, hasn\u2019t focused publicly on Pentagon budget issues.

The defendants also include drug distributors and doctors.\u201cWe firmly believe the allegations in this lawsuit are both legally and factually unfounded,\u201d a spokeswoman for Janssen Pharmaceuticals said.A spokesman for Purdue Pharma said the company shares the concerns of public officials regarding the opioid crisis and is committed to finding collaborative solutions. A spokeswoman for Teva echoed those remarks.\u201cTeva is committed to the appropriate promotion and use of opioids,\u201d the Teva spokeswoman said.Nassau is the latest municipality to take aim at drugmakers. States and the federal government have previously pursued legal action against Purdue, alleging improper marketing of the painkiller OxyContin, and won settlements from the company.Purdue Frederick Co., an affiliate of Purdue Pharma, and three of its executives pleaded guilty in 2007 in federal court to criminal charges of misleading the public about the addictive qualities of OxyContin. The company and executives paid more than $634.5 million in penaltiesSome cities and counties have pursued lawsuits against broader groups of opioid painkiller makers. Ohio filed a similar suit against five drug companies in May.Attorneys for Nassau County said in the lawsuit that the Long Island county, with a population of about 1.4 million, has had to invest in health care and law enforcement as a result of the opioid addiction epidemic, and pay for training seminars for the overdose antidote naloxone.\u201cThe opioid crisis is costing taxpayers millions of dollars a year, and this action seeks to recoup dollars for important awareness, education, enforcement and treatment initiatives to combat the war on drug abuse and addiction,\u201d said Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano. The county is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.On Long Island, nearly 500 people died from opioid overdoses last year, the highest number of deaths to date.Suffolk County, also on Long Island, along with Sullivan and Orange counties are among the New York municipalities that have also taken legal action against the pharmaceutical industry. The state of Ohio, the city of Chicago and counties in California have also launched litigation.More than 33,000 people died in 2015 from opioid overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up nearly 16% from the year before.In addition to incurring costs related to the opioid epidemic, Nassau County alleged that all the companies named in its lawsuit used deceptive marketing tactics to \u201cconvince doctors and patients that the benefits of using opioids to treat chronic pain outweighed the risks and that opioids could be used safely by most patients.\u201dThe lawsuit also accuses the opioid distributors of negligence for failing to exercise care in the distribution of the drug.Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 19:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nassau-county-sues-drug-makers-over-opioid-epidemic-1497298701", "news_title": "Nassau County Sues Drugmakers Over Opioid Epidemic", "keywords": "crisis,epidemic,health care,lawsuit,naloxone,opioid,Janssen Pharmaceuticals,Purdue Pharma,Teva Pharmaceutical,TEVA,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,health,outbreaks,epidemics,pharmaceuticals,over-the-counter drugs,analgesics,life sciences,specialized drugs,medications,generic,biosimilar drugs"}, {"content": "Jeff Immelt       became chairman and CEO of General Electric Co., one of the world\u2019s largest corporate conglomerates, in 2001.

Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross       framed the deal as a big win\u2014and it is, for the few sugar producers on both sides of the border. The losers are millions of consumers.No industry has enjoyed as much protection under the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) as sugar producers and refiners. Mexico raised its sugar import tariffs from third countries in 1994 to match U.S. protection levels and thereby form a customs union. While most of the U.S. economy had to adapt to competition from Canada and Mexico starting in 1994, the U.S. market remained heavily protected from Mexican sugar until 2008.Even when the market opened, U.S. sugar interests refused to adapt and filed antidumping and countervailing duty suits against Mexican exports. In 2014 the Commerce Department ruled in their favor. Mexico could have fought that ruling at a Nafta arbitration panel but its sugar lobby also likes high prices. So instead it agreed to comply with a U.S.-stipulated minimum price and quota, and to restrict the amount of refined sugar it ships. In other words, both sides conspired to run a sugar cartel.Enter President Trump, who the sugar titans saw as a vehicle for even more protection. In March Mexico voluntarily suspended permits for exporting sugar to the U.S. as a precaution against the possibility that the U.S. would cancel the 2014 agreement and impose tariffs. Last week\u2019s deal is an attempt to avoid those new duties in exchange for further limits on Mexican sugar exports to the U.S.The new minimum price for raw sugar will be 23 cents per pound, up from 22.5 cents. The world market price is about 14 cents. Refined sugar will now be set at 28 cents per pound, up from 26 cents. Mexico sugar exports to the U.S. will now be 70% raw and 30% refined, up from 53% raw and 47% refined.Yet the American Sugar Alliance still doesn\u2019t support the deal because of what it calls a \u201cloophole\u201d that could allow refined Mexican sugar into the U.S. in case of shortages under the Soviet-style quota system that predicts U.S. supply every year.If this is a glimpse into Team Trump\u2019s trade policy, it isn\u2019t pretty. The deal suggests the strategy is to use government power to enforce cartels that protect politically powerful producers, and Mexico\u2019s decision to roll over may encourage White House protectionists to ask for more.

New EPA Administrator       Scott Pruitt       plans to address that in an underreported effort to clean up toxic waste sites under the so-called Superfund program.In a memo to EPA staff last month, Mr. Pruitt announced a plan to reform the Superfund program created in 1980 and to accelerate the clean up of hazardous waste sites such as old industrial properties or landfills. The effort is long overdue. Superfund has too often become a sinecure for the bureaucracy and a cash cow for lawyers. EPA staff offices can wait years or decades to assess a Superfund site, figure out who\u2019s liable for what, consult with the community, decide on a remedy and assign the actual work.Take the West Lake Landfill Superfund site in Bridgeton, Missouri, which was used for quarrying in the 1930s and later as a landfill. In 1973, 8,700 tons of leached barium sulfate from the Manhattan Project was dumped there, along with soil and waste. The EPA listed the 200-acre facility as a Superfund site in 1990.Yet it took 18 years for EPA to decide how to clean up West Lake, finally settling in 2008 on a \u201cmulti-layered engineered cover and a system of new monitoring wells.\u201d In 2009 the       Obama       EPA ditched that solution and re-opened the file. In 2010 an underground chemical reaction ignited a fire that is still smoldering.Another example is the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex in Idaho and Washington state that polluted the air and soil with heavy metals such as lead. The EPA put Bunker Hill on its original list of 406 Superfund sites in 1983, but it too remains an open case.Or Portland Harbor, in Oregon, which was listed in 2000. The private companies EPA found responsible spent years and tens of millions of dollars on a clean-up study that the agency eventually discarded. Obama EPA chief       Gina McCarthy       didn\u2019t choose a remedy for the site until this January, days before President       Trump\u2019s       inauguration, using information that was more than a decade old.These are examples of the 1,336 Superfund sites on the EPA\u2019s National Priorities List. Mr. Pruitt has directed a new task force, chaired by senior adviser       Albert Kelly,        to review Superfund management and business practices. He has also taken power from EPA regional offices to make decisions about projects estimated to cost $50 million or more, which should speed decision-making.The response from critics, especially from the previous Administration, is that the problem is lack of federal funding. They\u2019re upset that President Trump\u2019s budget proposes a 30% cut in Superfund for next fiscal year, $330 million less than this year.But Superfund delays aren\u2019t the result of insufficient funds, especially since private parties now shoulder most clean-up costs, as envisaged in the original legislation. At the end of fiscal 2016 the Superfund\u2019s special accounts, which hold settlement money for specific projects, totalled $3.3 billion. EPA projects it will spend $1.3 billion of that over the next five years. That\u2019s on top of Superfund\u2019s 2018 budget request for $762 million.In 2009 the Obama Administration pumped $600 million into the program as part of the stimulus plan. Yet the EPA\u2019s data on \u201cconstruction completions,\u201d which track Superfund sites that have finished physical construction and dealt with long-term threats, shows a downward trend even as the money flowed in. There were 18 completions in 2010, down from 20 in 2009, and 47 in 2001. In 2016 only 13 sites were completed.The real obstacle is a combination of bureaucratic inertia and legal or political disputes over who pays what. Washington typically measures success by money spent rather than on results. Yet Superfund ought to be measured by how many sites it cleans up\u2014until it is no longer necessary. The green lobby puts symbolic gestures against climate change above all other priorities, but if Mr. Pruitt can accelerate Superfund cleanup he\u2019ll do far more for the environment.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 19:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cleaning-up-the-superfund-mess-1497309104", "news_title": "Cleaning Up the Superfund Mess", "keywords": "Environmental Protection Agency,political,general news,climate change,natural environment,global,world issues,editorials,waste management,recycling services,business,consumer services,environment"}, {"content": "Moon Jae-in\u2019s decision to suspend deployment of a missile-defense system last week signals how the new South Korean President will approach the threat from North Korea as well as relations with the U.S., China and Japan. Like his center-left predecessors, Mr. Moon wants to play a balancing role between the regional powers and convince North Korea to negotiate an entente. This na\u00efvete puts South Korea\u2019s security in peril.The ability of the U.S.-made Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) to protect against missile attacks from the North isn\u2019t at issue. Nor is cost, since Washington is picking up the $1 billion tab. The system is only controversial because China is angry that the radar can peer into its airspace. Beijing is imposing unofficial economic sanctions on Seoul to force it to abandon Thaad.Mr. Moon has buckled under Chinese pressure and decided to delay the placement of new launchers for up to two years as his government conducts an environmental assessment. National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong tried to reassure the U.S. that Seoul will adhere to the agreement to deploy Thaad.But Mr. Chung\u2019s promise was undermined by an unidentified presidential official who told the media last week that the need for Thaad is \u201cnot urgent.\u201d That prompted incredulity among many Koreans, since the North continues to test its missiles almost every week along with apocalyptic threats.The Joongang Daily newspaper wrote, \u201cWe are absolutely dumbfounded by the remarks,\u201d while the Korea Herald opined, \u201cGiven the higher frequency of the North\u2019s missile tests in recent months, the complete deployment of the system is urgent. Anti-missile capability has become a matter of survival for the South.\u201dMr. Moon also tried to reassure Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, who visited Seoul in late May, that he wouldn\u2019t reverse the decision to deploy Thaad. But Mr. Durbin came away even more concerned about the new President\u2019s plans. \u201cIt\u2019s my fear that he thinks\u2014I hope I\u2019m wrong\u2014that [Moon] thinks that South Korea has a better chance working with China to contain North Korea than working with the United States,\u201d he told the Washington Examiner.Anything short of dismantling the Thaad radar and the two sets of launchers deployed by the previous government is unlikely to appease Beijing. Abroad and at home, Mr. Moon\u2019s attempt to please everyone is bound to backfire. Meanwhile, North Korea may be emboldened to escalate its missile and other military provocations to test the new administration.Mr. Moon still has time to fix his mistake before he meets President Trump in Washington later this month. Environmental assessments can and should be waived when national security is at stake.

A video taken by a witness right after the crash purportedly shows Mr. Feliz-Rodriguez emerging from his car on fire, rolling and on his hands and knees.

Ranchers, miners and loggers have argued that land should be more open to industry and put under local control to help stimulate the economy.\u00a0Others\u00a0argue the land should be preserved for wildlife and as open space for future generations.Mr. Zinke has said he is seeking a balance between those positions, though environmentalists fear reductions would dangerously diminish protections of natural space, animals and artifacts.Utah lawmakers who had pushed for an all-out reversal of the monument welcomed the decision, while environmental groups threatened legal challenges to any shrinking of the monument.The Bears Ears preserve was created late last year by President Barack Obama to the delight of environmental groups and some Native Americans, but over the opposition of many state and local politicians and some other Native Americans.The interior secretary said at a press conference Monday announcing his decision that he\u00a0believes the monument should\u00a0only\u00a0include areas around objects of the most archaeological importance such as ancient cliff dwellings and rock drawings. He said\u00a0those predominantly exist in\u00a0two areas of the current monument: the twin buttes that give Bears Ears its name, and in some canyon areas to the north.\u201cWe have to draw a line to do our job,\u201d Mr. Zinke said.He said tightening boundaries around just those areas would hew more closely to the language of the Antiquities Act of 1906, which authorizes presidents to set aside the smallest area needed to protect items of historic or scientific value.He said he plans to apply the same standard to other monuments under review. Mr. Zinke\u00a0is reviewing land and water monuments of more than 100,000 acres created since 1996, which also include Utah\u2019s Grand Staircase-Escalante.The president has said his\u00a0predecessors had abused the Antiquities Act by cordoning off federal without seeking adequate local agreement.Mr. Zinke is asking\u00a0that the president\u00a0handle the actual reduction, and\u00a0called for a bill that\u00a0would give the Navajo, the Ute and a coalition of other tribes that have ancestral and cultural ties to the Bears Ears land the same co-management role they had under the existing monument.He\u00a0also recommends Congress consider legislation enacting other protections for the Bears Ears area.Utah Rep.       Jason Chaffetz,        chairman of the House oversight committee and a supporter of revoking the monument\u2019s status, said the decision was a good compromise.\u201cA locally-driven, legislative approach is the best way to strike a balance among the people who love and use the vast acreage surrounding the Bears Ears.\u201dBut environmental groups blasted the recommendation, saying the president lacks the authority to change the monument.\u201cIf President Trump follows Secretary Zinke\u2019s recommendation to shrink the boundaries of these cherished lands, we will\u00a0see\u00a0him\u00a0in\u00a0court,\u201d said       Heidi McIntosh,        a managing attorney for Earthjustice, a San Francisco-based environmental group.A move\u00a0by the president\u00a0to shrink Bears Ears and other monuments could represent a more legally defensible route than\u00a0abolishing\u00a0them altogether.That is because no such legal language exists in the Antiquities Act, which presidents going back to       Theodore Roosevelt       have used to set aside public lands for special protection, legal scholars say. Moreover, no president has ever overturned one of the more than 100 monuments created, congressional researchers say.There is precedent, however, for both Congress and presidents to shrink the boundaries of monuments.But environmental attorneys and some legal scholars say boundaries have been adjusted so infrequently\u2014only about a dozen times and none in at least 40 years\u2014that the Trump administration would be open to legal challenges.In northern Maine, opponents to the Katahdin Woods and Water National Monument, which was created by former President       Barack Obama       in 2016 and is now under federal review, cheered the idea that the Bears Ears National Monument could be downsized.\u201cI think there is hope,\u201d said Anne Mitchell, a board member of the Maine Woods Coalition, a citizens\u2019 group that fears the 87,000-acre Katahdin monument\u00a0could eventually be expanded and consume timber land and hinder outdoor recreation. \u201cThis strikes me as a common sense way of addressing this.\u201dBut supporters of the monument, including the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce, said they plan to fight harder to keep the designation, which they say is an economic boost to\u00a0the rural community.\u201cWe\u2019re going to going to argue economics and more importantly we will talk about local support for the monument, and the extensive public outreach that happened,\u201d said Gail Fanjoy, president of the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce.\u2014Jennifer Levitz contributed to this article.Write to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/interior-secretary-recommends-shrinking-utah-monument-1497307770", "news_title": "Interior Secretary Recommends Shrinking Utah Monument ", "keywords": "bears ears,bears ears national monument,interior secretary ryan zinke,trump bears ears,trump national monuments,trump utah monument,utah's bears ears national monument,zinke bears ears,Ryan Zinke,political,general news,natural environment,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "This article is signed by Sens.

After these catastrophic natural disasters, too many Americans find themselves facing a man-made calamity: a National Flood Insurance Program that overcharges and underdelivers for policyholders and for taxpayers.The Sept. 30 expiration of the law authorizing the NFIP represents an opportunity to address the waste, abuse and mismanagement plaguing the system. As members of the Senate Banking and Appropriations committees, which oversee flood insurance and provide federal disaster response, we plan to offer bipartisan landmark legislation to tackle systemic problems with flood insurance and to reframe our entire disaster paradigm.Today, more homeowners are abandoning national flood insurance policies because their premiums continue to rise, despite the emergency relief measures Congress approved in 2014. With the NFIP becoming more insolvent day by day, we must get this program back on solid fiscal ground. But we cannot build a sustainable system by simply imposing higher premiums on homeowners. We must address the program\u2019s critical problems: unsustainability, low participation rates, inaccurate flood maps, indifference to the benefits of flood control infrastructure, agency mismanagement, unsustainable debt service costs and contractor profiteering.The time has come to make an ambitious national reinvestment in cost-effective flood control and mitigation that reduces risk across the country. Under the current system, FEMA spent more than $277 billion in disaster aid to rebuild communities after floods from 2005 to 2014, but only a fraction of that on efforts to stop or control floodwaters to avert disasters. Our current system is backward. Rebuilding communities after a disaster is far more expensive than working proactively to reduce or prevent their devastation. FEMA has found that every dollar spent on mitigation generates at least $4 in future savings, and some major federal flood-control projects have seen a return on investment of approximately 54 to 1.Our legislation will apply these lessons by moving us toward proactive flood prevention and mitigation. By ending FEMA\u2019s reliance on antiquated flood maps and encouraging the use of cutting-edge technologies, we can create more-accurate nationwide flood-hazard mapping. These changes would improve the NFIP\u2019s long-term solvency while better protecting our communities, local economies and the environment.To pay for these critical investments, we propose three key reforms: a temporary freeze on interest on the NFIP debt; elimination of agency waste, mismanagement and contractor profiteering; and increasing NFIP enrollment.The NFIP has paid the federal government $4 billion in interest over the last decade, payments that swallow more than 10% of all premiums. Beyond the folly of the federal government charging itself interest, these dollars would be better spent on premium affordability and cost-effective community flood prevention. Temporarily freezing interest on the debt would not forgive what is owed, but it would free up policyholder-contributed dollars for necessary investments in state-of-the-art flood mapping and property mitigation.At the same time, our bill will generate savings by eliminating waste in FEMA\u2019s Write Your Own program. Currently, private insurers selling NFIP policies pocket at least 31 cents of every premium dollar while bearing no financial risk. Our plan will cap compensation to private insurance companies, putting affordable premiums over runaway industry profits.Finally, our legislation will put people first. In the aftermath of severe floods, coastal and inland communities across our country have learned that the deck is often stacked against policyholders. In recent years, FEMA and its contractors have spent millions of dollars fighting property owners with legitimate claims. The current system has given rise to a cottage industry of entities that profit by needlessly prolonging costly court disputes over flood claims. Most flood victims cannot afford protracted legal battles, but these entities faced no limit to the time they can spend in court on the taxpayers\u2019 dime. To correct this unseemly situation, our plan will give the federal government the tools it needs to remove bad actors and better defend itself in court.We cannot control the disasters nature sends our way. But we can control how we prepare for and respond to such events. Americans deserve a National Flood Insurance Program that is sustainable for taxpayers, affordable for homeowners, and accountable to everyone. Affordable flood insurance, when accompanied by effective flood prevention and mitigation tools, helps to achieve this vital mission. In an era of severe flooding, our legislation will better protect our communities and put our National Flood Insurance Program on a more sustainable, affordable and accountable path.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-bipartisan-plan-for-flood-insurance-1497307690", "news_title": "A Bipartisan Plan for Flood Insurance", "keywords": " bill, bipartisan, legislation,national flood insurance program, nfip,political,general news,disasters,accidents,floods,tidal waves,natural disasters,catastrophes,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Sometimes government regulators do things that are not merely misguided but gratuitously stupid. A classic example came last month, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture called for the destruction of at least 13 varieties of petunias with striking hues. These plants don\u2019t pose any danger to health or the natural environment. But because they were crafted with modern genetic-engineering techniques, technically they\u2019re in violation of 30-year-old government regulations.These petunias, first developed in the 1980s, were sold around the globe for years without incident. Then in 2015 a Finnish plant scientist noticed bright-orange petunias at a train station in Helsinki. He recalled that such a variety was genetically engineered three decades prior but never commercialized. The scientist took a stem and later confirmed that it contained foreign DNA\u2014a corn gene that confers the vivid color and a tiny sequence of DNA from a virus that turns on the newly-inserted gene.He tipped off Finnish regulators, who notified their counterparts in Europe and North America. Since no government had issued permits to sell these varieties, the result was a petunia purge. Untold numbers of beautiful and completely harmless flowers and seeds were destroyed. The USDA said the flowers could be burned and the seeds ground up.The USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has long regulated the importation and interstate movement of \u201cplant pests,\u201d which can include plants, bacteria, fungi, viruses and more. If someone wants to introduce a plant or other organism included on the USDA\u2019s pest list into the field, a permit is required. If the organism isn\u2019t on the list, it can be introduced without government approval.But for a quarter-century, this process has had an evil twin: a regime focused exclusively on plants altered or produced with the most precise genetic-engineering techniques if they contain even a snippet of DNA from a plant pest. The original concept of a plant pest, something known to be harmful, has been tortured into a new category: a \u201cregulated article.\u201d For decades the definition of this category has required virtually every genetically engineered plant to undergo a lengthy case-by-case review, regardless of potential risk. An edible plant can take longer.If a researcher wants to perform a field trial with a regulated article such as the forbidden petunias, he must submit extensive paperwork to the Agriculture Department. After conducting tests for years at many sites, the developer can then submit a large dossier of data and request \u201cderegulation\u201d by the USDA for cultivation and sale.These requirements make genetically engineered plants extraordinarily expensive to develop and test. On average, each costs about $136 million, according to       Wendelyn Jones       of             DuPont                   Crop Protection. This probably is why the developers of the genetically engineered petunias never commercialized them legally. At around $5 for 5,000 seeds, there is no way to recover the regulatory costs.The USDA\u2019s discriminatory treatment of genetically engineered plants ignores science. Plants always have been selected by nature and bred by humans or mutated to create new varieties with enhanced resistance to insects, disease, weeds, herbicides and environmental stresses. Grain yields in particular have increased dramatically over the past 50 years. Like the contraband petunias, plants have also been modified for qualities attractive to consumers, such as seedless watermelons.Government should regulate similar products or activities in a similar way, and the degree of oversight should be proportionate to risk. For new varieties of plants, risk is a function of such characteristics as toxicity or weed-like qualities. It doesn\u2019t matter how a new gene is introduced. What\u2019s important is whether that gene\u2019s expression confers risk on other organisms or natural ecosystems. The only new gene expressed in the Helsinki petunias imparts a unique orange hue\u2014harming no one\u2014but the Agriculture Department subjects such plants to extensive and burdensome regulation.Since it\u2019s illegal to sell the genetically engineered petunias without a permit, regulators have told vendors to destroy them. I have a better idea. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue should instruct his subordinates to invoke \u201cenforcement discretion\u201d and not take action against the sellers. Or he can ask growers to donate the flowers to cancer wards in pediatric hospitals. There\u2019s a difference between petunias and plutonium.Dr. Miller, a physician and molecular biologist, is a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.

Consequently, Sandoz began selling the drug in September 2015\u2014at a 15% discount to Neupogen\u2014even as it argued against the delay.The high court, in an opinion by Justice       Clarence Thomas,        ruled unanimously that Sandoz shouldn\u2019t have had the additional wait, a ruling that could speed up the timeline for future biologics to reach the market.At issue was how to interpret part of a recent federal law that sought to encourage price competition for expensive biologic drugs by creating an abbreviated approval process for so-called biosimilar medicines.The law required the manufacturer of a biosimilar to give 180 days advanced notice to the maker of the brand-name biotech drug, but the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling said companies can give the notice even before FDA approval.Amgen said it was disappointed in the ruling but \u201cwe will continue to seek to enforce our intellectual property against those parties that infringe upon our rights.\u201d Novartis said the decision \u201cwill help expedite patient access to life-enhancing treatments.\u201dThe Microsoft case involved allegations that Xbox videogame consoles had a design defect that could cause scratches on game discs, a claim the company denied.\u00a0A group of Xbox owners sought to bring their case jointly as a class action, but a judge declined to allow the litigants to proceed collectively.When a judge declines to certify a class action, such a court order isn\u2019t automatically eligible to be appealed right away.The plaintiffs in the Xbox case sought to voluntarily dismiss their claims, a tactic they hoped would allow them to go forward with an appeal. They said pursuing their cases individually was economically irrational because the value of their claims was small.The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice       Ruth Bader Ginsburg,        said the plaintiffs couldn\u2019t obtain the right to appeal simply by voluntarily dismissing their claims.Microsoft had argued the plaintiffs\u2019 approach was unfair because it would allow them to appeal adverse rulings on certifying class actions, while company defendants wouldn\u2019t have the same right.\u201cThis case was about following procedural rules that Congress established and that work for everyone,\u201d the company said in blog post.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Biotech Copy Wins Ruling.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-court-ruling-could-speed-competition-in-biosimilars-market-1497307562", "news_title": "High Court Ruling Could Speed Competition in Biosimilars Market ", "keywords": "biosimilar,biotech drug,clarence thomas,drug competition,high court,supreme court,Amgen,AMGN,Microsoft,MSFT,Novartis,NOVN.EB,Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Clarence Thomas,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,new products,services,new product approvals,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "A decline in technology stocks moderated Monday and the shares of several chip makers turned higher, alleviating some concerns that last week\u2019s pullback could be the start of a deep rout.Nvidia Corp.

Some analysts and investors had grown concerned that the concentrated group of highfliers was vulnerable to a reversal.The PHLX Semiconductor Index, a group of 30 semiconductor stocks, declined 0.5% Monday compared with Friday\u2019s 4.2% slide, which was its second-biggest daily drop of the year. Nvidia Corp. climbed 37 cents, or 0.25%, to $149.97 on Monday after shedding 6.5% Friday in its highest-volume trading day since 2004, according to FactSet.\u201cIs the panic over? To some extent, it feels like it is because if you look at Nvidia, it\u2019s bounced back off the low,\u201d said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services, after the market closed Friday.Nvidia, which more than doubled over the seven months through Thursday, has been watched by some analysts and investors for signs about where the broader tech rally is heading.Some of the most actively traded options contracts on Nvidia stock Monday were calls, or bullish options, expiring in June, according to Trade Alert data.\u201cI think participants see this latest selloff as short-term in nature,\u201d said Fred Ruffy, an analyst at Trade Alert, adding that calls trading on Nvidia outpaced puts, or bearish options, exchanging hands on Monday. \u201cThere are people using options to play the stock for a rebound.\u201dThe PHLX Semiconductor Index has gained more than twice as much as S&P 500 tech stocks and         Nasdaq Co      mposite since the start of 2016. Although a strong 2016 accounts for much of the PHLX Index\u2019s gains, it has still fared better than the S&P tech sector and Nasdaq this year.As investors dialed back on some of the most popular stocks of the year last week, some of this year\u2019s underperformers posted gains.Energy stocks in the S&P 500, the worst performer of the 11 sectors this year, have risen more than 3% during the two-session tech selloff. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rose 4.9% last week\u2014its biggest weekly gain of the year. That bounce has raised the prospect that investors may rotate back into underperforming sectors, boosting what had been laggards for much of the year.At the same time, investors say those sectors face challenges of their own. Bank stocks typically rise when long-term rates increase relative to short-term ones, but that so-called spread has been declining since the end of last year as investors reverse bets on quicker economic growth. Shares of energy companies have fallen largely because oil prices are down more than 14% this year.That has made many analysts and investors wary of calling an end to the tech rally.\u201cIt\u2019s all a herd mentality,\u201d said       Robert Pavlik,        chief equity strategist at Boston Private Wealth. \u201cI think once you see this all sort of play out, the market is going to be looking for growth,\u201d he said, adding that he thinks investors will use the selloff as a buying opportunity for tech.Some say chip makers are one group that has more room to run.Many semiconductor companies have been benefiting from rising memory-chip prices, according to a Benchmark Research industry note published Monday. Global semiconductor revenue is forecast to increase more than 12% this year, research firm Gartner said in April.The semiconductor index traded Friday at about 15.7 times Wall Street\u2019s projected earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet, below the Nasdaq\u2019s multiple of 22.5, suggesting that that they are still attractively valued relative to the broader market.\u201cAt this point, in 2017, we see the group positioned mid-cycle,\u201d said       Rick Schafer,        managing director and senior analyst at Oppenheimer. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough when you\u2019re in the middle of a cycle to know whether you\u2019re in the third inning or the seventh.\u201d\u2014Ben Eisen, Gunjan Banerji and Akane Otani contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Chip Stocks Buck Broader Slump.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/decline-in-technology-stocks-moderates-in-mondays-session-1497307544", "news_title": "Decline in Technology Stocks Moderates in Monday\u2019s Session ", "keywords": "Alphabet Inc.

But the known facts do not support a Russia-Trump plot to defeat       Hillary Clinton.       Russia\u2019s actions are consistent instead with an attempt to turn Americans against each other and sow distrust between the president and the American intelligence services.For Russians, the difference between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton simply was not that significant. Mr. Trump made naive and uninformed remarks during the campaign. But Mrs. Clinton, as secretary of state, showed no grasp of Russian realities. She launched the \u201creset\u201d policy after the murders of       Alexander Litvinenko,        a former Russian intelligence agent who had been granted asylum in Britain, and       Anna Politkovskaya,        Russia\u2019s leading investigative journalist. In both cases, the regime of       Vladimir Putin       was directly implicated.Instead of trying seriously to deter Russian aggression, which in Ukraine so far has claimed more than 10,000 lives, the Obama administration in 2009 created the McFaul-Surkov commission.       Michael McFaul,        Mr. Obama\u2019s chief adviser on Russia, was tasked with building civil society alongside       Vladislav Surkov,        a Kremlin aide responsible for suppressing it.The reset was intended to support       Dmitry Medvedev,        who was Russia\u2019s president from 2008 to 2012 before Mr. Putin returned for a third term. But while Mr. Medvedev was chairman of Gazprom from 2001 to 2007, 6.4% of the state energy conglomerate\u2019s shares\u2014$20 billion worth\u2014went missing. When nationwide anticorruption protests were held in Russia this March, the target was now-Prime Minister Medvedev, who was treated as \u201cthe face of state corruption.\u201dRussia\u2019s 2015-16 hacking operation was also carried out in a way that would have made a focused and tightly held conspiracy nearly impossible. Last October my emails were stolen by Fancy Bear, the same Russia-linked group that hacked       John Podesta,        Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chief. Citizens Lab, a University of Toronto cybersecurity project found that I was part of an operation aimed at 218 unique targets\u2014officials, journalists and military\u2014in at least 39 countries. Former FBI Director       James Comey       said during his recent testimony that since 2015 there could be more than 1,000 entities targeted by Russian hackers in the U.S. alone.Hacking on this scale would have been difficult to coordinate with any American political operatives, let alone in the heat of a presidential race. Further, Russian influence operations are almost always a matter of facilitation rather than subordination.       Victor Louis,        a KGB agent and the father of Soviet disinformation, successfully insinuated lies into the Western press by presenting them as inside information. \u201cAmerican reporters,\u201d he once told me jokingly, \u201calways steal my best ideas.\u201dWikiLeaks\u2019s Julian Assange may be sincere when he says that \u201cour source is not the Russian government,\u201d but only because he is more useful to Moscow if he thinks he is acting independently. The Russian practice of achieving objectives \u201cthrough the hands of others\u201d would make it nearly impossible to coordinate with the Trump campaign as some have alleged.Perhaps most important, Russian intelligence also acted to sabotage Mr. Trump. The \u201cTrump dossier,\u201d full of unverified sexual and political allegations, was published in January by BuzzFeed, despite having all the hallmarks of Russian spy agency \u201ccreativity.\u201d The dossier was prepared by       Christopher Steele,        a former British intelligence officer. It employed standard Russian techniques of disinformation and manipulation. The dossier depicts Mr. Putin as dedicated to \u201cNineteenth Century \u2018Great Power\u2019 politics,\u201d determined to prosecute \u201coligarchs\u201d and \u201cmotivated by fear and hatred of Hillary Clinton.\u201dAfter the publication of the Trump dossier, Mr. Steele went into hiding, supposedly in fear for his life. On March 15, however,       Michael Morell,        the former acting CIA director, told NBC that Mr. Steele had paid the Russian intelligence sources who provided the information and never met with them directly. In other words, his sources were not only working for pay. Furthermore, Mr. Steele had no way to judge the veracity of their claims.The payments are likely to have been high. So who provided the money? An April Vanity Fair article determined that the research that became the dossier was originally funded by a \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican. After Mr. Trump sewed up the GOP nomination, however, \u201cDemocratic donors\u201d kept the effort alive. Perhaps the time has come to expand the investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling to include Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign as well.Investigating the role of Russian disinformation in the 2016 election requires understanding the layers of deception in which Russian intelligence specialize.

We now tend to view them in a bipolar way, either as heroes or victims. Around half of Americans who see a homeless man believe he\u2019s a veteran, one study found\u2014they\u2019re wrong 90% of the time\u2014yet they also rush to thank veterans for their service.Americans, in other words, don\u2019t understand veterans. This is partly due to the professionalization of the military. In 1973 the federal government ended conscription and established the all-volunteer force. As the population grew and the military drastically shrank, the military-civilian divide grew wider and became self-reinforcing. Today, the child of a career-military parent is six times as likely to make the military his career, while less than 1% of Americans serve. Veterans are often assumed not to be representative of America at large.Such assumptions are also due to scholarly neglect. University of Chicago sociologist       Samuel Stouffer\u2019s       massive postwar American Soldier project is often hailed as kicking off modern sociology. It and later studies examined the effect military service had on attitudes and behavior in civilian life.The more than 16 million American veterans of World War II had an unmistakable influence across American civic and social life. Their participation in the GI Bill dramatically expanded the number of college students and graduates. More than half a million people got help financing their own homes, farms and other businesses. Stouffer\u2019s studies showed empirically that veterans mirrored the nation even as their commitment to it resulted in deep civic engagement.Are Stouffer\u2019s insights true of today\u2019s veteran? Probably, but we can\u2019t say for sure. We may even be shortchanging veterans\u2019 civic-mindedness: Perhaps because of the divergences in ideology, geography and background between those who serve and the public at large, veterans of the volunteer forces are more engaged in public service.If so, it might help explain why the military enjoys greater public trust and confidence than any other institution\u2014doctors, the media, the Supreme Court, and never mind Congress. We need that better understanding because we are in the midst of a well-documented crisis of decline of civic engagement and \u201csocial capital\u201d in America.While more colleges and universities have veterans\u2019 centers, these are generally designed to help veterans who are enrolled in school. Programs designed to generate knowledge about veterans and society are rare, even after nearly 16 years of continuous war.It\u2019s likely that veterans\u2019 participation in civic life, and especially in politics and elected office, will improve the country similarly to how the World War II generation\u2019s involvement did. There are signs that it already is. But this is something we should know, rather than speculate about, the next time we see a homeless individual or thank vets for their service.Mr. Schmitt and Ms. Burgess are, respectively, director and program manager of the Program on American Citizenship at the American Enterprise Institute.Appeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-dont-know-about-veterans-1497307334", "news_title": "What We Don\u2019t Know About Veterans", "keywords": "military service,united states veterans,us armed forces,us military,us veterans,va hospital,veterans,veterans administration,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "This coming Sunday, in homes across the nation, millions of American men will awake to the arrival of breakfast in bed. Prepared and served by their children, these Father\u2019s Day repasts convey appreciation as well as contributing to the general bonhomie of the day to come. But as he sips his coffee from his \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Dad\u201d mug, even the most obtuse father has to ask himself: Have I been the man my children deserve?For dads with daughters, the question can be particularly disquieting as we contemplate a sexual revolution that has lost sight of any boundaries. In theory it\u2019s all gloriously empowering. But for those who regard human sexuality as a profound gift, and la diff\u00e9rence as a key to appreciating this gift, it\u2019s astonishing how judgments that would have been elementary to our great-great-grandmothers today elude the most privileged and well-educated.Just one example, from a news story that made national headlines about two years ago. At Stanford, two grad students were cycling across campus when they noticed a young man sexually engaging a woman who wasn\u2019t moving. In the cozy surrounds of a campus dumpster.The young man was a member of the Stanford swim team. He was sentenced to six months for sexual assault and released after serving half his time. The coverage suggests the issues are complicated. But are they?For young men: Does it require a Stanford degree to know that sexual contact with an unconscious woman is a line a man does not cross? As for being drunk himself, if he had no notion he might be doing something wrong, why did he make a run for it when the cyclists interrupted him?For young women: This may sound impolitic, but loving moms and dads say it anyway. What happened here is a lesson in the vulnerability of women not in control of themselves because they are drunk.The straw-man rejoinder is that this suggests the woman was \u201casking for it.\u201d To the contrary, this is a refusal to allow ideology to deny a fact of life. The physical reality is that a woman\u2019s inebriation removes a critical barrier to assault and humiliation.The great fraud of our age, of course, is that consent and contraception are all a woman needs to have sex the way a man can. Certainly birth control and its backstop (abortion) permit women to enjoy a sexual relationship without the fear of an unwanted child. But seldom does anyone ask whether an unwanted pregnancy is the only unfortunate consequence a consensual sexual relationship might bring.This father wonders. I know any number of accomplished women who are not prudes, who want to be more than someone\u2019s Tinder swipe and who are looking for full and worthy partners. When these women relate the reality of modern courtship\u2014how so many first dates end with the man making clear that not jumping into bed with him means no second date\u2014let\u2019s just say \u201cempowering\u201d is not the first word that comes to mind.In a 2014 piece for the Weekly Standard,       Heather Mac Donald       noted that when the social default for unmarried sex was \u201cno,\u201d the woman didn\u2019t have to explain herself. \u201cNo\u201d was sufficient. The irony is that this default meant the woman held most of the cards when it came to deciding whether a relationship would become sexual.Today, Ms. Mac Donald notes, the default has become \u201cyes\u201d\u2014and the woman who resists is both on her own and on the defensive. For men, of course, this has been a most welcome shift. And no doubt for some women, too.Then again, if all women are yearning for is strings-free sex, why does it seem to require so much alcohol? Might one answer be the loneliness that comes from giving fully of yourself in the hope of finding intimacy\u2014and in return getting only intercourse?Already I hear the chorus rumbling. Mansplaining! This guy\u2019s a dinosaur! Get woke!Perhaps. Then again, most dads accept that part of the job is a willingness to be the unfashionable one; that is, to love enough to speak unpopular truths when the world cheats your children with fifty shades of grey. For all the complaints about \u201ctoxic masculinity,\u201d genuine masculinity seems hard to come by. Surely the greater male dysfunction of our time is perpetual adolescence, and a culture that encourages the man-child.So this Father\u2019s Day, looking over the three greatest blessings in his life, this dad pines for the day when we might again speak honestly and openly about the profound differences between male and female sexuality, when the heart might be taken as seriously as the orgasm\u2014and when young men pursuing young women might even rediscover the marvelous possibilities of moonlit summer evenings.Write to mcgurn@wsj.com.Appeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dad-meets-the-sexual-revolution-1497307294", "news_title": "Dad Meets the Sexual Revolution", "keywords": "father's day,fathers and daughters,feminism,masculinism,masculinity,sex,sexual revolution,political,general news,health,sexuality,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "It is a striking and dangerous contradiction: Qatar invests billions of dollars in the U.S. and Europe and then recycles the profits to support Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and groups linked to al Qaeda. Qatar hosts the American military base from which the U.S. directs the regional war against extremism, yet it also owns media networks responsible for inciting many of the same extremists.When the United Arab Emirates and like-minded countries took diplomatic and economic measures against Qatar last week, it was not done lightly or in haste. Rather it was prompted by the accumulation of years of bewildering Qatari behavior that poses a direct threat to the U.S., U.A.E. and Qatar itself. If Qatar sows the wind, it will reap the whirlwind.President Trump said it well on Friday: \u201cthe time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding [of extremism]. .\u00a0.\u00a0. For Qatar, we want you back among the unity of responsible nations.\u201dQatar can no longer have it both ways. It must now decide whether it is \u201call in\u201d\u2014or not\u2014in the fight against extremism and aggression.For years, Qatar has supported and sheltered extremists. In the mid-1990s, it harbored the notorious terrorist Khalid       Sheikh Mohammed,        who became one of the principal plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks. Today it hosts and promotes the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s spiritual leader       Yusuf al-Qaradawi,        as well as       Khaled Mashal,        leader of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.Last week the U.A.E. and other states designated Mr. al-Qaradawi, along with 58 others and 12 organizations, as providing material support for terrorists. Many live in, operate from, or receive backing from Doha. Some are linked directly to the ruling family. They will not be lonely\u2014along with Iran, Qatar has the unseemly distinction of having one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of internationally designated terror financiers.A 2015 Wall Street Journal article noted: \u201cFor years, Islamist rebel fighters from Libya and Syria traveled to Qatar and returned with suitcases full of money.\u201d Doha has provided financial and logistical support to the Nusra Front (now known as Tahrir al Sham), the Syrian branch of al Qaeda. The Manchester suicide bomber was associated with an al Qaeda-aligned militia in Libya supported by Qatar.The Financial Times reports that two months ago Qatar paid a hostage ransom of as much as $1 billion to a variety of terror organizations in Syria and Iraq that are subject to sanctions, including Iran\u2019s local Hezbollah franchise. In Egypt, Qatar has given a blank check to the Muslim Brotherhood, the launching pad for many of the most violent Islamist groups.And just when responsible nations are focusing attention on confronting radicalization in all of its forms, Qatar-owned media, led by Al Jazeera, continue to incite violence and fanaticism across the Arab world. Like a twisted version of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d the cleric al-Qaradawi has used his TV program to promote a fatwa encouraging suicide bombers, as well as to defend the killing of American soldiers in Iraq as a \u201creligious obligation.\u201dFormer Defense Secretary       Robert Gates       said in May: \u201cGeneral [John] Abizaid was convinced that Al Jazeera was working against our troops and actually providing information to our enemies. There was concern about\u2014broader concern about Al Jazeera providing a platform for terrorists.\u201dThe comments by Mr. Gates, who led the Pentagon under both Presidents       George W. Bush       and       Barack Obama,        demonstrate that Qatar has been a festering concern for Washington across parties and administrations. The Bush administration began the concerted global effort to target terrorist financing. The Obama administration concluded in 2016 that Qatar \u201clacks the necessary political will and capacity to effectively enforce\u201d laws against terror financing. Obama officials also considered pulling a U.S. fighter squadron from the Al Udeid air base over Qatari refusal to take action against terrorist financiers.The American presence at Al Udeid is critical to protecting U.S. and allied interests in the Middle East. While the current measures against Qatar remain in place, the U.A.E. and America\u2019s other friends in the region will continue working closely with the U.S. military to sustain the base\u2019s full war-fighting capabilities. We also welcome U.S. involvement in facilitating a diplomatic resolution that will allow Qatar, a neighbor and treaty ally, to return to the community of responsible nations.What must Qatar do? It should first acknowledge what the world already knows: Doha has become a financial, media and ideological hub for extremism. Then it must take decisive action to deal once and for all with its extremist problem\u2014to shut down this funding, stop interfering in its neighbors\u2019 internal affairs, and end its media incitement and radicalization.With terrorists rampaging through the streets of European cities and hatching plots against targets in the U.S., there can be no equivocation, no hedging and no delay in taking on the radical menace. Qatar cannot own stakes in the Empire State Building and the London Shard and use the profits to write checks to affiliates of al Qaeda. It cannot plaster its name on soccer jerseys while its media networks burnish the extremist brand. It cannot be owners of Harrods and             Tiffany                   & Co. while providing safe haven to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.Mr. Otaiba is the United Arab Emirates\u2019 ambassador to the U.S.Appeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-cannot-have-it-both-ways-1497307260", "news_title": "Qatar Cannot Have It Both Ways", "keywords": "funding terrorism,hamas,islamic radicalism,muslim brotherhood,muslim extrmism,president trump,qatar,robert gates,Hamas,Muslim Brotherhood,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism,commentaries,opinions,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "A young man moves to San Francisco. He has a startup that\u2019s growing fast. He is fond of meditation and likes to quote libertarian theories to anyone who will listen. He is worth many millions of dollars but dresses casually. He tells himself and those who work for him that, although the money is pouring in, their work is not about the money\u2014it\u2019s about changing the world. What they\u2019re building isn\u2019t a business, he says. It\u2019s a revolution.This description could apply to any number of Silicon Valley executives. It also applies to       Ross William Ulbricht,        the founder of a notorious online black market called the Silk Road, which allowed customers to anonymously buy drugs and other illicit goods. Ulbricht bootstrapped the Silk Road from his bedroom into a billion-dollar criminal business; he is now serving a life sentence in federal prison. As       Nick Bilton       shows in \u201cAmerican Kingpin: The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road,\u201d Ulbricht does indeed fit the classic mold of the tech entrepreneur. He may have been a major narcotics trafficker, but he also belongs to the tradition of Zuckerberg and Musk and Jobs. And if it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that his particular form of entrepreneurship was highly illegal, Ulbricht might have become a celebrated sage of Silicon Valley, dispensing wisdom to graduating college students and feeding quotes to adoring journalists.The Silk Road had humble beginnings. At age 26, Ulbricht grew a crop of magic mushrooms and wanted to sell them. So in 2011 he created a website in a hidden portion of the internet known as the \u201cdark web,\u201d which requires special tools to access and offers its users a degree of anonymity. Customers would purchase the mushrooms with the \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d bitcoin\u2014which allows for pseudonymous, relatively private transactions\u2014and Ulbricht would send the goods through the mail.The experiment proved a success, and within months other sellers had joined the site, hawking everything from heroin to hash. After all, Ulbricht could sell only so many mushrooms: It was far more lucrative to let other people sell the drugs and take a percentage of each sale. The Silk Road became a \u201cplatform\u201d\u2014a marketplace that linked dealers and buyers, with an eBay-style rating system.By Nick Bilton  Portfolio, 328 pages, $27But playing the middleman brought difficulties of its own, especially as the site grew. Drug dealing is presumably a stressful profession, but running a global drug bazaar seems like a perpetual panic attack. Drawing on an impressive stockpile of research, Mr. Bilton documents Ulbricht\u2019s mental state in great detail, producing a portrait of a young man experiencing the heady mix of exhilaration and terror that accompanies becoming an immensely successful criminal. \u201cWhether you like it or not, I am the captain of this ship,\u201d he fumes when the site\u2019s merchants revolt against higher commissions on their sales. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the rules of the game, or you don\u2019t trust your captain, you can get off the boat.\u201dLike any startup founder, Ulbricht had to do a little bit of everything. In one moment, he\u2019s handling customer complaints and plugging security holes. In another, he\u2019s ordering the killing of an underling who betrayed him (or at least he thinks he is: none of the people he paid to have killed actually ended up dead.) He never slows down, and, in Mr. Bilton\u2019s telling, he has few doubts about the morality of what he\u2019s doing. His obstacles are technical, not ethical. A devout libertarian, Ulbricht is committed to the idea that anyone should be allowed to buy anything and doesn\u2019t hesitate when sellers start listing other kinds of contraband on the Silk Road. For Ulbricht, free exchange is holy, even if what is being exchanged is a handgun, a vial of cyanide or a human kidney. One suspects he would have let people buy and sell human beings on the Silk Road if they could figure out how to send human beings through the mail.Ulbricht left an enormous paper trail, both in the form of online conversations with his employees and his own detailed notes: It\u2019s rare for a criminal to spend so much time discussing and chronicling his own crimes. Perhaps it confirms certain clich\u00e9s about millennial self-absorption, or reflects a mode of narcissism cultivated by the contemporary internet, or says something more specific about Ulbricht. But in any case it was a boon to both the prosecutors, who used the material to strengthen their case, and to Mr. Bilton, who uses it to drive his story.Yet all of Ulbricht\u2019s crimes\u2014and much of Mr. Bilton\u2019s story\u2014took place online. This presents problems for a book that bills itself as a thriller and that probably aspires to be made into a film. Everything Ulbricht does, from disciplining his lieutenants to buying off a corrupt cop, occurs with him sitting in front of his computer. The filmmakers may find a way around this inconvenient fact, but in the book it tends to dull the suspense. Even the story of Tony Soprano would feel anticlimactic if the entirety of his criminal career took place within a laptop.Unlike Tony, however, Ross Ulbricht isn\u2019t a very interesting character. He is not merely unlikable but unremarkable. He is a young white male of enormous confidence and middling competence who loves       Ayn Rand       and can build a website. There are neighborhoods in San Francisco where a dozen Ulbrichts can be found on every street corner. The interesting question isn\u2019t who Ulbricht was but how he got as far as he did. A specific combination of technologies made the Silk Road possible\u2014particularly bitcoin, which debuted two years before the site launched, and Tor, a group of servers that provide a portal to the dark web. Mr. Bilton spends relatively little time discussing these technologies. He evidently concluded that these technicalities wouldn\u2019t hold the interest of the general reader, noting that the jury seemed bored when the prosecution discussed them in court.Without technology, however, the book feels incomplete. It\u2019s hard to understand how Ulbricht succeeded and what lessons his story holds for the future. The Silk Road has been shut down, but other sites have sprung up to take its place. Ulbricht may have disrupted the drug trade, but the War on Drugs remains wedged so deeply in the American body politic that no amount of libertarian disruption can dislodge it. And the next generation of Ulbrichts are inventing new tools and techniques, while an alphabet soup of law-enforcement agencies keep chasing them around the internet.Mr. Tarnoff is a founding editor of Logic, a new magazine about technology.Appeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dark-webs-dark-prince-1497307220", "news_title": "The Dark Web\u2019s Dark Prince", "keywords": "book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said Monday that the U.S. government can be funded through \u201cthe beginning of September\u201d and urged lawmakers to raise the federal borrowing limit before they leave for their summer recess.He reiterated remarks he made last week that if Congress doesn\u2019t raise the federal borrowing limit before August, Treasury has \u201cbackup plans\u201d to fund the government but didn\u2019t elaborate on what those plans entail.\u201cI want to make it clear that this is not the time frame that would create a serious problem,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cMarkets don\u2019t want us to wait. The sooner we do this, the better.\u201dAsked for more specifics on when the government will run out of cash to pay its bills, Mr. Mnuchin said he would prefer not to give a range at this time.Mixed messages and a dearth of details from the administration have led to confusion on Capitol Hill and in markets over when exactly Congress needs to lift the debt ceiling.Government debt hit Congress\u2019s self-imposed limit at nearly $20 trillion in mid-March. Since then, Treasury has been using extraordinary measures, such as redeeming certain investments in federal pensions programs and suspending new investments in those programs, to raise cash. Eventually, Treasury could exhaust those measures and run too low on cash to make all of its payments in full and on time unless the debt limit is raised and it can once again sell bonds.Mr. Mnuchin said failure to increase the debt ceiling would \u201cobviously create significant market disruption.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that we would get to a point where we don\u2019t raise it,\u201d he told a House panel.He also emphasized his preference that Congress increase the debt limit without conditions such as spending cuts or changes to the congressional budget process, and said the debt ceiling should not be a partisan issue.\u201cIt should be an acknowledgment that we have spent the money and need to fund the government,\u201d he said.This is the first time the Treasury secretary has said when he expects the government to run out of cash to pay the government\u2019s bills.Analysts had estimated that Treasury will run out of cash to meet its obligations some time in October or November, though             Wells Fargo                   economists said Monday it could happen as early as the first week or two of September.One uncertainty surrounding the forecasts is lower government revenues in recent months than previously expected. If the trend continues, it could cause Treasury to run out of room sooner, analysts have said.Lawmakers leave for their summer recess on July 28 and don\u2019t return to Capitol Hill until September 5.Mr. Mnuchin also suggested \u201cat some point in the future\u201d that Congress considers changing the timing of the debt-limit expiration so it matches the budgets process and \u201cwe don\u2019t have to deal with this in this format.\u201dWrite to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Mnuchin Urges Lift Of Debt Ceiling.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 18:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mnuchin-urges-congress-to-lift-debt-ceiling-before-august-recess-1497300895", "news_title": "Mnuchin Urges Congress to Lift Debt Ceiling Before August Recess", "keywords": "borrowing,cash conservation,debt ceiling,market,recess,u.s. treasury,U.S. government,Steven Mnuchin,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "General Electric Co.\u2019s        GE 0.19%       leadership reshuffle left the company\u2019s new chief with target annual pay of $5 million and a runner-up for the job with a shot at more than $7 million in GE shares if he sticks around for five years.John Flannery,        who on Monday was named GE\u2019s chief executive effective Aug. 1, will receive salary of $2 million and a target bonus of $3 million a year, according to a securities filing.

Monitor group OVD-Info put the figure for Moscow significantly higher, at more than 700 detained.The White House said Monday that the U.S. \u201cstrongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protesters throughout Russia.\u201cDetaining peace protesters, human rights observers and journalists is an affront to core democratic values,\u201d said press secretary       Sean Spicer,        calling on Moscow to release peaceful protesters.He added: \u201cThe Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve a government that supports an open marketplace of ideas, transparent and accountable governance, equal treatment under the law, and the ability to exercise their rights without fear or retribution.\u201dMr. Navalny, a 41-year-old anticorruption blogger, has energized Russia\u2019s weak and divided opposition with videos and blog posts that expose what he calls egregious examples of corruption at the top levels of the Russian state.He has spread his campaign for the presidency to cities across Russia in recent months, even though a conviction for embezzlement, which he calls politically motivated, may prevent him from running, and opinion polls show overwhelming support for 17-year Kremlin incumbent Mr. Putin.Police detained Mr. Navalny on Monday near the entrance to his home, his wife said in a message on his             Twitter.Mr. Navalny had received permission to stage a rally in Moscow, but he said Sunday he was switching the venue to the capital\u2019s main drag near the Kremlin, blaming authorities for pressuring companies into not providing equipment for a stage at the agreed location.The General Prosecutor\u2019s Office said that a protest in the new location would be illegal, and warned that police would take measures to prevent disorder. Late Monday, a court jailed Mr. Navalny for 30 days on a misdemeanor charge of repeated violation of the law on organizing public meetings, Interfax reported.Members of Mr. Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which uses the internet to appeal to young voters, said electricity at their office was cut and their streaming video stopped, before they moved to a backup that worked.Authorities had warned that people carrying placards or who appeared to be protesting would be detained. But thousands, many of them in their late teens and twenties, still came to Tverskaya Street in Moscow, where they swarmed around metal detectors that police had set up for Russia Day celebrations.People re-enacting events from Russia\u2019s history, including men in metal helmets and chain mail wielding wooden shields, mixed with crowds shouting, \u201cWe\u2019re in charge!\u201d and \u201cPutin\u2019s a thief!\u201d Police tried to hold protesters back at certain points, beating some with batons and dragging others from the crowd to waiting police vans.The geographical spread of the protests, including cities in Russia\u2019s far east, Siberia and Arctic north, represents rare progress for the opposition movement in tapping discontent outside Moscow and St. Petersburg, although attendance was largely modest.Numbers varied from city to city from dozens to hundreds to thousands. Russian state television largely ignored the demonstrations, instead covering official events including sports competitions, musical performances and the unfurling of a huge Russian flag by service members from the Ministry of Emergency Situations and children in red berets from a government-backed youth military group called Yunarmiya.Write to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Russia Police Detain Hundreds in Protests.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 17:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-detained-hours-before-anticorruption-rally-1497267741", "news_title": "Hundreds, Including Kremlin Critic Alexei Navalny, Detained Amid Russia Protests", "keywords": " alexei navalny, kremlin, moscow, moscow protests,navalny arrest, protests, putin,russia, vladimir putin,General Prosecutor's Office,Alexei Navalny,Vladimir Putin,blogging,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,crime,legal action,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,elections,social media"}, {"content": "The dollar edged lower Monday as investors await central-bank meetings later in the week.The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, slipped 0.1% to 88.44 The dollar fell against the euro and Japanese yen. but rose against the British pound.The key event for investors this week will be the Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day policy meeting, which concludes with a press conference on Wednesday.

The application was filed June 6 under the name of a Salt Lake City, Utah-based subsidiary called SoFi Bank.Fintech companies including SoFi have attracted billions of dollars in venture capital in recent years with a goal of taking business from banks and other big financial companies that lend money, transfer funds, offer insurance policies and manage customers\u2019 wealth. Many firms have opted to cut deals with banks and other financial institutions to handle the technical functions of those activities behind the scenes because of regulatory restrictions.Since its 2011 founding, SoFi has amassed a network of state licenses that it has used to make around $17 billion in student loans, unsecured personal loans and mortgages. But plans to provide its borrowers with a SoFi credit card and deposit account faced challenges because the company wasn\u2019t a bank.In a portion of the application reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, SoFi said it was seeking to establish an industrial bank chartered by the state of Utah to offer an FDIC-insured deposit account and a credit-card product.

The justices could act on the requests as soon as this week.White House press secretary       Sean Spicer       said the White House is reviewing Monday\u2019s decision. \u201cWe can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every tool at our disposal\u201d to prevent terrorists from entering the country, Mr. Spicer said. He said the administration is confident that the executive order is \u201cfully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the Supreme Court.\u201dThe ruling came in a case from Hawaii, where state officials and a local resident sued the president.\u201cI stated from the beginning that the president must act in a way that follows the laws and Constitution of the United States,\u201d Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said in a statement. \u201cOur system of checks and balances, enshrined in the Constitution for more than 225 years, remains in place.\u201dIn addition to barring the travel restrictions, the Ninth Circuit prohibited the president from moving forward with his plan to temporarily suspend the U.S. program for admitting refugees, based on similar reasoning. And it prevented Mr. Trump from implementing his plan to cap the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. annually at 50,000.The court, however, did narrow part of the Hawaii judge\u2019s earlier decision. The Ninth Circuit ruled the president could move forward with the section of his executive order that called for the federal government to review world-wide vetting procedures for visa applicants.Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez issued Monday\u2019s ruling. All three were appointed by President       Bill Clinton.Mr. Trump has said his planned restrictions are needed to address the national-security threats posed by potential terrorists. In a series of tweets last week, Mr. Trump called for a travel ban that is broader than the current executive order he signed and that the Justice Department has been defending in court.The order, signed March 6, temporarily bars U.S. entry for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It is a scaled-back version of a more ambitious effort that Mr. Trump pursued in January and dropped after courts issued rulings halting its implementation.The revised restrictions also have fared poorly in court, as judges have agreed with challengers that Mr. Trump\u2019s past statements about Muslims and his support for a so-called Muslim ban suggest his order unlawfully targeted people on the basis of religion.The Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling followed a somewhat different path of reasoning. The court didn\u2019t focus on the president\u2019s statements, including those from the campaign. And unlike some other notable recent court decisions, the Ninth Circuit didn\u2019t base its ruling on the Constitution\u2019s Establishment Clause, which bars the president from favoring or disfavoring particular religions.Instead, the court said Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order violated provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act that require him to offer sufficient support for his belief that allowing U.S. entry for people from the six countries would be detrimental to the national interest.\u201cThe order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,\u201d the appeals court said. \u201cNational security is not a talismanic incantation that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power.\u201dThe ruling said the order didn\u2019t provide \u201cany link between an individual\u2019s nationality and their propensity to commit terrorism or their inherent dangerousness.\u201dThe court also said the president\u2019s order didn\u2019t demonstrate that current U.S. screening procedures for travelers are inadequate. And it said Mr. Trump likely ran afoul of a provision in immigration law that prohibits discrimination in the visa process on the basis of nationality.The Ninth Circuit decision follows one from the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., on May 25 that rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to reinstate the travel ban. That appeals court affirmed an earlier ruling by a federal trial judge in Maryland.Those rulings, however, blocked only the travel restrictions, not the refugee restrictions or the government vetting study.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Travel Ban Suffers Another Legal Setback.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 17:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ninth-circuit-court-declines-to-reinstate-trump-travel-ban-1497287531", "news_title": "Ninth Circuit Court Declines to Reinstate Trump Travel Ban", "keywords": " donald trump, immigration, immigration ban, muslim,ninth circuit court, president trump,travel ban, trump travel ban,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch"}, {"content": "ANCUD, Chile\u2014On a recent day in this remote island town,       Dr. Jhomar Yansen       rushed to operate on a man who had been kicked in the gut by a sheep and was suffering severe internal bleeding.The surgeon worked in his native Venezuela saving patients with gunshot and knife wounds until last year, when he fled the chaotic, impoverished country like thousands of other professionals.

I didn\u2019t want my daughter to grow up in such a hostile environment.\u201dNearly 2 million Venezuelans have fled their country since the late strongman       Hugo Ch\u00e1vez       took office in 1999 and put his country on the path to socialist revolution, according to       Tom\u00e1s P\u00e1ez,        a sociologist at Venezuela\u2019s Central University who wrote a book on the diaspora.The numbers have accelerated since President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro       took over in 2013, Mr. P\u00e1ez said, with businessmen, university professors, farmers and oil workers abandoning a country riven by authoritarian rule and protests. Venezuelans are flooding particularly into neighboring Colombia and Brazil. They have boarded boats bound for Caribbean islands. In the U.S., their asylum requests have surged, while the sight of them selling cornmeal cakes known as arepas has become a commonplace in the Peruvian capital, Lima.The exodus of doctors is exacerbating the already serious strain on Venezuela\u2019s once-vaunted public-health system, which has been crippled by dilapidated hospitals and shortages of medicine, supplies and equipment. Figures released last month by the country\u2019s health ministry showed maternal mortality there increased by 66% last year; infant mortality, which rose by 30% last year, is now higher in Venezuela than in war-torn Syria. Malaria and diphtheria rates are soaring amid shortages of insect repellents, vaccinations, and public-health funding.The Venezuelan Federation of Doctors estimates that some 16,000 doctors have left in 12 years, moving as far away as Spain and Australia.\u201cIf this wave of migration of doctors to other countries continues, a moment is going to arrive\u2026when they aren\u2019t going to have enough capacity to run hospitals,\u201d said       Juan Correa,        the federation\u2019s vice president. Calls to Venezuelan health authorities seeking comment weren\u2019t returned.Venezuela\u2019s loss is helping places like Ancud on Chilo\u00e9, a tranquil island of green rolling hills, Humboldt penguins and wooden churches located 760 miles south of Santiago\u2014and a world away from Venezuela\u2019s strife.\u201cWe\u2019ve had, I would say, a blessing with doctors of such good technical quality,\u201d said       Luis Hern\u00e1n Vallejos,        a Chilean physician who runs the Ancud hospital\u2019s emergency unit.Venezuelans have arrived to Chile in droves, attracted to the political stability in Latin America\u2019s most developed nation. Last year, nearly 23,000 Venezuelans received visas, up from 439 in 2006, with recent arrivals including many young, well-educated professionals, according to the head of Chile\u2019s immigration office,       Rodrigo Sandoval.\u201cChile is kind of this California of the south,\u201d said       Cristi\u00e1n Do\u00f1a,        an immigration expert at the Diego Portales University in Santiago, referring to this country\u2019s appeal to South American migrants.Last year, 1,313 Venezuela-educated physicians, more than any other foreign group, took a test to work in Chile\u2019s public-health system, up from just 16 in 2011, according to exam administrators. Most took jobs in areas that have an acute shortage of physicians, said       Juan Carlos Riera,        a urologist who created an association of Venezuelan doctors in Chile.Many more could arrive. In 2016, 88% of medical students in their final year at four Venezuelan universities said they hoped to emigrate after graduation, according to research by       Iv\u00e1n de la Vega,        a Venezuelan sociologist.Mario Castro, the first Venezuelan physician to settle in Ancud, fled with his family in late 2015 after a friend was kidnapped and a neighbor\u2019s car was stolen with her baby in the back seat.\u201cIn no way did I want my son to grow up in an environment with so much violence,\u201d the fertility expert said.In the last 18 months, about a dozen other Venezuelan doctors\u2014including surgeons, gynecologists, and anesthesiologists\u2014have found work in Ancud\u2019s small 72-bed hospital.The physicians recently saved a baby through an emergency caesarean section and operated on a man\u2019s deeply cut forearm and wrist to avoid amputation.       Ang\u00e9lica Vel\u00e1squez,        a 25-year-old woman Dr. Castro treated for difficulties conceiving a child, recently gave birth to twins.\u201cI\u2019ve had an excellent experience,\u201d she said. \u201cHis knowledge can help a lot of women like me.\u201dThese Venezuelan exiles from a Caribbean climate have adjusted to the Chilean island\u2019s cold nights by learning to split firewood to heat their houses.

But Friday\u2019s pullback in technology stocks bears closer attention than usual, coming out of the blue and, unusually, not being part of a wider selloff.The fall was small in absolute terms, but it looks huge compared with everything else. The S&P 500 tech sector has had only two worse days relative to the wider market since the dot-com bear market ended in 2003. One was amid the post-Lehman carnage in October 2008, the other after the market began its credit-crunch-induced descent in late 2007. These are not good precedents for investors.Investors should be cautious about reading too much into one or two days\u2019 moves.             Nvidia Corp.      , the graphics card maker that has become the picks-and-shovels supplier to the gold rush in artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, had a hard time, dropping 6.5% on Friday and another 5% on Monday morning before a partial rebound.             Facebook Inc.,Amazon.com Inc.,Alphabet Inc.       and             Apple Inc.       were down more than 3% on Friday and fell again on Monday. But the wider Nasdaq-100 index, dominated by technology, was off only 2.4% on Friday and 0.6% on Monday. Even Nvidia\u2019s Friday drop wasn\u2019t its worst day this year. This will probably turn out to be merely a small correction to the phenomenal run-up in tech stocks this year.Yet, there are both short-term and long-term reasons to worry about tech. In the short term, the fall was an example of what happens when shares lose momentum. When shareholders buy stocks just because they\u2019re going up, any interruption can be brutal.The tech sector has also become universally popular, suggesting the shares have become a crowded trade.             Goldman Sachs                   Group Inc. analysts even point out that the biggest tech stocks\u2014the \u201cFAAMGs\u201d of Facebook, Apple, Amazon,             Microsoft Corp.       and Alphabet (Google)\u2014have appeal to investors who buy into low volatility, after recording lower volatility than any market sector in the past six months. They already qualified for those who screen shares for momentum and earnings growth. When popular trades go out of fashion, they often do so suddenly.Yet, tech stocks aren\u2019t repeating the dot-com bubble of 2000. It\u2019s true that before its drop on Friday, the S&P tech sector came within 0.1% of breaking its dot-com high for the first time. But unlike 2000, many of today\u2019s tech stocks are well established and run highly profitable oligopolies.In the long term, the danger is that hubris in the boardrooms of tech companies will lead them to fritter away shareholder cash as they set out on a landgrab of new technologies away from their core expertise.Apple has put the \u201chub\u201d in hubris with its flashy new wheel-shaped headquarters. Some of the maddest projects have been put on ice\u2014Apple\u2019s plan to diversify from mobile phones into electric cars or Google\u2019s internet provision via solar-powered drones\u2014but plenty of \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects remain.Some of these moonshots will surely pay off, but investors would be wise to wonder about the core expertise of some of the companies in which they\u2019re buying shares. Are they high-margin oligopolies in social media, mobile phones and operating systems? Or are they generic technology incubation operations able to turn wacky ideas into new business models? Treating them as safe, low-volatility stocks implies the former, but that isn\u2019t compatible with their cash generation being plowed back into high-growth moonshots.Worsening this risk is the lack of effective controls on the powerful founders of many of the big tech companies. History has shown time and again that executives without effective checks and balances waste company cash on poorly thought out or overly expensive vanity projects, and founders of several of the biggest tech businesses have kept control of their companies through special share classes.       Mark Zuckerberg       still controls 60% of Facebook votes, co-founders       Larry Page       and       Sergey Brin       control 51% of Alphabet votes, and Snap Inc.\u2019s IPO this year gave buyers of its shares zero votes.There are other risks. New tech eventually disrupts old tech; could a new approach to social media send Facebook the way of Myspace, or a new phone style leave Apple looking like             Nokia Corp.      ? Hard to imagine, but so was the invention of the iPhone. Staff shortages are bidding up costs rapidly, as Silicon Valley competes with itself and Wall Street for the best computer-science graduates. There\u2019s also a danger that governments, particularly in Europe, get serious about their tax, antitrust or encryption concerns.All these are for the future; for now, worry about a crowded trade quickly becoming much less crowded.Write to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Hot Sector + Crowded Trade = Danger.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 17:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-stocks-profitable-innovative-and-a-danger-to-your-portfolio-1497282800", "news_title": "Tech Stocks: Profitable, Innovative and a Danger to Your Portfolio ", "keywords": " alphabet, amazon,apple, facebook, google, microsoft, nvidia,s&p 500,silicon valley , stock market, stocks, streetwise, technology, technology stocks,tech stocks,Amazon.com,AMZN,Microsoft,MSFT,Nokia,NOK,Nvidia,NVDA,Facebook,FB,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Apple,AAPL,Mark Zuckerberg,Sergey Brin,Larry Page,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,routine market,financial news,semiconductors,e-commerce,industrial electronics,industrial goods,internet,online,integrated circuits,technology,audio,video,graphics integrated circuits"}, {"content": "Iowa officials are seeking federal permission to implement a plan that would alter major aspects of the Affordable Care Act in the state, \u200bin what could be a key test of the ability to modify the health law through executive authority.Trump administration officials said they were open to supporting the Iowa proposal to the extent possible under the current health law. A White House official said the administration welcomed suggestions from the states to tweak the workings of the ACA within their borders, and officials \u201cwant to get to \u2018yes\u2019 with states.\u201dThe Iowa proposal, which would offer one type of insurance plan and revamp the law\u2019s subsidies that help people buy coverage, among other changes, would be in effect for 2018, though it could be extended.Iowa Insurance Commissioner       Doug Ommen,        a Republican, said the state must take emergency action to ensure that about 72,000 Iowans who have ACA plans aren\u2019t left without coverage options next year, after insurers said they would pull out. The proposal was meant as a stopgap measure, Mr. Ommen said, as Republicans in Congress work to pass a bill that would make significant changes to the law at a national level.Iowa\u2019s gambit will get notice from around the country, experts said, and if approved could provide a model for state officials who want to make changes to the ACA, particularly if efforts to overhaul, or tweak, the health law remain stalled at the federal level. The Iowa plan has some elements that go in directions similar to the health bill that passed the Republican House, though it has notable differences as well.More states are facing potentially big problems with their insurance exchanges, as insurers announce plans to pull back next year. About 45 counties across three state\u2014Missouri, Ohio and Washington\u2014are poised to be without any products available through their insurance marketplaces in 2018. Other states, including Alaska, are seeking federal waivers for programs to bolster their markets, but the Iowa proposal is more sweeping.Still, the Iowa effort faces significant challenges\u2014including questions about whether       Mr. Trump\u2019s       administration has the authority to approve all aspects of it under the law. The White House official said the administration is\u00a0\u201copen to maximizing opportunities\u201d for states\u2019 proposals under the law, but \u201cwe\u2019re not going to stretch the law.\u201dIowa officials believe the federal government has flexibility to approve the plan, which aims to steady the Iowa individual insurance market, Mr. Ommen said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a stable market, no one has insurance,\u201d he said.Iowa\u2019s largest insurer, Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, says it will reverse its plans to exit from the state\u2019s individual market and will sell plans in every county next year if the new proposal goes into effect.President Donald Trump and other administration officials have sought to highlight insurance-market problems\u2014including Iowa\u2019s\u2014in their bid to push GOP health-care legislation through the Senate. Democrats have said Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is exacerbating strains on the insurance marketplaces by threatening to stop certain federal ACA payments that insurers said are vital.But there is also pressure on Mr. Trump\u2019s administration to ensure the\u00a0individual insurance markets don\u2019t implode.\u00a0Even if Republican legislation is signed, it likely wouldn\u2019t take effect in time to change insurance markets in 2018.\u00a0White House officials said they have worked behind the scenes for months with insurers to discuss their options, including answering questions and encouraging them to continue to offer coverage in some cases.The Iowa proposal would change important features of the federal health law. The ACA subsidies that enable lower-income people to buy health insurance would become flat payments tied to age and income\u2014the House GOP health bill also had flat payments, though allotted differently. The plan streamlines the insurance plans now sold under the law to one design at the ACA\u2019s most popular \u201csilver\u201d tier of coverage. Consumers would purchase the plans outside the insurance exchange created by the law.Consumers would still be able to buy 2018 plans during this fall\u2019s open enrollment period, but to purchase them after Jan. 1 they would need to show they had maintained continuous coverage, with no gap longer than 63 days in the previous 12 months. That restriction aims to prevent people from signing up only when they have medical needs, Mr. Ommen said. The law\u2019s mandated essential benefits would stay in place, as would protections that ban insurers from setting premiums or denying coverage based on consumers\u2019 pre-existing health conditions. A new reinsurance program would limit insurers\u2019 costs for the most-expensive enrollees.Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield had said in early April that it would stop selling ACA plans in Iowa after losses. CEO John Forsyth said the insurer believed the current market wasn\u2019t sustainable but wanted to help develop changes that would improve it.Wellmark needs an answer by late August to be ready for open enrollment in the fall, Mr. Forsyth said.\u201cWe\u2019re confident there will be something in 2018, but we can\u2019t guarantee anything\u201d until the state gets the federal signoff, he said.Mr. Forsyth said he and other Iowa officials met last Wednesday with leaders of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, including its head,       Seema Verma,        and got encouraging signals. A CMS spokeswoman said the agency can\u2019t comment until a final decision is made\u00a0on the state\u2019s proposal.A spokesman for Medica, another ACA insurer that has said it may pull out of Iowa next year, said, \u201cWe are familiar with the proposal and appreciate [the Iowa Insurance Division] working with interested carriers for input.\u201dAetna Inc.,       which is exiting Iowa\u2019s exchange next year, said the proposal wouldn\u2019t change its plans. A spokeswoman for Gundersen Health Plan, which has a small Iowa ACA footprint, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Legal experts said federal officials might lack the authority under the law to approve the Iowa proposal. The law includes a waiver program that allows for federal subsidy money to be redirected under a state plan, but the program has specific requirements and it is far from clear whether the Iowa proposal could meet them, said\u00a0      Timothy S.\u00a0Jost,        an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to imagine how this could be legal,\u201d he said.The Iowa program may also pose challenges to some older and lower-income ACA enrollees, compared with the current law\u2019s setup, due to how the Iowa subsidies would work, said\u00a0      Larry\u00a0Levitt,        a senior vice president at the\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThere may be some winners and losers from this,\u201d he said, but \u201cit sounds like an important proactive effort\u00a0from the state to preserve coverage for people.\u201dMr. Ommen said the plan \u201cis not a perfect solution,\u201d but \u201cour view is this is the only option we have to preserve our market.\u201dWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Iowa Seeks to Rework Health Law.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 17:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iowa-seeks-to-revamp-affordable-care-act-1497276180", "news_title": "Iowa Seeks to Revamp Affordable Care Act", "keywords": " aca, affordable care act, health insurance, insurance exchanges, iowa,obamacare,Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield,Aetna,AET,Doug Ommen,John Forsyth,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,health care policy,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,heavy construction,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,construction,real estate,financial services"}, {"content": "Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d has neared all-time lows this year. That hasn\u2019t stopped retail investor Jason Miller from making a nice chunk of change betting it will go even lower.The Boca Raton, Fla., day trader says he has made $53,000 since the start of the year by effectively shorting the         CBOE               Volatility Index, nicknamed the VIX. That includes a white-knuckle day on May 17, when the VIX spiked 46% following reports that President       Donald Trump       had pressured former FBI Director       James Comey       to drop an investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.As the 40-year-old Mr. Miller recalls, he rode out the storm, confident the market would revert to its torpid ways\u2014which it did. \u201cOne person\u2019s fear is another person\u2019s opportunity,\u201d says Mr. Miller.Volatility\u2014or the lack of it\u2014has become the central obsession of the markets as the S&P 500 trades around its all-time high. Invented 24 years ago as a way to warn investors of an imminent crash, the VIX has morphed into a giant casino of its own.Volatility trading has wormed its way into many corners of the investing universe, including insurance products that guarantee retirement income and mutual funds that try to avoid the worst declines. Once the obscure province of academics and derivatives experts, volatility is now traded by would-be retirees alongside the most sophisticated hedge funds in the world.Even investors who have never heard of the VIX are exposed to its gyrations. There\u2019s an estimated $200 billion in so-called \u201cvolatility control\u201d funds that use the VIX to decide whether to buy or sell stocks. \u201cTail risk\u201d strategies, designed to steer clear of sudden slumps, often rely on it. Pensions such as the San Bernardino County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association have profited from bets the VIX would fall. Asset managers including AllianceBernstein incorporate volatility into retirement-date savings funds, adjusting stock exposure based on the severity of market swings. And insurance giant         AIG               sells annuities with fees that rise along with the VIX.Lately, the VIX has been signaling a near-complete absence of fear, and the preternatural calm is making some people nervous. Opinion is divided on whether it is a bullish signal for stocks or a worrying sign of complacency. After all, the VIX also approached a record low in early 2007, just before the subprime crisis began unspooling. In recent days the VIX nudged higher, rising more than 10%, as technology stocks fell.Some analysts see low volatility as a sign of increased efficiency, where shocks are more quickly absorbed by the markets. Others credit the growth of passive investing with overriding the herd mentality that exacerbates panicked selling. And yet another theory claims VIX trading itself has smoothed the market\u2019s jagged edges by allowing traders to easily offset risks.Whatever the reason, becalmed stock markets have become a feature of the postcrisis world. Central bankers have lulled investors with record-low interest rates and flooded the market with cash. Even though the Federal Reserve is slowly withdrawing those supports, stocks have lost none of their appeal, notching new highs despite U.S. political turmoil.This leads to the VIX paradox: The lack of fear scares some investors who say bloated stock prices portend a painful reckoning when monetary policy tightens.\u201cThey\u2019re not adding to market stability. They\u2019re just building a bigger bomb,\u201d says Tom Chadwick, a New Hampshire financial adviser who uses VIX options to help protect his clients\u2019 portfolios from downturns. He says the Fed\u2019s policies have kept volatility artificially low for so long that the speed of any reversal will be more severe. \u201cWhen this goes, you\u2019re going to see the mushroom cloud from Saturn.\u201dThe VIX was conceived after the Black Monday crash in 1987, when the market fell 23% in a single day. The measure used stock-market bets, known as options, to gauge expectations for the speed and severity of market moves, or what traders call volatility. Options prices rise and fall based on the perceived odds of a payoff, akin to the way home insurance costs more on a hurricane-plagued coast than in an untroubled inland suburb.Unlike home insurance, options prices fluctuate constantly as traders react to news and reassess their risks. Those prices feed into the VIX. The CBOE launched the original index in 1993, and it quickly became a staple of the financial press.It took Wall Street another decade to figure out the VIX wasn\u2019t just a market weather vane but a potential gold mine. In the summer of 2002, newly minted billionaire Mark Cuban called         Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       looking for a way to protect his fortune from a crash. Because the VIX typically rises when stocks fall, he wanted to use it as insurance. But there was no way to trade it.Devesh Shah, the Goldman trader who fielded the call, says he instead offered him an arcane derivative called a \u201cvariance swap,\u201d but Mr. Cuban wasn\u2019t interested.Lamenting the lost opportunity, Mr. Shah met up with Sandy Rattray, a Goldman colleague and erstwhile indexing buff with a knack for packaging investment products. What if, the pair speculated, they could tap the VIX brand and reformulate the index based on their esoteric swaps?\u201cThe world wanted to drink         Coca-Cola,      \u201d says Mr. Shah, who retired from Goldman as a partner in 2011. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want the white label.\u201dThese were the heady days after financial deregulation, and Wall Street was busily securitizing everything from weather reports to bundles of sliced-and-diced mortgages. Turning the VIX into something tradable was nothing more than a math problem, says Mr. Rattray.The pair rewrote the VIX formula, expanding it to a larger universe of stock-market bets and making it possible to create a tradable futures contract. Their equation synthesizes thousands of trades and distills them all into a single number meant to represent the collective expectations for the market. When the VIX is at its current level of around 10, it implies that traders believe the S&P 500 will move by an average of less than 1% a day during the next 30 days.The more stocks move, the higher the VIX goes. Since the market typically falls much more sharply than it rises, the VIX tends to surge when the market crashes\u2014hence its potential as insurance.Messrs. Shah and Rattray handed their invention to CBOE Holdings Inc., the owner of the VIX trademark. Neither had any idea that their brainchild would transform the markets for years to come.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how big it would be,\u201d says Mr. Rattray, who is now the chief investment officer for Man Group PLC, an $89 billion hedge fund.The formula allowed the CBOE to cash in its marquee index. The exchange launched VIX futures in 2004, and VIX options two years later. The firm billed VIX trading as a new risk-management tool, banking on the same appeal that had drawn Mr. Cuban. Trading grew steadily, but slowly.Then the financial crisis hit, serving up a huge marketing opportunity. Amid an economic tailspin akin to the Great Depression, surging unemployment, and more than $5 trillion erased from the S&P 500, the only thing rising in the U.S. was the VIX, which topped 80 in late 2008. Who wouldn\u2019t pay just a little bit more to protect their nest egg from the wipeout?At         Barclays               PLC, a farsighted few realized access was a big problem. Trading futures and options was too complicated and costly for many investors. The bank instead devised a product that tracks VIX contracts but trades on an exchange just like any a corporate stock. Suddenly anyone with a brokerage account could trade like the pros. The Barclays iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN launched in January 2009, just months before the S&P 500 hit a 12-year low.VIX trading exploded. Terrified investors piled into Barclays\u2019s new product and similar ones that followed, desperate for anything that might help them repair their dented fortunes. \u201cI think of it as the great democratization of volatility,\u201d says       Bill Speth,        vice president of research and product development at CBOE. \u201cInvestors who never would have opened a futures account or traded an option could and did trade these exchange-traded products.\u201dAmid the panic, investors were willing to pay to insure their portfolios. The costs would be a drag in bull markets, but looked like a small price to pay in the immediate wake of the crisis.\u201cIt was the Wild West,\u201d says Bill Luby, who quit a 20-year consulting career in 2005 to become a full-time trader. \u201cIf you knew the landscape, there was a lot of money to be made.\u201dTrading the VIX, however, is a lot different from watching it on TV, and its idiosyncrasies left some investors feeling burned. No trading strategy can exactly replicate the VIX index, and traders rely on proxies like futures and options, which can veer widely from the VIX itself.VIX exchange-traded products are especially susceptible to this divergence because of the peculiar structure of VIX futures. Uncertainty increases with time, and the further away an anticipated downturn is, the more expensive it is to insure against. That means VIX futures for this month are typically less expensive than next month\u2019s contracts, which are less expensive than the month after that, and so on.Some of the most popular exchange-traded products invest in a combination of this month\u2019s VIX futures and next month\u2019s. To maintain their exposure, they sell the contracts that are nearing expiration and buy contracts for the following month. Put simply, they buy high and sell low almost every day, steadily bleeding money. A share of the original Barclays product, bought at its January 2009 debut, would be nearly worthless today.This decay is difficult to comprehend, even for sophisticated investors, and leveraged funds can compound those losses. Market experts say the products are designed for short-term tactical trading, not long-term passive investment.When the VIX dipped in September,       Larry Tabb,        founder and research chairman of the Tabb Group, a consulting firm, thought volatility would rise and bought an exchange-traded product that aims to double the daily gain of VIX futures. And even though the VIX rose 28% in October, the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN lost money.\u201cIt just kept going down and down and down,\u201d says Mr. Tabb, who blames himself for not reading up on its mechanics before buying. \u201cI got completely screwed.\u201dJanus Henderson Group               PLC, owner of VelocityShares, declined to comment.The flip side of the punishing decay favors short sellers, allowing them to profit when volatility is flat and sometimes even when it rises. Instead of buying insurance, selling it became the new hot trade. Traders like Mr. Miller see spikes in volatility\u2014such as those ahead of the U.S. presidential election\u2014 as opportunities to bet that the VIX will quickly collapse again.Such bets have paid off in the past year as market shocks proved fleeting. The ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF that, like Mr. Miller, shorts the VIX, is up 70% this year. Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy for Macro Risk Advisors, estimates that traders and investors now have a near-record $512 million at stake for every single-point move in VIX futures.In a twist, the very funds that are meant to protect against volatility may make any correction worse, says Rocky Fishman, an equity-derivative strategist with         Deutsche Bank.       So-called \u201cvolatility control\u201d funds aim to provide investors with a smoother ride by sidestepping the worst dips. A rising VIX signals the funds to shed stocks in favor of safer assets, accelerating the selloff and spooking other investors into joining the exodus.Rising volatility triggered $50 billion in stock selling during the market gyrations of August 2015, and $25 billion in the wake of the U.K.\u2019s surprise vote to exit the European Union last year, according to Mr. Fishman. \u201cIt\u2019s a feedback loop that can make selloffs unfold faster,\u201d says Mr. Fishman. \u201cThere are fund managers whose job it is to sell equities when volatility goes up. And that affects everyone.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   The VIX was conceived after the Black Monday crash in 1987, when the market fell 23% in a single day. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that the market fell 26%. Also, Larry Tabb is the founder and research chairman of the Tabb Group. An earlier version incorrectly identified him as founder and president.

They were acquired with \u00a377 million ($98 million) which financier Jho Low got from a Malaysian state fund called 1Malaysia Development Bhd., or 1MDB, the U.S. Department of Justice said in court documents filed June 7 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.Mr. Low, a flamboyant Malaysian deal maker, is a\u00a0central figure in an alleged plot to siphon billions of dollars from the fund, according to the Justice Department. The London properties are the latest in a string of homes, art and other assets scattered around the world to be targeted for seizure by the U.S. The Justice Department has previously identified van Gogh and Monet paintings, and luxury real estate in New York, Los Angeles and London, allegedly bought with money stolen from 1MDB.\u201cLow acquired an interest in the Stratton penthouse and the Stratton flat using 1MDB proceeds,\u201d the Justice Department, which has been working with U.K. authorities, said in the filings. \u201cLow used funds traceable to misappropriated 1MDB proceeds to purchase the Stratton office.\u201d The Justice Department said in the filings it is seeking the forfeiture of the properties in London because they were \u201cderived from violations of U.S. law\u201d and were involved with money-laundering offenses.The office, acquired for \u00a342 million in 2014, was the headquarters for Myla, a U.K. lingerie company which Mr. Low also acquired with funds traceable to 1MDB, the Justice Department said in its lawsuits. Mr. Low resigned as a director of Myla in November, according to the Companies House business registry. Myla lost \u00a37.59 million in 2015, the latest available figures. A spokesman for Myla couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.1MDB was set up by Malaysian Prime Minister       Najib Razak,        whose stepson is described as a friend of Mr. Low in court documents.\u00a0Mr. Najib received more than $1 billion in his personal bank accounts\u2014including more than $800 million originating with the state fund\u2014via a network of offshore funds and accounts controlled by Mr. Low and his associates, according to Malaysian investigation documents viewed by the Journal and to people familiar with the U.S. investigation.The 1MDB scandal\u00a0unfolded when the Malaysian fund, which had run up a multibillion-dollar debt to finance development but had little to show for it, began struggling to repay. Later, billions of dollars were found to be missing. Investigations in search of the money sprang up in six countries.The\u00a0U.S. asset-seizure suits\u00a0refer to a \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d who allegedly received hundreds of millions of dollars siphoned from 1MDB. \u201cMalaysian Official 1\u201d refers to Mr. Najib, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation.Mr. Najib and 1MDB have denied wrongdoing and promised to cooperate with investigations. Mr. Najib has been cleared by the Malaysian attorney general, who has said the funds that went into Mr. Najib\u2019s account were a legal political donation from Saudi Arabia and that most of the money was returned.Mr. Low, whose full name is Low Taek Jho, and his lawyers didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment Monday. In the past, Mr. Low has told news organizations he was the victim of political infighting in Malaysia and was only an informal adviser to 1MDB. Lawyers for Mr. Low\u2019s family have said they would contest the U.S. asset-seizure lawsuits.In 2010, Mr. Low wired about \u00a335 million to a             Royal Bank of Scotland Group                   PLC account in London named \u201cMacfarlanes LLP Client Account Number 1,\u201d according to the most recent legal filings.

In a superb, sharply etched production, created for its U.K. world premiere by the opera\u2019s lead commissioner, Music Theatre Wales, and directed by MTW\u2019s artistic director,       Michael McCarthy,        this dark comedy revolves around Josef K., who is arrested on the morning of his 30th birthday. His crime is never specified, and no one prevents him from continuing his life as before, but every step he takes in his struggle to defend himself or to understand his plight is futile.Mr. Glass and his librettist,       Christopher Hampton,        created a sung play in which the motoric music puts the text on an infernal merry-go-round from which K. cannot get off. The listener thus absorbs the inevitability of K.\u2019s fate. Visually, we are in a world of clowns and pretense:       Simon Banham\u2019s       designs allude to Charlie Chaplin and Samuel Beckett with white pancake makeup, bowler hats and obviously fake shaggy beards (seven of the eight singers play multiple roles, switching in view of the audience). It is all ominous too: Characters who are not participating in scenes are watching, and everybody seems to know more about what is happening to K. than he does.Theo Hoffman\u2019s       plangent baritone made K.\u2019s struggles all the more poignant and increasingly hopeless. The bright-voiced tenor       Joshua Blue       brought physical comedy to his absurdist portrayals of Franz, one of K.\u2019s guards, and Block, a pathetic defendant. The women in the story are blatant seducers and sex objects, and Sofia Selowsky and       Susannah Biller       had fun with that;       Keith Phares,       Brenton Ryan,       Robert Mellon       and       Matthew Lau       completed the excellent young cast.       Carolyn Kuan       was the acute conductor.Ricky Ian Gordon\u2019s       \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d based on       John Steinbeck\u2019s       massive novel about the Joads, who flee the Dust Bowl in the 1930s for the supposed Promised Land of California, also has contemporary resonance in an era newly perplexed over the fate of refugees. The lengthy, three-act piece, with libretto by       Michael Korie,        had its premiere at the Minnesota Opera in 2007; for OTSL Messrs. Gordon and Korie created a new version, trimming 50 minutes from the score to bring it to just under three hours with one intermission.\u201cGrapes\u201d is now tighter and more focused, but Mr. Korie\u2019s earnest text and Mr. Gordon\u2019s music still don\u2019t carry the weight of the story. The episodic, music-theater-like structure seems to demand something like \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d with power ballads and defiant choruses, or, alternatively, a Brecht-Weill edge. Instead, wan tunes (faintly recalling Copland and Barber) alternate with jaunty Gershwin-like moments, and the ensembles stall. Most of the numbers still feel too long, apart from a few showstoppers\u2014the matriarch Ma Joad\u2019s aria about the things left behind; the lapsed preacher       Jim Casy\u2019s       bleak funeral words for Grandpa, the first of the caravan to die. This harsh tale of attrition\u201413 start the journey, five remain at the end\u2014needed a tougher spine.Standouts in the enormous cast included tenor       Geoffrey Agpalo,        who sold Casy\u2019s arias with conviction; baritone       Tobias Greenhalgh,        ruggedly determined as Tom Joad; and       Deanna Breiwick,        sweet-toned as Tom\u2019s pregnant sister, Rosasharn.       Katharine Goeldner\u2019s       solid lower register communicated Ma Joad\u2019s implacable will; her voice was patchy as it got higher.       Christopher Allen       was the capable conductor.James Robinson\u2019s       production, with sets by       Allen Moyer,        cleverly captured the makeshift nature of these people\u2019s lives, and suggested a play within a play, with Tom Joad telling the story of the migration. It began with the chorus crowded at long tables in a soup kitchen under the Bible text \u201cJesus said, if any man thirst, let him come to me,\u201d ironic in the circumstances. Chairs and tables were swiftly repurposed, creating the truck that carries the family westward and the Hooverville where they land.       James Schuette\u2019s       costumes eerily evoked the bleak Dorothea Lange photos of the period.OTSL had mixed results with       Mozart\u2019s       \u201cLa Clemenza di Tito,\u201d sung in an appealing English translation by       Daniel Dooner.       Tenor       Ren\u00e9 Barbera       brought focused power to the role of the Emperor Tito, whose much-vaunted generosity of spirit is tested when his friend Sesto attempts to assassinate him. But mezzo       Cecelia Hall       (Sesto) and soprano Laura Wilde (Vitellia, the jealous instigator of the plot) failed to shape their lengthy arias in ways that captured their characters\u2019 psychological complexity and the urgency of their desires. Everything, including the orchestra under       Stephen Lord,        felt too slow and deliberate. The minimalist, static production, directed by       Stephen Lawless       and designed by       Leslie Travers,        featured the head, wings and claws of a gigantic Roman eagle that loomed over the empty stage, crashed to the ground, and then rose again. The 18th-century costumes suggested Tito\u2019s Enlightenment principles; the electric chair brought out for Sesto was a jarringly obvious touch.\u2014Ms. Waleson writes about opera for the Journal.Appeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Dystopia and the Dust Bowl.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 17:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dystopia-and-the-dust-bowl-1497302416", "news_title": "Dystopia and the Dust Bowl ", "keywords": "arts in review, grapes of wrath, john steinbeck, kafka, la clemenza di tito, mozart,opera, opera theatre of saint louis, philip glass, the trial,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,theater,reviews"}, {"content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va.\u2014Virginia\u2019s Democrats\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0will be the first in the country to decide whether their party should choose a strident anti-Trump candidate over one pledging to work with elected Republicans.Former Rep. Tom Perriello is betting opposition to President Donald Trump will be the biggest factor motivating voters in\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0Democratic primary for governor. His opponent, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, is pitching himself as an experienced, steady hand who brings working relationships with Republicans who control the state legislature.With dozens of Democratic primary contests looming in 2018 House and governor\u2019s races, the Virginia contest will serve as the first indication of whether new liberal groups energized by their opposition to the new president can win intraparty contests against the Democratic establishment.And while Democratic congressional candidates such as       Jon Ossoff       in Georgia and       Rob Quist       in Montana raised millions of dollars for their special elections this year from liberal donors motivated by Mr. Trump, neither faced a significant primary challenge nor did they center their campaign around opposing the president.\u201cIt is a test as much for these new movements as for the Democratic Party about whether the energy\u2026will translate into political power at the ballot box,\u201d Mr. Perriello said\u00a0Monday\u00a0in an interview. \u201cWill some of this resistance energy translate into political energy?\u201dMr. Northam is backed by Gov.       Terry McAuliffe,        who is barred by Virginia law from seeking a second consecutive term, the state\u2019s two Democratic senators, its attorney general and every Democrat elected to the Virginia General Assembly. He has raised $7 million to Mr. Perriello\u2019s $4 million and has more than twice as many campaign contributors.Mr. Perriello, a one-term congressman defeated in the 2010 Tea Party wave, has support from Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. He launched his campaign in January promising to be a \u201cfirewall\u201d against Mr. Trump, while Mr. Northam has spent years soliciting and racking up support across the state. Mr. Perriello\u2019s television ads compare Mr. Trump to \u201cauthoritarians overseas\u201d he confronted while working in the State Department during the Obama administration.Mr. Northam has tried to ride the anti-Trump energy while also touting his experience in state government. In a TV ad, he diagnosed the president as a \u201cnarcissistic maniac.\u201d\u201cMost people agree that he\u2019s a dangerous man and we\u2019ve got to have someone in Virginia who will stand up to his recklessness and hatred,\u201d Mr. Northam said in an interview Monday. \u201cVirginians are looking for a leader who has experience and has relationships and knows how to get things done in Richmond.\u201dThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The winner of\u00a0Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0contest will likely face Republican Ed Gillespie, a former       George W. Bush       administration official who narrowly lost a 2014 race against Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner.Mr. Gillespie has said he would campaign with Mr. Trump but hasn\u2019t embraced the president\u2019s rhetoric\u2014he has aired Spanish and Korean language TV ads and pledged in another ad to be \u201ca governor for all Virginians.\u201d Mr. Gillespie holds a sizable lead in polls against his two GOP opponents, including Corey Stewart, who was the Trump campaign\u2019s Virginia chairman.Democrats will have a historical advantage in November\u2019s general election. The president\u2019s party has lost nine of the last 10 Virginia gubernatorial elections. Further, in 1993, 2005 and 2009 the state\u2019s voters signaled the first opposition to newly elected presidents a year ahead of a wave of elections that shifted control of Congress.A poll conducted by the Washington Post last month found Messrs. Northam and Perriello to be in a virtual tie. Both Democrats held double-digit leads against Mr. Gillespie.\u201cWhoever the nominee is, the race for governor of Virginia will be a referendum on Donald Trump,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Virginia Democratic operative who is neutral in the race. \u201cHistorically, Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race is a harbinger of the mood of the country and an early warning sign for the midterms.\u201dThe stylistic differences between the two Democrats animate their campaigns. The energetic Mr. Perriello speaks quickly and uses the language of the party\u2019s activists. \u201cMovement energy,\u201d he says, will boost his campaign. He refers to Virginia as a state.Mr. Northam, a pediatric neurologist with the country drawl of his native Eastern Shore, calls Virginia a \u201ccommonwealth,\u201d the term of endearment used by its political establishment.On Monday\u00a0morning, Mr. Perriello\u2019s campaign field office was filled with a mix of millennials and union activists who mostly backed Mr. Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign.Delia Goldin, a 2017 University of Virginia graduate from Fairfax, Va., said she volunteered for Mr. Perriello\u2019s campaign after he spoke to her history class in February. Mr. Perriello, she said, has the ability to expand the Democratic coalition like Mr. Sanders did during last year\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201cWe need someone who can energize people outside of the traditional Democratic base and can win against the Republicans,\u201d Ms. Goldin said. \u201cThe energy has always been there, but Trump was the tipping point to get people who have been talking about it on their computers to do something about it.\u201dWrite to Reid J.

Brent, the global benchmark, rose 14 cents, or 0.29%, to $48.29 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.The move higher comes after prices fell nearly 4% last week. Investors have become more skeptical that efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major exporters are working off a global oil glut. Prices tumbled sharply last Wednesday after U.S. data showed an unexpected increase in the amount of crude in storage.But Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said that he expects global oil stockpiles to fall more quickly in the coming months.

The market is factoring in a little bit of disruption,\u201d said Miswin Mahesh, an oil market analyst at Energy Aspects.The prospect of rising production from Nigeria has weighed on prices at times in recent months. Nigeria is exempt from an agreement struck by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers to cut output by 1.8 million barrels a day.A softer U.S. dollar may also have supported prices. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of other currencies, fell 0.1% on Monday. Oil is priced in dollars and as the greenback wanes in strength it becomes is more affordable for buyers holding other currencies.Investors are looking forward to the release of a slew of data this week, such as the International Energy Agency\u2019s report on Wednesday which includes figures on the state of OECD stocks.

Gary Abernathy of Hillsboro, Ohio\u2019s Times-Gazette was a rare newspaper editor who endorsed Donald Trump for President in 2016. On Friday, he provided an update from his community of 6,600 people:The 2016 election made clear how little the average voter in the Midwest has in common with the average journalist on either coast. But your humble correspondent is struck by how much the Trump analysis offered by small-town Midwesterners squares with the view of Trump voters who live and work in Manhattan. Yes, there are a few, and just like the much larger population of Trump voters in Middle America, they understand his faults but tend to appreciate his goal of American revival.Meanwhile back in Ohio, Mr. Abernathy finds that constant negative coverage of Mr. Trump in the national media is still not having the intended effect, and may even be backfiring:But are the good folks in Hillsboro really representative of the country\u2014or even Ohio\u2014in general? Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings have never been good, and now they are downright awful. According to the polling average maintained by RealClearPolitics, Americans were almost evenly split between approval and disapproval of Mr. Trump in January. But now the nays have it by a margin of 17 percentage points.This would suggest that Mr. Trump has been hemorrhaging political support. And maybe he has. Yet even as the President has inspired higher levels of disapproval, Americans have become slightly more optimistic. Another RealClearPolitics average shows that since Inauguration Day the percentage of Americans who think the country is moving in the right direction has modestly increased, while the number who believe we\u2019re on the wrong track has declined. It seems that Americans don\u2019t much care for Mr. Trump but think they might like his results.As always, voters say the economy is their top concern, so their preferences on this issue have particular political importance. Among the more negative of the approval surveys included in the RealClear average is the recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, which found that a full 58% of survey respondents disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the job of President, compared to just 38% who approve. Yet in the same survey, which has a sample population that skews Democratic, Mr. Trump gets a 47% approval rating on the issue of employment and jobs, versus 46% who disapprove. Whatever they think of the messenger, a lot of Americans like the message of U.S. economic resurgence.Democrats for their part have certainly been taking a lot of shots at the messenger. Sen. Chuck Schumer and his staff have made a short video making fun of the President\u2019s hair and the way he deals with his most senior appointees.What will it mean for elections in 2018 and 2020? When it comes to appraising Mr. Trump\u2019s personality or his tweeting or the way he conducts a meeting, voters might choose to agree with Democrats--and still vote against them.***Bottom Stories of the DayMay the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor  \u201cActress Jennifer Lawrence OK after both engines fail on private plane,\u201d WABC, June 11Generalissimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead  \u201cDemocrats in N.J. vote to condemn another Trump action,\u201d NJ.com, June 11Out on a Limb  \u201cChimpanzees are not \u2018persons,\u2019 appeals court says,\u201d Washington Post, June 10Answers to Questions Nobody Is Asking  \u201cWhat photographing 100 naked men taught me,\u201d The Telegraph, June 12The Thrill Is Gone  \u201cChris Matthews: Trump-Russia collusion theory \u2018came apart\u2019 with Comey testimony,\u201d Washington Examiner, June 8In Search of News They Can Use  \u201cWhat do you do if a North Korean missile is coming at you, Japanese wonder,\u201d Washington Post, June 9Rock-Bottom Story of the Year  \u201cWhy the marrying-yourself trend of sologamy isn\u2019t as crazy as it sounds,\u201d Dallas Morning News, May 22Follow James Freeman on Twitter.Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.(Carol Muller helps compile Best of the Web.

Currently, the period is a year for an unmarried American mother but five years for an unmarried American father.Passed in 1940, the law treated men and women differently based on \u201cthe long-held view that unwed fathers care little about, indeed are strangers to, their children,\u201d Justice Ginsburg wrote, joined by Chief Justice       John Roberts       and       Justices Anthony Kennedy,       Stephen Breyer,       Sonia Sotomayor       and       Elena Kagan.       \u201cLump characterization of that kind, however, no longer passes equal protection inspection.\u201d.Justice       Clarence Thomas,        joined by Justice       Samuel Alito,        agreed with the result but declined to join the majority\u2019s constitutional analysis, saying it was unnecessary to decide the case.The ruling provided cold comfort, however, to       Luis Ramon Morales-Santana,        born in the Dominican Republic in 1962 to a Dominican mother and American father just 20 days short of the paternal residency requirement, which at the time was 10 years.Mr. Morales-Santana had sought to be treated the same as if his mother had been the U.S. citizen, and a federal appeals court in New York agreed he should be.The Supreme Court said, however, that in these circumstances it lacked the power to expand an exception to the general immigration law, and could eliminate the discriminatory practice only by ending the advantage afforded to women.\u201cWe are pleased that the Supreme Court held that the provisions of the [Immigration and Nationality Act] used to deny Mr. Morales-Santana U.S. citizenship unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of gender,\u201d said       Stephen Broome,        a Los Angeles attorney who argued the case. \u201cWe are examining our options with respect to Mr. Morales-Santana, who in our view, should benefit from the court\u2019s insistence that \u2018the government must ensure that the laws in question are administered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination.\u2019\u201dA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.For Justice Ginsburg, Monday\u2019s opinion marked another feminist milestone, one she placed in the context of women\u2019s rights cases she argued as an attorney in the 1970s and constitutional decisions she later wrote as a justice.The provisions struck down \u201cdate from an era when the lawbooks of our nation were rife with overbroad generalizations about the way men and women are,\u201d she wrote.When the unwed-mother provision was enacted, \u201conce habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our nation\u2019s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage, husband is\u00a0dominant, wife subordinate; unwed\u00a0mother is the natural and sole guardian of a nonmarital child,\u201d she wrote.The newest justice,       Neil Gorsuch,        was seated after the case was heard and didn\u2019t participate. He did, however, deliver his first opinion Monday, a unanimous decision exempting companies that purchase debts to pursue for themselves from a federal consumer-protection law.\u201cDisruptive dinnertime calls, downright deceit, and more besides drew Congress\u2019s eye to the debt collection industry,\u201d prompting passage of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Justice Gorsuch began, showing the flair that attracted attention when he was on a federal appeals court.\u201cEveryone agrees that the term embraces the repo man\u2014someone hired by a creditor to collect an outstanding debt,\u201d he continued. In recent years, however, companies have begun purchasing consumer debt for themselves and then pursuing past-due customers without a middleman, prompting disputes over whether they were \u201cmore like the repo man or the loan originator.\u201dThe opinion, in Henson v.

It quickly became the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s stepped up efforts to deport people with criminal records.Chaldean activists, who have been pressing for several years to allow more Chaldeans to enter the U.S., say that the consequences could be dire for Iraqi Christians who are sent back to their homeland, because Islamic State has been wiping out the country\u2019s Christian population. Last year,       John Kerry,        who was the Secretary of State at the time, called the attacks on Christians in Iraq a genocide.\u201cIf they go they will be captured, they will be tortured and they will be killed,\u201d said Joseph Kassab, founder and president of the Iraqi Christians Advocacy and Empowerment Institute in West Bloomfield, Mich.Mr. Kassab and other longtime Chaldean community advocates said they believed the deportation effort was ironic given President Donald Trump\u2019s pledges to aid Christians facing persecution in the Middle East and around the globe.In recent months, the Trump administration has been targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions, including low-level ones, for deportation, and individual ICE agencies have a lot of leeway in carrying out the president\u2019s goals.A spokesman for ICE said the people who were arrested were undocumented and had been convicted of serious crimes that included homicide, rape and assault. He said Iraq agreed to accept Iraqi nationals following recent negotiations with the U.S. and that the agency was working through a backlog of these individuals.\u201cEach of these individuals received full and fair immigration proceedings, after which a federal immigration judge found them ineligible for any form of relief under U.S. law and ordered them removed,\u201d said the ICE spokesman, Khaalid Walls. He declined to say when deportations would begin.Since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Chaldean Christian population has been steadily shifting away from their homeland in Iraq and toward the U.S.There are now around 400,000 Chaldeans in Iraq, down from 1.4 million before the invasion. There are currently roughly 250,000 Chaldeans in the U.S., most of them in Michigan and Southern California, according to Chaldean church officials.The arrests over the weekend took many by surprise, according to several accounts by family members.Cynthia Barash, 18 years old, said her father, Moayad Barash, was arrested Sunday evening near their home in Warren, Mich., after they had spent the day at the shore. A few blocks from his home, ICE pulled him out of the car and took him away, she said. His youngest daughter, 7 years old, watched from the back seat as her father was put in handcuffs.Ms. Barash said her father had been in the country since he was 8 years old. He is now 47, the manager of a grocery store in the Detroit area, and the father of five daughters.\u201cWe\u2019re just in shock right now,\u201d Ms. Barash said. \u201cHe\u2019s a loved person in the community.\u201dEveryone in the family is a U.S. citizen, she said, except for Mr. Barash, who was unable to get citizenship because of a felony drug charge when he was 17. He served several years in jail, Ms. Barash said, and has had no legal trouble since then.She added that her father, who is originally from Baghdad, no longer has any family in Iraq. If they send him back, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to get hurt. It\u2019s not good for him to be there. It\u2019s not safe.\u201dAfter he was detained, the Barash family and other Chaldeans went to an ICE detention facility in the Detroit area, where they said they saw her father and about 40 other people, all handcuffed, moved from the facility into a bus with barred windows.Jalal J. Dallo, an attorney in Southfield, Mich., said he saw two buses depart from the Detroit ICE field office containing Chaldeans headed to a correctional facility in Youngstown, Ohio.,\u00a0and believes more than 100 people in the community were arrested. ICE didn\u2019t confirm the number of arrests.Mr. Dallo said he is representing about half-a-dozen families, including several on a pro bono basis.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to look at it as a case-by-case basis and stop deportation,\u201d he said.Mark Arabo, founder of the Minority Humanitarian Foundation and a Chaldean-American, said his group planned to file a federal lawsuit this week, asking for a stay of any deportations of Christians back to Iraq.\u201cIt\u2019s a complete nightmare, not just for the families but for the entire community,\u201d Mr. Arabo said. \u201cYou can\u2019t send them back to Iraq.

GE 0.19%      , brings to the corner suite a professional past that is more akin to a private-equity executive than an industrial operator.The son of a bank executive, Mr. Flannery joined GE Capital in 1987 and worked around the globe cutting deals buying and selling portfolios of undervalued assets. The Wharton M.B.A. made his mark leading the $17 billion acquisition of             Alstom SA\u2019s       power business, the biggest industrial acquisition in the company\u2019s history.Despite his financial background and long tenure at GE, Mr. Flannery has shown a willingness to break ranks.At GE\u2019s annual management retreat in Boca Raton, Fla., where the top leaders of the company meet and discuss the business, Mr. Flannery stunned the crowd by abandoning the standard PowerPoint in his 2015 presentation, said people familiar with the matter. \u201cThat takes guts because there are 600 people in the room,\u201d one of the people said.One of four internal contenders to succeed       Jeff Immelt       for the top job, Mr. Flannery became the board\u2019s final pick based on his broad GE experience and inclusive leadership style, said another person familiar with the matter.Mr. Flannery \u201cis willing to contemplate significant change. He is quite bold in his thinking,\u2019\u2019 said Shelly Lazarus, a longtime GE director. \u201cHe can cast a cold eye even though he is a very warm person.\u2019\u2019That was evident when Mr. Flannery took charge of GE\u2019s business development team in 2013 and insisted on reviewing whether the company should stick with its then assortment of business. \u201cAll of a sudden, everything was on the table,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Lazarus said.Mr. Flannery was born in Alexandria, Va., and lived there for the first 10 years of his life with his two older sisters. His father worked for the FDIC Corp. In 1971, Mr. Flannery moved to West Hartford, Conn., where his father was president of a small bank. He graduated from Fairfield University before going to business school at the University of Pennsylvania.Like Mr. Immelt, he is a devoted Allman Brothers fan going to some of the rock group\u2019s final concerts. He is a voracious reader of fiction and nonfiction by authors including       Atul Gawande       and       J.D. Vance.He started working abroad for GE Capital in 1997 in Latin America and moved to Asia in 2005. He took a risk in 2009 by moving to India where he ran the company\u2019s first separate profit-and-loss statement for a country.After leaving India, he joined GE\u2019s corporate headquarters team in 2013 where he ran mergers and acquisitions and showed a willingness to part with assets.As head of strategic planning, Mr. Flannery pushed to exit the underperforming appliances unit, despite its long history inside GE, one person familiar with the matter said. Even though the business had been struggling for years, the company\u2019s earlier deal makers hadn\u2019t made the call to sell the business until Mr. Flannery took the job and Mr. Immelt agreed with him, the person said.Mr. Flannery was also instrumental in the Alstom deal, arguing the asset would be valuable to GE despite concerns about operating in France and improvements needed in the business, the person said. He negotiated directly with the now French President       Emmanuel Macron,        who was economy minister at the time, in a deal that involved contentious negotiations, another person familiar with the matter said.On Mr. Flannery\u2019s watch as head of GE\u2019s mergers and acquisitions team, he led the spinoff of its consumer credit business,             Synchrony Financial,       and eventually sold its appliance business to a Chinese rival after a deal with             Electrolux                   was scuttled.He stepped in to lead the health-care business in 2014 when the unit was struggling and some analysts called for GE to spin it off or sell it. Instead, Mr. Flannery and GE have doubled down. The unit, which makes imaging and diagnostic equipment, has been expanding into life sciences. GE Healthcare\u2019s revenue rose to $18.29 billion in 2016, back to levels it sustained in the beginning of the decade, while increasing operating profits.But Mr. Flannery will face different decisions than Mr. Immelt initially did when he took over the company in 2001 from       Jack Welch,        who had built up the conglomerate\u2019s media and financial business.Mr. Flannery faces calls for accelerated cost cuts and must complete a corporate transformation begun by Mr. Immelt. \u201cJeff created the big apple,\u2019\u2019 the first knowledgeable person said. \u201dNow is time for John to polish it.\u2019\u2019\u2014David Benoit contributed to this article.Write to Joann S.

The avenue spans 13 miles in Manhattan.A spokesman for Ms. Brewer\u2019s office said he didn\u2019t know the total number of storefronts on the avenue, so it is unclear what percentage of Broadway\u2019s total commercial footprint is vacant.Manhattan\u2019s retail vacancy rate was 3.8% in the first quarter, slightly above the citywide vacancy rate of 3.4%, according to an analysis by Marcus & Millichap Research Services and             CoStar Group Inc.       The borough has the highest average asking rent of New York\u2019s five boroughs, about $107 a square foot, according to the analysis.The fact that empty storefronts spanned the length of Broadway shows that the problem of commercial vacancies is widespread and new policies are needed to encourage occupancy, Ms. Brewer said in a statement.

The announcement sets up the second high-drama session before the committee within a few days, after Mr. Comey\u2019s much-watched appearance last Thursday.In his three hours of testimony on that day, Mr. Comey portrayed Mr. Sessions as an attorney general who didn\u2019t manage the relationship between President       Donald Trump,        his boss, and Mr. Comey, his subordinate. Mr. Comey also hinted that there were reasons Mr. Sessions had to recuse himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election beyond what was publicly known.In March, Mr. Sessions said he would recuse himself from any inquiry related to the 2016 campaign because he had played such a high-profile role in the Trump campaign. That announcement came after revelations that Mr. Sessions had met twice with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. during the campaign but didn\u2019t disclose those meetings in his confirmation hearing.A Justice Department spokesman last week rejected parts of Mr. Comey\u2019s descriptions of his interactions with the attorney general, and a spokeswoman on Monday said Mr. Sessions \u201cbelieves it is important for the American people to hear the truth directly from him.\u201dMr. Sessions, a former federal prosecutor and a former member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has made significant changes since leading the Justice Department, including altering policies on everything from how to charge a case to how to deal with alleged abuses by local police departments. He\u2019s also faced repeated questions related to his contacts with Russia and his role as a top Trump campaign adviser.Tuesday\u2019s hearing offers Mr. Sessions an opportunity to tackle some of those issues head on, and it will be the first time he is expected to personally address several of them in public. Lawmakers are expected to press the attorney general on Mr. Comey\u2019s account of their interactions, for example, as well as the reasons for Mr. Sessions\u2019 recusal and his meetings with Russian Ambassador       Sergei Kislyak       during the campaign.Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       will take Mr. Sessions\u2019 place at the hearings before the appropriations committees. His announced subject will be the Justice Department\u2019s budget, but he is likely to face questions on matters like his role in the president\u2019s decision to fire Mr. Comey.Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in early May, suggesting later in a television interview that the decision was driven in part by Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation into Russian meddling in the election.Last week, Mr. Comey described an Oval Office meeting at which he said the president asked the attorney general to exit from the room, ultimately leaving Mr. Comey alone with Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump inappropriately asked him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser       Mike Flynn,        which Mr. Trump denies.After that Oval Office meeting, Mr. Comey said, he asked the attorney general to ensure he would never be left alone with Mr. Trump again. Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t respond to that request, in Mr. Comey\u2019s telling.\u201cI have a recollection of him just kind of looking at me\u2026His body language gave me the sense like, \u2018What am I going to do?\u2019...He didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Mr. Comey said at the hearing.Mr. Sessions hasn\u2019t himself addressed those allegations, but Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said last week Mr. Sessions \u201cwas not silent\u201d and said he responded by saying that the agency \u201cneeded to be careful about following appropriate policies regarding contacts with the White House.\u201d Mr. Comey testified he didn\u2019t inform Mr. Sessions about the substance of his conversations with Mr. Trump.Mr. Sessions, who was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest and most vocal supporters on the campaign trail, has had his own tense relationship with Mr. Trump in recent weeks, stemming in part from his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.Mr. Trump remains convinced it was a misstep for Mr. Sessions to recuse himself, one person close to the White House said. Various people who\u2019ve worked for Mr. Trump said he\u2019s long thought it is a mistake to admit error\u2014something he believes that recusal implies.The Sessions testimony would make this the second consecutive week that the White House has tried to emphasize a policy goal\u2014in this case, workforce development\u2014only to end up competing with a high-drama hearing on Capitol Hill. Last week, the White House tried to showcase Mr. Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan, only to see the subject drowned out by Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony.The White House is taking new steps to make sure its policy agenda isn\u2019t overlooked. Each week, the administration intends to identify a policy theme, scheduling presidential travel and events to reinforce the message. Next week, the White House focus will be technology, and the following week, energy.\u201cThe White House has now realized the new normal will be parallel paths that are running,\u201d said Jason Miller, a former senior Trump campaign aide. \u201cThere will be periodic distractions while they\u2019re also pushing forward with the agenda of governing.\u201d\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Sessions to Address Allegations by Comey.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 16:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-to-testify-publicly-on-tuesday-1497281126", "news_title": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions to Testify Publicly on Tuesday", "keywords": " attorney general, donald trump,jeff sessions, open session, president trump, russia investigation, russia probe, senate intelligence committee,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. budget deficit widened through the first eight months of the fiscal year, highlighting challenges for the Trump administration as it looks to cut taxes and rebalance spending priorities.Government spending outpaced revenues by $433 billion from October through May, the Treasury Department said Monday, up from $405 billion during the same period a year earlier. The fiscal year starts in October.Receipts are up 1%, and outlays have climbed 2%.Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office forecast a 3% rise in receipts this year. Most of that revenue shortfall reflects smaller-than-anticipated tax payments from individuals and corporations, though the cause remains unclear.The nonpartisan CBO in a report last week speculated that income growth may have been weaker than expected in calendar year 2016 or taxpayers may be shifting income to later years in anticipation of a tax cut.\u201cThe sources of the shortfall will be better understood as data from tax returns start to become available later this year,\u201d the CBO said.Trump administration officials and analysts have flagged lackluster receipts as potentially compressing the period of time the government has before it runs out of cash. The Treasury Department has been employing cash-conservation measures since mid-March when government debt hit the borrowing limit.Analysts have estimated those measures will last until October or November. Administration officials have urged lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling before they leave for their summer recess July 28, but the Treasury hasn\u2019t said when it expects to run out of room to meet the government\u2019s obligations.Last month, Mr. Trump outlined budget priorities that include cuts to taxes and government safety-net programs. It would balance itself through faster economic growth, the White House said.Monday\u2019s budget figures underscore challenges for the administration and Congress. Spending on Social Security, Medicaid and interest owed on the national debt are all up through the first eight months of the year.Declining government revenues and long-term costs associated with an aging population are expected to continue pushing up the deficit.For the month of May, the deficit was $88 billion, up from $53 billion a year earlier.Corrections & Amplifications   The Treasury Department released its latest U.S. budget information on Monday.

It follows a 2014 cyber-campaign against the U.S. in which networks at 17 energy companies, including four electric utilities, were compromised.The malicious software, called Crashoverride, has been analyzed over the past week by Dragos Inc., a Washington, D.C., firm specializing in securing the industrial-control systems in manufacturing plants or power facilities. Robert M. Lee, Dragos\u2019s chief executive, said the software was discovered earlier this year by ESET, a Slovakia-based antivirus vendor.ESET obtained the sample though the company\u2019s \u201cregular research channels, which include victims, established malware sample sharing platforms, public sources and our own detection technology,\u201d a company spokeswoman said Monday.U.S. officials have expressed concern about cyberattacks on the industrial-control systems that run power plants and factory systems. Software specifically designed to infect these systems is relatively rare, however\u2014Crashoverride is only the fourth example, according to Dragos.Mr. Lee said Crashoverride focuses on disruption, rather than merely reconnaissance as in some other examples of such software. That makes it the most powerful industrial-attack code uncovered since Stuxnet, the software jointly developed by the U.S. and Israel a decade ago to disrupt Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, he said.Crashoverride \u201cis a selection of tools that are targeted, well planned and tested,\u201d said another industrial-control system expert briefed on the malicious software. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this level of capabilities before.\u201dThe software runs on the             Microsoft                   Windows operating system. Once installed on a network, it scans to discover what computer systems are available and can then be configured to switch circuit breakers, cutting off power, Mr. Lee said.Microsoft\u2019s free security software now \u201cdetects and helps remove\u201d the Crashoverride malware, a company spokeswoman said Monday.Mr. Lee said the software contains a number of digital clues linking it to the 2016 attack that caused a partial outage in Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital, in the early hours of Dec. 17.It isn\u2019t clear who was responsible for that attack.

Mr. Trump tapped his two adult sons to run the Trump Organization in his absence.Payments from domestic and foreign governments to Mr. Trump\u2019s hotels and other businesses violate constitutional provisions that prohibit U.S. officials from accepting \u201cany present, Emolument, Office, or Title\u201d from foreign states, and that bar the president from receiving compensation from the federal or state governments, other than his salary, according to the lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Greenbelt, Md.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the new lawsuit. Government lawyers have argued in the New York case that Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses place him in the company of past high-ranking U.S. officials who profited while in office, including 1970s Vice President       Nelson Rockefeller       who had stockholdings in major oil companies and other\u200b corporations that conducted business globally.White House press secretary       Sean Spicer       on Monday suggested the lawsuit was politically motivated and the business transactions in question were commonplace for government officials.\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to conclude that partisan politics may be one of the motivations,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, noting the similarities between Monday\u2019s lawsuit and one filed in New York. He added the suit \u201cchallenges the sort of business transaction\u201d that government officials have long engaged in.Few courts \u200bhave considered the emoluments provisions of the Constitution. Some legal experts say the\u200b Foreign Emoluments\u200b clause was intended to prevent U.S. officials from entering the employ of foreign governments, making it inapplicable to Mr. Trump\u2019s situation.D.C. Attorney General       Karl Racine       and Maryland Attorney General       Brian Frosh       cite in their complaint \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d in payments from foreign governments that lease space in Trump properties, patronize the president\u2019s hotels or otherwise conduct business with the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump receives benefits from the U.S. government as well, through his lease of federal property for the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit says.\u201cAbsent the consent of Congress, private enrichment through the receipt of benefits from foreign governments is prohibited,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which asks a federal judge to declare Mr. Trump in violation of the Constitution and to prohibit him from further violations.Mr. Trump, through his lawyers, has pledged to donate to the U.S. Treasury all profits from foreign-government payments made to his hotels. The policy will apply only to payments from guests who identify themselves as a representative of a foreign government, the Trump Organization told Congress in May.On Friday, lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice moved for dismissal of the New York lawsuit, which was filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and makes nearly the same case as the complaint filed by Maryland and the District of Columbia.Department lawyers said in their brief that the nation\u2019s founders didn\u2019t intend for the constitutional provision to reach the president\u2019s private business pursuits. The clauses apply \u201conly to the receipt of compensation for personal services and to the receipt of honors and gifts based on official position,\u201d they wrote, adding that CREW\u2019s interpretation would mean that presidents \u201cfrom the very beginning of the Republic, including       George Washington      \u201d had also violated the Constitution.Maryland and District of Columbia officials must show they have been injured to have standing to sue. The complaint says they own businesses that compete with Mr. Trump\u2019s and could lose economic and commercial activity to the Trump Organization.They also argue that they are harmed by \u201cperceived and/or actual pressure to grant special treatment\u201d to Trump businesses, which could put them at a disadvantage to other states that have given or will give the president\u2019s companies favorable consideration.\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Write to Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 16:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/maryland-district-of-columbia-sue-trump-organization-over-government-payments-to-businesses-1497291078", "news_title": "Maryland, District of Columbia Sue Trump Over Government Payments to His Businesses", "keywords": "brian frosh,district of columbia,donald trump,government payments,karl racine,lawsuit,maryland,politics,sean spicer,trump businesses,trump hotels,trump organization,u.s. constitution,u.s. government,Trump Organization,U.S. government,U.S. Department of Justice,Trump International Hotel,Donald Trump,Brian Frosh,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Prime Minister       Theresa May       addressed Conservative lawmakers for the first time since last week\u2019s election and sought to convince them that she would take the party out of the \u201cmess\u201d she created, after a disappointing outcome weakened her grip on power.Mrs. May\u2019s failure to secure a majority in last week\u2019s vote puts the country\u2019s objectives in coming Brexit negotiations in flux. With no clear mandate, control over the shape of Brexit is likely to hang on lawmakers more than with Mrs. May\u2019s own views, raising the prospect that the U.K. is heading for a less-abrupt break with the European Union than seemed likely before the election.The electoral gamble has damaged Mrs. May\u2019s authority within her party. At the Monday meeting, she sounded contrite and took responsibility for the disastrous election results.\u201cI\u2019m the person who got us into this mess and I\u2019m the one who will get us out of it,\u201d Mrs. May told a roomful of lawmakers, one who was there said.Jacob Rees-Mogg,        a Conservative lawmaker who backed leaving the EU, said Mrs. May answered questions from members of Parliament including ones pertaining to the party\u2019s campaign strategy and its policy proposals.\u201cShe was humble, she apologized and set out a clear purpose for the future,\u201d Mr. Rees-Mogg said. \u201cShe got the tone spot on.\u201dBut rumors swirled over how long she could last, and to what extent she could see through the definitive break with the EU she had set out\u2014including leaving the bloc\u2019s single market for goods and services to get control over immigration. Scottish leader       Nicola Sturgeon       said supporters of a clear break with the EU have been left dead in the water in the wake of the election result.       Ruth Davidson,        the leader of the Scottish Conservative party, said she wanted to put economic advancement at the heart of any Brexit deal.Mrs. May\u2019s team continued to seek a deal with a small Northern Irish party, the Democratic Unionist Party, which it is hoping it can rely on to pass legislation through Parliament. The DUP is likely to demand concessions in exchange for its support, including guarantees that Brexit won\u2019t disrupt trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland, an EU member.Kathrin Muehlbronner,        senior vice president of Moody\u2019s, said in a research note that the Conservative Party\u2019s reduced share of parliamentary seats may mean there is a higher likelihood of a Brexit involving compromises that Mrs. May wouldn\u2019t have earlier considered.\u201cThis could potentially include a request to remain inside the EU single market or the customs union,\u201d Mrs. Muehlbronner said.She also expected the election outcome to delay the start of negotiations or lead to a period where no substantive issues are discussed.Like the Conservative Party, the main opposition Labour Party is also divided on what Brexit should look like. Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn       and his close ally       John McDonnell,        the party\u2019s finance spokesman, have sent a strong signal that they believe the U.K. should quit the EU\u2019s single market for goods and services, as well as its customs union.Mr. McDonnell, in an interview with broadcaster ITV on Sunday, said a Brexit deal that preserves Britain\u2019s single-market membership would be interpreted \u201cas not respecting the result of that referendum,\u201d referring to last year\u2019s Brexit vote.Their stance aligns with the party\u2019s election platform, which said a Labour government would seek to preserve the benefits of single-market membership and the EU\u2019s customs union, while ending free movement of people. It pledged to \u201cbuild a close cooperative future relationship with the EU, not as members but as partners.\u201dYet some in the party have left the door open to less of a clear break.       Barry Gardiner,        trade spokesman and one of a three-person team driving Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, said on Monday that some kind of \u201creformed membership\u201d of the single market and customs union was another possibility, though it isn\u2019t clear if such an offer would even be on the table.Others in the party have been more explicit. Chuka Ummuna, a former Labour business spokesman, has said the U.K. could leave the EU but maintain single-market membership by seeking a similar status to Norway, which pays into the EU budget and accepts the free movement of people from the bloc.Uncertainty over the direction of Brexit weighed on business leaders. The U.K.\u2019s Institute of Directors said it quizzed 700 executives and found a sharp deterioration in confidence about the U.K. economy\u2019s prospects following the election result. The institute said 57% of respondents were pessimistic about the economy, compared with 37% before the vote.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Leader Vows to Fix Election \u2018Mess\u2019.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 16:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-theresa-may-grilled-by-party-members-after-election-setback-1497286797", "news_title": "U.K.\u2019s May Vows to Deliver Conservatives From \u2018Mess\u2019 Caused by Election Setback ", "keywords": "brexit,conservative party,european union,jeremy corbyn,theresa may,u.k. election,united kingdom,Theresa May,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,broadcasting,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "The chief executives of             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

C -0.28%       are the latest bank bosses to be hooked by an email prankster trolling top Wall Street brass,\u00a0exposing a low-tech gap in banks\u2019 cybersecurity armor.Goldman\u2019s       Lloyd Blankfein       and Citigroup\u2019s       Michael Corbat,        as well as Citigroup consumer-banking chief       Stephen Bird,        responded over the weekend to emails sent by the anonymous prankster masquerading as top executives at the two banks.The hoaxer, who last month snared             Barclays                   PLC chief       Jes Staley       and Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, on Sunday published screenshots of the exchanges on Twitter. Goldman and Citigroup confirmed the email exchanges.None of the executives disclosed sensitive information in responding to the prankster, but the repeated episodes flag concerns about whether banks have done enough to\u00a0guard against online threats.\u00a0It comes as more trading is happening on mobile devices and investment bankers are taking electronic pitchbooks on the road.The emails mimic a well-known scam known as \u201cphishing.\u201d In this, scammers try to get victims to click on malicious links or try to capture sensitive information, such as passwords, via seemingly innocuous emails. These emails can take the form of invoices from customers, shared Google documents, or phony password reset requests.Last year, the FBI said that it had observed a 270% increase in business-email scams over a 15-month period. In these, criminals had impersonated executives to request a fraudulent money transfer or other fraudulent transaction. Between October 2013 and February 2016, law-enforcement officials received reports from 17,642 victims of this kind of scheme that amounted to more than $2.3 billion in losses.The anonymous bank trickster so far has appeared to seek to embarrass executives rather than extract secrets or plant viruses.The fear, though, is that if bankers can fall for cheeky pranksters, they might also fall victim to the kinds of phishing attacks that hackers used to breach the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email, enabled by a false email asking to reset a password.Mr. Blankfein received an email that appeared to be from a top lieutenant,       Harvey Schwartz.       The prankster appeared to be looking for confirmation that a pair of recent tweets from Mr. Blankfein were a swipe at President       Donald Trump\u2019s       infrastructure agenda.\u201cTweet won some online award for humorous tweet\u2014Trump will be so pissed ;),\u201d it read, according to the screenshots published on Twitter.Mr. Blankfein largely declined to take the bait. He said the tweet \u201cseemed like a good way to bookend my trip,\u201d though he did say he would \u201csettle for getting away with it.\u201dMessrs. Corbat and Bird received emails appearing to come from Citigroup Chairman       Michael O\u2019Neill.      \u00a0Mr. Corbat only sent a brief response, while Mr. Bird traded a series of emails with the prankster. The emails were personal in nature and didn\u2019t pertain to business dealings of the banks or their financial workings.\u201cCEOs are trying to be hands on these days, tweeting and emailing and responding to many things themselves,\u201d said       Sandeep Kumar,        managing director for capital markets at Synechron, an information-technology consulting firm. \u201cThese firms have many layers of security and filtering.\u2026But at times, emails will sneak in and somebody will be tempted to click on a wrong link or respond to someone they shouldn\u2019t.\u201dMany bankers, including those at Citigroup, access their email through third-party security applications such as those developed by Good Technology, now part of             BlackBerry Ltd.      \u00a0Those apps screen links when they are clicked and block many of them. Mr. Corbat, in his response to the prankster, noted that he couldn\u2019t open the link.In fact, bankers often complain that their email is too secure, making it cumbersome to interact with clients. At many firms, emails dealing with client or financial information go through additional layers of security.The email from Mr. O\u2019Neill originating from a non-Citigroup email address wouldn\u2019t be unusual, said a person familiar with the bank.\u00a0Many board members use personal email accounts for board duties, as they aren\u2019t bank employees and aren\u2019t acting on behalf of other companies they may work for.Goldman\u2019s email system, which the bank\u2019s engineers built themselves and spun out, alerts users when they are sending an email to someone outside the firm. Like many cybersecurity tools, though, users can get inured to such warnings, clicking past them without thinking.\u2014Peter Rudegeair contributed to this article.Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com and Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Goldman, Citi Bosses Duped by Email Prankster.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 15:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldmans-blankfein-citis-corbat-duped-by-email-prankster-1497297211", "news_title": "Goldman\u2019s Blankfein, Citi\u2019s Corbat Duped by Email Prankster ", "keywords": " bank security, cybersecurity,email scams, online banking,phishing,Citigroup,C,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Barclays,BCS,Good Technology,Michael Corbat,Lloyd Blankfein,Sandeep Kumar,Stephen Bird,Jes Staley,Mark Carney,Harvey Schwartz,Donald Trump,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,privacy issues,information security,fraud,cybercrime,hacking,spamming,computers,consumer electronics,networking,banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,computing,financial services,integrated banks,internet,online,investing,securities,technology"}, {"content": "Children\u2019s clothing seller Gymboree filed for bankruptcy, hoping to cement a deal to slice more than $900 million in debt off its books and survive the shakeout in the retail sector.On Monday, the retailer unveiled its restructuring strategy before Judge       Keith Phillips       in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Va.\u201cAs we\u2019re all aware, there are very few success stories of fully maximizing going concerns in retail cases,\u201d said Gymboree lawyer Steven Serajeddini in court Monday.The company won approval to begin drawing on its bankruptcy loan, a critical first step in keeping Gymboree afloat during the restructuring proceedings, said James Mesterharm, the AlixPartners turnaround executive who is in charge of Gymboree\u2019s restructuring. Without access to the bankruptcy loan, he said, Gymboree wouldn\u2019t have enough liquidity to place new inventory orders and would have to liquidate the chain sooner than later.The San Francisco-based retailer\u2019s survival will be costly to unsecured creditors, assuming Gymboree succeeds in implementing a fast-track restructuring.Suppliers deemed \u201ccritical\u201d to Gymboree\u2019s continued business will be paid in full, but general unsecured creditors are being offered nothing, according to a description of the restructuring strategy in court papers.Sunday\u2019s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing wasn\u2019t a surprise. Gymboree has been struggling along with other brick-and-mortar retailers against a switch by consumers to online shopping. Rivals like             Children\u2019s Place Inc.       and the             Gap Inc.       have the advantage of lighter debt burdens, Mr. Mesterharm said in court papers.With major debts starting to coming due in December, earnings in decline and vendors demanding tighter payment terms, Gymboree faced liquidity issues that pushed it into talks with lenders, and a chapter 11 filing Sunday.The turnaround plan includes an infusion of up to $115 million in new money, $35 million is in the form of bankruptcy financing, court papers show The rest will be raised as part of Gymboree\u2019s bankruptcy exit, court papers say.Funding for the chapter 11 process comes from some of the lenders that have agreed to cast crucial votes in support of the plan, investors in Gymboree\u2019s $789 million secured term loan. Those lenders will get control of the postbankruptcy Gymboree, which will be run by a board of directors that includes appointees of Carriage House Capital Advisors, Brigade Capital Management, OppenheimerFunds Inc. and Searchlight Capital Partners.Lower-ranking bondholders, owed $171 million, are being offered nothing under the bankruptcy exit plan. Gymboree will be seeking early court permission to pay foreign vendors about $39 million early in the bankruptcy, according to court papers.Also on Monday, Judge Phillips signed off on closing more than 375 stores during the restructuring.Gymboree hired liquidators in the weeks leading up to the bankruptcy filing to identify which underperforming locations should be closed, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported in May.While 375 will be closed immediately, the number could rise to 450 to continue freeing up capital to boost its online-selling effort, court papers said.The company also announced on Monday that Chief Financial Officer       Andy North       resigned, and an outside restructuring executive,       Liyuan Woo,        has been designated to fill that position in the interim.In March, Mark Breitbard announced his resignation as chief executive. He was ultimately succeeded by       Daniel J. Griesemer.Gymboree\u2019s private-equity owners, led by Bain Capital, will relinquish their holdings under the chapter 11 plan. Bain led a $1.8 billion buyout of Gymboree in 2010, and launched a global expansion of the brand into China, South Korea, Australia and parts of Latin America.As of the end of April, Gymboree operated nearly 1,300 stores, mostly in the U.S., under its three brands: Gymboree, Janie and Jack and Crazy 8. The Gymboree line makes up the bulk of its business, with 586 stores and 174 outlets, accounting for 66% of its revenue in 2016, according to court papers.Simon Property Group Inc.       and             GGP Inc.       are the landlords for more than one-third of Gymboree\u2019s domestic real estate space, court papers said.The law firms of Kirkland & Ellis and Kutak Rock LLP are advising Gymboree, along with AlixPartners and Lazard Freres & Co.Gymboree has set a target date of Sept. 24 to win confirmation of a chapter 11 plan.\u2014Imani Moise contributed to this article.Write to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com and Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 15:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gymboree-files-chapter-11-cfo-leaves-1497268737", "news_title": "Gymboree Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy to Slash Debts", "keywords": "apparel retailer,bankruptcy,chapter 11,gymboree,pe restructuring,retail,retail bankruptcy,retailer,Gymboree,AlixPartners LLP,James Mesterharm,Steven Serajeddini,Keith Phillips,corporate actions,bankruptcy reorganization,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,wholesale,clothing stores,specialty stores,management consulting,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,business consultancy"}, {"content": "France\u2019s President       Emmanuel Macron,        knowing only success in his first month in office, has yet to act on one of his most quietly announced goals: dealing with Islam in France. He\u2019s pledged affirmative-action measures, zero tolerance on security and \u201ca determined policy of reconquest of the Republic\u201d in the country\u2019s no-go, Islamist-controlled enclaves.Tall order. Taller still, even in Mr. Macron\u2019s current state of grace, considering history\u2019s great Reconquista took more than 700 years.In the context of France\u2019s battle with homegrown \u201cIslamist terrorism\u201d (Mr. Macron\u2019s verbal escalation over former President       Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s       \u201cobscurantism\u201d) and its hundreds of French dead, the details of the new president\u2019s approach to restraining Islamism are few. So far, they have nothing to do with a unifying charter of national civilization that would represent a binding solution for an Islamic presence that has been described by the intellectual       Alain Minc       as \u201ca subterranean territory within French society.\u201dInstead, the president\u2019s announced priorities are the \u201cmoralization\u201d of French politics (don\u2019t hold your breath) and, in order to restore international confidence in France\u2019s economic stability, the difficult reform of the rigid French labor code.When it comes to drawing Muslims closer to France, Candidate Macron spoke of reducing class sizes in schools in \u201cdifficult neighborhoods\u201d and giving employers \u20ac15,000 ($16,800) over three years for each new open-term hire from those neighborhoods.That, for now, is it on affirmative action (\u201cdiscrimination positive,\u201d in French) which Mr. Macron said in March he\u2019ll \u201ctake on totally.\u201d His predecessor, Mr. Hollande, had experimented with a similar but no-name employment inducement for two years before dropping it.And the \u201creconquest of the Republic\u201d remarks?They received virtually no media attention. In spite of last month\u2019s election defeat of       Marine Le Pen,        and a consistent majority view in France that the failure to integrate Muslims is a Muslim-made problem, broad political discussion of Islam remains couched in euphemism. The talk is instead of migrants, the suburbs (a verbal stand-in for Muslim-majority enclaves), or communautarisme (referring to the total rejection of French law and values in many Muslim-majority housing projects).Who these Muslims are, or their number, is left vague by the state, which considers precise information on the subject potentially discriminatory. But a liberal think-tank, Institut Montaigne, last year came up with some interesting results on the 5.6% of France\u2019s population that it counts as Muslim.The study found that 28% of those Muslims have \u201cadopted value systems clearly opposed to the values of the Republic.\u201d Hold that up alongside an estimate a year ago from former Prime Minister       Manuel Valls       that only 1% of French Muslims are Salafists supporting jihadism.Boualem Sansal,        an Algerian novelist, recently told a French reporter that when it came to \u201cIslamism or political Islam,\u201d Mr. Macron didn\u2019t grasp \u201cFrance\u2019s No. 1 problem.\u201d The Islamists in France think in terms of conquering neighborhoods, not states, Mr. Sansal said.Perhaps Mr. Macron should talk to       G\u00e9rald Darmanin.       He\u2019s the president\u2019s budget minister with a part-Algerian heritage who, as mayor of Tourcoing, the northern French town with a large Muslim population, had refused to approve a building permit for a minaret.Mr. Darmanin said last year that \u201cIslam has to adapt to the Republic and not vice versa.\u201d To establish this relationship officially, making clear that French law and values have precedence over any interpretation of the Quran, he urged that \u201cthere has to be a compact or state agreement.\u201dA covenant of this kind would create an Islamic consistory in France with legal status equal to that of similar Roman Catholic, Protestant or Jewish bodies. As was the case with the Jews more than 200 years ago, Muslims could be asked to pledge to defend France ahead of all other considerations.With Muslims representing an estimated 5% to 6% of the French voting population, Mr. Macron\u2019s subordinate focus on their role buys him momentary calm to solidify power through another remarkable performance in the second round of legislative elections Sunday.But dealing with the issue of Islam head-on, comprehensively and soon\u2014offering job and educational opportunity while achieving real accommodation of French values\u2014would be a profound statement of Mr. Macron\u2019s authority.

The speech also comes days after a blockbuster May jobs report for Canada that indicated the country recorded its fastest pace of annual job growth in over four years.Some economists say the speech represents the starkest message yet the central bank is firmly turning its focus to rate increases. The last time it raised its benchmark policy rate was in the fall of 2010.A majority of Canadian market watchers anticipated rate increases to start in early 2018, based on improving economic data.\u201cI am not so sure that the Bank of Canada will wait until 2018,\u201d said Jimmy Jean, economist at Desjardins Capital Markets in Montreal, after reading the speech. In his view, the central bank \u201creally likes what they are seeing in the economy, and they won\u2019t let themselves be paralyzed by downside risk.\u201dThe Canadian dollar gained nearly a penny against its U.S. counterpart as traders digested Ms. Wilkins\u2019 hawkish remarks. The Canadian dollar now trades around 74.90 U.S. cents from about 74.27 U.S. cents right before the release of the speech, according to CQG.The central bank\u2019s next rate-policy decision is scheduled for July 12, at which time it will also release an updated economic forecast.Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s       economics team said Monday that markets are underestimating growing strength in the underlying Canadian economy. It said it anticipates the Bank of Canada to increase its policy rate multiple times before reaching 1.25% by the end of next year.Until recent weeks, the Bank of Canada had urged caution amid a string of positive economic indicators. Canada has registered three straight quarters of strong growth, with first-quarter expansion of 3.7% annualized top among Group of Seven countries. Momentum in hiring has also continued unabated, with Canada adding 54,500 jobs in May, all of them full time and most concentrated in the private sector.In her speech, Ms. Wilkins said the central bank is \u201cacutely\u201d aware of the risk posed to the Canadian economy by U.S. trade-policy uncertainty, with the Trump administration seeking changes to the North American Free-Trade Agreement in trilateral talks that begin in August. \u201cThis will likely remain an important uncertainty in our projection, but life goes on and decisions must be made in the meantime,\u201d she said.Three-quarters of all Canadian exports are U.S. bound, and Ms. Wilkins said exports were a \u201cdisappointment\u201d in an otherwise impressive first-quarter report on Canada\u2019s gross domestic product.She added tepid inflationary pressure and wage growth point to the existence of slack, or unused industrial and labor capacity.\u201cThat said,\u201d Ms. Wilkins added, \u201cwhen you look at the economy from different perspectives, there is reason to be encouraged.\u201d\u2014David George-Cosh in Toronto contributed to this article.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.comWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 14:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-canada-to-assess-whether-considerable-stimulus-still-required-1497290033", "news_title": "Bank of Canada to Assess Whether \u2018Considerable\u2019 Stimulus Still Required ", "keywords": "bank of canada,canada ,canada jobs,canada oil,canada trade,nafta,oil jobs,Bank of Canada,Carolyn Wilkins,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. Secret Service has no audio copies\u00a0or transcripts of any tapes recorded within President Donald Trump\u2019s White House, the agency said on Monday.The agency\u2019s response to a freedom of information request submitted by The Wall Street Journal doesn\u2019t exclude the possibility that recordings could have been created by another entity.The Secret Service handled recording systems within the White House for past presidents, including       Richard Nixon       and John F.

Mr. Gianforte won the election the following day by six points.Gallatin County Justice Court Judge Rick West ordered Mr. Gianforte to pay $385 in fines and fees and to perform 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. A six-month jail sentence was deferred, and if Mr. Gianforte doesn\u2019t break the law in the next six months, his attorney can move to have his charges dismissed.

Could they do it in the U.S.?Multiple forces were at work, of course, in the stunning outcome of the British election, which cost Prime Minister       Theresa May       and her Conservative Party their majority in Parliament. An uninspiring campaign, terrorism, second thoughts about the decision to exit from the European Union, even the downsides of the prime minister\u2019s attachment to the American president\u2014all were factors.But the decisive one may have been a surge of support for the opposition Labour Party among young voters. A postelection analysis by the Financial Times found that young voters backed Labour over the Conservatives by 51 points more than the national average. By contrast, voters over the age of 65 backed the Conservatives by 32 points more than the national average.That is a stunning generation gap\u2014and a far wider one than seen just a few years ago. \u201cOver the course of seven years, the partisan age gap has rocketed from 14 points to 83,\u201d the Financial Times wrote.Those young voters propelled Labour leader       Jeremy Corbyn,        the trans-Atlantic version of Sen. Bernie Sanders, to his unexpectedly strong challenge to Mrs. May. This all represented a considerable turnaround from just 12 months ago, when young voters\u2019 failure to show up in such numbers was a significant factor in the vote in favor of Brexit, the departure from the EU.\u201cFor many of Corbyn\u2019s supporters, this was the anti-Brexit election,\u201d writes Richard V. Reeves of the Brookings Institution in his postelection analysis. \u201cOlder voters voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU, while many pro-European youngsters stayed home. This time, they turned out. Seats with high numbers of young voters, including many college towns, swung strongly towards Labour.\u201dIndeed, an exit poll by NME, a music-news organization, indicated that turnout among those aged 18 through 24 rose 12 percentage points over the last general election two years ago. Two-thirds of those young voters went for Labour.Such findings are cause for concern for America\u2019s own conservative party, the Republicans, who face signs they could be confronting a similar wave among young voters. Democrats, in turn, will be heartened\u2014though the story also carries cautionary notes for them.The election of Republican President       Donald Trump      \u2014brought about in part because young voters underperformed in key areas for Democrat       Hillary Clinton      \u2014has prompted a surge of anti-Trump sentiment among young voters, as well as a rise in activism.In the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, just 26% of those aged 18 through 34 said they approved of the job Mr. Trump is doing, while\u00a0 64% said they disapproved. That 38-point gap between approval and disapproval stands in stark contrast to the findings among voters aged 50 to 64, where Trump approval essentially matched disapproval, and with voters aged 65 and above,\u00a0 where approval slightly topped disapproval.Moreover, there are signs that this Trump disapproval is spilling over into the Republican Party more broadly. The Pew Research Center tracked the party affiliation of voters\u00a0from December 2015 through March of this year, and found that 23% of voters aged 18 through 29 who originally identified as Republicans or leaned Republican had defected to the Democrats.Anecdotal evidence shows this move toward the Democrats is accompanied by stronger activism among young voters. State and local meetings of both the Democratic Party and Our Revolution, the organization formed to absorb last year\u2019s Sanders supporters, are filled with boisterous young activists of the left.Significant parts of that youth movement have little to no use for the Democratic Party establishment, and some actually would prefer breaking out on their own. The divide was on full display over the weekend, when Mr. Sanders told a boisterous rally in Chicago:\u00a0\u201cThe current model and the current strategy of the Democratic Party is an absolute failure.\u201dBut therein also lies a warning for Democrats. The surge in activism by young voters is fueled not merely by anti-Trump sentiment but by a drive to push the party to the left. That almost certainly isn\u2019t a formula for picking off some swing congressional districts within their grasp, such as the one to be filled in a special election for an open House seat in Georgia on June 20.In such districts, the key for Democrats is winning over centrists who may lean Republican but are turned off by Mr. Trump. As that suggests, young-voter fervor is a good thing for Democrats overall\u2014but not necessarily everywhere.Write to Gerald F.

A major protest against the U.S.-backed government over its failure to prevent a massive truck bombing in the heavily fortified diplomatic center of the capital has been under way in the city for over a week.The organizers have set up half a dozen tents around the city, blocking roads and causing further anxiety among residents worried the tense situation could spark clashes between ethnic groups.The Afghan government is led by the majority Pashtun group, while many of the protesters belong to the Tajik minority; the two have clashed in the past.The truck bomb earlier this month killed more than 150 people and wounded hundreds, in the most violent week in Kabul since the U.S. invasion in 2001. Police killed another seven people during a protest in the area and then suicide bombers killed dozens at the funeral of a prominent protester.The surge in violence comes at a time when the Taliban have made sweeping gains across rural Afghanistan, taking advantage of the withdrawal of most foreign troops in 2014.

He didn\u2019t provide a reason for his departure, but he was expected to part ways with the company as soon as Monday, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.The departure was related to a report on Uber\u2019s workplace culture by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder       that was presented to the board on Sunday, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.

Uber is expected to release a summary of Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation on Tuesday.The board on Sunday also weighed a suggestion by Mr. Kalanick that he take a temporary leave in part to cope with the sudden death of his mother in a boating accident last month.

He described to BuzzFeed a plan in 2014 to spend millions to investigate journalists critical of Uber, though he ultimately condemned the comments, as did Mr. Kalanick.Mr. Michael also was aware the company\u2019s head of Asian operations,       Eric Alexander,        had obtained the medical records of a rape victim in an Uber car in India while pursuing a theory that local competitor Ola had pushed the story to damage Uber\u2019s reputation, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Alexander was fired this week after reporter inquiries. Mr. Alexander didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Mr. Michael was also instrumental in landing big corporate names for several Uber funding rounds and was considered a skilled businessman by many at the company.With him gone, Uber suddenly faces a leadership void.

Given that the crucial goal of improving critical thinking is a widely shared one, the better question would be: How can we ensure more access and good use of a rigorous well-rounded higher education? The answer begins with pushing back against short-term thinking exclusively about job-related skills and placing a higher value on opportunities for students to challenge themselves with a broad curriculum that will prepare them to learn and adapt in a rapidly changing career landscape.

To this end students need be able to write a piece from a viewpoint from which they may well differ, regardless of their \u201csensitivities\u201d or those of their parents. Much of political correctness seems to me a form of hypersensitivity. But that is in a practical sense unworkable when college ends.

He shrunk its once massive GE Capital finance operations and refocused the company on making jet engines and other heavy machinery.\u201cYou could never have predicted the environment of the last 16 years,\u201d Mr. Immelt said to employees in a town hall meeting Monday morning. He became choked up as he thanked his team and highlighted some of the challenges he faced over his time, including the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the financial crisis.Mr. Immelt came to GE in 1982, the same year as getting an M.B.A. from Harvard. In his career, he spent time in the Plastics, Appliances, and Healthcare businesses. Like his successor,       John Flannery,        Mr. Immelt was promoted to CEO after running the Healthcare division.Mr. Immelt had a tough CEO act to follow in       Jack Welch,        an empire builder who delivered steady profit growth and sent GE\u2019s shares soaring during the 1990s. Four days after Mr. Immelt took charge in 2001, the Sept. 11 attacks flattened GE\u2019s aviation business. Later, the financial crisis turned its giant banking business into a liability, forcing GE to cut its dividend for the first time since the Great Depression.Mr. Immelt ultimately sold NBCUniversal because it distracted from GE\u2019s core mission and he exited the insurance industry in 2005. He bought industrial businesses such as Enron Corp.\u2019s wind-power division and life-sciences firm Amersham PLC. He made major investments to serve oil and gas drillers but was criticized by some for paying up at the peaks of that market.His moves resulted in a reshaping of the company\u2019s workforce\u2014with the number of GE workers abroad increasing while the number of employees in the U.S. declined.The end of his career as CEO came under President       Donald Trump       and a push against globalization. Mr. Immelt has walked a careful line by defending global trade and the Paris Accord on climate change.Mr. Immelt bought and sold more than $100 billion worth of business in his time as CEO but said in a letter to investors this year that the \u201cGE portfolio is pretty well set.\u201dMr. Flannery, in a meeting for employees Monday, made it clear that he would be conducting his own review. \u201cI want to start with a fresh look around the company overall,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to go through a deep review with a sense of urgency.\u201dOn Monday, investors cheered the news of Mr. Immelt\u2019s departure, sending shares up 3.9%.

Some estimate the new system will add nearly 1 percentage point to India\u2019s GDP growth within a few years.But the risks could drag on short-term economic growth, experts say. Among the hurdles are getting millions of companies to register, educating them on how to file online, poor internet connections and widespread tax avoidance. The design of the new nationwide Goods and Services Tax\u2014which replaces a value-added tax and other levies\u2014also is more complex than many expected.A chaotic rollout could roil an economy still hobbled by a cash shortage caused by the elimination of the bank notes in November.\u201cThis is one of the biggest changes we have undertaken since independence,\u201d said Neelkanth Mishra, India equity analyst at Credit Suisse.The government says it will implement the tax on schedule, simplifying the tax structure and lifting the economy.India ranks 172nd\u00a0out of 190 countries in the World Bank\u2019s ease of paying taxes index.\u00a0It has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios in the world, at 16.6%, versus an OECD average of 34%. That deprives the government of revenue for much-needed improvements to education, health care, sanitation, infrastructure and other state priorities.The new tax has already registered 80% of the 7 million current VAT business payers, the government says, and it hopes to bring in most of the rest. The challenge, experts say, will be registering millions of other small and medium-size enterprises in India that aren\u2019t registered.Among the more than 160 countries that use a value-added tax, India\u2019s is among the most complex. It has four tax brackets, exemptions for products like petroleum\u00a0and additional levies on luxury goods.\u00a0It will split revenue between states and the central government. The rules are the result of years of wrangling between political parties, states and central government in the world\u2019s biggest democracy, a country of 1.2 billion people.Kunal Kumar Kundu, analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, called it \u201cthe world\u2019s most complicated VAT framework,\u201d saying that compliance will likely be burdensome, particularly for small businesses.             HSBC                   initially projected that the system would add 0.8% to India\u2019s GDP growth but halved its projection after the government announced the multiple tax brackets.\u201cIt\u2019s not ideal,\u201d said Pranjul Bhandari, HSBC\u2019s chief economist for India.The new system requires most businesses with\u00a0annual\u00a0revenue above 2 million rupees ($31,000) to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will need to be stable enough to accept billions of documents.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether [policy makers] know the complications in a small trade,\u201d said Biju John, a rubber dealer in the southern state of Kerala. \u201cWe are in rural areas, where internet connectivity is poor.\u201dBusinesses\u2019 invoices will be matched with those of their suppliers or vendors, who must provide their tax number before they can claim a credit. Analysts commend the use of peer pressure to make businesses comply.\u201cThe government has made you the tax collector,\u201d Uday Pimprikar, a partner at Ernst and Young who specializes in indirect taxation told a seminar hall packed with business owners and accountants in Mumbai this month.At scenes like this playing out across the country, merchants anxiously ask questions and voice hopes the government will delay implementation. Many businesses say they are still awaiting guidance on how the new tax will work.\u201cThere are no clear insights given on how to process\u201d it, said Parag Malde, owner of Jupiter Impex, a textile company in Mumbai.As the registration deadline looms, some businesses say they plan to stop taking orders while the tax is implemented. Others say they will wait to see what happens.\u201cEven our accountants are clueless on how to comply with the rules,\u201d said Naresh Patel, owner of R&D Plastics in the western city of Ahmedabad. \u201cIt will likely be a painful transition for us.\u201dAnkit Tanna, director of Mumbai-based printing company Printmann group, said his company sent three reminders to suppliers to register.\u201cWe told them: \u2018If by\u00a0June 15\u00a0we do not have a [tax] number from you, we will be discontinuing our orders.\u2019\u201dTwo of his staff have helped vendors register. \u201cA teacher can only teach, ultimately,\u201d but it is up to them to comply, Mr. Tanna said.Once in place, the system will create a single market, potentially allowing global companies like Unilever, Amazon and Nestl\u00e9 to consolidate operations.Wal-Mart India this month said it was setting up a new tax helpline for the mom-and-pop shops that buy goods from its wholesaling business. The company said it wanted to help all its partners make a smooth transition to the new system. Amazon said it was conducting tax webinars for sellers and had produced written and video guides for them.But few expect implementation to be easy.\u201cIndia is trying to attempt what some of the leading economies do not have,\u201d said Abhay Laijawala, head of India equities research for             Deutsche Bank.       \u201cEven the United States does not have\u201d such a system.Write to Corinne Abrams at corinne.abrams@wsj.com and Debiprasad Nayak at debi.nayak@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 12:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-indian-businesses-will-soon-try-something-new-paying-taxes-1497259927", "news_title": "Millions of Indian Businesses Will Soon Try Something New: Paying Taxes", "keywords": "india,modi,tax,Jupiter Impex,Amazon.com,AMZN,economic performance,indicators,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news"}, {"content": "FORT BELVOIR, Va.\u2014The U.S. Army has commissioned a study to determine whether an anesthetic injection to the neck alleviates symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder\u2014a treatment that, if proven effective, could be a big step toward easing an affliction affecting hundreds of thousands of troops who have returned from combat.The $2 million Army study constitutes the first large-scale randomized control research into use of the shots\u2014called stellate ganglion blocks\u2014to treat PTSD. The injections have been used for decades for arm pain and shingles.In recent years, some military doctors have begun treating PTSD patients, particularly Navy SEALs and Army Green Berets, with the injections. The shots interrupt messages along nerve fibers that control the fight-or-flight response.That early clinical experience has produced promising results, with troops experiencing near-immediate relief of anxiety, hyper-vigilance, social withdrawal and other symptoms, said military doctors who have administered the treatment. They include Col. Jim Lynch, command surgeon at the joint Special Operations Command-Africa, which deploys elite troops to train local forces and conduct missions in Africa.\u201cOnce people have the shot, they get dramatically better immediately,\u201d Dr. Lynch said. The shot isn\u2019t a cure, he said, but eases symptoms enough to allow talk therapy, pharmaceuticals and other approaches to achieve long-term improvements.The treatment occupies an unusual medical netherworld. Most of the doctors who have administered it said they firmly believe it works. The wider military, hewing to standard medical practice, won\u2019t endorse the treatment without evidence from a controlled trial such as the one the Army has commissioned.\u201cIt has yet to be proven that it really does work,\u201d said psychologist Ron Hoover, who oversees the new PTSD study on behalf of the Army. \u201cThe Army takes a fairly conservative position about treatments or any kind of medical care. They don\u2019t want to risk service members\u2019 lives or experiment on them.\u201dResearchers are finding it difficult, though, to recruit volunteers for the study because likely candidates have already heard promising reports about the treatment from comrades, said co-principal investigator Kristine Rae Olmsted of RTI International, a nonprofit research organization hired by the Army to conduct the study.Of the 240 patients that researchers hope to enroll, 80 would receive a harmless saline injection to distinguish the real shot\u2019s medical impact from any placebo effect. PTSD sufferers know they can get the genuine injection free from military hospitals without signing up for the study and risking getting a placebo, Ms. Olmsted said. \u201cThe problem,\u201d she said, \u201cis word of mouth is very powerful.\u201dResearchers began enrolling subjects last summer at military hospitals in Germany, Hawaii and North Carolina. RTI said only 45 had volunteered.Between 11% and 20% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer from PTSD in a given year, according to the National Center for PTSD, an arm of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Commanders worry that PTSD reduces the combat effectiveness of those still in the military and can make life a misery for those who have left it. Sufferers are often irritable, edgy and quick to anger.The most common psychological treatments, called exposure therapies\u2014in which a PTSD sufferer repeatedly revisits the traumatic event in order to weaken its effect\u2014ease symptoms in about 60% of those with combat-related PTSD, according to an estimate by psychologist JoAnn Difede, director of the Program for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Studies at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital.About the same percentage see at least some improvement from the most frequently used anti-PTSD drugs\u2014selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u2014but only 20% to 30% see complete remission from the drugs, according to 2014 research led by Dr. Difede.Physicians such as Dr. Lynch who advocate use of the stellate ganglion block say it improves the effectiveness of traditional treatments.The conundrum surrounding the new Army study highlights both the injection\u2019s promise and the frustration its advocates feel trying to win it wider acceptance beyond the special-operations troops who are already convinced.\u201cHonestly, I feel like I\u2019ve let people down,\u201d said Army Dr. Sean Mulvaney, a former Navy SEAL who practices at Fort Belvoir, Va., and said he had administered more than 600 stellate ganglion injections to PTSD patients. Among most military doctors, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not getting traction.\u201dThe Department of Veterans Affairs said it has no specific policy regarding use of stellate ganglion blocks to treat PTSD among those who have left the military. Doctors use the injections for PTSD on a \u201climited\u201d basis at their discretion, a VA spokesman said. The department is conducting a small research project on the injections at its medical center in Long Beach, Calif.The prospects of generating scientific consensus are clouded by the nature of the population suffering from PTSD. Doctors say some veterans are problematic trial subjects because they have an incentive to stay sick\u2014the VA pays benefits to those suffering from combat-induced PTSD. The elite commandos who have already become fans of the injections have the opposite incentive\u2014active-duty SEALs and Green Berets usually want to show improvement so they can stay with their teams, doctors say.In the stellate ganglion procedure, doctors inject the anesthetic ropivacaine in the right side of the neck, using ultrasound to guide the needle to the area around the target nerves. The right side of the brain controls the fight-or-flight reaction. Doctors surmise that in patients with PTSD, messages between the brain and body get stuck in a loop. The anesthetic resets the system.The drug is marketed under the brand name Naropin by Germany\u2019s Fresenius Kabi AG and, according to RTI, costs less than $2 a dose. Most patients require just one injection, although some return for a second shot, doctors say.One of the patients is Dr. Lynch\u2019s commander, Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc, a Green Beret who has served more than five years in Afghanistan. He was injured by an errant 2,000-lb. American bomb in 2001 and again in a 2005 helicopter crash.Gen. Bolduc said he came home with symptoms from headaches and memory loss to excessive alertness and flashes of anger. He was diagnosed with PTSD in 2014 and received his first of two stellate ganglion blocks. His wife, he said, noticed the change in his demeanor on the drive home.The shot \u201cgives you the break to deal with things,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to put myself on the road to recovery.\u201d He said he is also on medication for anxiety and depression as part of a broad treatment plan for his PTSD and injuries. The injection, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop you from operating effectively in a combat environment.\u201dIn a 2014 study led by Drs. Lynch and Mulvaney, researchers injected a local anesthetic into the necks of 166 service members suffering from PTSD. They concluded the injection is a \u201csafe and minimally invasive procedure that may provide at least 3 months of relief from symptoms associated with combat-related PTSD.\u201dThat study didn\u2019t feature a control group. One small controlled study published in 2015 found no statistically significant difference between effects from one stellate ganglion block and the placebo. Patients showed improvement after a second injection.\u201cThe most obvious explanation would be that the previously reported benefits for PTSD were attributable to placebo effect,\u201d psychiatrist Robert McLay, then the research director at Naval Medical Center San Diego, said at the time. He said this year he believes the treatment is worthy of further study.The Army study is intended to settle the debate.Write to Michael M.

Ms. Le Pen on Monday faced a final election result that showed the momentum that carried her in to last month\u2019s second-round presidential vote had perished.National Front candidates garnered only 13.2% of Sunday\u2019s vote, compared with 13.6% in the last parliamentary election five years ago. Pollster Ipsos Sopra-Steria projected the party would end up with only between one and five seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, compared with between 415 and 455 for Mr. Macron\u2019s party and its centrist ally.What caused the collapse, pollsters and party officials say, is that the National Front\u2019s primarily young, working-class base decided to sit out the parliamentary races. Around 57% of people who voted for Marine Le Pen in the presidential election stayed home for the parliamentary ballot, Ipsos Sopra-Steria said. The abstention rate among Macron voters was 38%.The numbers stand in contrast to the National Front\u2019s high expectations going into the 2017 races. In recent years, the party had drawn nearly a third of the vote in local, regional and European Parliament elections.\u201cThis clearly marks a pause in a very, very strong progression,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said Monday while campaigning for a seat in the north of France.Supporters who expected Ms. Le Pen to win the first round of the presidential race were disappointed when she finished behind Mr. Macron. Her 33.9% score in the runoff also fell far short of the 40% mark she was hitting in the polls.What followed was soul-searching. Ms. Le Pen floated the possibility of renaming and restructuring her party before deserting the idea. She also promised to hold a party congress after the parliamentary elections to discuss the National Front\u2019s anti-euro stance, which many of the rank-and-file blamed for her presidential loss.\u201cAll voters have is disappointment from the presidential election, and all they hear about is internal difficulties,\u201d said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, a pollster with IFOP.Mr. Fourquet and other analysts say Ms. Le Pen is likely to retain leadership of the National Front, because the party\u2019s identity is built around her family. They say the only figure who might have challenged her for leadership was her niece, Marion Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen, who quit the party shortly after the presidential loss, saying she wanted to spend time with family.In 2012, Ms. Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen won the party\u2019s only seat in the National Assembly, winning 34.65% of the first-round vote in a southern French district. The National Front candidate now running for her seat, Herv\u00e9 de L\u00e9pinau, won 31.81% of the vote on Sunday behind the La R\u00e9publique en Marche candidate.The party\u2019s best shot for landing a parliamentary seat is in Pas de Calais, an area hard-hit by migrant flows and industrial decline, where Ms. Le Pen herself is running.Ms. Le Pen scored 46.02% on Sunday, nearly 30 points ahead of her La R\u00e9publique en Marche rival, Anne Roquet.But Ms. Le Pen and other National Front candidates face the same hurdle she tripped over in the presidential race: People who voted for other candidates in the first round are expected to coalesce behind her rival.Write to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com and Stacy Meichtry at stacy.meichtry@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'National Front Loses Big in France.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 12:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/marine-le-pens-national-front-faces-reckoning-after-loss-in-french-vote-1497286027", "news_title": "Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front Faces Reckoning After Loss in French Vote", "keywords": "Marine Le Pen,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Paul Gigot: Welcome to \u201cThe Journal Editorial Report.\u201d I\u2019m       Paul Gigot.

Bush.Judge, welcome.Michael Mukasey: Good to be here.Gigot: Let\u2019s focus first on what\u2019s the appropriate behavior for a senior Justice Department official, like the FBI director, in interacting with the president of the United States because when you go into the Oval Office, it\u2019s an intimidating thing, I guess. How was he supposed to behave when the president pulls him aside and says something like he said with -- by       Michael Flynn      ?Mukasey: The same way he would behave any place else. Yes, the Oval Office -- the idea of the Oval Office is intimidating, he may be in fact, intimidating for the first few times you\u2019re there, for the first 15 minutes.If you\u2019ve been the U.S. attorney in two districts, if you\u2019ve been the deputy attorney general, if you\u2019ve been for a number of years the director of the FBI, and you\u2019re intimidated by being in the Oval Office, you\u2019re in the wrong job.Gigot: How should he have reacted to that?Mukasey: If he thought what he says he thought, he should have said, Mr. President, we can\u2019t have this conversation.Gigot: And he said he thought he was being directed to shut down that portion of the probe, the Flynn probe, he should have said, we can\u2019t have this conversation and talk to the attorney general?Mukasey: Sure. Talk to the attorney general. I don\u2019t think that it would have been reporting a crime but he should have talked to the attorney general immediately so that anybody else was aware of what had happened when everybody left the room.Gigot: What about the idea that James Comey has talked about, he used the word, he said, \u201cThe FBI is traditionally been independent of the executive branch.\u201d Is that true?Mukasey: No, it\u2019s not true. The FBI is in the executive branch and it is not independent. There\u2019s a very funny story about       Ramsey Clark,        when he first became A.G., showed up on a Saturday and wearing a sport jacket and was stopped in the hall by a watchman who said, can I see your I.D. He said, well, I\u2019m the attorney general. That\u2019s fine, show me your I.D. He said, no, I\u2019m the attorney general. He said I don\u2019t think if you\u2019re       J. Edgar Hoover       himself, show me your I.D. That\u2019s some people\u2019s idea of the FBI being independent but it\u2019s not.Gigot: So the FBI director and the Justice Department are part of the executive branch and they\u2019re subject to the political accountability of the president of the United States, and yet there\u2019s some tension there because you don\u2019t want political actors directing investigations or saying stop that investigation, so there is -- there is some tension, there is some art to this?Mukasey: There is. You don\u2019t want political actors doing that. At the same time, if there are, for example, reasons of state why investigations should be stopped, if somebody is investigating a relatively minor crime committed by some foreign diplomat or by somebody in whom the president has a much larger interest, he would be perfectly proper in saying I want that investigation shut down, there are bigger things at stakes here.Gigot: Was the president\u2019s behavior, in your mind, improper? I\u2019m not saying illegal, I\u2019m just saying improper first.Mukasey: Sure.Gigot: Shouldn\u2019t have acted that way?Mukasey: There are a lot of things that you don\u2019t do, not because they\u2019re against the law, because you simply don\u2019t do them, and that\u2019s one of them.Gigot: What about the question of obstruction of justice, do you see any of that in the facts that Comey laid out?Mukasey: No.Gigot: Why not?Mukasey: The obstruction of justice statute in so far as it\u2019s relevant requires that the president acted corruptly, unless he acted by force, which obviously he didn\u2019t. So that he acted corruptly -- that means doing something lawful by an unlawful means or doing something unlawful -- he didn\u2019t do either one of those. It wasn\u2019t that he took a bribe in order to shut down the investigation, it wasn\u2019t that he offered a bribe in order to shut down the investigation, he acted apparently out of concern for -- for Flynn, perhaps even out of concern for himself. That\u2019s not corruptly.Gigot: What about the chain of events, I would hope to let this go and then, later, some months later, he fired Comey. Is that of a chain of events that he was trying to shut down the probe by firing Comey?Mukasey: If you want to shut down a probe, you don\u2019t shut down the probe by firing somebody to whom the people who are conducting the probe report.Gigot: I think that\u2019s been proven by the fact of all the uproar.Mukasey: Correct. That\u2019s not the way you shut down a probe?Gigot: Comey is kind of having it both ways. On the one hand, he says, I felt directed to shut down the probe, on the other hand, I\u2019m not saying it was obstruction of justice. But if he really felt it was directed, OK, he was being told, look, you must do this, why -- didn\u2019t he have an obligation to go back to the Justice Department, tell the attorney general, and maybe tap out a resignation letter saying, I cannot work for somebody who is directing me not to investigate something?Gigot: That\u2019s certainly an alternative. You recall, when he was deputy attorney general, the famous hospital scene, and he did threaten to resign unless they changed the program.Gigot: Right. I think he typed out the letter in advance of that meeting.Mukasey: Right. In fact, he was joined with the man who is now supposedly investigating all of this,       Robert Mueller.       The two of them both threatened to resign.Gigot: That is right.Comey clearly said -- but if Comey said I believe there was obstruction at the time, then he would have had to talked to the attorney general and maybe resigned.Mukasey: Threatened to resign.Gigot: You\u2019d would think he would.What do you make of him going back to the FBI, as he testified, telling half a dozen or 10 colleagues about this, and then keeping it quiet, essentially sticking his notes into a drawer, and then keeping it quiet from everybody until he was fired?Mukasey: That\u2019s what\u2019s known as having an ace in the hole. Not only did he create a memo, he created a memo that was, by design, not classified so that he could have it leaked eventually. Gave it to somebody else to leak so that he wouldn\u2019t have his fingerprints on it immediately, and assured that, according to his own statement, that a special prosecutor, special counsel would be appointed. That\u2019s an extraordinarily devious thing to do.Gigot: Bottom line, if based on the fact that is we know, there\u2019s not an impeachable offense or indictable offense in what we learned?Mukasey: An impeachable offense is what Congress says is an impeachable offense.Gigot: It\u2019s a political act?Mukasey: It\u2019s a political act. And it\u2019s a gross neglect of duty or abuse of power. It needn\u2019t be a crime. I don\u2019t think this rises to an impeachable act but that\u2019s for Congress to decide. It is not a crime.Gigot: All right, Judge, thanks very much for being here. Appreciate it.Mukasey: Good to be here.Gigot: Much more to come as we break down the Comey testimony. Should the former FBI director have voiced his concerns about President Trump earlier or even resigned? Our panel weighs in next.Sen.       Dianne Feinstein       : Why didn\u2019t you stop and say, Mr. President, this is wrong, I cannot discuss this with you?Comey: That\u2019s a great question. Maybe if I were stronger, I would have.Sen.       Marco Rubio       : At the time, did you say anything to the president about that, it\u2019s not an appropriate request? Did you tell the White House counsel that\u2019s not an appropriate request, somebody needs to tell the president that he can\u2019t do these things?Comey: I didn\u2019t, no.Rubio: Why?Comey: I don\u2019t know. I think, as I said earlier, the circumstances were such that it was -- I was a bit stunned and didn\u2019t have the presence of mind. And I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to make you sound like I\u2019m Captain Courageous. I don\u2019t know. If I had the presence of mind, I would have said, sir, that\u2019s wrong.Gigot: Florida Senator Marco Rubio Thursday questioning why former Director James Comey didn\u2019t immediately report his concerns about President Trump\u2019s behavior to the White House counsel\u2019s office.Let\u2019s bring in \u201cWall Street Journal\u201d columnist and deputy editor,       Dan Henninger      ; Washington columnist,       Kim Strassel      ; and editorial board member,       Joe Rago.Dan, does this self-description of Comey\u2019s behavior, I didn\u2019t have the self-possession to address the president and tell him that isn\u2019t appropriate, does that wash in your mind?Dan Henninger: I don\u2019t think it washes. It doesn\u2019t wash in my mind. And more importantly, it doesn\u2019t wash in the American people, everybody who watched that. I would include even Democrats.There something about the Comey narrative that didn\u2019t quite add up, and that exchange with Senator Rubio was a perfect example. Virtually everybody listening to what his description of what went on in the Oval Office, certainly anybody who has been around Washington, would have said, something improper happened there. You\u2019re the director of the FBI and he could have walked out of that office and gone to White House counsel and said, the president has just done something improper, let me tell you, you have to go in and explain to him that this sort of thing can\u2019t happen, or even have gone to the attorney general. And to say, I don\u2019t know, I was so startled, strange.Gigot: If he didn\u2019t want to go the White House counsel because, oh, well, and he thought the White House counsel\u2019s intimidated by the president, the attorney general of the United States is his immediate superior, the deputy attorney general, but then the attorney general, and you should do that. And he said he didn\u2019t want to do because he thought, Joe, that the attorney general was going to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Did he know that at the time?Joe Rago: That\u2019s the big question. How did he know that? It\u2019s another --Gigot: He couldn\u2019t have known, because he rescued himself two weeks later, right?Rago: Right. Unless he\u2019s a fortune teller. His whole narrative is, I was so stunned, I just couldn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t have the composure to do anything, but he goes back and writes a memo to himself, he discusses it with a half dozen of his senior deputies, and then reserves all of this information for himself, doesn\u2019t inform the public, doesn\u2019t tell any of his superiors. It just doesn\u2019t add up.Gigot: Let\u2019s take a clip with an exchange with Senator Risch and Comey.Comey: The president of the United States with me alone saying I hope this, I took it as this is what he wants me to do. I didn\u2019t obey that but that\u2019s the way I took it.Sen. James Risch: You may have taken it as a direction but that\u2019s not what he said?Comey: Correct.Sen. James Risch: He said, I hope.Comey: Those were his exact words, correct.Sen. James Risch: You don\u2019t know of anybody who has been charged for hoping, is that a fair statement?Comey: I don\u2019t, as I sit here.Gigot: Kim, that\u2019s crucial to this question of obstruction, as Judge Mukasey made clear. I mean, do you think that looking at all of this there is -- the Democrats are many are going to say this is obstruction, but what about the ultimate impact here? Is that going to play politically, do you think?Kim Strassel: No. I don\u2019t. I mean, they\u2019re going to try to make it, but this is a pretty devastating blow that Jim Comey ultimately made to the Democratic case that there was obstruction, because you look at the exact words, and he has them there in black and white, and even he had to admit, under testinomy, that the clear meaning of those words \u201chope\u201d was not a direction. He could take it the other way and Democrats can make a big fuss over that, but it\u2019s pretty clear cut on a piece of paper.Gigot: All right, Dan?Henninger: Yeah, I want to add one point here. Judge Mukasey just explained to us that impeachment is a political decision, right, by the House of Representatives and the Democrats have been trying to run this offense against Donald Trump as a political event. Jim Comey\u2019s appearance was one of the melodramatic political events in Washington in years, and it just didn\u2019t live up to its billing. He did not make the case for them in the way they we wanted to that the president had done something in violation of the law.Gigot: All right, but there\u2019s still political damage, Joe. I agree with Dan\u2019s overall summary. He called him a liar. Trump -- if you want to read the worst into it, Trump was trying to subtly imply, hey, do me a favor here, you know. And there\u2019s a couple of exchanges, Comey described him as a patronage relationship. Where I don\u2019t believe Comey is he\u2019s not a babe in the woods, as Judge Mukasey said. This guy, he\u2019s a bear-knuckle bureaucratic fighter who knows how to really put presidents in their place, frankly.Rago: Right, look, this is a guy, a consummate professional, whose caused crises in every administration in which he served. We had Bush administration over wiretapping under       Obama,        we had the       Hillary Clinton       e- mail investigation and his improper exoneration of her in the summer, and now this. It leads me to believe that -- that you\u2019re exactly right, that he knows what he\u2019s doing. When Trump had this       Tony Soprano       behavior, like maybe this case -- it would be nice if it went away. Comey was probably thrilled. This is exactly the kind of material that he can use as political insurance.Gigot: And he went back and typed the memo and kept it as a form of political insurance. You never know when you\u2019re going to need that.Rago: No. And he said explicitly that he leaked it in the hopes of prompting a special counsel.Gigot: We want to get into it in the next block.When we come back, the White House goes on offense in an effort to move beyond the Russia probe and keep the president\u2019s agenda on track, but is their strategy a smart one?President Trump: No collusion, no obstruction. He\u2019s a leaker. But we want to get back to running our great country.Trump attorney       Marc Kasowitz       : Mr. Comey has now finally confirmed publicly what he repeatedly told President Trump privately, that is that the president was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian interference. Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony also makes clear that the president never thought to impede the investigation into attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election.Gigot: That was President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, Thursday responding to James Comey\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill. The president himself tweeted Friday, \u201cDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication. And, wow, Comey is a leaker.\u201dWe are back with Dan Henninger and Kim Strassel and Joe Rago.Kim, I want to address the question of leaks first. And we have Comey talking about how he directed a leak of his memos. Let\u2019s look.Comey: The president tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope that there\u2019s not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn\u2019t dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for our conversation, there might be a tape, and my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square. And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with the reporter. Didn\u2019t do it myself for a variety of reasons. But I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.Gigot: Kim, that\u2019s pretty remarkable. Not the fact that he leaked through a cut-out, that happens all of the time in Washington, we should tell our viewers that, but the fact that Comey said he deliberately leaked it to trigger a special counsel probe.Strassel: The deliberateness of it, also the ease with which he described the process that he went through to leaking. This is now part of the discussion in Washington, is, was this the first time that he did this? You know, if you think back and you step back, the last six months of drama, almost all of it has come from anonymously-sourced stories, often mostly wrong, but from different members of the intelligence community. And it\u2019s a very disturbing question about where all of these are coming from. And it opens up a new question into Comey himself and whether or not he\u2019s ever done this before.Gigot: It sounds to me that he\u2019s looking for political, I mean he really does -- he wants Mueller to be able to nail Trump. That\u2019s the implication I take out of this. He wanted that special counsel and he has teed Mueller up to be able to conclude that there was obstruction of justice. That\u2019s how I read it.Strassel: Look, if you want to be cynical, you can make the argument, he never corrected the president of what the appropriate behavior should be, instead he went and took all these secret memos and kept building all this dossier, and now he\u2019s tossing it all over to       Bob Mueller.       Maybe that was his goal along to bring down a president.Gigot: And, Dan, I don\u2019t think there are tapes. Remember when Donald Trump tweeted, you better watch out if there are tapes, and Comey refer to that in his clip there, but Kasowitz now has denied flat-out that Trump ever asked for loyalty so I doubt that there are tapes.Henninger: It doesn\u2019t look like it. And it seems the loyalty oath is subset minor issue here.But there\u2019s a couple of things that have gotten sort of joined here that, I think, need to be separated. Comey established that Trump was not the target of an investigation involving the Russian penetration of the campaign. What was involved in this conversation was the probe of Michael Flynn, right?Gigot: Right.Henninger: And the Michael Flynn probe is not the Russian probe. Flynn may be involved in that, but these are separate things. If he has established that the president was not a target, now we know that, as a matter of fact, unless at some point further on, the new special counsel decides to pull the president into it. But I think that was the big thing that Donald Trump was looking for.Gigot: We also have something that came up regarding the Clinton -- the Obama administration, the --       Loretta Lynch       was involved. Let\u2019s listen.Comey: At one point, the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation but instead to call it \u201ca matter,\u201d which confused me and concerned me.Gigot: He said he felt queasy about that and described it as \u201ca matter\u201d anyway. What do you make of that. Sounds like there was a little political pressure in the Obama administration for Comey to downplay the e- mail probe.Rago: The contradiction here is, even as Comey sort of conjures up the independent FBI, a sovereign law enforcement agency, is antithetical to --Gigot: Under the Constitution.Rago: -- democracy and political accountability. If he truly thought the FBI was independent, then Loretta Lynch\u2019s political interference in the Clinton investigation should have prompted the exact same kind of blow-up that he had over Donald Trump and the Russia investigation, but it didn\u2019t and it suggests that he was more concerned about preserving his job than his professed principles.Gigot: So bottom line is that this, it seems to me, that this didn\u2019t live up to the political hype but did do some harm to Trump. The real threat to him now, to Trump\u2019s presidential future, is Robert Mueller and the special counsel probe, because we never know where that can go. And clearly, Comey was teeing Mueller up to -- to maybe do some damage to the president.All right, still ahead, Britain\u2019s general election ends in a hung parliament in a stunning setback for Prime Minister       Theresa May\u2019s       Conservative Party. What does it mean for Brexit talks? We will have a report from London, next.Gigot: A stunning upset in the United Kingdom general election Thursday with British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Conservative Party losing its majority in parliament. The vote coming less than three days of terror attacks in less than three months, putting national security front and center in the campaign\u2019s final week.\u201dWall Street Journal\u201d editorial page writer, Sohrab Amari, joins us from London.Welcome, Sohrab.So Theresa May is --Sohrab Ahmari       : Hi, Paul.Gigot: -- is going to try, despite being a minority now, is going to try to form a government with the help of the Irish and the Unionists. Is she going to be able to pull that off?Ahmari: Well, the queen has authorized her to try to do that. Obviously now the ball is in her court to be able to, first of all, get a firm commitment from the Democratic Unionist Party, the small Northern Irish Unionist Party --Gigot: Right.Ahmari: -- and then to be able to both convince them and then to be able to convince her fellow Tories that she\u2019s the person to lead the party, and then it all goes to parliament. So it\u2019s going to be a mess. And whatever government emerges, and there\u2019s still chance that Theresa May will be prime minister when the dust settles, will be fragile and weak and vulnerable.Gigot: She went into this election -- she didn\u2019t have to call it until 2020. She went into this thinking I will get a much bigger majority, because I have a 20-point lead over Labour.       Jeremy Corbyn       isn\u2019t even popular with Labour voters, all of Labour voters, so this is a perfect time to strike. It seemed, I guess, a reasonable bet but how can he stay as prime minister and leader of the party after she led them into an election against Corbyn and lost seats?Ahmari: Well, that\u2019s why I think the Tory\u2019s are actually notoriously brutal, the activist base of the party once they feel the Labour leader is in effective. Unlike the Labour side, which for years had hung onto Jeremy Corbyn, who was seen as unelectable, but now he feels triumphant, the Tories tend to be pretty ruthless with leaders they feel aren\u2019t working out. So I wonder if -- I image, in fact, I\u2019m certain that the processes are underway to try to think of alternatives, whether that means bringing       George Osbourne       back to put forward a more traditionally pro-growth, limited government-type Toryism, as opposed to Theresa May\u2019s vision to, quote, unquote, \u201cworking class Toryism,\u201d that emphasized communitarian solidarity and goes after the big, bad business practices and so forth, or --Gigot: George Osbourne --Ahmari: -- or it could be       Boris Johnson.       I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s all very fluid.Gigot: George Osbourne was the chancellor of the exchequer under       David Cameron.       Now he\u2019s out of parliament and even a practicing journalist, god forbid. I don\u2019t know if he wants to get into politics. So how did she lose a 20-point lead?Ahmari: Well, I think there\u2019s a couple of factors. One is, I think the Brexit focus her government put forward had become tiresome in the sense that Brexit was in some ways a settled question, and yet the focus of her government was, we are going to be tough in Brexit negotiations, whereas, where she came short was putting a vision of, OK, what would a post-Britain look like. And to the extent that she put forward a vision, as I mentioned, it was this idea put forward by a clever but now seems to be discredited campaign guru named Nick Timothy that suggested that Toryism should return to a kind of pre-Thatcher era of emphasizing social solidarity, being OK with raising taxes, and all about regulation, in fact, when government needs to step in when business and markets fall short.(CROSSTALK)Ahmari: And that vision --Gigot: Didn\u2019t work.Ahmari: Didn\u2019t really find buys.Gigot: We\u2019ve got the terror attacks in the last two weeks. What role did that play? And Theresa May had been home secretary, equivalent to Homeland Security secretary here. Did that help or hurt her?Ahmari: I spoke with party insiders ahead of the election and they were so confident that the fact that the country seems to be facing, frankly, a low-grade Islamist insurgency with three attacks in 72 days that that would help her because, for all her other shortcomings, she put herself forward as the steady hand. She wouldn\u2019t engage in debates about these issues of security, precisely because it allowed her, she thought, to stay above the fray and appear like the prime minister, and while the rest of them do get out in these petty forums and debates. All of that taken together, they thought would ensure a victory for her because she was facing a guy, who called Hamas and Hezbollah friends, who wants to disarm the Britain\u2019s national security apparatus, who doesn\u2019t believe in the shoot-to-kill policy when there are terrorists on the streets, and so forth. So given that, they thought she would do well with it. And maybe the reason she didn\u2019t do as bad as it could have been was because of the national security shortcomings of Corbyn.Gigot: Well, one of the lessons is you cannot take voters for granted. They often surprise you.So still ahead, amid the Comey furor on Capitol Hill, the GOP fights to keep its agenda on track. So could Senate Republicans unveil their health care bill as early as next week?President Trump: Across America, premiums are skyrocketing, insurers are fleeing, and the American people are paying much more for much-worse coverage. Obamacare is in a total death spiral. And the problems will only get worse if Congress fails to act. Obamacare is dead.Gigot: President Trump Wednesday urging Congress to act on plans to repeal and replace Obamacare as Senate Republicans continue to hash out their bill behind closed doors. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told the president this week that a vote could come by July 4th. Pressure is mounting on the GOP as Anthem, Blue Cross/Blue Shield announced this week that it will pull out in exchanges in many Ohio counties next year, sighting growing uncertainty over the law\u2019s future.We are back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Joe Rago.Joe, how much progress are the Senate Republicans making behind the scenes?Rago: They are making a lot of progress, in the sense that they\u2019ve studied this issue more than any other. Everybody says they\u2019re working as well together as they ever have.Gigot: Wow. That\u2019s saying something.Rago: That\u2019s progress.Gigot: That\u2019s a fractious bunch.Rago: At this point, they know what the policies are, they know what the trade-ups are. It\u2019s time to make a decision.Gigot: And the trade-offs are all geared, from McConnell\u2019s point of view, you get to 50 votes?Rago: Exactly.Gigot: The problems here, the disputes here about how rich to make the subsidies for the insurance on the exchanges, how much --- what to do with Medicaid in particular, how much authority you give back to the states, and how much money you pay in Medicaid going forward from the federal government, and how much -- how many taxes in Obamacare to cut?Rago: Right, it\u2019s all about turning those dials, how long of an off-ramp do you have, do you maybe preserve some of the taxes in order to make the subsidies more generous. Ultimately, I think Leader McConnell, he\u2019s going to make a prudential decision about what can get to a majority, put it on the floor, have a vote, have accountability. And what he\u2019s been telling members is we can either vote for this, defend the success, or we can apologize for a failure. And if we are going to fail, you\u2019re going to have to produce a body. If you\u2019re going to kill this, we are going to have a vote.Gigot: You\u2019re going to have a vote.And, Kim, McConnell is also telling his members, look, if we don\u2019t do something on this, Obamacare is going downhill, sliding, we may end up having a debate amongst ourselves in the next year or so about how to bail out the exchanges. And if we make this an issue in 2018 and 2020, what\u2019s going to happen is the Democrats, if they get power next time, they will make the same mistake as Obamacare again, they\u2019re going to go with single payer.Strassel: Yeah, he\u2019s right. This is the point to make because this is just not, by the way, long-term political consequences, you see it happening already. As you get more news like what happened with Anthem this week, you already see Democrats, they\u2019re developing new talking points. They are out there saying, look, all of this problem you see in the health care market, it isn\u2019t because of Obamacare, it\u2019s because of the uncertainty that\u2019s being caused by Republicans not doing anything in terms of their reform on the health care bill. So there is an urgency for them to get something out and send a message to the markets to help calm things before this message gets dug in with the left and the public.Gigot:       Rand Paul,        Kentucky Senator, looks like he\u2019s not going to vote for anything here. So that is just give one vote to spare. A really narrow margin for McConnell, because Democrats have decided they\u2019re going to try to oppose everything that Trump does.Henninger: Yeah, there\u2019s a lot at risk right here. You know, the Republicans are trying to do something on the substance. One of the interesting things is they would like to move responsibility from Medicaid out into the states and there\u2019s some interesting things going on --Gigot: With some still federal funding.Henninger: With federal funding.Gigot: With substantial federal funding.Henninger: But the states are already trying to experiment with Medicaid. Just this week, the Nevada legislature passed a bill that would allow people in Nevada to pay to get into Medicaid if they wanted to. You can use Obamacare credits or your own money, if that\u2019s what you want to do. I think it was a bad idea but sounds like an interesting experiment. Indiana allows people to put aside money who are on the poverty line to buy their own private insurance. It\u2019s been working well in Indiana.The Republicans have something to argue on behalf of, that the states are better equipped to handle something this complex.Gigot: Joe, in the bill that McConnell is putting together, it\u2019s not going to be as conservative as the House bill, but it\u2019s going to have substantial conservative victories in terms of substantial tax cuts, the evolution of the entitlement, the most substantial reform of Medicaid in a long time, maybe ever, and significant reform of the exchanges. The question is, will conservatives accept that as enough?Rago: Yeah, that\u2019s the big question. Are they going to decide to govern, to make directional progress on -- on their policy goals, or try to defeat this? I think that\u2019s a real question. When you have the House bill come out first, the right hit it hard. They\u2019re going to have to, I think, be more pragmatic in this case to have any hope of forward advance.Gigot: All right, Joe, thank you.When we come back, President Trump unveils a plan to privatize America\u2019s air traffic control system. What it could mean for your future flights.Gigot: That was President Trump on Monday kicking off what the White House dubbed infrastructure week. The president unveiling a plan to privatize the nation\u2019s air traffic control system, spinning it off from the government-run Federal Aviation Administration to a nonprofit, a move the administration says will make air travel safer and more efficient.Robert Poole       is director of transportation policy at The Reason Foundation. He had advised four presidential administrations.Welcome, Mr. Poole. Good to have you here.A lot of Americans think that air travel, the experience is getting worse. What role does the air traffic control system play in that deterioration?Robert Poole: Well, the air traffic control system is behind the times in terms of its technology. It does not offer the same kind of advanced technologies that enable planes to fly closer together safely and, therefore, get better use out of the air space. And so it does contribute to delays, particularly 40 percent of all the delays occur because of the New York-New Jersey air space near New York City, and that is a terrible mess which the FAA has made a very low priority to solve. And yet, if it were customer-driven, responding to the real needs of its aviation customers that would be a very high priority. They would be working on that right now.Gigot: The FAA knows this technology exists. Global positioning system technology is not new. It\u2019s been around for a long time. Why does the FAA have such a hard time implementing these kinds of advances?Poole: A number of reasons. One, they can\u2019t do revenue bond financing to large-scale procurements because they have to operate on annual allocations from Congress --Gigot: OK.Poole: -- unlike the air traffic corporations in 60 other countries.Secondly, they have a god-awful procurement system. Some members of Congress, some Democrats, said it\u2019s even worse than the Department of Defense\u2019s procurement system.Gigot: That\u2019s saying something.Poole: It takes forever to build things, to design things, build things and get them out into the field. Many of these cases, by the time something hits the field, not only does it not work right the first time, but it\u2019s about 15 years past when they started defining it, and it\u2019s no longer even state-of-the-art.Gigot: OK, the question is, you mentioned 60-some countries have something like this.Poole: Right.Gigot: So, this move to a nonprofit has been tried by other countries. What\u2019s the experience, for example, in Canada?Poole: Canada is one of the best examples. Canada has -- it\u2019s 20 years old. Completely supported by user payments. It\u2019s basically a utility run as user co-op, with the stakeholders from aviation on the governing board. No micro management by the Canadian parliament. And it issues revenue bonds, have an investment-grade bond rating. And it has technology that puts FAA to shame. They have digital pilot controller messaging across the country and across the entire north Atlantic, which we don\u2019t have yet, and won\u2019t have for another eight years on a nationwide basis. They have -- they are putting in global satellite surveillance through an entity that they created called Aerion (ph), that 70 percent of the world\u2019s earth surface doesn\u2019t have a radar. Planes are just out there and they have to have huge buffer zones around them because the controllers don\u2019t know exactly where they are. But with satellite-based surveillance, starting in 2018, will know exactly where they are over the ocean, just like we know over land. Yet, the FAA itself has not signed up to subscribe to this, even though FAA is responsible for huge amounts of oceanic air space.Gigot: So the opponents of this, one of the questions they raise, well, what about safety. If you are going to fly these planes closer together, you\u2019re going to take risks, if you\u2019re not going to have -- if you are going to rely on technology, isn\u2019t there a danger, greater risk to passengers? What\u2019s your response?Poole: The response to that is the United States is the one that\u2019s in a high-risk operation because we don\u2019t have transparency between safety regulation and service provisions. The International Civil Aviation Organization, in 2001, said these two functions, safety regulation and ATC service provisions, should be at arm\u2019s-length organizationally. The United States is the few countries in the whole world that has not made that separation. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why 60 countries over the last 30 years have separated the two organizationally.Gigot: OK. It\u2019s such great idea -- and I like it. I\u2019ve been supporting this -- we have been sporting this at \u201cThe Journal\u201d for more than 20 years. Why --Poole: I know that.Gigot: -- is there so much opposition to this politically? Why is it --Poole: Yeah. A lot of it is a turf battle. Members of Congress really enjoy having the ability to direct, tell the FAA what to do and what not to do. One of the problems, for example, is the FAA has over 500 facilities around the country, not only control towers, but 20 big centers that control high-altitude flights spread across the country. With today\u2019s technology, they can probably do that with three or four --Gigot: Wow.Poole: -- that would be completely be backing each other. And yet, you can\u2019t -- it\u2019s almost impossible to close facilities in somebody\u2019s district. And so you get these kinds of colloquial concerns that prevent the kind of modernization that we really should have and that other countries, with air traffic corporations, are doing. Australia has done this. Germany has done it. The U.K. has done it.Gigot: OK, so let\u2019s hope we can break the gridlock.Thank you for being here.Poole: Thank you.Gigot: We have to take one more break. When we come back, \u201cHits Misses\u201d of the week.Gigot: Time for \u201cHits Misses\u201d of the week.Sohrab, start us off.Ahmari: A hit, Paul, to       Nikki Haley.       The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, this week issued a statement this week saying the U.S. will no longer tolerate the bullying of Israel at the United Nations. This is a welcome break from the Obama administration, which had either tolerated it or, in some cases, shamefully joined in with the U.N. jackals who try to use the U.N. forum to try to distract from their own despotic records and beat up on the world\u2019s sole Jewish state. So this was one of those reasons to cheer the Trump administration and the dramatic foreign policy break that it represents with its predecessor.Gigot: All right, Sohrab, thanks.Kim?Strassel: A hit, Paul, to       Michael Bloomberg,        whose philanthropic arm said it would be sending $15 million to the U.N. to make up for money lost from Trump withdrawing from the       Paris Accord.       I love this model. We have all of these billionaires and celebrities who have their pet causes but expect taxpayers to pay for it. This way, everyone wins. These get to ease their conscience, the U.N. gets the money, taxpayers keep their dollars. Hurray.Gigot: All right, Kim.Joe?Rago: Another hit. This one for the secretary of the Interior,       Ryan Zinke,        who took the first steps this week to de-list the great sage grouse as a protected species. This is basically a glorified chicken. It\u2019s not endangered. It\u2019s not adorable. But the Obama administration used it as a pretext for land management plans that lock up about 60millon acres out west, no development whatsoever. This is a victory for rationality over political environmentalism.Gigot: And, Dan?Henninger: Paul, I\u2019ve got a hit for one of the Democratic Party\u2019s greatest villains, the U.S. energy industry. We have now, it\u2019s been reported that the United States is now exporting, exporting a million barrels of oil a day. There was a time when tankers would come from the Middle East to Texas, unload the oil and go back empty. They\u2019re now filled with American oil, dropping it off in Europe. This is a great story of American innovation and entrepreneurship, and we should hail it.Gigot: Thank you all.That\u2019s it for this week\u2019s show. Thanks to my panel. Thank you for watching. I\u2019m Paul Gigot. We hope to see you right here next week.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 12:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-comeys-strange-testimony-1497285015", "news_title": "James Comey\u2019s Strange Testimony", "keywords": "Mr. Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions,editorials"}, {"content": "Facebook Inc.        FB 0.79%       may soon help its users do something unfamiliar on the platform: pay for news.The social-media giant is building a feature that would allow users to subscribe to publishers directly from the mobile app, according to people familiar with the matter. The feature, long-requested by publishers, is expected to roll out by the end of 2017, three of the people said.Many details remain up in the air, but discussions have centered around making the feature available only on stories published natively to Facebook through its Instant Articles product. Talks have also focused on how to structure the arrangement, with Facebook leaning toward a metered-payment model, which would allow users to read some articles for free each month before prompting them to pay, three of the people familiar with the matter said.Another point under discussion is how payments would be processed and whether Facebook would get a cut of the revenue. One model being looked at is to have Facebook take payment information but let publishers keep all the money, some of the people said.\u201cWe\u2019re working with partners to understand their business and explore ways we can help them drive more value from Facebook. We are taking the time to deeply understand their different goals and needs,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.The new feature would be a boon to publishers who are increasingly emphasizing digital subscriptions to power revenue growth, including the The Wall Street Journal, the             New York Times,       the Washington Post and the Financial Times.Publishers have long been frustrated by Facebook\u2019s outsized role in news dissemination and commanding presence in the digital advertising market. The dominance of             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google and Facebook in online advertising\u2014they are expected to receive more than 60% of U.S. digital ad spending this year, according to eMarketer\u2014is one reason many newspapers now see subscription growth as paramount.\u201cHelping news publishers get paid for their digital content is arguably the most meaningful help that Facebook could provide to global journalism,\u201d said       Jim Friedlich,        chief executive of the foundation behind the Philadelphia Inquirer, which has lobbied Facebook hard for the initiative. \u201cIf Facebook truly creates a successful platform for the sale of news subscriptions at scale it will be a powerful and historic game changer for the news industry.\u201dHe argued that such a change would likely be hugely beneficial to local and regional publishers \u201cwho have been less successful than national news enterprises in building revenue beyond print.\u201dTop publishers urged Facebook to include a subscription option on Instant Articles before the format\u2019s launch in May 2015. At the time, Facebook employees studied different subscription models, such as prompting users to visit a publisher\u2019s website and subscribe after they have read a certain number of articles, according two people familiar with matter.The idea didn\u2019t get off the ground partly because Facebook didn\u2019t want to introduce barriers between its users and content, one of the people said. One of the goals of Instant Articles, in which media outlets publish stories directly on Facebook instead of linking back to their sites, was to speed up load times on mobile.But many publishers found they weren\u2019t making as much money on Instant Articles as on their own sites, due to Facebook\u2019s restrictions on the number and types of ads, according to a January report from Digital Content Next, a trade group for digital-content companies. Publishers are also experimenting with new rival offerings from             Apple Inc.       and Google.In response to mounting frustration and competition, Facebook eased some of its ad restrictions on Instant Articles. In April, it added a new tool so publishers could encourage readers to sign up for their newsletters. Facebook executives also warmed to the idea of driving subscriptions through Facebook and started working on a \u201cpayment system\u201d more seriously, the people familiar said.One of the people familiar with the matter said Facebook is likely to allow users to read 10 articles free before prompting them to subscribe, mirroring the approach of news organizations like the New York Times and the Washington Post. This model is likely to be a point of contention between Facebook and publishers with stricter paywalls, including The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times.Write to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Lukas I.

Doha denies that it supports extremists.U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled he backed the move by Qatar\u2019s neighbors.\u201cI\u2019m extremely disappointed in President Trump, I thought he was more shrewd,\u201d       Akbar Al Baker,        CEO of state-owned Qatar Airways, said in an interview. \u201cI was expecting that the U.S. will lead the challenge to this blockade,\u201d he said.\u2018I\u2019m extremely disappointed in President Trump, I thought he was more shrewd\u2019Mr. Al Baker, who has for years maintained friendly relations with Mr. Trump, is among the first Qatari executives to publicly lash out at the U.S. for its role in isolating the Persian Gulf state.He called the four countries\u2019 blockade \u201can illegal act\u201d that contravenes existing agreements with Qatar allowing free and unhindered airspace passage.The tension with the U.S. comes at a politically sensitive time for Mideast airlines that have expanded rapidly on U.S. routes. Some U.S. rivals, including             American Airlines Group Inc.,Delta Air Lines Inc.       and             United Continental Holdings Inc.,       have lobbied the Trump administration to curb the growth of airlines from the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar Airways, Emirates Airline, and Etihad Airways, though other U.S. carriers and tourist groups have urged Washington to maintain an open market. The Trump administration hasn\u2019t said which side it would back.The suspension of flights between the Arab states threatens to disrupt Qatar Airways\u2019 model, which consists of shuttling passengers from larger nearby countries like Saudi Arabia across its network of more than 150 destinations. Through Doha\u2019s sparkling airport, the airline carries millions of passengers every year, helping boost tourism and business, which are vital to Qatar\u2019s plan to diversify its energy-dependent economy.\u201cIt will be a difficult year but we have a plan to mitigate any risk of the reduction of Qatar Airways\u2019 growth,\u201d Mr. Al Baker said.The air blockade has affected 18 Qatar Airways destinations or about 50 daily flights since it was announced last week, according to Mr. Al Baker.Mr. Al Baker said he would use the planes normally deployed on one of the affected routes to accelerate the launch of several new destinations. The airline had earlier said that for 2017 and 2018 it expects to establish new routes to Thailand, Brazil, Chile, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Australia and Kenya among two dozen destinations.\u201cNow that we have the capacity available to us, we will deploy in those new destinations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world isn\u2019t only these four countries,\u201d he said.The airline late Sunday announced a 22% jump in profit for the fiscal year ended in March. \u201cWe are going to persevere, we are going to remain strong,\u201d he said.Mr. Al Baker has tried to build the 20-year-old airline into a global aviation powerhouse with big purchases of             Boeing Co.       jets. In October, it agreed to buy 60 of Boeing\u2019s newest single-aisle planes. It also is a launch customer for the Chicago-based plane maker\u2019s new 777X, its biggest twin-engine jetliner.Also a big customer for Boeing\u2019s rival             Airbus SE,       Mr. Al Baker said he would not delay any plane orders or put expansion plans in other countries such as India on hold.Airbus Chief Executive Officer       Tom Enders       last week called the Middle East situation \u201ctroubling for our industry.\u201dThe Qatar Airways boss warned that the current diplomatic crisis would also hurt its regional airline rivals, Dubai-based Emirates and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad.\u201cThe financial impact for them will be bigger because both of them have weaker balance sheets vis-\u00e0-vis Qatar Airways,\u201d said Mr. Al Baker.\u201cIf they think they are going to go laughing to the bank at Qatar\u2019s cost, I think they are mistaken,\u201d he said.Write to Nicolas Parasie at nicolas.parasie@wsj.com and Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 12:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-airways-boss-bashes-trump-for-backing-blockade-1497273376", "news_title": "Qatar Airways Boss Bashes Trump for Backing Blockade", "keywords": " airlines, al-baker interview, emirates, etihad, gulf airlines, middle east crisis, qatar,qatar airways, sanctions, saudi arabia, terrorism, wsj interviews qatar airways ceo,Qatar Airways,Donald Trump,Akbar Al Baker,plans,strategy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,international sanctions,politics,terrorism,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,aerospace,defense,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "General Motors Co.\u2019s        GM 0.11%       European unit Opel appointed a new chief executive as             Peugeot        PUGOY 0.73%       gets set to complete its more than $2 billion acquisition of the perennially money-losing car maker.Michael Lohscheller,        who had been Opel\u2019s chief financial officer for the past five years, has taken over as the German company\u2019s CEO, Opel said Monday. He replaces       Karl-Thomas Neumann,        who called his decision to leave Opel a \u201cpersonal decision,\u201d without giving further details.Peugeot earlier this year agreed to buy Opel, betting it can turn around a company that hasn\u2019t posted a profit in almost two decades. The acquisition, which could close as early as the end of July, will make Peugeot Europe\u2019s No. 2 car maker behind             Volkswagen AG      . Revenue at Peugeot, officially known as Groupe PSA, will jump by a third.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what role Peugeot CEO       Carlos Tavares       played in the change at Opel. A Peugeot spokesman declined to comment on the relationship between Messrs. Tavares and Neumann. Mr. Neumann couldn\u2019t be reached through an Opel spokesman.\u201cI know some of you are disappointed, but I hope you can understand my decision,\u201d Mr. Neumann wrote on Twitter. He said he would take some time before deciding his next move.Mr. Tavares had been expected to make some changes among Opel\u2019s top managers, though many analysts expected that significant changes were likely to come only once Peugeot had control of Opel.GM installed Mr. Neumann in early 2013 after a turbulent period of restructuring and executive turnover at Opel. The former CEO of German parts maker             Continental AG       put in place a 10-year plan that included a $5 billion commitment from GM for investment in new vehicles.Mr. Neumann, an avid marathon runner, had some success in reviving the beleaguered brand. He hired a new marketing chief from the cosmetics industry who oversaw edgy advertising campaigns that emphasized stylish designs and distinctive features. The vehicles improved and garnered critical praise too, as Opel gained market share in key categories like compact cars and crossover SUVs.Still, Mr. Neumann was unable to deliver on his primary goal of ending a long run of losses in Europe. GM said it had been on track to break even on the continent in 2016 before the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the European Union created currency-exchange headwinds. GM reported a loss of $257 million in Europe last year, adding to the nearly $20 billion in red ink it has spilled there over the last two decades.\u2014Nick Kostov contributed to this articleWrite to Eric Sylvers at eric.sylvers@wsj.com and Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'GM\u2019s Opel Unit Taps CEO Ahead of Sale.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 12:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gms-money-losing-opel-unit-names-new-ceo-ahead-of-sale-to-peugeot-1497283581", "news_title": "GM\u2019s Money-Losing Opel Unit Names New CEO Ahead of Sale to Peugeot ", "keywords": " adam opel,europe car market,gm europe,opel ceo,opel management, peugeot opel,Adam Opel,Peugeot-Citroen,UG.FR,General Motors,GM,Karl-Thomas Neumann,Michael Lohscheller,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,management,management moves,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"}, {"content": "Edward Albee spent most of his long life stirring up theatrical trouble, and he continues to do so nine months after his death. Just last month, the Shoebox Theatre, a small house in Portland, Ore., was denied performance rights to \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d       Michael Streeter,        the producer, wanted to cast a black actor as Nick, one of the play\u2019s four characters. This went squarely against the script, in which Nick is described as \u201cblond.\u201d (Another character broadly hints that he looks like a Nazi.) In addition, Mr. Albee reportedly said that since the play is set in the early \u201960s, a time when mixed-race marriages were uncommon, it was neither logical nor appropriate to cast actors of different races as Nick and Honey, his wife. Result: No show. The Albee estate declined to issue a license for the production, which was duly canceled.Mr. Albee is not the only dead playwright whose estate makes short work of attempts to tinker with his plays. Try to stage an all-female \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d and       Samuel Beckett\u2019s       estate will come down on you like a SWAT team. And some living playwrights are just as vigilant, not just about casting but about other matters as well.       David Mamet,        for example, recently informed Detroit\u2019s Outvisible Theatre Company that in return for allowing it to produce \u201cOleanna,\u201d his 1992 drama about a professor accused of sexual harassment, the company would be forced to pay a $25,000 fine if it held a post-performance \u201ctalkback\u201d about the play. Mr. Mamet declined to say why, though the company\u2019s assumption was that he wanted the play to \u201cstand on its own.\u201dMr. Mamet\u2019s stance is defensible, if a bit on the stodgy side. What is now known as \u201cnontraditional\u201d casting, by contrast, is both commonplace and generally (if not universally) thought to be a good thing. Not only does the Public Theater\u2019s new       Shakespeare       in the Park version of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d feature a woman,       Elizabeth Marvel,        in the part of Marc Antony, but another New York-based troupe, Pocket Universe, has just opened an all-female production of the same play. Not surprisingly, then, Mr. Albee\u2019s refusal to countenance similar casting of his plays has been widely and passionately criticized as fuddy-duddy at best, crypto-racist at worst.What nobody seems to question is that Mr. Albee and his estate have an absolute right to control the casting of \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d for as long as the play is controlled by copyright. I have my doubts, however, about exactly how absolute that right is. While I\u2019m not a lawyer, I suspect that a friendly judge might well look upon the requirement that Nick be played by a white man (Mr. Albee was identically militant about denying permission to change the sexes of the characters in \u201cVirginia Woolf\u201d) as a racially restrictive covenant contrary to law. On the other hand, the 35-seat Shoebox Theatre would have to lawyer up to fight that battle, and I also doubt they\u2019ve got the resources to do so. My guess, then, is that no theater company will be bringing any such action anytime soon.I\u2019m interested, being a sometime playwright, in ensuring that the rights of any living author to control his own work are fully protected under the law. That is\u2014or should be\u2014a given. But I also agree with the film critic       Mark Harris,        who broke the \u201cVirginia Woolf\u201d story on Twitter and who has argued in an online essay that \u201cdeath is, I\u2019d argue, the point at which this aspect of copyright law should cede to a greater social and artistic good\u2026.It\u2019s hard to imagine a playwright\u2019s work long surviving him if it\u2019s shackled to the unexamined enforcement of questionable decisions from another era, or constrained by the terror that it might be mishandled.\u201dThis is, I think, exactly right. No small part of the burgeoning vitality of modern-day Shakespeare productions, after all, lies in the freshness and immediacy that can be fostered by genuinely imaginative nontraditional casting (as opposed to the rigidly political kind). By far the best \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d I\u2019ve ever reviewed, directed by       Amanda Dehnert       at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2011, was a modern-dress production that featured a woman actor,       Vilma Silva,        in the title role. And while \u201cVirginia Woolf\u201d still feels fresh and immediate, a time will come\u2014perhaps soon, maybe even now\u2014when it will profit from an equally new spin. I\u2019d love, for instance, to see it performed by an all-black cast.Don\u2019t get me wrong: I esteem Mr. Albee\u2019s estate for protecting the literary interests of a great artist. But I also feel very strongly that the estate should find another hill to die on, lest it inadvertently kill off one of the masterpieces of American theater by refusing to let Mr. Albee\u2019s interpreters go their own creative ways, regardless of whether they\u2019re right or wrong.\u2014Mr. Teachout, the Journal\u2019s drama critic, writes \u201cSightings,\u201d a column about the arts, every other week.

In the latest and largest breakout, hundreds of people marched down a busy Shanghai shopping street this weekend.Snapshots of the Shanghai protest quickly whirled through mobile-messaging app             WeChat,       showing scenes of protesters clashing with police and some being dragged away. In videos set against bright neon lights and in drizzly rain, the shrieks of whistles were heard as fists pumped and the crowd chanted demands that the city loosen restrictions.\u201cSo far, no Shanghai leader has come out to speak to us,\u201d said       Li Pinger,        a 40-year-old IT contractor at a local university who took part in Saturday\u2019s protest.Ms. Li said she has been unable to move into an apartment she bought last year at a hotel project in Shanghai\u2019s Qingpu District after the Shanghai government in May banned the sale of apartments built on land for commercial or office use and directed developers to convert thousands of units back to fit those purposes.Ms. Li put up half of the 580,000 yuan (about $85,000) for her apartment and took out a mortgage for the rest. Now, she feels trapped, she said: \u201cI\u2019m really angry.\u201dIn one office building far from the city center, occupants of the \u201coffices\u201d have built kitchens, showers and in one case, a loft sleeping area\u2014all in defiance of a notice saying d\u00e9cor is limited to office functions.The developer, Shanghai Tongying Real Estate Co., has proposed refunds or compensation for those who want to pull out since Shanghai issued restrictions, according to a statement it published online. Some residents said leaving would require moving even farther out of town.Shanghai\u2019s government had no official response to Saturday\u2019s protest. In \u200ba statement released\u200b late\u200b Monday, \u200ba local housing bureau\u200b \u200bsuggested a softening of policies applied to developers and buyers, though it stopped short of explicitly saying commercially-zoned units could be permitted for use as residences.It is unclear how many people have been detained by police in Shanghai; some WeChat users say their friends have been held since Saturday. Other WeChat users in Beijing and Shanghai say police have come to their homes to ask them to go \u201cdrink tea,\u201d a euphemism for an interrogation.Shanghai\u2019s police department didn\u2019t respond to calls or a fax for comment.Public displays of discontent in China\u2019s largest cities is an especially delicate matter ahead of a Communist Party leadership shuffle this fall and protest coverage and policy criticism have been largely removed from social media.Disgruntled residents have flocked to WeChat, venting frustrations and sharing personal grievances as well as rallying each other to hit the streets. One message shared widely on WeChat groups highlighted the sense of shared purpose that protesters in Shanghai felt with those protesting restrictions in the capital.\u201cWe\u2019re just following in the steps of Beijing,\u201d said the anonymous poster. \u201cWe have been awakened and are standing up.\u201dBeijing banned people from buying or selling commercial-use apartments in late March. Some buyers had seen these homes as a good option because they were generally cheaper and rules to buy them had been looser than for ordinary homes, making it easier for people without local residency to buy them.For       Han Bote,        35, who had bought two such commercial-use apartments, the new rules meant the suspension of a deal to sell one of his apartments, leaving him in limbo and without enough cash to buy a new home. He has since been to several protests.\u201cI\u2019m facing quite a bit of pressure,\u201d Mr. Han said.At a May 20 demonstration in Beijing of roughly 200 to 300 people in front of the Beijing municipal government offices, police officers lined up on two sides of the road outside the building\u2019s entrance.A handful crowded around a police officer, waving documents and complaining to him. He listened but said that no one was coming out to receive them. Intermittently, people would chant, \u201cWe want to see the mayor!\u201dSuddenly, a police van rolled out. \u201cYou must leave immediately,\u201d a loudspeaker boomed. People quickly scattered.Beijing\u2019s housing authority said in late May that it would allow apartments that were bought before March 26 to be listed and sold, an apparent loosening of the previous blanket ban on the sale of them.Mr. Han is trying to get the sale of his apartment back on track. For now, \u201cany conclusion has been put off,\u201d he said.\u2014       Junya Qian       in Shanghai contributed to this articleWrite to Dominique Fong at Dominique.Fong@wsj.com and James T.

Friday is typically the cheapest day to depart for short getaways during the summer months, he says.Travel in June is the cheapest month of the summer-travel season to fly domestically, with the first and second weeks being least expensive, Mr. Melnick says. If budget is your top priority, avoid travel in July as it\u2019s typically the most expensive of the summer months to travel with median airfare coming in around $315.For international travel, it\u2019s more expensive to travel during the week, he says.When traveling to a secondary location like Olbia in Sardinia, Italy, it\u2019s usually cheaper to break up the trip into two separate legs, says Johnny Jet, a travel expert based in Los Angeles.For example, you might buy a ticket from New York to London or another major European city and then buy a ticket from there to Sardinia on a low-fare carrier.Just make sure to leave plenty of time between flights, because most low-fare carriers usually depart out of secondary airports and would require checking out of one airport, traveling to the other airport and then checking in again.\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to pack light because low-fare carriers can have crazy baggage fees,\u201d he says.When traveling with family or friends, booking a suite rather than individual rooms is a good money-saving option, says Brooke Ferencsik, senior director of communications for             TripAdvisor.Suites often include laundry and kitchenettes, offering other chances to save money by cooking in or washing clothes, he says.When traveling with a family or a large group, also consider booking a vacation-house rental to save money on accommodations, he says. Many rentals can provide accommodations for an entire family, and they can be more affordable than hotels for small and large groups, he says.The general rule in the summer, says Expedia spokeswoman Sarah Gavin, is the hotter the destination\u2019s temperatures, the hotter the deals.Destinations such as Hawaii and islands in the Caribbean, while they can be extra-hot in the summer, are more likely to offer big savings on hotels as it\u2019s the off-season, she says.Don\u2019t assume you\u2019re getting the best deal just because a hotel or car is described as \u201cbudget,\u201d says Trisha Ping, eastern U.S. destination editor at Lonely Planet.Whether it\u2019s budget accommodations or transportation, read the fine print and make sure there are no hidden fees, taxes or add-ons that aren\u2019t in the initially advertised price, she says.Write to Veronica Dagher at veronica.dagher@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   It might be cheaper to break up a trip into two legs by flying, for example, from New York to London or another major European city and from there to Sardinia on a low-fare carrier.

In court papers and other documents, band members discuss such pedestrian matters as salaries, tour buses, laundry arrangements and how concert venues should prepare the bananas in their backstage spread.\u201cDon\u2019t put any fast food under our noses,\u201d the band tells venues.In a realm where celebrities market their personal lives as much as their music, Ghost\u2019s anonymity was an anomaly that fans flocked to. The band\u2019s lead singer, Papa Emeritus, pairs skeletal face makeup with a pope hat bearing an inverted cross.He performs while flanked by musicians known as Nameless Ghouls who wear silver-horned, mouth-less masks. Without revealing their faces, the band walked the red carpet at last year\u2019s Grammys and accepted an award with Papa proclaiming that \u201ca nightmare has turned into a dream.\u201dFour Nameless Ghouls are now suing Papa\u2014a 36-year-old whose real name is       Tobias Forge      \u2014in a Swedish court. They have accused him of financially shortchanging them and reneging on an agreement to make them partners and distribute the band\u2019s profits equally.The suit identified all the band\u2019s members and has divided fans world-wide. Some have pored over the court documents and soaked up the behind-the-scenes details, while others resent the revelations for ruining Ghost\u2019s spooky image. The dispute \u201creally messed up the whole mythos of the band,\u201d one fan complained online. \u201cThe lawsuit reduces them all to boring, flawed people.\u201dKathleen Higgins       of Halifax, Canada, a pet-store manager whose husband plays in a Ghost tribute band, avoided news of the lawsuit online and said she was bummed out by the band\u2019s money squabbles and mundane affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching a Broadway show. When I saw \u2018Phantom of the Opera\u2019 as a child I wasn\u2019t interested in who the actors were or what they ate for breakfast,\u201d she said.In character, Papa is a sort of occult sect leader who leads audiences in chants of \u201cBelial, Behemoth, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer,\u201d incantations in the song \u201cYear Zero.\u201d But ahead of the band\u2019s 2013 American tour, the front man was especially excited about Ghost\u2019s transportation upgrade.\u201cIt will be a real tour bus on the U.S. bit!\u201d Mr. Forge wrote to the band in an email included in the suit. \u201cHad we taken the van we would [have] gotten a minimal profit, but not sufficiently large for us to endure a month in the van.\u201dDuring concerts around that time, the band churned through songs such as \u201cDeath Knell\u201d and \u201cSatan Prayer.\u201d At one point, Papa handed out unconsecrated communion wafers and sang about the stench of \u201cdead human sacrifices.\u201dAfterwards, one of the Nameless Ghouls was tasked with cleaning the band\u2019s gamey vestments in his apartment building\u2019s communal washing machine in Sweden.\u201cIt was like getting the whole football team\u2019s dirty wash,\u201d       Martin Persner,        the former Ghoul, said in an interview. Minutes from a band meeting included with court documents noted him raising concerns about the dank wardrobe situation and asking if it was possible to do laundry at the concert venues. Mr. Persner, a longtime Ghost guitarist who left the band last year, didn\u2019t join the other Ghouls in filing suit.As Ghost ascended in popularity in recent years, its concerts\u2014known to fans as \u201crituals\u201d\u2014became more elaborate, featuring faux stained glass and burning incense. A confetti cannon shot fake money with Papa\u2019s scowling face printed next to the number 666. Friends and audience members recruited as \u201csisters of sin\u201d dressed up as nuns to administer the ersatz communion.Backstage protocol was more basic. A list of requests sent to concert venues, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, included Ghost\u2019s demands for cold cuts, beer and room-temperature bottled water. The band stipulated that bananas remain bagged in the catering area due to \u201ca very severe banana allergy\u201d among the traveling crew.At each tour stop, they asked for six local postcards plus stamps (\u201cYES WE REALLY WANT THESE\u201d), along with good chocolate (\u201cNOT HERSHEY!\u201d) and quality food. \u201cYou are what you eat and in this regard we want to stay healthy,\u201d Ghost noted in a dossier sent to venues.When band members weren\u2019t on stage or discussing evolutions in Ghost\u2019s devilish mythology, they grappled with the earthly concerns of road life. In the cramped confines of the tour bus, sleeping schedules conflicted, recalls Mr. Persner. Debates about which restaurants to eat at were common.The ultimate behind-the-scenes clashes, however, were about money. Mr. Forge\u2019s legal response to the Ghouls\u2019 suit, filed last week, describes showdowns over the band\u2019s salaries, and claims the Ghouls were never more than musicians for hire. Their lawsuit \u201cdestroyed the mystery\u201d of Ghost, Mr. Forge said, and their anonymity made them replaceable. He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment for this article.Papa Emeritus recently debuted a new set of Nameless Ghouls, with no announcement to fans. The band launched a U.S. tour earlier this month.The former Ghouls who filed suit declined interview requests. In a statement released in April, they accused Mr. Forge of \u201cunabashed dishonesty, greed, and darkness. Not the darkness of which Ghost sings, but a darkness that pushes a person to betray his best friends when fame and fortune appear within reach.\u201dGhost\u2019s anonymity is a throwback to the 1970s, when groups like Kiss shrouded themselves in sinister mystery. Pre-Wikipedia, fans had to piece together group lore by poring over music magazines, album liner notes and urban legends.To be sure, some inquisitive and savvy Ghost fans were able to ferret out details about the musicians before they were exposed in the suit. But for the band, concealing their everyday identities was just a way to amp up the theater. The goal was to fuel rumors and \u201cto create something larger than five dudes. Like comic book characters,\u201d said Mr. Persner, who went public separately in a YouTube reveal meant to promote his own band, Magna Carta Cartel.Being shrouded in a cloak and mask had practical advantages, too. \u201cThere was never a bad hair day,\u201d said Mr. Persner.-- Neanda Salvaterra contributed to this article.Write to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'This Satanic Band Demands Better Work Conditions.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 11:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hell-on-earth-satanic-band-files-suit-citing-dreary-work-conditions-1497282380", "news_title": "Hell on Earth!

It is the first such agreement struck by a bank, according to trade group Business Renewables Center, and pushes Goldman closer to its goal of procuring 100% of the energy it uses from renewable sources by 2020.The deal is Goldman\u2019s effort to stake a claim in a hot corner of the energy-trading market\u2014and to try to catch up with rivals.Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are already big in the renewables-trading space. Goldman recently hired a Citigroup trader,       Moe Hanifi,        who will join       Harry Singh       and Joram Cukierman in spearheading the firm\u2019s effort.Commodities trading has been a tough business across Wall Street since the financial crisis due to stricter capital rules. It was among the businesses that Goldman blamed for disappointing trading revenues last quarter.Goldman won\u2019t just be in the renewables market for its own needs. The firm\u2019s commodities arm has been building a business to connect corporate buyers of electricity with developers.That group, reporting to commodities chief       Greg Agran,        will manage the 15-year electricity contract, protecting Goldman from price swings, grid congestion and other risks. It hopes to market that same service to a growing group of companies that are striking their own power agreements, Mr. Agran said in an interview.The market for such deals has grown from next to nothing in 2012 to 1.5 gigawatts last year, according to the Business Renewables Center.Large technology firms such as         Apple Inc.       and Google parent         Alphabet Inc.       were early and remain the biggest players. But they have been joined by the likes of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and General Motors Co.As wind and solar prices continue to fall, demand is likely to grow. The catch: \u201cWhat developers want to sell and what these companies want to buy doesn\u2019t always match up,\u201d Mr. Agran said.Goldman hopes to stand in the middle. The firm\u2019s traders, for example, can use derivatives to transform short-term contracts that companies typically want into 20- or 25-year terms that developers prefer. Goldman also can aggregate orders from smaller companies, or buy big slugs of power from developers and syndicate it to many buyers.Goldman\u2019s traders are working with the firm\u2019s investment bankers to drum up interest from corporate clients, Mr. Agran said.The Scranton project, which is being developed by         NextEra Energy Inc.,       will produce power equivalent to Goldman\u2019s usage across its North American facilities, said       Cindy Quan,        who runs the bank\u2019s real estate sustainability efforts. Goldman currently gets 90% of its power from green sources, mostly by buying \u201ccredits\u201d created by other projects.Chief Executive       Lloyd Blankfein       recently criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, tweeting that the decision was \u201ca setback for the environment and for the U.S.\u2019s leadership position in the world.\u201dWrite to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Goldman\u2019s Green Push Comes With Trading Twist.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 11:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldmans-green-push-comes-with-a-trading-twist-1497278652", "news_title": "Goldman\u2019s Green Push Comes With a Trading Twist", "keywords": "goldman commodities, goldman renewables,goldman sachs, green energy, renewable energy trading, renewables trading, wind farm, wind power,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Apple,AAPL,Anheuser-Busch InBev,ABI.BT,BUD,Citigroup,C,Morgan Stanley,MS,NextEra Energy,NEE,General Motors,GM,Alphabet,GOOGL,GOOG,Anheuser-Busch InBev S.A.,Lloyd Blankfein,Cindy Quan,Greg Agran,Harry Singh,Moe Hanifi,Joram Cukierman,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,electricity markets,energy,motor vehicle parts,banking,financial investments,investment banking,automotive,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "From the Apple                   Watch to eagle-eyed sensors, digital technology is going ever further to embed itself into your health club.These advances promise exercisers everything from smoother workout starts to better data to increased gym attendance. However, tech-savvy gym rats concerned about privacy should remember that they can always opt out.This fall, an update to Apple Watch\u2019s operating system launches a feature called GymKit, which will allow the watch to link to most major cardio-equipment brands available at gyms by tapping the watch to an enabled machine, says       Jeff Williams,        Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.On a treadmill, for instance, the machine will track speed, workout duration, incline and distance covered. The watch will track heart rate, and use a combination of treadmill data and its knowledge of user age, sex and body type to calculate calorie count. All data from the workout will beam to the Apple Watch, but the cardio equipment won\u2019t store user data, Apple officials say.For the past few years, gym-goers have been able to connect to cardio equipment through various smartphone apps. But it is a patchwork system, and many people skip it and leave their data locked in machines.A spokeswoman from equipment maker Life Fitness says she anticipates the Apple Watch\u2019s new connectivity will boost the number of tracked workouts.A simpler connection to cardio machines will remove a step or two from groggy morning routines and could give Apple Watch an edge in the wearables market, where it is playing catch-up two years after its launch. About 7% of adult consumers own a smartwatch, compared with 18% who own a wearable fitness tracker, according to the NPD Group. Another perk: not having to use the cardio console. \u201cWho wants to punch in your weight before you do your workout?\u201d says       Jay Blahnik,        Apple\u2019s director of fitness for health technologies.Bryan O\u2019Rourke,        a fitness-industry consultant specializing in technology, says Apple Watch\u2019s move is part of a larger push to integrate easy-to-use technology into health club members\u2019 lives at the gym and elsewhere. Traditional health clubs are facing more competition from specialty fitness boutiques and online-streaming workout services.New York-based health club chain Equinox is testing a smartphone-based chatbot\u2014a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to simulate human conversation\u2014to talk to new members via instant messaging. Equinox\u2019s chatbot reaches out to new members weekly for the first month, encouraging them to set goals and nudging them when they fall short. It also responds when they send a message.In a recent monthlong test at all 88 Equinox clubs, new members who used the chatbot visited the club 40% more often than new members who opted out, according to       Samir Desai,        Equinox chief information officer. The chatbot\u2019s first goal is to get people coming to the gym, since people who don\u2019t form that habit in the first few months are likely to drop their membership.At four clubs in New York, Equinox has also installed sensors to track members through their smartphones while they\u2019re in the club. The sensors can tell when a member regularly runs on a treadmill, for instance, and prompt a message suggesting the person try one of Equinox\u2019s Precision Running classes.Nadine Kerstan,        a 45-year-old holistic health coach in South Orange, N.J., joined Equinox about a year ago. She enjoys the guided meditations she listens to through Equinox\u2019s smartphone app. But the concept of sensor-tracking is \u201ca little creepy,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like Big Brother is watching me at the gym.\u201dNiki Leondakis,        CEO of Equinox Fitness Clubs, says the information from sensors will help the club help members achieve their goals. The more engaged members are with the club, the more often they show up and exercise, she says. \u201cI would say that everyone today understands that they\u2019re being tracked,\u201d Ms. Leondakis says, citing a shopper browsing for shoes on a website.The aim is to install the sensor system at all clubs, Mr. Desai says. Equinox says its members are asked if they want to allow the app to track their location and can opt out.Bay Area-based Active Wellness is going further. It manages about 60 fitness locations across the U.S., mostly in corporate settings. In its Oakland, Calif., club, Active Wellness is testing a facial-recognition system designed to let members breeze in without a card or digital swipe, and track members in most places except locker rooms and bathrooms.Mike Rucker,        Active Wellness\u2019s vice president of technology, acknowledged some members\u2019 reservations about the system.

But much of that increase in revenue came after acquisitions in more developed markets, such as last year\u2019s $2.4 billion deal to buy Sleepy\u2019s ownerMattress Firm Holding Corp. in the U.S. and the \u00a3597 million ($716 million) acquisition of British discount retailer Poundland Group PLC.Steinhoff is the latest in a string of multinationals with South African roots that has looked outside the continent for growth. The company moved its primary listing to Frankfurt in late 2015 to better access capital, joining the likes of mining behemoth             Anglo American                   PLC and luxury-goods giant             Cie. Financi\u00e8re Richemont SA,       which also retain secondary listings on the             Johannesburg Stock Exchange.In 2011, the African Development Bank lit a fire under companies selling everything from beer to baby diapers when it said Africa\u2019s middle class totaled roughly 350 million people. That assessment coincided with big investments in Africa from international brands, such as             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,       and a push into the broader continent by South African retail heavyweights like             Woolworths Holdings Ltd.      ,             Shoprite Holdings Ltd.      , the continent\u2019s largest grocer, and Steinhoff.But the bank in its estimate included workers who made little more than $2 a day. A more conservative count, released in 2015 by             Credit Suisse,       said that when narrowing Africa\u2019s middle class to individuals with at least $50,000 in assets, it had just 20 million members.Slow and expensive logistics, problems securing land for new stores and wildly fluctuating currencies also have hampered growth, while rises in inflation and unemployment have eaten into consumers\u2019 purchasing power. Walmart\u2019s             Massmart Holdings Ltd.has been slow to open stores, while             Woolworths                   has pulled out of Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy.\u201cThey sort of go [into Africa] thinking, \u2018We\u2019re God\u2019s gift to the retail industry,\u2019\u201d said Nicholas Corbishley, head of Africa investments at Old Mutual Property, a South African real-estate developer. \u201cAnd they got hammered.\u201dSteinhoff executives have said growth potential for their African retail businesses is constrained by the current size of the African market.\u201cFive years ago, there was a lot more optimism and interest,\u201d said Dion Shango, chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers for Southern Africa.Steinhoff said its African retail businesses outside Southern Africa were hit hard in the most recent six-month period by falling local currencies. The company also said it was moving ahead with a separate listing of its African operations to better value those businesses and provide a stock for emerging-markets investors interested in the continent.This stripped-back success speaks volumes about the evolution of consumer activity across Africa as steep slides in prices of commodities from copper to crude shake local economies. While retailers in other emerging markets, such as Eastern Europe or Asia, have seen opportunity in luxury goods, in Africa they are going in a different direction.The challenges\u2014and promises\u2014of the African retail market were on display on a recent afternoon in a small, well-lit shop near Luanda\u2019s international airport. Here, in an outlet of Steinhoff\u2019s Pep chain, Angola\u2019s middle class shopped for brightly colored essentials from blouses to baby bathtubs, which were largely made in China and then driven more than 2,600 miles driven by truck from South Africa to this sprawling seaside capital.Steinhoff doubled down on Africa when it bought discount clothing retailer Pepkor in 2015 for 62.8 billion South African rand (about $5.7 billion at the time). There are now more than 2,300 Pep stores in a dozen countries on the continent. Angola was Pep Africa\u2019s top-performing market during the 2016 fiscal year, the company says, despite inflation of more than 30%.One of the reasons: \u201cWe understand how to trade cheap,\u201d says Thys Potgieter, the company\u2019s general manager for Angola. \u201cWe are not flashy.\u201dPep\u2019s competitors are largely informal vendors on Luanda\u2019s street markets, who usually don\u2019t pay rent, marketing, taxes or staff. But some customers say those traders don\u2019t offer the quality or choice available in air-conditioned Pep stores.\u201cPeople always talk about stuff from Pep,\u201d says Edmar Augustinho, a 21-year-old economics and law student. Vania Tiago, a 22-year-old secretary, said she used to come to the store almost every week to shop for clothes for her baby.

Tom Wolf       signed a pension-overhaul bill Monday that the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts says will be one of the most comprehensive state-level reforms in the U.S.The compromise measure will move most future state and public school workers at least partly into 401(k)-style plans to help shore up the deeply underfunded pension system and shift market risk from taxpayers to employees. An independent analysis estimates the state will save $5 billion to $20 billion over 30 years, depending on investment performance.\u201cI think we have a road map to actually move out of the nightmare that we\u2019ve been in for the last 20 years,\u201d Gov. Wolf, a Democrat, said in an interview Monday.Pennsylvania is one of many states, including New Jersey, Illinois and Connecticut, grappling with rising pension costs and huge unfunded liabilities\u2014the gap between promised benefits and the funding available to meet those obligations. A 2015 Pew report found that the nation\u2019s state-run retirement systems had a collective $968 billion shortfall.Pennsylvania\u2019s pension crunch dates to a 2001 move by the legislature to sweeten benefits, combined with subsequent underfunding by state government and school districts, and weak investment returns, particularly after the 2008 financial crash.A 2010 law boosted the government pension contributions, and Mr. Wolf said the current bill represents a key second step.Republicans and Democrats in the GOP-led state legislature hashed out the bipartisan deal along with the governor and his aides.The Pennsylvania School Boards Association applauded the bill, saying school districts have faced growing financial pressure because legally required pension contributions have risen at an unprecedented rate.Current and retired employees will remain under the traditional \u201cdefined benefit\u201d pension that provides set retirement payments. The two pension systems for state and public school employees have about 863,000 active, vested and retired members. The new law won\u2019t apply to state troopers or correctional officers.Greg Mennis, director of Pew\u2019s public-sector retirement systems project, said the bill breaks new ground.\u201cOur research indicates that this would be one of the most\u2014if not the most\u2014comprehensive and impactful reforms any state has implemented,\u201d he wrote in a letter to lawmakers.Critics of the legislation say it would do little to address the state\u2019s roughly $62 billion in existing pension debt.\u201cPension debt is the sole reason for doing pension reform and yet, ironically and bizarrely,\u201d the bill doesn\u2019t address existing unfunded liabilities, Republican state Rep. John McGinnis said during a recent debate. \u201cWe\u2019re not making history, we are repeating it.\u201dGov. Wolf said the criticism amounts to \u201ccrying over spilled milk,\u201d adding: \u201cA big part of that is because the commonwealth didn\u2019t pay its bill and kicked the can down the road\u201d until the 2010 change.Republican House Speaker Mike Turzai acknowledged the state isn\u2019t likely to see major savings for years under the pension overhaul, but said it is time to follow the private sector into 401(k)-type retirement plans, where the market determines future benefits.\u201cAt a certain point you\u2019ve just got to turn off the spigot, and you\u2019ve got to move to where the private sector\u2019s been,\u201d he said in a video on his website.His office says 18 states have enacted some 401(k)-style plan for state workers, and notes that the state\u2019s Independent Fiscal Office estimates pension payments by Pennsylvania taxpayers will account for nearly 10% of the state\u2019s general fund budget by 2019.Gov. Wolf, who vetoed a 2015 GOP pension bill that he deemed unfair, said one key element of the current bill is a push to cut Wall Street investment fees by $3 billion over three decades. Pennsylvania has the fifth-highest fee levels of any state, according to Pew.The union representing more than 65,000 Pennsylvania state employees said it can \u201clive with\u201d the bill because it lets current employees keep their plans and offers retirement security for new employees.\u201cUltimately, this proposal may be as good as it gets with a Republican-controlled legislature that has constantly been going after pension reform,\u201d said David Fillman, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employee Council 13, on the union\u2019s website.Starting in 2019, the retirement age for new employees will rise to 67 from 65.Mr. Wolf said the new approach offers portability that better suits many workers. \u201cThere are a lot of people who might want to stay in public service four or five years,\u201d he said, but it takes employees 10 years to vest in the state pension system.Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Pennsylvania Moves to Fix Pension Problems.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 11:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pennsylvania-lawmakers-compromise-on-pension-overhaul-bill-1497281589", "news_title": "Pennsylvania Lawmakers Compromise on Pension-Overhaul Bill ", "keywords": "401k,pennsylvania,pension reform,teachers,teachers union,Pew Charitable Trusts,Tom Wolf,political,general news,personal finance,retirement planning"}, {"content": "The decision on which of the 29 tote bags stashed in your closet to bring on your Saturday afternoon stroll can spark a minor identity crisis.Kyle Chayka,        a freelance writer in Brooklyn, N.Y., says he owns somewhere between 12 and 20 tote bags. He favors a red one with both long and short straps, from clothing brand Freitag (acquired as a conference freebie) and an especially roomy Christie\u2019s bag which he likes on the weekends.\u201cThey\u2019ve become visible status symbols,\u201d Mr. Chayka says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the equivalent of wearing a sports jersey.\u201d A tote shows what style and brands you affiliate with, he says.Totes are conversation starters, the way noticing the book someone is reading on the subway used to be, he says. \u201cSometimes when you see a tote bag, you know that person is one degree of separation from you.\u201dSturdy, canvas, waterproof or made of recycled material, tote bags take up an expanding part of our lives (and car trunks) as cities, counties and states continue to impose fees or bans on plastic bags. Stores either give them away free with purchase or sell them for a couple bucks in the hopes that consumers will like them and carry them\u2014and that others will notice.\u201cThey are walking billboards,\u201d says       Ty Haney,        founder of Outdoor Voices, an athletic-leisure clothing brand that emphasizes recreational play over performance. Its tote bags, which come free with an in-store purchase, carry the slogan \u201ctechnical apparel for recreation.\u201d Ms. Haney says it is a more cost effective way of advertising than buying online ads because it gets the brand name into neighborhoods and scenes where there are lots of potential customers.The company\u2019s investment is $5 a bag, and it says it distributes thousands in its stores each month, but declined to specify a number.Jonathan Hochman,        an Internet marketing consultant in Cheshire, Conn., says that \u201cfor $5,000 worth of bags, you could probably buy 3 to 5 million online impressions.\u201d Some of those eyeballs, though, might be the wrong type of customer. It takes five views of an online ad for the brand to really register with someone, he says. A real-world logo on a bag, however, \u201cis actually a testimonial,\u201d he says.When totes are durable and reusable they become longer-lived ad campaigns. Swimwear label 6 Shore Road\u2019s founder, Pooja Kharbanda, says that she made 1,000 tote bags to distribute at pop-up stores in Montauk, N.Y., and Newport, R.I., this summer. She estimates the cost is 2.5 times what it would be if she had just chosen paper bags. But she hopes the bags will turn up on the beach, carrying flip flops and towels. For a customer who might forget about the brand over the winter, \u201cthey could pick it up again and think \u2018maybe I should check out what new things they have,\u2019 \u201d says Ms. Kharbanda.Some retailers sell the bags to help cover the cost.             H&M\u2019s       tote bags cost $2 to $4 and help spread the word about its garment recycling program. Customers who trade in old clothing or textiles can get 15% off their purchase. The bags proclaim: \u201cThere\u2019s only one rule in fashion: Recycle your clothes\u201d or \u201cBring it: The lonely sock, the stained shirt, the washed-out dress and it will be reborn.\u201d\u201cWe know that word-of-mouth is the strongest kind of advertising,\u201d says       Marybeth Schmitt,        communications manager for H&M North America, which operates 477 stores in the U.S. \u201cAnd, this is like a form of word-of-mouth.

GE 0.19%       Next up for the industrial giant: freshening up shareholder returns.GE announced Monday morning that longtime Chief Executive       Jeff Immelt       will retire on Aug. 1. The change is more of a makeover than a full-scale rebuild.       John Flannery,        a veteran company executive, will take over as CEO. Finance chief       Jeff Bornstein       will remain in place. GE said in a statement that succession planning has been under way since 2011.Investor returns under Mr. Immelt were disappointing. Much of that was due to bad luck. Mr. Immelt took the helm on September 10, 2001, and presided over the company during the 2008 financial crisis.More recently, however, GE has missed analyst sales estimates in 10 of the past 13 quarters, according to FactSet. The rate at which GE has converted operating profits into free cash flow, an important metric for an industrial company, has deteriorated to 76% in 2016 from 91% in 2014 (GE subsequently changed the way it measures cash flow conversion).Operating cash flow from the industrial business was negative $1.6 billion in the first quarter, though GE held this year\u2019s expectation of $12-14 billion constant.

On the bright side, he will enjoy the benefit of lower expectations.

He will review the wide portfolio of industrial businesses and announce more detailed plans to shape the portfolio later this year and he will have some options. Perhaps, to pick one example, a greater investment in the currently struggling oil and gas business, which is in the process of merging with Baker-Hughes, is in order. Segment operating profit fell by 33% from a year earlier, but equipment orders were up 30%.

May\u2019s expectation for inflation three years from now stood at its lowest level since January 2016.The New York Fed report arrives just ahead of this week\u2019s interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is scheduled to take place over Tuesday and Wednesday. The gathering is widely expected to result in an increase to what is now the central bank\u2019s 0.75% and 1% overnight target rate range.That said, the expected rate increase is attended by some alarm given that recent inflation data has been weakening. While the job market remains strong amid a slowdown in the pace of job creation, Fed officials have long expected inflationary pressures to continue to rise back to their official 2% annual increase target.The Fed has suffered setbacks on that front, to a degree that has put a cloud over officials\u2019 push to boost borrowing costs. The central bank\u2019s preferred price gauge, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, was only up by 1.7% in April from a year ago, slowing from recent months.Fed officials have largely argued that recent weakness is temporary and unlikely to slow their campaign to raise rates. Softening inflation expectations, however, complicate that view. Most Fed officials believe that expectations of future inflation exert a powerful influence on price pressures now. So the decline in expectations shown by the New York Fed report could herald softer inflation readings in the future.If inflation doesn\u2019t return to a path that will get it to the Fed\u2019s 2% rise target, that could change the game for monetary policy.Earlier this month, Fed Governor       Lael Brainard        told a New York audience \u201cit likely will be appropriate soon to adjust the federal-funds rate\u201d given the economy\u2019s performance.

The idea for both new tools is to reduce the amount of money advertisers spend targeting the wrong people\u2014known in the ad industry as wastage.Facebook is hoping its algorithms, which take advantage of the rich set of data it has on its 1.9 billion users, will be able to do some of this job for them, or at the very least help them focus their ad campaigns on driving real purchases rather than just clicks. If Facebook can prove it is driving sales, advertisers are likely to increase their spending with the platform.\u201cThis is a priority product for the company,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said.The first of the new tools, Value Optimization, uses prior purchase data to estimate how much money a person might spend in an advertiser\u2019s store over a seven-day period. The tool then adjusts the advertiser\u2019s campaign to send ads to the people it anticipates are most likely to actually spend the most money.The second new product is an add-on to an existing tool called Lookalike Audiences, which launched four years ago and finds people on Facebook who display similar traits to advertisers\u2019 existing customer lists. The add-on, called \u201cValue-Based Lookalikes,\u201d as the name would suggest, finds the Facebook users among those with similar traits who are also most likely to make a purchase after seeing an ad.Both tools are rolling out from Monday and are free for marketers to use.Facebook is trying to bolster the value of its advertising inventory to help drive sales growth, particularly after executives have warned that ad revenue growth will slow over the course of this year compared with last year. In the first quarter, the company\u2019s ad revenue rose 51% to $7.9 billion.The new offerings build on Facebook\u2019s efforts to help advertisers spend their money more wisely. Last year, Facebook introduced another optimization product for app developers, called App Event Optimization. It lets marketers send ads to people who are more likely to make an in-app purchase or people who are likely to stick with a mobile game to a certain level.Google is also attempting something similar. In a May blog post, the company said it will allow advertisers to tailor app ads toward high-value users.Write to Lara O\u2019Reilly at lara.oreilly@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 11:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-facebook-tools-help-marketers-serve-ads-to-people-most-likely-to-spend-money-1497279600", "news_title": "New Facebook Tools Help Marketers Serve Ads to People Most Likely to Spend Money", "keywords": "financial performance,earnings,sales figures,new products,services,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,social media marketing,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "The board of             Cypress Semiconductor Corp.        CY 1.04%       has shuffled its ranks amid a bruising proxy fight led by company founder and former chief executive       T.J. Rodgers.Cypress said Monday that executive chairman Raymond Bingham resigned and       Eric Benhamou       stepped down as lead independent director, although he will remain on the board. Board member       W. Steve Albrecht       has been named chairman.The changes come in response to demands from Mr. Rodgers, who said that Mr. Bingham had a conflict of interest as the co-founder of a China-backed U.S. private-equity firm that could compete with Cypress for acquisitions in the semiconductor sector.Mr. Rodgers, once a prominent leader in the microchip industry with his brash, outspoken personality, is the largest individual shareholder of Cypress with a 2.7% stake. He served as Cypress CEO for nearly 34 years until last year.Last week, influential proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. reversed its position and recommended shareholders back Mr. Rodgers\u2019 plan to replace Messrs. Bingham and Benhamou, possibly forcing the board\u2019s hand. Shareholders are slated to meet on June 20 to vote on board appointments.\u201cBy now we are sure that you are exhausted by a seemingly endless succession of fight letters and disclosures\u2026from both sides -- innuendoes, chronologies, accusations and rebuttals,\u201d the board said in a letter to shareholders released Monday. \u201cReputations have been tarnished, none have been burnished.\u201dThe company said it expects one of Mr. Rodgers\u2019 nominees to join the board and plans to add other new directors. Cypress currently has six board members.Cypress and Mr. Rodgers haven't immediately returned calls seeking comment.Cypress, based in San Jose, Calif., originally sold chips known as static random-access memory but has branched into other markets. Along the way, Mr. Rodgers, a manufacturing expert, gambled outside the semiconductor industry by buying and later spinning off solar-panel maker             SunPower Corp.In August of last year, Cypress named       Hassane El-Khoury       as its president and chief executive and newest board member. Mr. El-Khoury joined Cypress in 2007 after serving in a series of positions at Continental Automotive Systems Inc., one of the best-known suppliers of electronic products for car makers.Last year, the company generated sales of $1.92 billion, up 19.6% from a year earlier.Shares in Cypress fell 1.6% to $13.38 in recent trading Monday.Write to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 10:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cypress-semiconductor-founder-scores-win-in-proxy-fight-1497279014", "news_title": "Cypress Semiconductor Founder Scores Win in Proxy Fight", "keywords": "cypress semiconductor,eric benhamou,hassane el-khoury,institutional shareholder services,proxy,proxy fight,raymond bingham,t.j. rodgers,w. steve albrecht,Cypress Semiconductor,CY,Institutional Shareholder Services,Eric Benhamou,T.J.

Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Alex Coppola.The financial advisories with the healthiest growth today are those that reflect more diversity both in terms of their staff and the clients they serve. For firms that want to improve their ability to meet the needs of those clients, it\u2019s important to both recognize the country\u2019s changing demographics and make active efforts to engage with diverse groups.The first demographic for firms to consider is age. A recent survey asked advisers to compare the ages of their client base against the makeup of the national affluent market. It found that, in general, firms are serving a greater percentage of older clients, though younger ones represent a larger percentage of the overall market.Despite the fact that one-third of all affluent clients are now age 45 and under, firms have a tendency to overlook younger clients, in part because they don\u2019t believe they\u2019re interested in advice. (What\u2019s interesting is that those younger clients have a similar opinion about themselves\u2014many don\u2019t believe they\u2019re worthy of financial advice until they have at least $1 million in investable assets.)As advisers, we have to understand that correcting that disconnect about the need for advice is not up to the consumer. It is incumbent on us to recognize the issue and be intentional in our efforts to engage those clients. The research we\u2019ve done on our own firms shows that those with a greater percentage of younger clients outgrew those with an older base by a 150% margin.Next, consider adviser gender. Gender diversity has been shown to lead to better outcomes. Firms where both women and men are well represented tend to grow at a greater rate than those with an all-female or all-male staff. One way to promote gender diversity is to actively expand the talent pool you\u2019re drawing from, seeking out a wider range of candidates with perspectives, experiences and skills that are different from your own. That pool should not only include female advisers, but also those of different cultural backgrounds.A diversity of cultural backgrounds isn\u2019t currently very well reflected in the advising world. Although fewer than two-thirds of the country is white, more than three-quarters of all advisers are. On the other hand, African-American and Latino advisers make up 8% and 7% of the advising community and 13% and 16% of the population, respectively. Yet only 21% of all advisers felt that minorities were underserved\u2014and that\u2019s a problem for clients and advisers.Firms often struggle to take stock of the client market\u2014to see beyond their own experience and that closes them off to possibility. They don\u2019t push themselves to understand and address the underserved minority community, to recognize that female advisers could add much-needed dimension to their practices, or that young people want their help. I would encourage advisers and firms to challenge themselves to reflect on and explore these issues.The face of America is changing quickly. To maintain the status quo is to do so at some peril. Finding ways to embrace and reflect diversity is one of the surest ways forward.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 10:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/embrace-diversityof-clients-and-advisers-1497278994", "news_title": "Embrace Diversity\u2026of Clients and Advisers", "keywords": "commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil,natural gas product markets,energy commentary,routine market,financial news,refined product market commentary,banking,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan\u2014A man sentenced to death over the weekend\u00a0by a Pakistani court for committing blasphemy on Facebook plans to appeal the conviction, his lawyer said Monday, the first such punishment in Pakistan for blasphemy on social media.A court in the central city of Bahawalpur on Saturday sentenced Taimoor Raza, 30 years old, to death, after finding him guilty of insulting figures revered in Islam, including the Prophet Muhammad and his wives.The verdict comes amid a government crackdown on blasphemous comments on social media. Authorities launched the campaign earlier this year, citing public anger. Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan has said content against Islam and its revered figures is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cintolerable for any Muslim\u201d.Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where even an allegation of an insult to Islam can lead to violence.Mr. Raza\u2019s lawyer,       Fida Hussain Rana,        said his client, a Shiite Muslim, was targeted after he had an argument about a sectarian matter with two Sunni Muslims on Facebook.Mr. Raza was arrested in April last year and accused of posting content on social media that insulted Islam\u2019s Prophet Muhammad, his wives and close companions, according to police reports and court documents. Insulting Prophet Muhammad carries a maximum penalty of death under Pakistani law.Mr. Rana said that there was \u201cabsolutely no material evidence\u201d to support the charges, and that he was hopeful a higher court will overturn the verdict. Mr. Rana described the verdict as \u201ca miscarriage of justice.\"Sectarian violence has claimed hundreds of lives in Pakistan in recent years, most of them Shiite Muslims. Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country, with Shiites making up an estimated 20% of the population. Sunni extremist groups consider Shiites heretics.While Pakistan has never executed anyone convicted of blasphemy, people accused of it have often been killed by mobs and vigilantes.Human rights organizations and activists say the blasphemy law is regularly abused. Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy law has \u201cbeen used to target some of the most vulnerable people in society, including children, individuals with mental disabilities, members of religious minorities and the poor,\u201d Amnesty International said in a report last year.Pakistan has seen a number of high-profile blasphemy-related incidents this year, amid the government crackdown on online content.In March, Pakistani authorities ran ads in newspapers asking the public to come forward with any information about blasphemous content, a move activists warned would lead to attacks by mobs and vigilantes.Human Rights Watch said last month that the government\u2019s move is shrinking space for free expression and targeting dissenting voices.The lynching in April of a university student by other students over allegations of blasphemy shocked Pakistan and prompted international condemnation. A police investigation concluded this month that Mashal Khan, the student, never committed any act that could be considered blasphemous under Pakistani law.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 10:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/man-to-appeal-death-sentence-in-pakistan-for-blasphemy-on-facebook-1497276395", "news_title": "Man to Appeal Death Sentence in Pakistan for Blasphemy on Facebook ", "keywords": "appeal,blasphemous comments, blasphemy, death sentence, facebook,facebook posts,human rights, killing,pakistan,pakistan court,pakistan death penalty,pakistani man, shiite,social media, sunni,taimoor raza,verdict,political,general news,crime,legal action,death penalty,capital punishment,cybercrime,hacking"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014GoJek is beating its international rivals in the race for users at home in Indonesia, according to Nadiem Makarim, co-founder of the fast-growing motorcycle-hailing startup.\u201cIn terms of competition, we\u2019re clearly number one across verticals,\u201d said Mr. Makarim, speaking Friday at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s D.Live Asia conference in Hong Kong.Go-Jek, which is backed by             KKR        KKR 1.62%       & Co., Warburg Pincus LLC and others, is locked in a battle with Uber Technologies Inc. and Singapore-based Grab for Indonesia\u2019s more than 250 million consumers.The company launched its app in 2015 and is named after the motorcycle taxis, or ojeks, that customers can summon on its platform.

A weaker pound means exports are cheaper for foreign buyers. Foreign wares become more expensive in the U.K.But, as for many British industries, the reality isn\u2019t straightforward. Plus, last week\u2019s U.K. election adds to uncertainty over what Brexit will look like, say winegrowers.English winemakers must buy their gear and vines from countries where winemaking is better established. English wine is a niche product, mostly sold domestically\u2014unlike Scottish\u00a0whiskey,\u00a0the global market is small. And domestic drinkers aren\u2019t readily willing to give up their beloved Champagne, even if English wine comes with a cheaper price tag.For English winemakers, \u201cthere\u2019s no real benefit at all,\u201d from the weaker pound, says       Bob Lindo,        a former pilot who turned to vine-growing 27 years ago, after a mid-air collision ended his Royal Air Force career.In many cases, the fall in the pound isn\u2019t helping sales. The long-term nature of the business means it can take six years or more for planting additional vines to result in more\u00a0wine\u00a0on the shelf.At the same time, the currency move means vineyards have to absorb higher import costs. Most of the specialist equipment and raw materials for producing\u00a0wine, from the vines themselves, to fermenting tanks, glass bottles and corks, can only be bought abroad and usually come from France or elsewhere in the eurozone.\u201cWinegrowers now have to buy at the new exchange rate,\u201d said Mr. Lindo. \u201cIt depends what stage of the cycle you\u2019re at\u2014if you\u2019re just starting out, then you\u2019ve had a 7% or 8% increase in costs.\u201dMr. Lindo, whose\u00a0Camel Valley\u00a0vineyard is based in\u00a0Cornwall\u2014a southwest region that voted to leave the European Union in last year\u2019s referendum\u2014added that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the result of the vote.Mark Driver,        a former hedge-fund manager at London\u2019s Horseman Capital who quit to set up\u00a0winery\u00a0Rathfinny Estate, voted to leave the EU but says \u201ccosting will certainly increase\u201d because of the weaker pound.He still has to invest around \u00a34 million ($5 million) in the\u00a0winery\u00a0he is building. Around half of this will be in euros and covers bottling, disgorging and riddling equipment from France and Italy and 250,000 vines from Germany and France.\u201cBrexit could be adding 5%-to-7% to our capital investment bill over the next year,\u201d Mr. Driver said.This could mean a bill roughly \u00a3200,000 to \u00a3280,000 higher than before the Brexit vote. However, Mr. Driver believes the weaker pound will be positive for sales as overseas buyers find it cheaper to buy English wine.Others in an industry that mostly favored staying in the EU\u00a0echoed his concerns.\u201cIt is affecting margins. It does have an impact,\u201d said       Tamara Roberts,        chief executive of Ridgeview Estate. Her company, which makes sparkling\u00a0wine in Sussex, south of London, is the official supplier to receptions at the U.K. prime minister\u2019s Downing Street residence.Ms. Roberts said domestic and foreign sales had been buoyant in the first half of 2017, but it was hard to know how much of this was due to the pound\u2019s fall.She said\u00a0she saw little chance that weaker sterling would help English\u00a0wine\u00a0displace \u201cthe power and place of Champagne\u201d among U.K. buyers. Champagne is \u201calmost immune to any exchange rate\u201d moves, she said.English wine is exactly the sort of industry U.K. politicians want to nurture, but it is also one of the sectors most affected by the massive forces unleashed by\u00a0last summer\u2019s referendum.More than most U.K. industries, English\u00a0wine\u00a0competes head-on with an EU rival\u2014English Chardonnay and Pinot Noir-based sparkling\u00a0wines\u00a0are closely modeled on Champagne from northern France.English winemakers grow their grapes domestically, benefiting from a similar climate to northern France. The sector is expected to double production by 2020.Miles Beale,        chief executive of The\u00a0Wine\u00a0and Spirit Trade Association, told the industry body\u2019s annual conference back in September that Brexit presents \u201cperhaps the ultimate disruption\u201d for the U.K.\u00a0wine\u00a0and spirits industries. However, he told The Wall Street Journal that the weaker pound could help the English\u00a0wine\u00a0industry\u2019s ambition of boosting exports 10-fold by 2020.Uncertainty remains over the future of the EU\u2019s grants to the English\u00a0wine\u00a0industry, which have helped train winegrowers and build wineries. The cash, which is earmarked for rural development, is sent to the U.K. government, which part-matches the funding and decides how it is allocated.Simon Robinson,        a lawyer who owns Hattingley Valley\u00a0winery and is chairman of the English\u00a0Wine\u00a0Producers association, said he was worried about the future of EU grants, which \u201chave provided substantial amounts of money to the industry.\u201dWrite to Laurence Fletcher at laurence.fletcher@wsj.com and Tapan Panchal at Tapan.Panchal@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Wine Industry in Ferment Over Brexit.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 09:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/englands-upcoming-wine-industry-in-ferment-over-brexit-1497275437", "news_title": "England\u2019s Growing Wine Industry in Ferment Over Brexit ", "keywords": "European Union,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,international relations,food,drink,living,lifestyle,politics,domestic politics,wine,beer,spirits,money,currency markets,commodity,financial market news,beverages,tobacco,alcoholic beverages,drinks,consumer goods"}, {"content": "The U.K. wants to separate from Europe.

The pledges were to be made at a Rotary International convention in Atlanta.The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which includes Rotary, the Gates Foundation, and other organizations, set the cost of polio eradication activities between 2013 and 2019 at $7 billion. The new pledges leave about $300 million still to be raised.The GPEI has missed previous deadlines that it set for eradicating polio, a highly infectious virus which primarily affects young children and can cause paralysis. There is reason to hope the latest goal can be met, because there have been only five cases of polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan this year, two countries where transmission of polio has never been stopped. Vaccination campaigns have improved, reaching children in communities hard to access before.But some areas controlled by insurgent groups are still hard to reach. Polio resurfaced in Nigeria last year, after the World Health Organization had declared that the country had eliminated it. There have also been six polio cases reported this year in Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo from a form of the virus derived from the oral vaccine. In addition, an injectable form of the vaccine is in short supply, forcing health officials to prioritize who gets it. And future funding from the U.S. government, a major contributor, is uncertain as Congress must now weigh sharp cuts to foreign aid proposed by the Trump administration.\u201c2020 is feasible but it\u2019s probably a best-case scenario,\u201d       John Hewko,        general secretary of Rotary International said in an interview. Rotary, which works through its members in countries on programs to vaccinate children and conduct surveillance for the virus, is increasing its goal for annual contribution to $50 million a year from $35 million a year, with its dollars matched two to one by the Gates Foundation.For the 2020 goal to be met, no more cases of polio could occur after this year, because the WHO will declare eradication only three years after the last case. \u201cif we don\u2019t get some big increase in instability in those countries, we have a very good chance that this would be the last year of cases,\u201d       Bill Gates,        the billionaire philanthropist and Gates Foundation co-chair, said in an interview.Still, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re still very worried about Nigeria and we very worried about Syria.\u201dThe most sensitive test for whether polio is circulating is not illnesses, but presence of the virus in sewage samples, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a lot of positive sewage samples in various parts of Pakistan,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to execute very well this year in order to stay on track,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cif we have cases in 2018, then we miss 2020.\u201dWrite to Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 08:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donors-fund-effort-to-declare-polio-eradicated-in-2020-1497270601", "news_title": "Donors Fund Effort to Declare Polio Eradicated in 2020", "keywords": " bill & melinda gates foundation, bill gates, gates foundation, global polio eradication initiative, gpei, john hewko, melinda gates,polio, polio eradication 2020, polio eradication deadline,rotary international,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Rotary International,political,general news,charities,philanthropy,community,civic groups,society,demographic health,health,infant,child,teenage health,immunizations,medical conditions,vector-borne diseases,medical treatments,procedures,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "Turkey\u2019s economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter this year as government spending, domestic demand and exports surged.Gross domestic product expanded by an annualized 5% in the first three months of 2017, the state statistics agency said Monday. While outpacing the 3.8% pace forecast by analysts in a survey by The Wall Street Journal, accelerating from 3.5% in the fourth quarter of last year.After the data, Turkish lira extended its gains to trade 0.4% higher against the dollar at TRY3.5240 compared with TRY3.5316 before the data. Meanwhile, the yield on two-year benchmark bonds was at 11% compared with 11.03% close on Friday. Turkey\u2019s main BIST-100 index was up 0.7%.\u201cThe Turkish economy is recovering much faster than previously anticipated after slowing down last year following the failed coup,\u201d said       Piotr Matys,        emerging market strategist at Rabobank. \u201cWhile a substantial fiscal stimulus provided by the government is a major source of economic activity, private consumption and exports are important pillars of growth as well\u2026The next important step for the government to put the economy on the path of well-balanced and sustainable GDP growth would be to implement a comprehensive package of economic reforms.\u201dBetter-than-anticipated economic growth came after Turkey in April approved a constitutional referendum consolidating more power with President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s       office.The vote result was seen market friendly by investors as a sign of political stability in the country which was hit by uncertainties following last year\u2019s failed coup attempt, which led to an economic contraction in the third quarter for the first time in seven years.Turkey\u2019s economy shrank 1.3% in the third quarter of 2016 as domestic demand ebbed and tourism revenues tumbled due to terror attacks, failed putsch and strained relations with European countries over the past year.The government took a series of measures to support the economy and stabilize the currency, which slumped to record lows against the dollar in the beginning of this year. The central bank raised interest rates and tightened lira liquidity to prop up the currency.In its latest April meeting, the central bank raised the late-liquidity lending rate to 12.25% from 11.75%. It kept the one-week repo rate at 8%, the overnight lending rate at 9.25% and the overnight borrowing rate at 7.25%.This was the bank\u2019s third tightening so far this year to curb inflation, which jumped to nearly nine-year high of 11.87% in April before slowing to 11.72% in May and was more than double the central bank\u2019s inflation target of 5%.Turkey\u2019s central bank is due to hold its next monetary policy committee meeting on Thursday.\u201cThe much sharper-than-expected increase in Turkish GDP in Q1\u2026has prompted us to revise up our GDP growth forecast for the year as a whole to 4.3%. At the margin, today\u2019s figures make it more likely that the central bank will resist pressure from the government to lower interest rates,\u201d said       William Jackson,        senior emerging market economist at Capital Economics.Deputy Prime Minister       Mehmet Simsek       told broadcaster NTV Monday that leading indicators suggest that \u201ceconomic growth accelerated in the second quarter\u201d.He added that the country\u2019s economic growth would beat the government\u2019s 4.4% target this year.The breakdown of the first quarter GDP data showed government consumption rose 9.4% on the year in the first quarter, while consumer spending soared 5.1% and exports of goods and services jumped 10.6% during the same period.Write to Yeliz Candemir at yeliz.candemir@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 08:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-economy-thrives-on-increased-spending-demand-and-exports-1497270471", "news_title": "Turkey\u2019s Economy Thrives on Increased Spending, Demand and Exports ", "keywords": "economic performance,indicators,economic growth,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news"}, {"content": "Lyft drivers are getting an upgrade.The U.K.\u2019s luxury-vehicle duo Jaguar Land Rover has invested $25 million in Lyft Inc., the latest auto company to strike a deal with the Silicon Valley ride-hailing company.Under the agreement, the companies will collaborate on \u201cmobility services\u201d, including self-driving cars, and certain Lyft drivers will be supplied with Jaguar or Land Rover vehicles, likely for testing purposes.The partnership follows a wave of conventional auto companies pairing with a growing patchwork of tech companies, startups or companies not seen as conventional players in the car business on autonomous-vehicle technology and testing.

In April, Ford moved its entire engineering and purchasing staff into space once inhabited by department-store chain Lord & Taylor. Ford is now the mall\u2019s largest tenant, with 240,000 square feet of space.\u201cOur relationship began as good neighbors,\u201d said       Michael Powers,        senior vice president of leasing at Starwood. \u201cThen we found out they were in the market for office space. It was somewhat serendipitous.\u201dAs retailers close bricks-and-mortar stores at an accelerating pace, shopping-center landlords like Starwood Capital are facing a vexing question: What to do with all this empty space?Their solutions are varied but all have a common element: reducing, or even eliminating, retail from the equation.Some landlords plug empty spaces with churches, for-profit schools and random enterprises while they figure out a long-term plan. Others see a future in mixed-use real estate, converting malls into streetscapes with restaurants, offices and housing. And some are razing properties altogether and turning them into entertainment or industrial parks.Ford\u2019s 10-year lease at Fairlane Town Center \u201cbrought 1,800 to 2,000 employed people to our property, people with a paycheck,\u201d said Mr. Powers. The mall, which is still anchored by             Macy\u2019s,J.C. Penney                   and Sears, is currently 91% leased, he said, and its food operators are doing better in the daytime than they did before, as Ford workers pile in for lunch.Ford liked the mall\u2019s proximity to its main facility in Dearborn, which is being rebuilt over the next 10 years, and its wide open spaces.\u201cWe didn\u2019t move walls, didn\u2019t change anything in a significant way,\u201d said       Dave Dubensky,        chairman and chief executive of Ford Land, the company\u2019s real estate arm.A construction binge in the 1980s and \u201990s left the U.S. oversaturated with malls. Growth in online sales and declining demand for full-priced goods are causing retailers to shrink their store fleets and divert resources to e-commerce platforms.In all, retailers have announced 2,880 store closings from January to April 6 of this year, more than twice as many as in the same period a year earlier, according to             Credit Suisse.       For the full year, the investment bank anticipates more than 8,600 stores to close. Analysts predict that 400 or so of the roughly 1,100 malls in the U.S. will close in the coming years.Many mall owners are trying to liven up the experience, bringing more dining and entertainment tenants and eschewing the traditional mix of middling food courts, fashion retailers and department stores.\u201cThe appetite for experimentation is there,\u201d said       Matthew Billerbeck,        a Seattle-based senior vice president of design and architecture firm CallisonRTKL. \u201cThe industry had gotten complacent and formulaic.\u201dOne strategy is to convert enclosed malls into open-air properties that landlords call \u201clifestyle centers,\u201d with apartments, theaters, grocery stores, medical offices and other conveniences\u2014and much less retail.In Arlington, Va., landlord             Forest City Realty Trust                   is redeveloping Ballston Common Mall by knocking down the main entrance to create a plaza, removing two-thirds of the roof and installing more windows to create wider vistas of open spaces. The Cleveland-based real-estate investment trust is also building 406 apartments linked to the mall.\u201cWe\u2019re turning the mall inside out,\u201d said Will Voegele, senior vice president at Forest City Realty Trust. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a building with its back turned to the street.\u201dThe firm is converting what was once Macy\u2019s furniture store on the third level of the mall into a gathering space for residents, including outdoor patios, seating and landscaping. Its tenant mix will feature more food options and street-facing retail.At the Staten Island Mall in New York City, shopping-center real-estate investment trust             GGP Inc.       is adding 235,000 square feet of space in an expansion expected to be completed next fall. Entertainment operators such as AMC theaters and             Dave & Buster\u2019s                   will take up 54% of the space, while food tenants including             Shake Shack                   will account for 20%. Apparel tenants such as Zara will make up just 17%.The remaining space will be taken up by home-furnishing and personal-care shops as well as other enterprises such as Apple Bank. Discount supermarket operator Lidl will open there soon.In GGP\u2019s holdings of more than 130 shopping centers, apparel takes up half of the portfolio by gross leasable area. Food has risen to 13% from 6% and is projected to go to 20% by 2025, said GGP Chief Executive       Sandeep Mathrani       in a recent earnings call. Apparel will fall by another 10% or so by the fall, and stabilize at around 40%, he said.\u2018Many mall owners are trying to liven up the experience, bringing more dining and entertainment tenants and eschewing the traditional mix.\u2019Sometimes developers conclude that the only way to save a dying mall is to level it and start over.The City Center mall in downtown Columbus, Ohio, was a community centerpiece where pop bands such as Hanson performed in the 1990s.But the 1.25-million-square-foot mall started to deteriorate as competition from shopping centers such as the Mall at Tuttle Crossing, Easton Town Center and Polaris Fashion Place increased.City Center\u2019s anchor department stores, Lazarus, Kaufmann\u2019s and Jacobson\u2019s, closed in the 2000s, and vacancy rates jumped to 75%.The city in 2007 sued the owners for the mall and sought to evict them, accusing them of neglecting the property. The city purchased the property that year in hopes of redeveloping it, but closed it in 2009.\u201cWe looked at 10 different redevelopment plans,\u201d said Guy Worley, chief executive and president of Columbus Downtown Development Corp., a nonprofit development firm. \u201cIt was built to be a mall and nothing else.\u201dSo the city \u201csurgically demolished\u201d the property over a two-year period to retain the underground parking structure, which was still used by workers downtown. In 2011, Columbus Downtown opened a park in its place called Columbus Commons, which has a performance space, two cafes, a carousel and bocce courts.The park has spurred development around its perimeter, mostly office and residential, and hosts more than 200 events annually. The flagship Lazarus department store, which had been linked to the mall, is now an office building.Taking some inspiration from parks and high-street retail in New York City, Mr. Worley said Columbus Downtown is looking to add restaurants and art galleries along the streets a block away from the park, preferring to keep the park-facing buildings for residential use.While there have been no pure retail property projects around Columbus Commons, some retail stores are coming onboard that are \u201cmore organic, not national retailers,\u201d he added.\u201cRetail is coming back,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s following residential.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-12 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mall-of-the-future-will-have-no-stores-1497268801", "news_title": "The Mall of the Future Will Have No Stores ", "keywords": "ballston common mall,city center mall,columbus downtown development corp.,commercial real estae,fairlane town center ,ford land,forest city realty trust,ggp,mall real estate,malls,shopping-center landlords ,shopping center real estate,shopping centers,starwood capital group,staten island mall,the new mall,Ford Motor,F,Starwood Capital Group,Forest City Realty Trust,FCEA,FCE.A,Easton Town Center,Fairlane Town Center,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,real estate,property,motor vehicles,passenger cars,building construction,residential building construction,retail construction,retail,wholesale,mixed retailing,department stores,shopping malls,superstores,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,real estate transactions,retail real estate,alternative investments,automotive,commercial,industrial real estate,construction,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Good morning.

Delta is ending its sponsorship entirely, while Bank of America is withdrawing its support only of this particular play. The storm comes soon after Kathy Griffin lost an endorsement deal and a CNN New Year\u2019s Eve hosting gig after appearing in a photo shoot holding the fake bloodied head of a beheaded Trump. Over the weekend, CNN dropped TV host Reza Aslan, who sent a profanity-laden tweet in criticism of the president. The flare-up this time is on a smaller scale, but it follows the same social-media-outrage playbook, and corporate brands that have been shamed publicly are moving quicker than ever to pull the plug.The last bastions of print are moving on. Luxury fashion houses increasingly are turning their backs on glossy print ads and reinvesting some of that money into digital, The Wall Street Journal reports. The luxury industry as a whole still spends more than twice as much on print ads than digital: $2.6 billion versus $1.01 billion in 2016, according to Zenith. But the sector\u2019s spend on digital has increased 63% since 2013, while print ad spending dropped 8%. Luxury brands, which for years had developed the muscle memory of buying page after page of ads in fashion magazines and working with their editors on shoots and shows, are starting to slowly realize the value of influencers and their own brand platforms on social media sites. Most magazines are one step ahead of the trend and are behaving more like creative agencies to capture those digital dollars and keep luxury fashion houses within their branded environments.German discount grocery chain Aldi is set to announce a plan to invest $5 billion to open nearly 900 stores and remodel hundreds more in the U.S. over the next five years, WSJ reports. In Europe, Aldi has had a profound impact on the grocery market, stealing market share from the major supermarkets and forcing them to bring down their prices. Aldi doesn\u2019t tend to spend large amounts on big marketing campaigns, but it gets customers through the door thanks to its deep discounting and focus on private-label brands, which keeps prices down. Consumers in the U.S. are becoming less loyal to well-known brands, which could encourage them to give Aldi a try. Just as happened in Europe, traditional grocers such as Wal-Mart and Kroger -- which already are having to shift their approaches to compete with online rivals such are Amazon -- are probably are going to find themselves in the middle of another price war if Aldi\u2019s U.S. expansion is a success. That too could squeeze consumer-goods giants who are reliant on traditional grocers for millions of dollars in sales.Fox has begun offering a national 24-hour feed on Hulu in more than 70 markets where it hasn\u2019t come to agreements with local affiliate stations, the Journal reports. Fox is also said to be looking to launch the feed on other streaming outlets such as AT&T\u2019s DirecTV Now and PlayStation Vue. While cutting out affiliates does mean Fox keeps the entire share of the fees it receives from such streaming services to carry its content, running a national feed does carry an element of risk. Some broadcast-industry executives have said consumers may be disappointed by a national feed that doesn\u2019t carry their usual local news programming. 21st Century Fox and WSJ parent News Corp share common ownership.Univision\u2019s acquisition of Gawker Media has been messy, hamstrung by an exodus of top staff, a stricter editorial approach, and payroll and benefit issues.

The meeting capped a difficult stretch for the ride-hailing company, which is trying to weather an investigation into its workplace culture, a federal probe into its business practices and the recent departures of top executives. The company is also facing a lawsuit by Google parent Alphabet over the alleged theft of self-driving-car trade secrets, which Uber denies. Chief Business Officer Emil Michael was planning to resign as soon as today, a potential exit said to be related to a report on Uber\u2019s workplace culture by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder.       Mr. Michael\u2019s departure could complicate a proposal that Mr. Kalanick step aside for a spell.The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate increases aren\u2019t having the desired effect of cooling off Wall Street\u2019s hot streak. While Fed officials this week will likely raise short-term interest rates for a fourth time since December 2015, much of that tightening effort has yet to be felt in financial markets. Stocks have rallied this year, reaching record levels, while bond yields have fallen\u2014developments that tend to prompt more borrowing, faster economic growth and more market speculation. Easy financial conditions create a risk the market could overheat and then snap back, sending yields soaring and choking off lending, says the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. The fact that the Fed and Wall Street are moving in opposite directions suggests limits to the central bank\u2019s influence over the economy.

Mr. Comey, during his testimony last week, raised the possibility of additional concerns about Mr. Sessions\u2019s dealings with Russia during the Trump campaign. In a weekend letter, Mr. Sessions canceled previously planned public testimony before the House and Senate appropriations panels. He said the testimony by Mr. Comey, whom Mr. Trump fired in early May, made it \u201cimportant that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum\u201d\u2014the Senate Intelligence Committee.You might have heard that             Facebook                   is working on a way for you to message your friends and update your news feed \u2026 telepathically.

But it turns out I missed one of the craziest basketball games ever? Here\u2019s how crazy it was: I woke up at like 4 a.m. to a text from a friend of mine that said: \u201cIs 49 points at end of first quarter normal?\u201d and I thought to myself: Good lord, the Warriors are steamrolling them. And went back to sleep.Wrong! Cavs won. But that\u2019s just the start of it. What happened?BEN: What happened was complete, utter weirdness. That\u2019s really the only way I can put it. Game 3 was the best game of the NBA season. Game 4 was one of the weirdest. The crowd was desperate. The refs lost control. The Warriors were possibly overconfident, and the Cavs were undeniably insane. They hung 49 points in the first quarter\u2014and they missed eight free throws. It\u2019s so hard to do that in a playoff game that it had never been done before.GAY: Now I know I sound like a talk-radio host here, or Jim Carrey in \u201cDumb and Dumber,\u201d but is there a... chance Cleveland gets itself into this thing?COHEN: The Cavs have experience coming back from a 3-1 lead against the Warriors, the same amount of pressure required for a water balloon and the French word for basketball genius: LeBron. So I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a chance. Is it a good chance? I don\u2019t know. I still don\u2019t know.The big question in this series is whether the Cavs won because they found a real strategy or because they had a ridiculous shooting night. There are some reasons to believe it\u2019s the former. The Cavs kept Game 2 close, they probably should have won Game 3 and they did win Game 4. They\u2019re limiting Stephen Curry\u2019s looks. They\u2019re daring Draymond Green to shoot, and he was 1-of-6 on his open threes Friday. They\u2019re shooting more 3-pointers themselves: 31 in Game 1, 29 in Game, then 44 in Game 3 and 45 in Game 4. They\u2019re finally slowing the pace down to a speed they can handle. They\u2019re also riding LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Here\u2019s a remarkable statistic from the league\u2019s SportVU data: LeBron and Kyrie had 1,673 dribbles in Games 3 and 4; the entire Warriors team had 1,501 dribbles.The lesson of this year\u2019s Finals, though, is that they\u2019re not last year\u2019s Finals. That\u2019s worth remembering before Game 5. Think about what had to happen for the Cavs to win Game 5 last year. LeBron had to score 41. Kyrie had to score 41. Draymond had to literally not be in the building. I don\u2019t know they can do that again\u2014especially because the Warriors purchased an insurance policy named Kevin Durant for exactly this situation. They also know they have to win. Golden State is in serious trouble if this gets to a Game 6 or Game 7. It reminds me of Stephen Curry going to see \u201cHamilton\u201d (twice!) and, like everyone who sees \u201cHamilton\u201d (even once), walking around for days afterward singing about not throwing away his shot. This is his shot.But the fact that it\u2019s even a possibility the Warriors could blow another 3-1 lead is almost solely because of LeBron. Here\u2019s a little-known secret: The guy is amazing at basketball. To watch him in person and see the way he controls every part of the game is really mesmerizing. So here\u2019s my question: Is he as spellbinding for you as       Roger Federer      ?GAY: I feel you\u2019re just handing me meat off the back of a truck with a LeBron vs. Federer comparison. It is a weird one to be sure, but there\u2019s sense to it in this regard: They both continue to be utterly motivated to play at a super high level despite the fact that they\u2019ve basically done it all. Both of them have come back from painful defeats to play with renewed vigor and joy, and even though they\u2019re both tremendous off-court workers, there\u2019s a naturalness to their style that\u2019s almost beautiful, as in they\u2019re both born to do this, and they actually like to do it.Also: WHAT IS UP WITH PEOPLE SAYING KEVIN DURANT IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD? DURANT IS AWESOME, A BRILLIANT AND GROUNDBREAKING PLAYER FOR CERTAIN, BUT CAN I ASK THESE DURANTOLOGISTS WHAT THEY THINK LEBRON WOULD LOOK LIKE IF HE WAS ON THE WARRIORS? SHEESH.BEN: LeBron would be awesome on the Warriors. But he still wouldn\u2019t be as good as Michael Jordan and the Warriors still wouldn\u2019t be able to beat any team that played before 1998.By the way, apparently there are people who didn\u2019t like watching Game 4 because there wasn\u2019t enough defense, because it looked too much like an All-Star Game? Here\u2019s what I have to say to those people. It looked like an All-Star Game because it was an All-Star Game; there were 11 players on the court who have been All-Stars in their careers. And there wasn\u2019t enough defense because the offense was that incredible. The shotmaking in these games has been at the highest level imaginable. LeBron, Curry, Durant and Kyrie are creating looks that weren\u2019t even conceivable not that long ago. Anyone who wishes basketball looked the way it did in the 1980s should take a time machine to the 1980s and never come back. Phew. That felt good.Now back to Durant. The rush to anoint Durant as the best player in the world is bizarre, and it\u2019s the result of people needing something new to say about a series in which there wasn\u2019t much new to say. LeBron is the best player in the world. Durant might be the second best. And that\u2019s OK! There are billions of people on this flat earth, and Kevin Durant is better at basketball than almost every single one of them. Imagine being so much better than the average person in anything you do. I\u2019m only better than everyone at getting scratched by a very specific, very mentally unstable cat.Jason, you said Cavs in 7 before the series, and you stuck to Cavs in 7 when they were down 2-0. The only way they can win now is in seven games. So... Cavs in 7?GAY: My prediction only ages like a fine Napa wine. I\u2019m 100% correct until I am not.BEN: And were you the one who hacked J.R. Smith\u2019s             Twitter                  ?GAY: If I was going to hack that guy, don\u2019t you think I would have tried something better?Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com and Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 07:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ben-gay-the-cavs-big-shot-lebron-vs-federer-and-who-hacked-j-r-1497266742", "news_title": "Ben & Gay: The Cavs\u2019 Big Shot, LeBron vs. Federer and Who Hacked J.R.?", "keywords": "cleveland cavaliers,golden state warriors,nba finals,Cleveland Cavaliers,Golden State Warriors,Roger Federer,basketball,political,general news,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,sports,recreation,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "SHANGHAI\u2014China\u2019s passenger-car market is suffering a lean spell, mirroring a similar slowdown in the U.S. auto sector, with sales falling for the second month in a row in May as higher taxes hurt.Passenger-car sales in the world\u2019s biggest auto market dropped 2.6% to 1.75 million last month, the government-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Monday.That performance followed a 3.7% decline in April, the sharpest since a mid-2015 slump, which prompted the government to slash its auto-sales tax to 5% from 10% to stoke demand.\u201cThe market is gloomy,\u201d said Xu Haidong, the association\u2019s assistant secretary-general, blaming \u201coverconsumption\u201d last year for weak demand now.Passenger-car sales surged 16% in 2016, thanks in part to the government\u2019s tax cut. But Beijing raised the tax back to 7.5% at the start of this year, sapping buyer interest in the early months of 2017.Tighter liquidity controls are also making some Chinese banks reluctant to finance auto purchases, said       Robin Zhu,        an auto analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, a research and brokerage firm.Having forecast 4.6% growth for the China auto market in 2017 at the start of this year, Mr. Zhu said there is now a risk of growth failing to achieve that level.However, surging demand for commercial vehicles is offsetting sluggish passenger-car sales.Sales of commercial vehicles in China increased 15% year-over-year in May to 345,000. The commercial vehicle market grew 18% in the first five months of 2017.While total vehicle sales declined marginally in May by 0.1% year-over-year, they increased 3.7% in the first five months overall.China\u2019s auto market has entered a slow period that was inevitable after 2016\u2019s record-setting sales, Mr. Xu said, likening the slowdown in China to that in the U.S., where passenger-car sales fell 0.9% in May and 4.7% in April.But car dealers and auto makers are hoping for a year-end sales boost, as buyers try to make purchases before an expected tax increase to 10% takes effect.\u2014Lilian Lin contributed to this article.Write to Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 07:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-passenger-car-market-continues-to-slow-1497266623", "news_title": "China Passenger-Car Market Pulls Back Again", "keywords": "china auto sales,china car sales,China Association of Automobile Manufacturers,Robin Zhu,Xu Haidong,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,car registrations,vehicle sales,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,retail,wholesale,motor vehicle dealing,specialty stores"}, {"content": "MEXICO CITY\u2014Here is what Bruce Arena knows about the game of soccer\u2014the first thing a team has to do is defend and keep the other team from putting crooked numbers up on the scoreboard.Another thing the U.S. head coach knows\u2014defense is mostly about desire and commitment and heart and a willingness to fight. It has very little to do with ball skills, or the innate feel for the game that the rest of the world has and for the most part, Americans lack. It isn\u2019t often pretty, but when done well it produces results and is nothing to apologize for.Arena certainly wasn\u2019t apologizing Sunday night here, after escaping Estadio Azteca with a 1-1 draw in World Cup qualifying against archrival Mexico, the best team in the region and a side that has owned the U.S. the past two years.The Americans got an early goal from Michael Bradley in the sixth minute on what might end up being the most memorable play of the U.S. captain\u2019s long international career, then stuck hard to Arena\u2019s defend-first plan that put half his field players on the back line, and often every one of them behind the ball. Mexico\u2019s Carlos Vela equalized 23 minutes in, but El Tri didn\u2019t touch the nets again.\u201cThey came to defend, and we came to score,\u201d said a frustrated Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio after the game.It was all good, Arena said moments later, after his team executed a strategy he planned since January and the team practiced intensely the past two weeks.\u201cWe had a good game,\u201d was Arena\u2019s take. \u201cOur team did an excellent job with our tactical plan.\u201dThat unartful plan placed three center-backs\u2014Omar Gonzalez, Geoff Cameron, and Tim Ream\u2014in the middle of the back line and made sure Bradley and midfielders Paul Arriola and Kellyn Acosta rarely ventured far ahead. Christian Pulisic and Bobby Wood were largely on their own to create an attack.\u201cEvery guy had an idea of his responsibilities,\u201d Bradley said.No matter what happens in the rest of the Concacaf matches this week, the U.S. will enter the final four games of the qualifying tournament in no worse than fourth place. At worst that lands them in a winnable playoff against the fifth best team from Asia\u2014maybe Saudi Arabia, maybe Uzbekistan. They also have a home game coming up against Panama, the team they will likely have to beat out for the third and final automatic qualifying spot from this region.After a miserable start to this final qualifying tournament, including losses to Mexico and Costa Rica, Sunday night likely goes down as the moment the 2018 Russia World Cup became an actual possibility again, Arena said he had no doubt when he was re-hired in November that he would right the foundering ship.Arena has never apologized for trying to grab points wherever he can. Soccer is not a beauty contest for him. Prevent an opponent from scoring and you won\u2019t lose. You will also have a decent chance of stealing a win by converting a scoring chance, however few your team might produce, because every team usually gets at least one.Seven months into his second go-round, he is delivering exactly what he said he would\u2014an unbeautiful team that is physical, competitive, and is coming together with a collective spirit that went into hiding at the end of Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s roller coaster reign, when players had no idea where they would line up on the field until hours before the opening whistle. The 18-year-old wunderkind Pulisic, who put up about 190 minutes of soccer over the past four days, is turning out to be a pretty good asset too.This all makes sense. As Bradley said, the U.S. simply isn\u2019t talented enough to compete with quality teams like Mexico unless every intangible is clicking\u2014desire, belief, tactics, teamwork, fearlessness.On Sunday night, it mostly was, and that was important, since Estadio Azteca is one of the great cauldrons of international soccer, a 100,000-seat vertical behemoth with an overhanging roof that sends roars so loud the it feels like they can be touched straight back down onto the field. The thin air at 7,300 feet can also make players feel like a vise is squeezing their lungs.But Mexico came out a step flat and in the sixth minute Bradley intercepted a pass from Mexican star Javier Hernandez in the middle of the field, took a touch and saw that goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa had wandered more than a dozen yards off his line. Then Bradley went all Carli Lloyd on El Tri, whacking a shot from nearly 40 yards. Ochoa scrambled helplessly back and watched the ball slide above his outstretched arm and just under the crossbar.The score silenced and unsettled the crowd of 100,000 who had come for a party that would have to wait, though only for 17 minutes. With Mexico pushing the attack, Carlos Vela, the former Arsenal striker, streaked across the 18-yard line with the ball at his feet and sent it past U.S. keeper Brad Guzan inside the right post.And there the game stayed, mostly because of those five U.S. men in the back, even though for long periods it appeared that Mexico\u2019s dizzying little passing combinations were going to produce the game winner the Americans seemed fine to live without.To be sure, the soccer gods seemed to deliver some blessings on the U.S. team for this match.Mexico requested the game be played just two days after the first matches of this international period so it could head to Russia for the Confederations Cup. The turnaround was daunting for both teams, and it made Mexico, which appeared only to have about an hour of high-level soccer in its legs, just that much weaker, a break a lesser opponent on the road will always take. Also, just before the opening whistle, the clouds rolled in, hiding what had been a scorching sun that in the past has drained the U.S. players. And somehow Hector Herrera\u2019s free kick from 25 yards with 20 minutes to play clanked off the crossbar.Nothing to apologize for though as the U.S. got a point in World Cup qualifying here for only the third time in 20 years.\u201cWe\u2019re back where we want to be,\u201d Guzan said.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 07:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-u-s-mens-soccer-team-gets-defensive-in-a-draw-against-mexico-1497266499", "news_title": "The U.S. Men\u2019s Soccer Team Gets Defensive in a Draw Against Mexico ", "keywords": "mexico,soccer,u.s. soccer,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Britain\u2019s Brexit minister said Monday that negotiations with the European Union may not start next Monday, as originally planned, raising the prospect that the\u00a0political uncertainty facing the U.K. in the wake of the inconclusive election results could interfere with the timeline for negotiations.David Davis,        the minister overseeing Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, told Sky News that talks should start some time next week.\u00a0\u201cMy permanent secretary is actually in Brussels today talking to them about the details.

The Conservatives have 318 of 650 parliamentary seats, down from 330, and are seeking support from a small Northern Irish party, the Democratic Unionist Party, to support a minority government.Brexit negotiations were scheduled to start in earnest next Monday. Mr. Davis, speaking to the British Broadcasting Corp. in a separate interview, said the election was disappointing but said Mrs. May was a \u201cformidable prime minister.\u201dThe comments came after a weekend of drama that cost Mrs. May her two closest aides as criticism mounted over the prime minister\u2019s missteps in an election she had hoped would strengthen her parliamentary authority before looming Brexit talks with Brussels.Senior Conservative Party figures called for a more collegial approach to government after her tightknit inner circle failed to deliver an expected victory.In a sign of confusion at the very top of government, Mrs. May\u2019s office late Saturday had to backtrack on a statement that it had reached a deal with the DUP over forming a loose alliance to support a new government. The DUP said instead that talks centered on a so-called confidence-and-supply arrangement, a weaker and potentially more unstable partnership than a formal coalition.All the while, the clock has been counting down toward the start of divorce negotiations with the European Union slated for June 19, which European leaders say they expect will go ahead.\u2014Jason Douglas contributed to this article.Write to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 06:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-brexit-minister-says-talks-with-eu-could-face-delays-1497262417", "news_title": "U.K.\u2019s Brexit Minister Says Talks With EU Could Face Delays", "keywords": "brexit,dup, tory party,uk elections, uk prime minister,European Union,Theresa May,David Davis,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections"}, {"content": "TOKYO\u2014            Fujifilm Holdings Corp.        FUJIY 0.54%       said losses from accounting irregularities in New Zealand were much larger than first thought and extended to the company\u2019s Australian office-equipment unit, a development that raises further doubts about Japanese firms\u2019 control over their overseas operations.The Japanese camera and copier maker said six board members at its mainstay subsidiary Fuji Xerox would resign to take responsibility for losses that ballooned to \u00a537.5 billion ($340 million) between fiscal 2010 and 2015, from \u00a522 billion. It also docked pay from all the board members at Fuji Xerox and two senior group executives. Only one of the resigning board members will stay with the company.Fujifilm said the scandal-related losses shouldn\u2019t widen further because it had reviewed all existing contracts at the two units and didn\u2019t see the same problems in any of its other markets, including Japan.The latest example of Japanese accounting irregularities is likely to add to investors\u2019 concerns over corporate governance at Japan\u2019s companies, after a long-running accounting scandal at             Toshiba Corp.       and last year\u2019s admission by             Mitsubishi Motors Corp.       that it falsified fuel-efficiency data for some of its cars.Fujifilm launched an independent investigation in April into the irregularities at its New Zealand Fuji Xerox unit, several months after the first media reports of problems at the company.The findings by the third-party panel released Monday showed that the losses in New Zealand were larger than first thought and that an Australian sales subsidiary had followed similarly inappropriate accounting practices.Too much leeway had been given to Fuji Xerox to follow different practices from its parent company because the unit had helped support Fujifilm\u2019s bottom line as the company tried to reinvent itself in response to the digital revolution, said       Kenji Sukeno,        Fujifilm\u2019s president and chief operating officer.\u201cWe showed too much respect for Fuji Xerox because it contributed to profits when Fujifilm was reforming itself after its film business peaked in 2000. We didn\u2019t nag at Fuji Xerox very much, and that is something we now regret,\u201d Mr. Sukeno said at a news conference after the release of the company\u2019s delayed earnings for the business year ended March 31.Fujifilm didn\u2019t apply internal rules for managing its subsidiaries to Fuji Xerox, the company said. Those rules covered areas such as business strategy, personnel changes and capital expenditure.The irregularities stem from leasing agreements the New Zealand and Australian units made with customers allowing them to pay monthly usage fees. In some instances there was no clear minimum usage requirement, leading to doubts about whether the fees would be sufficient for Fujifilm to recover costs, the company said.Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 06:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fujifilm-says-losses-from-accounting-scandal-bigger-than-first-thought-1497264004", "news_title": "Fujifilm Says Losses From Accounting Scandal Bigger Than First Thought ", "keywords": " corporate governance. japanese accounting scandals,fujifilm, fujifilm accounting scandal, fujifilm earnings,fujifilm losses, fujifilm results, fuji xerox, japanese accounting scandal, olympus, toshiba,FujiFilm Holdings,4901.TO,Fuji Xerox,Mitsubishi Motors,7211.TO,JP:7211,Toshiba,6502.TO,Kenji Sukeno,financial performance,earnings,earnings surprises,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,electronic office equipment,computers,consumer electronics,computer printers,scanners,accounting,consulting,business,consumer services,consumer goods,computing,computer peripherals,computer hardware,office equipment,supplies,technology"}, {"content": "Sign up:With one click,get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.Qatar diverted two U.K.-bound LNG tankers from Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal last week, highlighting the potential for disruption of vital energy arteries due to a widening rift between the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas and its neighbors. Conflicting restrictions on Qatari oil and gas shipments have sown confusion among Middle East energy traders and goosed British natural gas prices, which jumped 4% Thursday, WSJ\u2019s Costas Paris, Summer Said and Sarah McFarlane write.

QCOM 0.87%, this time over concerns that its bid to acquire the world\u2019s largest developer of chips for automobiles could hurt semiconductor industry competition. Qualcomm agreed to buy Netherlands-based             NXP Semiconductors                   NV for $39 billion in October, an acquisition that would make it one of the top suppliers of chips used in cars. Now it faces an in-depth probe by the EU\u2019s antitrust regulator, which says the deal could allow the company to exclude rival suppliers or remove competition in the booming market for chips in the automotive sector, WSJ\u2019s Natalia Drozdiak reports. The deal comes as manufacturers are building cars with greater computer power and as self-driving models are in the development pipeline. Qualcomm is the largest supplier of chips for mobile devices and is already being investigated in Europe for alleged breaches of antitrust rules in other areas. Qualcomm still expects the NXP deal, which has won U.S. antitrust approval, to close by the end of the year.Europe\u2019s largest retailer,             Carrefour SA,       is tapping a chief executive with a strong digital track record as it seeks to close its e-commerce gap. The brick-and-mortar behemoth, which has struggled to compete with online retailers and smaller shops, named Alexandre Bompard of the books, music and electronics retailer Fnac Darty as its next leader, WSJ\u2019s Nick Kostov writes. Mr. Bompard is credited with turning around the former Groupe Fnanc SA\u2019s online operations, retooling its website and mobile app, matching prices of competitors like             Amazon.com Inc.       and using data mining to target customers. Last year he won a bidding war for white-goods retailer Darty to build scale and better compete with large e-commerce companies. Mr. Bompard also persuaded vendors like             Samsung                   and Apple Inc. to set up branded shop areas in stores. At Carrefour, his challenges include a store format known as the hypermarket--sprawling warehouses that sell everything from baguettes to bicycles--that has lost market share as consumers move online.A corruption scandal engulfing the world\u2019s largest meatpacker Is triggering a backlash from business partners, including some whose codes of conduct extend to their suppliers.

It lifted the wraps on that machine on Sunday, ahead of the game industry\u2019s annual E3 conference.The new console, called the Xbox One X, is designed to render games in super-high-resolution, 4K graphics. It goes on sale in November with a starting price tag of $499.This represents Microsoft\u2019s attempt at a mid-generation console update.             Sony        SNE 0.47%       took a crack at it in November with the launch of the PlayStation 4 Pro. Both consoles are designed for the same games as their lower-priced siblings, but with more robust graphics.Sony says its Pro has accounted for about 20% of total PlayStation 4 unit sales since the launch, which suggests at least 2.5 million PlayStation users have chosen to pay for sharper resolution.That isn\u2019t a huge number, although Microsoft will find it a challenge to match: the Xbox One X is priced $100 higher than the PlayStation 4 Pro. It is also double the recently reduced price of the mainstream Xbox One S. That means Microsoft is charging a much higher premium than Sony, which has priced its Pro console at only 33% above the regular PlayStation 4.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team.

The Xbox One is estimated to have sold around half the 60 million units that PlayStation 4 has since both consoles hit the market in late 2013.The Xbox One X won\u2019t change the console game for Microsoft. But a high-end machine that appeals to a small number of enthusiasts may be helpful for the company\u2019s wider gaming business. Microsoft generates much higher returns through software and services such as the popular Xbox Live, which hosts 52 million active users paying a monthly fee.

For an over-indebted, monstrously large Chinese property developer, it appears to be a sacrifice worth making.China Evergrande, the country\u2019s biggest developer by assets, sold its 14% stake in rival China Vanke to Shenzhen Metro Group on Friday at a discount to market price.The sale likely signals an end to the 18-month takeover saga at Vanke in which an obscure insurer called Baoneng makes an unsolicited effort to take control of the developer. Shenzhen Metro, a subway operator controlled by the municipal government, will become Vanke\u2019s largest shareholder with a 29.4% stake after the purchase. Founded by the Shenzhen government more than three decades ago, Vanke is one of the best-managed developers in China and the local government is eager to not let it fall into control of Baoneng, which has ballooned in assets in recent years by aggressively leveraging up.For Evergrande, it looks like a rash gamble gone wrong\u2014it lost $1 billion, or 19%, in less than one year. It has never explained why it inserted itself in the Baoneng saga, buying and selling the Vanke stake, apart from the vague reason of a \u201cstrategic development requirement.\u201dYet there could be deeper political calculus. Evergrande is seeking to list most of its assets on the Shenzhen stock exchange through a backdoor listing with Shenzhen SEZ Real Estate & Properties, a company ultimately controlled by the Shenzhen government. The move is seen as a way for the heavily indebted developer\u2014its net debt to equity ratio is 432%\u2014to find easier access to financing.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team.

SBGI 1.35%The national Fox feed is only live on Hulu, which is partly owned by             21st Century Fox,        FOX 0.96%       but people close to Fox said the network intends to launch it on other streaming outlets offering lineups of channels similar to cable TV offerings, such as             AT&T\u2019s       DirecTV Now and             Sony Corp.\u2019s       PlayStation Vue.Wall Street Journal parent             News Corp                   and 21st Century Fox share common ownership.In the place of local news and daytime programming, Fox has plugged into the stream some programming from sister cable channels like National Geographic, Fox Business Network and Fox News, as well as library programming from 21st Century Fox Television studio.Among the shows from National Geographic that are filling in the gaps: \u201cDiggers,\u201d about people digging for old American artifacts, and \u201cBuilding Wild,\u201d in which the show\u2019s hosts help people build wilderness getaways.The move has raised the ire of some of Fox\u2019s station affiliates. They say Fox has been offering terms far inferior to what rivals NBC, ABC and CBS are offering station owners for participation in streaming services.At issue is how the two sides will divvy up their share of the monthly subscriber fees consumers pay for streaming services like Hulu\u2019s. In at least some cases, Fox is offering station owners business terms that are 50% below that of other networks, people familiar with the matter said.\u201cFox has elected not to make the same efforts in the same way the other three networks have,\u201d one local station executive said. \u201cYou\u2019re not providing something of value that reflects what the affiliate brings to the party.\u201dFox executives are optimistic they will hammer out deals with affiliates. But in the interim, they want new streaming customers in every market to be able to watch live Fox programming.Nexstar Broadcasting Group\u2019s       chief operating officer,       Brian Jones,        who chairs the board of Fox-affiliated stations, said Nexstar is completing a deal with Fox for new streaming services.Mr. Jones said Fox negotiated the right to offer such a feed as it struck its last round of agreements with affiliates, so the move isn\u2019t entirely a surprise.For the broadcast stations, ensuring they get their share of streaming TV fees is hugely important as traditional pay-television subscriptions decline.Companies like Sony PlayStation Vue have found it slow going to strike deals with the hundreds of local affiliates of the major broadcast networks across the country. Even             Apple Inc.,       which has long toyed with getting into the TV business, struggled with how to overcome the hurdle of signing up broadcasters across the country efficiently.While NBC, CBS and ABC negotiated with the boards that represent multiple affiliate groups, Fox opted to hammer out individual deals as local station owners\u2019 agreements with the network come up for renewal, in a move that station owners say gives Fox more leverage.Fox has come to terms with some station groups like Tribune Media, which owns 14 affiliate stations in such cities as Seattle, Denver and San Diego. In those markets, Tribune\u2019s Fox affiliates will stream their feeds on the Hulu live-TV service, with Fox\u2019s network programming included as usual. Tribune Media recently struck a deal to sell itself to Sinclair, which has yet to come to terms with Fox.Offering its own streaming feed holds risks for Fox. Some broadcast industry executives noted that consumers who think they may be streaming the feed of a local Fox station may be disappointed when their local news programming isn\u2019t available.Other executives say it isn\u2019t clear whether the network would have the rights to include NFL games on its streaming channel unless it has signed on the local affiliate.

Now, the former Calvin Klein salesman is teaching\u00a0mortgage\u00a0brokers how to make\u00a0subprime\u00a0loans.Mr. Boyd, a 25-year-old account executive at\u00a0FundLoans\u00a0in a beach town outside of San Diego, is at the cusp of efforts to bring back an army of salespeople who once powered the\u00a0mortgage\u00a0industry and, some say, contributed to the housing crisis.Mortgage\u00a0brokers, who serve as middlemen between lenders and borrowers, used to be a key part of the home-loan process. But some brokers faked loan applications and steered people into debt they couldn\u2019t afford.Financial regulation has severely diminished their ranks since the housing meltdown. And big banks with national sales teams say they won\u2019t use brokers anymore because they are third-party contractors, making it harder to police loan quality.Now, small and midsize independent lenders want the brokers back. Nonbank lenders that typically cater to riskier borrowers say they need brokers to fan out across the country and arrange\u00a0mortgages\u00a0to people with lower credit scores, or who can\u2019t prove their income through a typical tax return.Brokers are a key part of a mortgage chain that starts with a borrower going to a broker for a loan. The broker surveys lenders for the best loan to fit the customer. The lender then funds the borrower\u2019s loan.While brokers before the crisis served banks and independent lenders, today they are working largely for nonbank lenders who make up a critical part of the mortgage market.In the first quarter, nonbank lenders accounted for about half the mortgages originated in the U.S., according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance.The subprime going has been tough, though. In the first quarter, nearly a decade after the start of the housing crisis, lenders originated just $6 billion in loans to borrowers with less than stellar credit scores or who are using alternative documentation to prove income, a category now known as \u201cnonprime,\u201d according to Inside Mortgage Finance.In all of 2016, they originated $22 billion in loans, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Back in 2005, at the peak for such loans, lenders made about $1 trillion of these mortgages.Meanwhile, the volume of loans produced by mortgage brokers dropped to $37 billion in this year\u2019s first quarter, down about 34% from the last three months of 2016. Loans from brokers peaked at around $1.1 trillion in 2003.Lenders say there is an untapped market among borrowers with good credit scores like self-employed workers who don\u2019t have proper income documentation, or for responsibly made loans to borrowers with credit problems that have had bankruptcies in the past or had to sell their home for less than it was worth.If they are successful in recruiting brokers, lenders believe the market potential for both types of loans could reach $200 billion annually.A big hurdle: finding the right kind of brokers and instructing them in the lost art of making a subprime loan. Some are returning to the industry for the first time since the crisis. Others like Mr. Boyd have never been in it.\u201cI knew a\u00a0mortgage\u00a0was a loan for a house,\u201d said Mr. Boyd, who was recruited by his boss,       Jon Maddux,        after selling him a Calvin Klein suit at a local outdoor mall. \u201cI came in just a blank slate.\u201dBefore he co-founded\u00a0Drop\u00a0Mortgage, the parent company of FundLoans,\u00a0in 2014, Mr. Maddux ran the website YouWalkAway.com\u00a0between 2008 and 2012. The site charged homeowners on the brink of foreclosure $995 to learn how to leave their debt behind.Mr. Maddux said his experience advising down-and-out homeowners is today helping him pitch them loan products. Drop Mortgage and FundLoans made about $200 million in\u00a0subprime\u00a0and alternative documentation loans in 2016, funding them by selling them to hedge funds and other Wall Street investors.\u201cI\u2019ve seen what caused these people to walk away and I don\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d he said.Subprime mortgages are typically made to borrowers with a credit score of around 660 or lower, at interest rates ranging from 6% to 10%.\u00a0Alternative documentation loans, or Alt-A loans, are made to borrowers with higher credit scores but who use bank statements or other less conventional ways to prove their income.Steve Arnold,        an account executive at Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions, one of the largest nonprime lenders, said he Is on the phone almost nonstop from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day except Sunday coaching brokers on how to make nonprime loans.Recently, Mr. Arnold said, a broker called with a client who had a credit score of 620 and had sold his prior house in a sale that didn\u2019t generate enough funds to cover the mortgage. But the person had stellar income and was paying his rent on time.The broker didn\u2019t know how to make a loan possible.\u201cA lot of (the brokers) are timid and scared and don\u2019t know where to start with the nonprime type loans,\u201d said Mr. Arnold, who is based in West Palm Beach, Fla.Mr. Arnold made subprime loans between 2003 and 2007 for lenders including Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., and laughs when asked about the difference between the precrisis lending period and today.\u201cBack then we saw a lot of fraud with wages and earnings and bank statements,\u201d he said. Today, every loan file \u201cis manually reviewed and underwritten by our company.\u201dMortgage\u00a0brokers have become so scarce that the industry\u2019s trade group last year launched a grant program\u00a0for the first time\u00a0to help loan salesmen get back into the business\u2014or enter it for the first time. The group, NAMB, the Association of Mortgage Professionals, has been overwhelmed with interest and has made 30 grants to brokers over the last six months, said       Rocke Andrews,        head of the program.There are other signs of progress. At the trade industry\u2019s annual conference at the Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas last September, several thousand brokers packed presentation rooms. Five years ago, the association said it was lucky to get 200 people.\u201cIt\u2019s been a hard battle\u201d against the stigma of subprime lending, said       Krista Donecker,        an account executive at Irving, Texas-based Caliber Home Loans Inc.Ms. Donecker sometimes uses a power-point presentation showing the difference between a precrisis subprime loan and a subprime loan today when she trains brokers.She said she would never forget the first time she gave the presentation a couple of years ago.

After losing more than 40% since late 2013, shares rose 2.2%.Charles Kantor       was less impressed with a different change. The portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group LLC, was concerned that the finance chief the company named the same day,       Keith Manbeck,        lacked experience, as the company is being targeted by activist investor Jana Partners LLC. Neuberger Berman owned a \u00a02.7% stake in the upscale grocery chain as of March 31, according to FactSet.\u201cHe has a very steep learning curve,\u201d said Mr. Kantor, who signed a letter last year calling for a new CFO with a background in real estate, cost-cutting and store economics.When activist investors call for changes at a company or on its board, their campaigns often start at the top, with the CEO in the crosshairs. Public activist pressure played a prominent role in ousting the chief executives of three S&P 500 companies this year: insurer American International Group Inc., railroad             CSX Corp.       and aerospace-parts maker             Arconic Inc.WIlbur Ross, John McCain and other speakers take the stage at WSJ\u2019s CFO Network annual meeting Monday and Tuesday. Follow live coverage at WSJ.com/CFO, and on Twitter #WSJCFO.But pressure is mounting on CFOs, too, as they are more often tasked with cutting waste, increasing efficiency and boosting margins.Mr. Kantor\u2019s concerns about Whole Foods speak to the vital function that CFOs have assumed. Mr. Manbeck previously served as senior vice president of digital finance, strategy management and business transformation at retailer             Kohl\u2019s Corp.      , according to Whole Foods.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue that they hired someone with the skill sets described in our letter,\u201d Mr. Kantor said.A Whole Foods spokeswoman didn\u2019t respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.The number of companies targeted publicly by either dedicated activists or those for whom it is a strategic focus rose 24.6% to 456 world-wide in 2016 from 366 from the previous year, according to Activist Insight.The kinds of opportunities activists exploit are changing, and some practitioners are recalibrating their tactics in ways that bolster the CFO\u2019s profile.After the 2008-09 financial crisis, U.S. companies built up cash on fears of more turmoil. That made them targets for activists who could score a bump in share price by pushing management to use cash for a dividend increase or share buyback.\u201cThose opportunities have largely vanished,\u201d said David Hunker, head of shareholder activism defense at             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co.\u201cThat\u2019s led activists to find other levers to improve performance.\u201dOperational changes are more arduous than buybacks for finance executives. In 2014, Starboard Value LP lobbied Darden Restaurants Inc. to cut back on free breadsticks and sell more wine at its Olive Garden chain, among other changes. The company had three CFOs in eight months. Starboard sold its stake last year after sharp price gains in Darden stock.\u201cIt\u2019s become more granular,\u201d said       Eleazer Klein,        a partner at the law firm of Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP. \u201cThey really get into the weeds on these things.\u201dStarboard Value didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The finance chief\u2019s role can require doing the activist\u2019s bidding\u2014or pushing back.\u201cThat takes a special person in the CFO position to stand up to an activist and say, \u2018That\u2019s not right,\u2019\u201d said             Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.       finance chief       Paul Herendeen.His experience dealing with pressure from activists dates back to the mid-2000s while CFO at Warner Chilcott PLC, he said. Mr. Herendeen was two months into a new CFO role at             Zoetis Inc.       in 2014 when he learned Pershing Square Capital Management LP had a stake of more than 8% in the animal-health company and was agitating for board seats and expense reductions.Mr. Herendeen helped lead a drive that included cutting Zoetis\u2019s head count by more than 20% over about 24 months, refocusing research and development, and reducing the variety of packages and dosages it sold. The efforts are expected to save $300 million in annual costs in 2017, according to a company spokesman.He joined Valeant last year, another Pershing Square holding at the time, and has quarterbacked a debt restructuring, cut spending and helped build a 200-person sales force focused on Xifaxan, a gastrointestinal drug. Valeant reached a deal on Thursday to sell its iNova Phamaceuticals unit for $930 million to a company jointly owned by affiliates of Pacific Equity Partners and Carlyle Group.\u201cThey play an important role in keeping management honest,\u201d Mr. Herendeen said of activists.Demand for activist-seasoned CFOs is rising. \u201cA lot of our more recent requests are that a candidate has had experience with an activist,\u201d said       Peter Crist,        chairman of Crist|Kolder Associates, an executive recruiter. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more CFOs say, \u2018You know, so-and-so at ValueAct really likes me,\u2019\u201d he added, referring to ValueAct Capital Management LP.\u2018That takes a special person in the CFO position to stand up to an activist and say, \u2018That\u2019s not right.\u2019CSX named Hunter Harrison as CEO in March, less than two months after Mantle Ridge LP led a campaign to remove       Michael Ward.       Arconic\u2019s Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld left after sending an unauthorized letter to activist Elliott Management Corp. AIG hired Brian Duperreault in May after       Peter Hancock       said he would resign.The finance chiefs at those companies remain. However CFO turnover is always a risk when there is a new boss. According to executive-recruitment firm             Korn/Ferry International,       22% of new CFOs are appointed within a CEO\u2019s first year on the job, and 41% of new CFOs are appointed within a CEO\u2019s first three years on the job.And any CFO engaged with an activist faces an additional job hazard. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to fire the CFO,\u201d said       John Coffee,        a professor at Columbia Law School.\u201cOne of the ways you show you\u2019re having an impact is to take one of several executives to the guillotine.\u201dWrite to Richard Teitelbaum at Richard.Teitelbaum@wsj.comAppeared in the June 13, 2017, print edition as 'Activists Turn Up Heat On Fresh Target: CFOs.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-activists-enter-the-kitchen-the-cfos-feel-the-heat-1497259802", "news_title": "When Activists Enter the Kitchen, the CFOs Feel the Heat", "keywords": " activist investors,cfos, darden, executive changes,finance chiefs, olive garden breadsticks, whole foods cfo,Neuberger Berman Group,Whole Foods Market,WFM,American International Group,AIG,Arconic,ARNC,Mantle Ridge,J.P.

The more important news will be what it says about shrinking its balance sheet, likely later this year.The Fed currently holds $2.5 trillion of U.S. Treasurys and $1.8 trillion of mortgage-backed securities, a legacy of multiple rounds of quantitative easing. It has been keeping these levels steady by continually reinvesting in new securities when its holdings mature. Analysts expect the Fed to outline further details of an emerging plan to gradually phase out these reinvestments, allowing the balance sheet to shrink at a controlled pace.This could give a boost to already rallying financial stocks, which perked up late last week after stagnating in recent months.The story of this tightening cycle so far is that short-term rates have risen but long-term yields have remained stubbornly low. This has still been a net positive for many banks, particularly large ones, because so many of their loans are linked to short-term benchmarks like Libor.But banks also want to earn more on their longer-duration assets, including mortgages, real-estate loans, and mortgage-backed securities. That is particularly true of regional lenders and, among the biggest banks,             Wells Fargo.Life insurance companies, which hold lots of long-dated assets to match against their future liabilities, are even more eager to see long-term rates rise.Finally, if the Fed is shrinking its assets, it will also have to shrink the liability side of its balance sheet, particularly the excess reserves that banks hold with the central bank, notes       Jim Vogel,        a fixed-income strategist at FTN Financial. This would free up banks to move more funds into higher-yielding assets.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team. Subscribe to the podcast.Of course, a sharp increase in long-term rates could hurt banks by curtailing demand for mortgages, or destabilizing the market for mortgage-backed securities. But the Fed seems determined to avoid this through a gradual tapering of repurchases.Even as the Fed has talked up its plans for shrinking the balance sheet, long-term rates have drifted lower so far this year, and bank stocks have underperformed following a strong rally in late 2016. This suggests that fading optimism on growth and inflation have overwhelmed any investor preparations for the possibility of higher rates.Nonetheless, removing a huge sovereign buyer from the market surely means that long-term rates will be higher than they otherwise would be. Financial stocks, already the biggest winners from Fed tightening, should get another boost.Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-12 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-crucial-fed-meeting-for-financials-1497259800", "news_title": "A Crucial Fed Meeting for Financials ", "keywords": "fed balance sheet,Federal Reserve,commodity,financial market news,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Unemployment dropped last month to its lowest level since 2001, yet wage growth is below levels seen in the late stages of previous economic expansions and underemployment remains above the lows of the previous cycles.

The board was to discuss Mr. Michael\u2019s future at Uber at its Sunday meeting, said people familiar with the matter.Mr. Michael\u2019s exit could complicate a proposal that Mr. Kalanick, who has recently faced personal trauma in addition to a string of scandals at Uber, step aside for a period of time.The board on Sunday took no action on Mr. Kalanick\u2019s suggestion for a temporary absence, instead leaving it to him to decide, according to a person familiar with the discussions. It isn\u2019t clear whether Mr. Kalanick will ultimately take the time off. Either way, the removal of Mr. Michael would accentuate leadership turmoil that is extraordinary for a company of Uber\u2019s size and value.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a long road ahead for them to fix all this,\u201d said Michael Barnett, a Rutgers Business School professor, adding that Uber\u2019s long list of challenges had little precedent in the business world. \u201cThere\u2019s a cultural problem there and that\u2019s very difficult to overcome.\u201dMr. Michael hadn\u2019t offered his resignation as of Sunday evening, according to a person familiar with the matter.Uber\u2019s board on Sunday unanimously voted to adopt all recommendations proposed by Mr. Holder and his firm, Covington & Burling LLP, according to a spokesman for the board. The recommendations, which will be released to employees on Tuesday, were expected to include new human resources processes, training and to address the future of key executives, including Mr. Michael, according to people familiar with the matter.Uber declined to comment and Messrs. Kalanick and Michael didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Valued by investors at $68 billion, Uber has been a tech darling with the ability to raise funds seemingly at will and to barrel into new markets, despite sometimes violent opposition. Its promise of summoning a ride in minutes upended the staid taxi industry and software engineers once flocked to the company, drawn by the promise of a huge payday once the company seeks an IPO.But a series of scandals threatens to put a crimp in Uber\u2019s most ambitious goals, including its eventual IPO and plans to roll out a fleet of self-driving vehicles to eventually replace its 1.5 million contract drivers.Uber is scrambling to repair its reputation, tattered by allegations from a former software engineer, Susan Fowler Rigetti, who described in a February blog post a workplace permissive of sexual harassment and sexism.Mr. Kalanick condemned the behavior, which he said he was unaware of, and immediately called for a probe of Uber\u2019s practices, hiring Mr. Holder\u2019s firm and Perkins Coie LLP to investigate the specifics of Ms. Fowler Rigetti\u2019s claims, among others.Until this year\u2019s crises, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s reputation for sharp elbows, a relentless work ethic and a willingness to push the limits of legality to achieve success was celebrated. Chief of the ride-hailing firm since 2010, Mr. Kalanick has been the face of Uber amid its ascent to the world\u2019s most valuable private company.Mr. Kalanick is protected in his position because of his share-based voting power\u2014which, along with co-founder Garrett Camp and early employee       Ryan Graves,        gives him a large majority.But Mr. Kalanick is also facing a personal crisis that could lead to a leave of absence. His mother died late last month in a boating accident that also left his father seriously injured. He has been spending time with his father in the Los Angeles area. \u200bMr. Camp would be a logical choice to fill the CEO role temporarily if Mr. Kalanick decides to temporarily leave, observers say. Mr. Camp had been a CEO in the early days of the eight-year-old company.Mr. Kalanick\u2019s closest associate has been Mr. Michael, 44 years old, who was well regarded by many internally for brokering financing deals. As chief business officer, Mr. Michael helped oversee broad strategy initiatives including mergers and acquisitions and fundraising. He joined Uber in 2013 from Klout Inc., which rates users\u2019 online reputation, and had worked as an adviser to technology companies.Mr. Michael stirred up a storm of controversy around Uber after allegedly suggesting in November 2014 to a BuzzFeed editor at a party that the company should spend millions of dollars to investigate journalists who were critical. His comments were condemned by Mr. Kalanick at the time who called them \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201ca departure from our values and ideals.\u201d Mr. Michael said at the time that his comments were \u201cwrong\u201d and don\u2019t represent his views.Mr. Michael also was aware the company\u2019s head of Asian operations, Eric Alexander, had obtained the medical records of a rape victim in an Uber car in India while pursuing a theory that local competitor Ola had pushed the story to damage Uber\u2019s reputation, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Alexander was fired this week after reporter inquiries. Mr. Alexander didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The potential sidelining of Mr. Kalanick could hurt Uber\u2019s effort to recruit a chief operating officer, who would be working closely with Mr. Kalanick. Uber is also trying to hire a chief financial officer, a key position as it struggles with hefty losses. It logged at least $2.8 billion in losses last year and in this year\u2019s first quarter, a $708 million loss, amid an 18% sales gain. It had more than $7 billion in cash on hand as of the end of March.Uber\u2019s board is participating in the recruitment of a chief operating officer. The seven-member board includes Mr. Camp, who is chairman; Mr. Graves; private equity billionaire       David Bonderman      ; media mogul       Arianna Huffington      ; venture capitalist       Bill Gurley       of Benchmark; an official from a Saudi Arabian government investment fund; and Mr. Kalanick himself.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Uber Faces Deeper Turmoil At Top.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 02:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-chief-business-officer-emil-michael-to-resignmonday-1497197701", "news_title": "Uber Faces Deeper Turmoil at Top as CEO Travis Kalanick Weighs Leave of Absence", "keywords": "ceo,emil,executive,kalanick,probe,resign,sexual harrassment,uber,vc people,Uber Technologies,Covington & Burling,Perkins Coie,Alphabet Cl A,GOOGL,Klout,Michael Barnett,Travis Kalanick,Eric Holder,Anthony Levandowski,Eric Alexander,Emil Michael,Susan Fowler Rigetti,plans,strategy,corporate crime,legal action,management,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,crime,burglary,theft,retail,wholesale,etailing,legal services,internet search engines,business,consumer services,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia\u2014South Korea\u2019s Lotte Group plans to offer shares in its petrochemical unit in Malaysia at between 7.80 ringgit and 8 ringgit ($1.83 and $1.88), two sources with direct knowledge of the initial public offering told The Wall Street Journal.At the high end, the 740.4 million shares in             Lotte Chemical        011170 1.40%       Titan being sold would be worth about 5.92 billion ringgit ($1.39 billion), making the IPO Malaysia\u2019s largest since pay-TV operator             Astro Malaysia Holdings                   Bhd. raised $1.5 billion in 2012.The bookbuilding will start Friday, according to the people.Four cornerstone investors have agreed to take up to 20% of the IPO, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

It is harshly critical of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and recommends that the bureau be stripped of its authority to examine financial institutions, people familiar with the matter said. By law, the bureau has the authority to enforce consumer laws as well as to examine individual firms on a continuing basis.One person familiar with the report\u2019s contents said it is likely to recommend that the CFPB continue to be led by a single director, but that the president be able to remove the director at will. Currently, the president\u2019s authority to do that is the subject of a continuing legal battle.The report also contains a substantial section on the Volcker rule, which bans banks from most trading or speculating unless they are doing so on customers\u2019 behalf.And it will likely recommend that small banks\u2014those with less than $10 billion in assets\u2014be exempt from it, these people said. It isn\u2019t expected to recommend repealing the Volcker rule, they said, a change that was included in House Republicans\u2019 bill.Changes to the CFPB\u2019s authority or structure, or the applicability of the Volcker rule, would require congressional action.The report also explores bank-rule changes that regulators could pursue on their own, once Mr. Trump\u2019s team completes the slow-moving process of appointing new regulators. Regulators are already reviewing the Volcker rule, for instance, and people familiar with the matter said the report examines how the current enforcement regime for the rule is affecting financial markets.The report is expected to set in motion a re-evaluation of the Community Reinvestment Act, a law intended to make sure banks meet local credit needs, people familiar with the matter said. It will also likely suggest that big banks be asked to file \u201cliving wills\u201d every two years, instead of annually, these people said. The wills outline how banks could go through bankruptcy without needing a taxpayer bailout.The report also is likely to examine bank regulators\u2019 position on so-called leveraged loans, a form of risky lending to already-indebted companies, one of the people said.It will likely raise broad concerns about the use of arbitrary asset-size thresholds to apply bank regulations, such as the 2010 Dodd-Frank law\u2019s provisions requiring tougher supervision of banks with more than $50 billion in assets, this person said.Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Trump to Urge Finance Curbs.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 00:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-to-call-for-curbs-on-consumer-finance-regulator-1497242487", "news_title": "Trump Administration to Call for Curbs on Consumer-Finance Regulator", "keywords": " banking rules, banks, cfpb, consumer finance, consumer financial protection bureau,trump, volcker rule,Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,corporate,industrial news,securities regulations,economic performance,indicators,consumer credit,expenditure,savings,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Sessions will testify Tuesday before the same Senate panel that heard from Comey last week, keeping attention on the Russia probe.Macron\u2019s centrist party won the first round of French parliamentary elections, positioning him to wield an overwhelming majority.The U.K. faces the prospect of prolonged political uncertainty amid doubts on May\u2019s ability to stay in office or govern effectively.Puerto Rican voters endorsed statehood, but low turnout suggested a split on the best path out of the territory\u2019s economic crisis.Medicare erroneously paid out an estimated $729 million under an initiative designed to shift health-care records to computer files.Iran has sent hundreds of tons of food to Qatar amid a break between U.S. allies in the Middle East.Mixed messages and a lack of details have led to confusion over when Congress needs to lift the debt ceiling.An Afghan commando killed three American soldiers and wounded one in eastern Afghanistan.U.S. special forces are supporting Philippine troops battling a militant group connected to Islamic State.The Pittsburgh Penguins beat the Nashville Predators 2-0 to win hockey\u2019s Stanley Cup in six games.\u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d took the Tony for best musical. \u201cOslo\u201d won for best play.Appeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-12 00:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-world-wide-1497240750", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: World-Wide", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,page-one stories,news digests"}, {"content": "Medicare erroneously paid an estimated $729 million to doctors and other health professionals under a multibillion-dollar federal initiative designed to shift the health-care system from paper records to computer files, according to a new federal audit.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, which conducted the audit, said Medicare, over a three-year period, improperly paid health professionals who vouched they earned bonus payments under the initiative, but who either lacked required proof or failed to meet bonus criteria.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees Medicare, should review its incentive payments and recoup any money erroneously paid and do more to scrutinize spending under the incentive program, OIG auditors said in a report of its audit. The program was created by 2009 legislation to accelerate use of electronic health records.CMS \u201cconducted minimal documentation reviews,\u201d the report said, \u201cleaving the EHR program vulnerable to abuse and misuse of federal funds.\u201dThe audit estimated improper payments totaled 12% of the approximately $6.1 billion Medicare paid out as electronic health-record incentives to professionals during the three years reviewed by auditors.Auditors based the estimate on a review of 100 health professionals who vouched they earned bonuses between May 2011 and June 2014. To do so, health professionals must meet several criteria, such as using computers to order prescriptions and transfer health data electronically. Rules also require professionals to monitor cybersecurity.Auditors said they found, in that sample of 100, 14 health professionals who reported incorrect information or who couldn\u2019t produce required documents or other proof they met bonus criteria, including six without evidence of cybersecurity efforts. The 14 professionals were paid $291,222 in that three-year period.In a February letter responding to the OIG findings, then-acting CMS Administrator       Patrick Conway       touted the rapid use of electronic health records under the initiative and said Medicare would recoup improper payments to professionals included in the sample audited by the OIG.Dr. Conway said CMS also launched targeted audits \u201cto strengthen the program integrity,\u201d which continue this year.The OIG report, however, said it didn\u2019t believe the targeted audits would be enough.\u201cThis administration is committed to turning the page and ushering in a new era of accountability,\u201d CMS officials said in a statement responding to the audit. \u201cProviding high-quality care to Medicare beneficiaries while being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars remains a top CMS priority, and we recognize the value data validation and auditing bring to our programs.\u201dThe audit also found Medicare overpaid health-care professionals by $2.3 million during the same period as some professionals moved between incentive programs run by Medicare and Medicaid. Health-care workers are allowed to earn such electronic-health-record incentives from either Medicare or Medicaid, but not from both. The OIG found some who switched incorrectly received higher payments than they would have otherwise.Write to Melanie Evans at Melanie.Evans@wsj.comAppeared in the June 12, 2017, print edition as 'Audit Finds Errors In Medicare Payouts.'", "news_time": "2017-06-12 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/medicare-erroneously-paid-millions-in-electronic-records-push-audit-finds-1497240060", "news_title": "Medicare Erroneously Paid Millions in Electronic Records Push, Audit Finds   ", "keywords": "cdc,ehr,electronic health records,error,incentive payments,medicare,mistake,reimburse,u.s. department of health and human services,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance"}]
