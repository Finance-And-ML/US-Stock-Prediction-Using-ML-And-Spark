The male lions escaped from the Kruger National Park, a main tourist attraction, on Sunday night and were last spotted at Matsulu village, South African National Parks said in a statement. The area around Kruger contains villages and farms which raise cattle, putting livestock as well as people at risk of attack. In May, the agency captured five lions that broke free from the same park. In 2015, a lion named Sylvester crawled under an electric fence at another park and went on a three-week, sheep-killing spree before he was caught by rangers while taking a nap.

Venus Williams and home favorite Johanna Konta were the only two leading women to have their matches on Centre Court or Court One on  Manic Monday , when all 16 fourth-round matches are played. Andy Murray, Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic all got top billing. Some of the women players  demoted  to the lesser courts were less than impressed about their treatment.   I was really surprised that I was playing on Court Two,  said world number one and top seed Angelique Kerber after she lost to Spanish 14th seed Garbine Muguruza.  I think it was a good match on a high level, I was actually looking forward to playing on one of the two big courts. Maybe I will talk to them.  Newly-crowned French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko said:  I think I deserve to play on a better court than Court 12.  (Opponent) Elina (Svitolina) is number four in the world. I think our match was a very interesting one for the people to watch.  After winning her match on Court Three, twice grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova added:  I have not played on Court One or Centre Court the whole tournament, though I understand why Johanna Konta is there, it's England and they have to put their product there.  Former champion Chris Evert also weighed in.  It’s equal prize money so why not equal representation on Centre Court and Court number One?,  she said.  I would like to see it three and three, and I think any woman would like to see it that way.  Fantastic Era Asked about the scheduling, Wimbledon chief executive Richard Lewis said:  You've got this fantastic era for men's tennis. There have been years where the women have outshone the men but at the moment it's very hard to argue beyond the big four - Djokovic, Murray, Nadal and Federer - being on Centre Court and Court One.  I absolutely respect Angelique Kerber is number one in the world, Muguruza is a former finalist, grand slam winner but we are spoilt for choice. There are matches on two and three today that would grace Centre Court on any other day.  I wouldn't say it's favoritism. I'd just say it's taking the marquee matches. In the end it's not about male/female, it's about which matches you think are the ones the public and the broadcasters would like to see. It's about who are the star players at the time.  Not all women players were upset by the scheduling either and Magdalena Rybarikova risked a frosty locker-room reception.  To be honest, I enjoy watching more men's tennis,  she said.  I think also for the spectators it's more enjoyable to watch - because it's huge names like Federer and Murray and I think they deserve to be on Centre Court,  the Slovakian said after winning her fourth-round match on Court 18.  Sometimes girls win 6-1 6-2 and I don't know if it is for spectators, but sometimes it's boring.

There were no irregularities at the nearby Sendai nuclear plant, where two reactors are in operation, Kyushu Electric Power Co said.

Trump,Ed Murray,Jason Mercier,US,SEATTLE,TAX,Crime / Law / Justice,Lawmaking,Society / Social Issues,Taxation,Government / Politics,Corporate Events,Economic Events,General News,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,US Government News,Washington,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle's city council unanimously passed a pioneering income tax on the city's highest earners on Monday, a measure that has become a clarion call for Democrats there even though it is likely to face a swift legal challenge over violating state law. The measure created a 2.25 percent tax rate on individuals earning above $250,000 and married couples jointly earning above $500,000. The tax will add roughly $140 million in new annual revenue and affect fewer than 20,000 residents in the city of more than 660,000, supporters say. The proposal has become a rallying cry for Democrats and activists in the liberal-leaning city who used local opposition to Republican President Donald Trump to advance long sought-after local policies. Washington is one of seven U.S. states without a tax on personal income, and no city in the state has an income tax. Supporters of the Seattle proposal, including Mayor Ed Murray, say the current tax code unfairly burdens poor and middle class residents because it relies on  regressive  taxes, such as taxes on property and sales transactions. Proponents say new revenue is needed to offset any potential drop in federal funding under the Trump administration.  Our goal is to replace our regressive tax system with a new formula for fairness, while ensuring Seattle stands up to President Trump's austere budget that cuts transportation, affordable housing, healthcare, and social services,  Murray said by e-mail after the city council's 9-0 vote. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray speaks with attendees of the March For Science in Seattle, Washington, U.S. April 22, 2017.David RyderEarlier on Monday, Murray told a cheering crowd at a rally outside city hall he would sign the measure into law on Friday and welcomed a legal challenge. The campaign for the new tax on Seattle's richest was launched earlier this year by Trump Proof Seattle, a coalition of community activists and residents. Proceeds from the tax could be used to pay for transit services and affordable housing, Murray said. The city has been grappling with soaring housing prices in recent years, fueled in part by the growth of online retailer Amazon.com, which is headquartered in downtown Seattle. Voters in Olympia, the state capital, rejected a similar tax on its highest earners last year. In 2010, Washington state voters rejected a state income tax at the ballot box. Jason Mercier, a director at the conservative Washington Policy Center, said Seattle's tax conflicts with state law and court decisions. He said he expects the city to face a swift legal challenge after Murray signs the measure into law.  There's something fundamentally wrong with elected officials passing a tax they know is against state law and the constitution with the hope of being sued and having a judge overturn prior decisions,  Mercier said.  State law blocks a county or city from levying a tax on  net  income, although net income is not defined in the statute. The Washington state Supreme Court has found that income is treated as property under the constitution and therefore has to be taxed uniformly and at no more than 1 percent of its value, Mercier said.

However, high private-sector debt remains a risk to financial system stability and bank performance across much of the region, particularly with US interest rates likely to continue to rise over the next few years. A synchronised improvement in advanced and emerging economies is driving a stronger recovery in global GDP growth and trade volumes. The pick-up in trade has been particularly robust in APAC, led by the policy-driven rise in Chinese demand. Commodity prices have recovered since early 2016, reducing strains in resource-linked sectors, while currencies and asset prices have held up well amid US rate hikes. These trends have helped support bank performance across most of the region. Asset quality, for example, has remained healthier than we had expected. Fitch's sector outlook is still negative for 10 of APAC's 17 rated banking systems, but that is down from 13 at the start of the year. We have removed the negative sector outlooks on Hong Kong and Macau - two economies with particularly close links to China. Our sector outlook on Japan has also been moved to stable from negative, which mirrors a similar change in the sovereign rating. Nevertheless, the build-up in private-sector debt and the rise in property prices over the last decade of ultra-loose global monetary policy have created financial risks that could still be tested by US rate hikes. Thailand, Malaysia, Korea and Singapore stand out as economies where household debt has risen strongly, while corporate debt has soared in Hong Kong and China. Several factors mitigate the risk of an outright financial crisis in China, but a sharp slowdown in its economy is one of the key potential risks facing other APAC banking systems. New and evolving regulations could add to pressures on banks, but will ultimately strengthen financial systems. The main changes will be the agreed phase-in of higher capital requirements and - in Japan's case - higher total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements. Fitch expects APAC banks to issue new loss-absorbing capital and debt instruments totalling USD200 billion by end-2018 to meet the requirements. Banks in China, Japan and India will account for most of this issuance. A focus on risk-weight calculations and robustness of models will also keep banks in the more developed markets busy over the next few years. More jurisdictions are likely to implement bail-in legislation, but support is unlikely to disappear in most markets as the authorities remain reluctant to impose losses on senior creditors. Most APAC banking systems are well-positioned to cope with pressures, but the potential for rating changes stemming from asset-quality issues is highest in India and China. In India, where problems are concentrated among state banks, the government appears to be willing to provide capital to stronger banks to support growth, while providing weak banks with only the capital needed to meet minimum requirements - in order to encourage them to downsize and/or consolidate. In China, risks are highest at second- and third-tier banks, which have weaker capital, larger exposure to shadow banking and higher reliance on short-term wholesale funding than the much stronger state banks.

David Krakoff, a lawyer at Buckley Sandler who has been representing Okada, Universal and its subsidiary, asked permission from a Nevada judge at a hearing to drop Okada as a client, while continuing to represent Universal. Clark County District Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez granted the request. Krakoff cited Universal's accusations that Okada, 74, misused some $20 million corporate funds while he was Universal's chairman. Krakoff told the court he would fly to Japan to meet with Universal officials and try to resolve representation. “I cannot tell you what their position might be, but I will say this to the court: we do not bring this motion to delay or disrupt these litigations,” Krakoff told the court. “I think we have a solution that will address any potential questions or issues.” Universal declined to comment on the details of an ongoing lawsuit. Krakoff declined to elaborate for Reuters beyond what he said in court. Reuters was unable to determine if Krakoff would remain as lawyer for the Universal subsidiary, Aruze USA, Inc. Universal did not respond to questions about its representation in the lawsuit. Robert Ziems, president of Aruze USA, did not reply to an email seeking comment. Okada could not be reached for comment. The legal battle between Okada and Wynn Resorts Chief Executive Steve Wynn stems from a prior business relationship between them that soured when Wynn Resorts dismissed Okada from its board in 2012, claiming in a lawsuit that Okada had breached his duties as director by spending over $100,000 to wine and dine and provide gifts to Philippine gaming officials.  Apart from the lawsuits, Okada and his companies have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a $40 million payment to a Manila-based consultant in 2010. The FBI's probe is focused on whether the payment was aimed at helping Universal gain tax and ownership concessions for the casino from the Philippine government, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Universal and Okada have denied any wrongdoing and filed a defamation lawsuit against Reuters in 2012 for its reporting on the payments. The Tokyo District Court ruled in 2015 that Universal's case was without merit. Last year the Tokyo High Court upheld that ruling, dismissing Universal's appeal. Universal has appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan.

Horn took the Filipino great's welterweight world title after judges scored the bout 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 in the 29-year-old's favor but many observers questioned the outcome, saying the officials had made a  hometown decision . The WBO agreed to review the decision and on Tuesday released its results, which backed up Horn as the victor.  The Jeff Horn vs. Manny Pacquiao bout results were controversial, causing disputes amongst fans. For this reason, transparency is so important,  the WBO said in a statement.  Based on this, five anonymous, competent judges from different countries were asked to watch the bout without sound.  To determine the winner of each round, three out of the five officials have to be in agreement.  From the results, it can be established that Pacquiao won five rounds while Horn won seven rounds.  While there has been talk that 38-year-old Pacquiao may retire, a rematch was written into the contract for the initial fight and the pair are expected to face each other again later this year. Former schoolteacher Horn, who improved his record to 17-0-1 after the win over the eight-division world champion, said he felt vindicated after the WBO's statement.  It gives me evidence behind me that I can just use now,  he  told reporters at Brisbane Airport on Tuesday.  Instead of saying I think I won the fight, now a heap of other people - professionally - think I won the fight.  Horn will be attending the ESPY Awards in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

Gox pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges relating to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins and cash from what was once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, the Nikkei business daily reported. Mark Karpeles, a 32-year-old French national, filed the plea in response to charges of embezzlement and data manipulation at the Tokyo District Court, the Nikkei said. Prosecutors said Karpeles sent around 340 million yen ($3 million) from an account that managed customers' funds to an external account between September and December 2013, and increased the balance of the account via  improper operation  of Mt. Gox's trading system, the Nikkei reported. Karpeles' defence told the court he had remitted the firm's revenue, not customer funds, and that the increased balance was part of the administrative process of exchanging cash and bitcoins and therefore not illegal, according to the Nikkei. Mt. Gox once handled 80 percent of the world's bitcoin trades but filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing some 850,000 bitcoins - then worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash from its Japanese bank accounts. In its bankruptcy filing, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox blamed hackers for the lost bitcoins, pointing to a software security flaw. Mt. Gox subsequently said it had found 200,000 of the missing bitcoins. The collapse of Mt. Gox represented a major setback for bitcoin and badly damaged the image of virtual currencies, particularly among risk-averse Japanese investors and corporations. But the bankruptcy also prompted Japan's government to decide how to treat bitcoin, and preceded a push by local regulators to licence virtual currency exchanges. Japan this year became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level, part of a government effort to exploit financial technology as a means of stimulating the economy. Interest in bitcoin among Japan's legions of individual investors - encouraged by Tokyo's recognition of the virtual currency as legal tender - has spiked in recent months. Still, institutional investors remain wary, say those running virtual currency exchanges in Tokyo. Japanese firms are also unenthusiastic: Only 4 percent of large and mid-sized firms plan to use bitcoin, showed a Reuters poll last month. The value of bitcoin is highly volatile. It hit a record high of $2,980 last month.

David Krakoff, a lawyer at Buckley Sandler who has been representing Okada, Universal and its subsidiary, asked permission from a Nevada judge at a hearing to drop Okada as a client, while continuing to represent Universal. Clark County District Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez granted the request. Krakoff cited Universal's accusations that Okada, 74, misused some $20 million corporate funds while he was Universal's chairman. Krakoff told the court he would fly to Japan to meet with Universal officials and try to resolve representation. “I cannot tell you what their position might be, but I will say this to the court: we do not bring this motion to delay or disrupt these litigations,” Krakoff told the court. “I think we have a solution that will address any potential questions or issues.” Universal declined to comment on the details of an ongoing lawsuit. Krakoff declined to elaborate for Reuters beyond what he said in court. Reuters was unable to determine if Krakoff would remain as lawyer for the Universal subsidiary, Aruze USA, Inc. Universal did not respond to questions about its representation in the lawsuit. Robert Ziems, president of Aruze USA, did not reply to an email seeking comment. Okada could not be reached for comment. The legal battle between Okada and Wynn Resorts Chief Executive Steve Wynn stems from a prior business relationship between them that soured when Wynn Resorts dismissed Okada from its board in 2012, claiming in a lawsuit that Okada had breached his duties as director by spending over $100,000 to wine and dine and provide gifts to Philippine gaming officials.  Apart from the lawsuits, Okada and his companies have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a $40 million payment to a Manila-based consultant in 2010. The FBI's probe is focused on whether the payment was aimed at helping Universal gain tax and ownership concessions for the casino from the Philippine government, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Universal and Okada have denied any wrongdoing and filed a defamation lawsuit against Reuters in 2012 for its reporting on the payments. The Tokyo District Court ruled in 2015 that Universal's case was without merit. Last year the Tokyo High Court upheld that ruling, dismissing Universal's appeal. Universal has appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan.

The Nikkei rose 0.2 percent to 20,126.30 in mid-morning trade. Panasonic Corp and Hitachi Ltd both gained 0.6 percent after the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P; 500 technology index rose overnight on expectations for brisk earnings. Technology companies are expected to post some of the strongest earnings growth figures for the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Overall sentiment was positive, as the dollar comfortably stayed above 114 yen after climbing to a two-month high of 114.300 overnight as the Bank of Japan's offer last week to buy an unlimited amount of bonds drew investors' focus to the divergent monetary policy outlook between the BOJ and the U.S. Federal Reserve. The spread between 10-year Treasury and JGB yields is the widest it has been in two months, contributing to the dollar's strength against the yen. Market analysts said that investors are likely to continue to take heart from the weak yen for now, while strength in tech shares is expected to support the Nikkei benchmark index.  While Japanese exporters expect much lower dollar-yen assumptions, the current currency levels raise hopes for better Japan Inc earnings,  said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities. He also said that there is demand for growth shares and commodity-related stocks globally, and the Japanese market is following this trend, citing strong performance among resource giants like Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Freeport-McMoRan.  Strength in these stocks indicate a pick up in global demand, which helps appetite for Japanese stocks as well,  Kuramochi said. Meanwhile, ink jet printer and watch maker Seiko Epson Corp soared to 2-1/2-year highs after Nikkei Inc said it would add the company's stock to the benchmark Nikkei 225 average .N225, replacing scandal-hit Toshiba Corp, which fell 2.0 percent.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index, which rose on Monday, added 0.2 percent to 5,737.30 at 0230 GMT, helped by gains in basic materials and energy shares. Miners benefited from a sustained rally in iron ore prices, as the most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose for a third straight day. That sent shares of heavyweight miners BHP and Fortescue Metals Group up 1.2 percent and 3 percent respectively. Rio Tinto shares were up about 0.5 percent but gains were capped by a slump in base metal prices, with copper falling to its lowest since June 27 on Monday and aluminium seeing its biggest single-day drop in over two months. A slight rise in oil prices fuelled further share-price gains for stocks of Aussie oil and gas majors, with sector bellwether Woodside Petroleum  up about 0.6 percent and fuel supplier Caltex Australia nearly 1 percent higher. Aussie financials were among the top gainers for a second day with the 'Big Four' banks, seen as a barometer of the sector's health, climbing between 0.2 percent and 0.6 percent. Volumes across the board are expected to remain weak as investors watch for Yellen's monetary policy testimony on Wednesday and Thursday for clues on when the Fed will again tighten U.S. monetary policy.  Most people have positioned their portfolios ahead of this (Yellen's testimony) and very few people are prepared to react if she does really go into little more depth  about her own personal views on financial conditions,  said Chris Weston, an institutional dealer with IG Markets.  Her views at the moment are well known to the market and it shouldn't be too surprised by what she's saying now.  New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index was 0.4 percent, or 31.87 points, higher at 7,615.82 helped by consumer staples and telecom shares. Dairy products maker a2 Milk and telecom firm Spark New Zealand were among the biggest gainers on the benchmark, up 3.7 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. While gains were largely broad-based, the energy sector saw some weakness with fuel retailer Z Energy slipping.

The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. ORIX, established in 1964, is engaged in a wide range of businesses including leasing, banking, life insurance, asset management, principal investments, real estate, and environment and energy-related businesses. It also has an extensive domestic and global operation network. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating of the notes is aligned with the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of ORIX because they will constitute unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of ORIX, and rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The IDR reflects ORIX's modest leverage, adequate liquidity position and solid profitability record. The IDR also factors in ORIX's opportunistic acquisition and divestment strategy, which has the potential to alter its already-complex business structure. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating on the notes is primarily sensitive to any change to ORIX's IDR, which would be affected by material changes in the company's risk appetite, business complexity, capital and leverage policy or liquidity position. An upgrade of ORIX's IDR is unlikely in the medium term, given improvement in the operating environment is likely to only be moderate and the company's structural complexity and opportunistic investment strategy. Fitch does not expect a significant or sustained reduction in leverage or further strengthening of liquidity. A downgrade of ORIX's IDR would be considered if the company's risk appetite increased without a corresponding strengthening of capital buffers. Negative pressure on the IDR could also result from increased complexity in its business operation that would render risk control more challenging, and substantial deterioration in the company's liquidity position due to internal or external factors - such as large cash usages or rapid deterioration in the funding market.

He fled Honduras after armed assailants shot and killed Igor Padilla, the program's director and producer, in the violent city of San Pedro Sula in mid-January. Rivera Paz fled to Mexico after Padilla's death, fearing that he might also be killed, a Honduran journalist who asked not to be identified told Reuters. Julian Hernandez, a spokesman for the Honduran police, said:  We are seeking more information about this crime in Mexico to determine if it is related to the murder of Igor Padilla and to see if any criminal gangs from Honduras were involved.  Veracruz, where more journalists have been murdered than the rest of Mexico, is now the deadliest region for the media in the Western hemisphere, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in May.

The album, on which the Jay Z addresses cheating on his wife Beyonce and the birth of their twins, was released on June 30 as an exclusive to members of Tidal and customers of wireless carrier Sprint Corp, who were offered a free six-month subscription to Tidal to listen to the album.  The Billboard 200 album chart is based on retailers and streaming platforms reporting sales and streaming figures to Nielsen SoundScan. Tidal did not report first week streaming figures of  4:44  to Nielsen, David Bakula of Nielsen Music said.  Representatives for Tidal and Jay Z did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on the album's exclusion from this week's Billboard chart, but this is not the first time the streaming platform's exclusive releases have not charted on Billboard.  Kanye West's  Life of Pablo  did not enter the Billboard charts during its exclusive Tidal release in February 2016. It only debuted on the Billboard 200 chart, at No. 1, after West made it available widely in April last year on platforms including iTunes, Apple Music and Spotify.   FILE PHOTO: American rapper Jay-Z performs at Bercy stadium in Paris, October 17, 2013.Benoit Tessier/File PhotoJust six days after  4:44  was released, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album as platinum, meaning one million U.S. consumers had already downloaded the album. But instead of featuring Jay Z, DJ Khaled's  Grateful  topped the Billboard 200 chart for a second consecutive week on Monday with another 70,000 album units sold.   4:44  was made available to purchase and stream widely on July 7, which will count toward next week's Billboard chart. The album has been praised by critics for Jay Z's raw self-examination and socially conscious themes.   Jay Z announced a  4:44  tour on Monday and will play 31 shows across North America and Canada from October to December. New albums in the top 10 of this week's Billboard 200 album chart include electro-pop DJ Calvin Harris'  Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1  at No. 2 with 68,000 album units sold and rock group Stone Sour at No. 8 with  Hydrograd.

The United States said this week it was ready to use force if necessary to counter the threat from North Korea, which tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea often threatens to strike the neighboring South and Japan, vowing to turn Seoul into a 'sea of fire' and 'a pile of ashes' the moment it has an order from leader Kim Jong Un. South Korea has nearly 19,000 bomb shelters throughout the country. They include more than 3,200 in Seoul, just 40 km (25 miles) from the militarized border drawn up under a truce that stopped the 1950-53 Korean War but left the combatants technically at war.  Chung Yoon-jin, a university student in Seoul, had no clue  these shelters existed.  I have never seen any signs that say ‘shelter’, although I have been to lots of places in Seoul,  the 26-year-old Chung said. The shelters are not built to protect against nuclear, chemical or biological attacks. They are mostly in subway stations or basements and parking garages in private apartments and commercial buildings designated as shelters with the consent of the owners. For a graphic on the locations of the shelters, click tmsnrt.rs/2rW8uvn In Seoul, most bomb shelters have no long-term supplies of food, water, medical kits or gas masks, an official at Seoul Metropolitan Government told Reuters. They can't be forced to stock up because no public funding is provided, said the official who declined to be identified. In Tokyo, the Japanese capital of 13.5 million people has an unknown number of bomb shelters left from World War II, but they are not useable or accessible to the public, an official at Tokyo Metropolitan Government's disaster prevention department told Reuters. Tokyo has no plans to reuse the decades-old shelters or build new ones for now.  The extent of any damage that could be caused by a North Korean missile is still unknown, and it will take time to figure out an appropriate design for a shelter,  the official said. FILE PHOTO: A shelter is seen near the Tae Sung freedom village near the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), inside the demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas, in Paju, South Korea, November 22, 2016. Picture taken on November 22, 2016.Kim Hong-Ji     Oblivious to Missile Threat While residents in Alaska and Hawaii are just waking up to the possibility of living within range of a North Korean missile, South Koreans for years have been exposed to thousands of artillery massed an hour's drive or so from the border, in addition to short-range missiles and bombs. People have grown numb to Pyongyang's unprecedented pace of missile and nuclear tests since the beginning of last year. “Every time, nothing seems to happen after (North Korea provocation), so now I feel I’m used to it. I think to myself, nothing will happen,  said Suh Yeon-ju, a 30-year-old housewife. Unlike in Japan, where sales of private nuclear shelters and radiation-blocking air purifiers have risen in recent months, South Korea has no market for private bunkers. One public bomb shelter that Reuters visited in central Seoul was in a large underground parking garage a few steps from a government complex building. A small sign posted at the entrance indicated a shelter, but people inside had no clue. A person in charge of the parking garage said one day last year he came to the office and saw a  shelter  sign posted, but he had no idea what it was. To raise awareness, Seoul has handed out 34,000 paper fans this summer with information about bomb shelters, and is in the process of creating other promotional products such as flyers and stickers, the city government official said. But it's difficult to get the buildings hosting shelters to put easily seen directional signs, he said. Shin Ji-ha, a 24-year-old university student in Seoul, said she heard about bomb shelters but didn't know where they were. It didn't matter to her anyway.  I would be dead like in less than a second (if a war broke out),  she said.  There will be no pain at all so I don’t mind that much.

Speaking at the end of a G20 summit in Germany where the two leaders met face-to-face for the first time, Putin said he believed he had been able to establish a personal relationship with Trump, and that the initial groundwork had been laid for an improvement in U.S.-Russian ties. Their meeting, on the sidelines of the Hamburg summit, was subject to intense scrutiny, following allegations that Moscow had tried to help Trump win the White House, and a Washington investigation into the Russia ties of Trump associates. Putin was pressed by reporters at a news conference to share details of the discussion he had with Trump about alleged Russian election interference. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election.  (Trump) asked a lot of questions on this subject. I, in as much as I was able, answered these questions. It seems to me that he took these (answers) on board and agreed with them, but in actual fact, it's best to ask him how he views this,  Putin told one reporter. Pressed again later in the same news conference by reporters about what precisely Trump had told him, Putin said:  He started to ask pointed questions, he was really interested in particular details. I, as much as I could, answered him in a fairly detailed way. U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 7, 2017.Carlos Barria I believe it would not be entirely appropriate on my part to disclose details of my discussion with Mr Trump. He asked, I answered him. He asked pointed questions, I answered them. It seemed to me that he was satisfied with those answers,  Putin said. Putin also spoke warmly of Trump's personal qualities. The two men have spoken by telephone since Trump won the U.S. presidential election last year, but had not met until the G20 summit in Hamburg.  I believe that we have established personal relations already,  Putin told a news conference.  The TV Trump is very different from the person in reality. He is absolutely precise, he reacts as you would expect to his interlocutor, he analyses fairly quickly, answers questions that are put to him.  It seems to me that if we build our relations the way that our conversation went yesterday, then we all have grounds to believe that we can, at least in part, restore the level of cooperation that we need,  Putin said. He said in particular that the Trump administration was taking a more pragmatic stance on the conflict on Syria. A ceasefire deal for southern Syria that was announced during the summit was the result of that new approach, Putin said, and represented a  breakthrough.

The fixed-rate EUR500 million bond with a five-year maturity is the first issued under the conditional pass-through covered bond programme and is also the first conditional pass-through bond to be issued in the Asia-Pacific region. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on BOQ's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A-', a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of eight notches, a recovery uplift of two notches and the current contractual maximum asset percentage (AP) of 90.9%, which Fitch relies upon in its analysis. This AP provides more protection than Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP of 96.0%. This supports a 'AA' tested rating on a probability-of-default basis and two-notch recovery uplift, as it roughly absorbs the 4.2% stressed credit loss in a 'AAA' scenario. The Stable Outlook on the rating reflects the four-notch buffer against a downgrade of the bank's IDR. Breakeven AP The 'AAA' breakeven AP of 96.0% corresponds to a breakeven overcollateralisation (OC) of 4.2% and is driven by the credit loss component of 3.1%, which reflects the credit quality of the underlying cover pool. The asset disposal loss and cash flow valuation components are at 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. The low asset disposal loss reflects the pass-through amortisation, which avoids forced asset sales. IDR Uplift The IDR uplift assigned is at zero notches. Fitch understands that in Australia, the regulator has the ability to resolve a bank under its supervisory powers pursuant to the Banking Act. However, Fitch views that the bail-in of creditors or the exemption of covered bonds in a bank resolution scenario is not contemplated under the current framework. Therefore, BOQ's Long-Term IDR is the floor for its covered bond rating. PCU The eight-notch PCU assigned to BOQ's CPT mortgage covered bond programme by Fitch reflects the principal protection stemming from the 31.5-year maturity extension for covered bond payments and the availability of a reserve fund providing three months of interest payment protection. The CPT feature eliminates refinancing risk if the payment source switches to the cover pool. Recovery Uplift BOQ's covered bonds benefit from a two-notch recovery uplift, as Fitch sees the underlying assets as standard and the AP relied upon by Fitch in its analysis roughly compensates for the credit loss modelled in a 'AAA' stress scenario. Fitch also expects minimal exposure to foreign-exchange risk, as the currency swaps on the covered bonds should cover the pass-through period. Therefore, Fitch does not expect any material downside risk to recovery expectations. A failure by the issuer to meet principal payments at the bonds' expected maturity triggers the bond's 31.5-year maturity extension for that series of bonds. Once a bond has been extended and fully repaid, the next due bond will immediately convert to pass-through, even if it has not reached its expected maturity date. This sequential pass-through mechanism speeds up the repayment of the bonds and is similar to that seen in mortgage-backed securities. The cover pool consisted of 4,044 loans secured by first-ranking mortgages of Australian residential properties as of 7 June 2017, with a total outstanding balance of AUD1 billion. The cover pool's weighted-average loan/value ratio (LVR) was 61.4%; the Fitch-calculated indexed current LVR was 57.4% and the weighted-average seasoning was 63 months. Investment loans formed 38.8% of the pool, while 19.6% of the pool was interest-only loans. The cover pool has a high concentration around Queensland, with 56.7% of loans in the pool originated in the state. The agency calculated that, in a 'AAA' scenario, there would be a cumulative weighted-average foreclosure frequency of 8.6% and a weighted-average recovery rate of 53.3% for the cover pool. Criteria Variation Fitch has applied a variation to the APAC Residential Mortgage Criteria, which states that the asset margin modelled will be capped at 2.0% for covered bonds where the margin exceeds that amount. Fitch has given credit to the servicer's ability to adjust cover asset mortgage rates to avoid interest-rate shortfalls in the programme, which could occur over time. In its analysis, Fitch has equalised the margin on the variable rate assets to the average extension margin on the covered bonds. Without the variation, the breakeven AP for the rating would remain higher than the AP Fitch relies on. Hence, Fitch believes the variation applied does not affect the assigned ratings. RATING SENSITIVITIES Bank of Queensland Limited's covered bonds are vulnerable to downgrade if the relied-upon asset percentage (AP) rises above the 'AAA' breakeven AP of 96.0% or if the bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating falls below 'BB+'. Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected by, among other factors, the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the 'AAA' breakeven AP, which maintains the covered bond rating, will remain stable over time.

Thousands of people gathered in an east Caracas square to hear opposition figures including the wife of Lopez, Lilian Tintori, speak. Many protests have ended in clashes between masked youths and security forces, with more than 90 killed, hundreds arrested and thousands injured since the unrest began at the start of April.  We're not giving up. That Leopoldo is home fills us with the strength to keep fighting,  said Maria Garcia, a 54-year-old homemaker clad in a white T-shirt bearing his image, as she gathered with friends at the rally. While Lopez was at home with his two young children, Tintori, who has campaigned for him around the world including during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, said she was relieved to have her husband home but the fight was not over.  I can't say I'm happy when we know our country is suffering, when there are children eating out of the trash, when there is no medicine in Venezuela,  she said, surrounded by opposition legislators. She added that former foreign minister Delcy Rodriguez as well as her brother Jorge Rodriguez, another Socialist Party heavyweight, had escorted Lopez to his home at 3 a.m. on Saturday. Parallel Assembly Lopez, 46, was sentenced to nearly 14 years in jail on charges of inciting violence during 2014 protests against President Nicolas Maduro that led to 43 deaths. But he was surprisingly granted house arrest and sent home due to what the Supreme Court called  irregularities  in his case and for health reasons. Lopez looked robust, however, when he later appeared to supporters.

For more than three months, tear gas, rubber bullets, rocks and petrol bombs have flown between protesters and security forces in hotspots around the OPEC member nation. Four years of brutal recession have underpinned the protests, as millions of Venezuelans suffer food shortages, runaway inflation and long shopping lines. Slideshow (21 Images)While foes slam him for incompetence and failed socialist policies, Maduro blames an  economic war  against him by pro-opposition businessmen and Washington. The opposition and government are on a political collision course this month. The opposition is organizing an unofficial referendum on Maduro next weekend, after which they are promising  zero hour , a presumed reference to an escalation of tactics that could include a general strike or march on the presidential palace. Maduro, in turn, is seeking to create a new super body called a Constituent Assembly, which would have powers to rewrite the constitution and dismiss the current opposition-controlled legislature, via a July 30 vote. Campaigning for the parallel assembly began on Sunday, with red-clad supporters cheering on Socialist Party leaders in Caracas.  It's the only immediate path we Venezuelans have to overcome violence, hatred and intolerance,  Rodriguez, the former foreign minister who is running for a seat in the constituent body, said on Sunday in a TV interview. Maduro's foes are boycotting the July 30 election, saying it is a sham designed to keep an unpopular leader in power.

Brent crude futures were at $47.13 per barrel at 0147 GMT, up 25 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $44.64 per barrel, up 24 cents, or 0.5 percent. Traders said the uptick in prices was in part due to healthy demand expected in the coming weeks. Weekly U.S. gasoline demand data  compares favorably to the five-year average and miles driven also continue to grow year-on-year,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch said. However, beyond the seasonal strength,  U.S. gasoline demand may have peaked in absolute terms last year , it said, adding that there was no structural tightness in sight once the peak demand summer season finishes. Crude prices are still about 17 percent below their 2017 opening levels despite a deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production from January.  Traders are worried that increasing supply from Nigeria and Libya, both of which are recovering from internal conflict, will continue and further undermine the output caps agreed to by OPEC and Russia,  said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities. OPEC along with some other producers like Russia, but excluding the United States, agreed to hold back around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of production between January this year and March 2018. However, an over 10 percent jump since mid-2016 in U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA to 9.34 million bpd, as well as rising output from Nigeria and Libya, OPEC-members who were exempt from cutting, have undermined efforts to tighten the market. OPEC exported 25.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, 450,000 bpd more than in May and 1.9 million bpd more than a year earlier.  The simple truth is that OPEC and Russia have to contend with the fact that there is output growth elsewhere diluting their efforts at reducing supply,  French bank BNP Paribas said.  We thus have made deep cuts to our crude oil price forecasts. We now see the price of WTI averaging $49 per barrel 2017 (-$8/barrel revision) and that of Brent $51 per barrel (-$9/barrel revision). We also revise downwards 2018 with WTI averaging $45 per barrel (-$16 per barrel) and Brent $48 per barrel (-$15/barrel revision),  BNP said.

After entering a trading halt on July 7 following the suspension, Bellamy's said in a statement on Tuesday the Chinese regulator in charge of its import licence had asked it for  certain information  about its Camperdown Powder Pty Ltd factory. The licence suspension was a result of allegations a third party had made to Chinese authorities about  certain previous quality issues  concerning Camperdown's processing facility, it added. A Bellamy's spokesman would not name the third party. China accounts for a third of Bellamy's revenue and a third of its pre-tax profit, according to its half-yearly earnings update in February. The regulator had not made any findings against Camperdown, Bellamy's said. In any case, the licence suspension would not affect its China-bound formula since the factory currently made product only for third-party vendors.

Luisa Ortega, Venezuela's lead prosecutor and main challenger to Maduro from within the ruling socialist movement, has said she is expecting to be fired after alleging human rights abuses and erosion of democracy under the country's leftist president during three months of major anti-government protests.  We have to show unwavering support towards our state prosecutor, and if they do touch her, they will never be allowed to take over our institution,  said an unofficial statement circulated by workers on Monday.           A heliport atop the prosecutor's main office in Caracas has  been blocked off with furniture to avoid external interruptions, the sources said on Monday, requesting anonymity out of fear of reprisals. The pro-government Supreme Court is considering a charge brought by a socialist lawmaker of  grave offense  against Ortega. Officials have also leveled a plethora of accusations against the 59-year-old lawyer, from  insanity  and encouraging  terrorists  to misusing a confiscated plane. Amid an apparent bid to oust her, the top court named a deputy prosecutor, whom Ortega has rejected as illegitimate. That court-appointed deputy prosecutor last week tried to enter the office hiding in the trunk of a car but was expelled by security personnel, a source at the prosecutor's office had told Reuters. The internal fissure has emboldened anti-Maduro protesters, who have been staging near-daily demonstrations since April to demand early elections amid a devastating economic crisis that has millions struggling to eat properly. Almost 100 people have died in the unrest.  Demonstrators clash with security forces during a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas.Andres Martinez CasaresProtesters across the oil-rich South American nation were holding a 10-hour road blockade on Monday.  Some demonstrators were sitting on garden chairs quietly reading a book or waving Venezuelan flags. Young hooded protesters also prepared Molotov cocktails, and were clashing with security forces in the capital.  Slideshow (8 Images) I'm fighting against these communists who don't know how to run the country and have stolen everything,  said retiree Antonio Montero, who lives in the sprawling Petare slum, as he waved a Venezuelan flag in the middle of an empty Caracas street. Seven National Guard soldiers were wounded after being attacked with an explosive, the government said on Monday evening. Two other security officers were injured by gunshot, according to Information Minister Ernesto Villegas. Many protesters feel vindicated after Venezuela's best-known jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was granted house arrest over the weekend. The opposition is also seeking to ramp up pressure ahead of Maduro's planned vote on July 30 to elect members of a new, controversial legislative superbody with powers to rewrite the constitution.  Maduro has said the assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela. His opponents have said that it is a ruse designed to avoid free and fair elections that the Socialist Party would lose. The opposition is holding its own referendum on Sunday to let Venezuelans have their say.

The company, which makes steel tubes and auto parts for customers including Ford (F.N), Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), posted its third straight annual loss in 2016, prompting ICICI (ICBK.NS), one of its lead lenders, to trigger bankruptcy proceedings early this year. Nearly six months on the proceedings against Innoventive, seen as a test case for the first national bankruptcy law, are raising questions about the efficiency of the new regime that regulators are now compelling lenders to use to recover debts. The new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code aims to move cases of company failure into a single forum, replacing an archaic system of overlapping regulations under which banks, company promoters and other creditors could all initiate competing proceedings in different courts, tribunals and regions. That system left India's Debt Recovery Tribunals vastly overstretched, with court buildings strewn with ever-rising pillars of dusty files, gumming up the flow of credit in the economy and discouraging new investment. The World Bank estimated it took 4.3 years on average in India to resolve insolvency under the old laws, more than twice as long as in China. And average recoveries were just 25.7 cents on the dollar, one of the worst among similar sized economies. The new regime aims to significantly boost recoveries and  put a firm timeline around case resolution in the hope that this will help clean-up bank balance sheets and spur lending.  India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India has already told banks to push 12 of the largest defaulters into insolvency, but experts worry the framework is largely untested and hampered by a shortage of experienced bankruptcy professionals.   I completely understand why they want resolution for large defaulters quickly because the balance sheets have to be cleaned up,  said Ashish Chhawchharia, a partner at accounting and consulting firm Grant Thornton.  You cannot really push too hard, however, because if things go wrong people will start losing faith in the new code.   Flood of Cases Defaulters identified by the RBI are already being taken to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the forum now empowered to rule on these cases. Only a few dozen cases have been taken on by the NCLT so far, but a deluge could be in the offing.     We estimate at least 20,000 to 25,000 bankruptcy cases will come to the NCLT, if not more,  said Nikhil Shah, a managing director at restructuring experts Alvarez & Marsal.  And at that point it would get crushed under the workload.  The new law mandates a 180-day deadline to resolve cases, but the Innoventive case, in which creditors are seeking to recover about $200 million, has already faced multiple delays. Innoventive initially sought to block the matter under a six-decade old state law, and launched appeals in the High Court and an appellate tribunal, while creditors were divided on the terms of an interim financing deal, according to two sources close to the case. The company could appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, forcing lenders to seek an extension and jeopardising the resolution deadline, the sources said. Chandu Chavan, the main backer of Innoventive, could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.  With loan syndicates in India typically comprising a dozen or more state-run and private banks, forging agreement between creditors is not easy. For Innoventive, it was harder to get the 21 lenders in the room to agree on an interim financing package for the firm to operate during the insolvency process than to find a party willing to actually provide the funds, one of the sources said. Bankers often lack authority to take decisions on writedowns and have to revert to their boards for approval, causing further delays, the source added.      Value Erosion Under the new system lenders are mandated to initiate liquidation proceedings if a case cannot be resolved within the 180-day deadline, with a 90-day extension granted only in exceptional circumstances. Such an outcome could result not only in job losses at companies that were still going concerns, but also steep losses for banks that have to sell assets piecemeal.  We've already been in touch with all possible suitors,  said one senior banker, describing the situation lenders often found themselves in when they tried to offload assets from liquidated firms.  It's not like you have a lot people waiting for these assets.  Despite these concerns, M.S. Sahoo, chairman of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, the government body set up to supervise the new code, said he was confident buyers would emerge under the new system.  Nothing develops in a vacuum.  said Sahoo.  Only when something is available will the market develop.   The NCLT would not be hit with a tsunami of cases, he added, as only large defaults will be handed to it. Those involved in cases are also concerned by the lack of experienced insolvency resolution professionals - a domain in its infancy in India and dominated by mom-and-pop firms. Dinkar Venkatasubramanian, a partner at EY, says a lack of professional indemnity insurance for insolvency professionals was a major deterrent for big accounting firms to take up the task.      The risk is significant,  he said.  There exists litigation and reputational risk and the indemnity for IPs in the code is very generic.

(bit.ly/2v3RyDX) Musk has high hopes for the $35,000 Model 3, aimed at the mass market, and expects the rollout to help the company deliver five times its current annual sales volume. Tesla's shares have taken a beating in the last few weeks, as investors have become increasingly concerned that demand for the company's existing Model S sedan is weakening. Musk said in May that some  confused  Tesla buyers considered the new Model 3 as an upgrade to the Model S, hurting orders for the older car. Registrations for Tesla's vehicles in California, its largest market, fell 24 percent in April from a year ago, according to data from research firm IHS Markit. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that new registrations of Tesla cars fell to zero in Hong Kong after authorities slashed a tax break for electric vehicles in April.  Last week, Musk said production of the Model 3 would increase exponentially — from 100 cars in August, more than 1,500 in September to 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in December.

There is a lot more riding on Tesla Inc's deal to install the world's largest grid-scale electric battery in Australia than whether Elon Musk can meet his bold commitment to finish within the 100-day deadline. Under an agreement made public on July 7, Tesla must deliver the 100 megawatt (MW) battery within 100 days of the contract being signed, or the government of South Australia state won't have to pay the electric car, clean energy and space exploration company. On the surface, this is a deal aimed at providing back-up electricity to South Australia, a state that has been plagued by blackouts since it closed coal-fired power plants and moved to being powered mainly by renewables such as wind, and to a grid connection to neighboring Victoria state. Certainly, if successful, the 100 MW of Tesla lithium-ion batteries will be able to provide power to some 30,000 homes in South Australia, which is home to about 1.7 million people and ranks fifth by population of Australia's six states. But the significance of the deal goes way beyond the mere provision of emergency power, and it is likely to become a political football in Australia's wider energy debate. Broadly speaking, Australia's energy debate is becoming polarized into two factions, one in favor of using the nation's abundant coal as the main fuel, and the other committed to switching to mainly renewable sources of power as part of efforts to limit global climate change. While there are moderate voices in both camps urging a gradual and planned switch from the current situation where about 80 percent of the nation's power comes from ageing, polluting coal-fired plants, the more radical voices tend to grab the media headlines. Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister and leader of the National Party, poured scorn on the Tesla battery plan, saying it wouldn't make much difference.  You know, a grain of sugar is an advantage to a teaspoon, but it doesn't make a hell of a lot of difference,  Joyce, whose party is the junior partner in the ruling Liberal-led federal government, said in a television interview on Sunday. The problem for the federal government, and indeed the state governments as well, is that electricity prices, and public anger, are soaring. Consumers in the main population states of New South Wales and Victoria face increases of as much as 20 percent this year in electricity bills, caused by rising generation costs amid the closure of several old coal-fired power plants. The question is what will replace these polluting plants as they reach the end of their useful lifespans. Misleading Claims The mining lobby, and elements within the ruling coalition, want to build new generation coal-fired plants, claiming these will be cheaper and less polluting. The so-called high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) coal plants would be less polluting than Australia's current fleet, but even these are still far more carbon-intensive than natural-gas plants, not to mention renewables. The Minerals Council of Australia released a report on July 3 in which it claimed a  clean coal  HELE plant would provide cheaper electricity than renewables. While the costings in the report are open to challenge, what was potentially misleading was the claim that HELE plants are  clean coal .  They are about 14 percent more efficient than older technology coal plants, but aren't clean insofar as they don't capture and store carbon emissions. This sort of claim certainly undermines the mining sector's credibility and helps boost the cause of the environmentalists. Sitting somewhere in the middle of the debate is Australia's petroleum industry, which has the dual aim of protecting its $200 billion of investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants and promoting the use of the cleaner-burning fuel domestically. The industry wants both federal and state governments to facilitate more onshore gas exploration and production, arguing that this will boost supply and lower costs. The environmental lobby, ignoring peer-reviewed science that fracking is largely safe if well regulated, wants an end to all unconventional and conventional natural gas exploration and production. At the very least, the environmentalists want restrictions on LNG exports in order to make natural gas cheaper and more available to the domestic market. Again, there is possibly misleading information and claims on both sides, with the industry stating that Australia's wholesale natural gas price is competitive in Asia (it is), but ignoring that retail prices have surged. For its part the environmental lobby, with the support of farming groups, is running a scare campaign on natural gas, using the typical bogeyman of greedy corporations sucking up and exporting resources, but ignoring that only one of the seven LNG plants actually buys gas that could be supplied domestically instead. Into this situation comes Tesla and its battery farm for South Australia. If the project does work, and more importantly is viewed by politicians and the public as a cost-effective success, then Barnaby Joyce may find that his one grain of sugar rapidly becomes many more. However, if the batteries don't prove effective in smoothing out South Australia's intermittent wind-powered electricity, then the move toward more renewables will take a blow, perhaps even big enough to allow the promoters of new coal plants an opportunity.

Both countries have boosted production since they were exempted from an OPEC-led deal to cut output, weighing on global prices LCOc1. This has prompted more talk among producers about including them in the pact.  We have spoken to (OPEC Secretary General Mohammad) Barkindo and in the next two weeks there will be conversations with them (Libya and Nigeria) and possibly we will invite them to the technical summit,  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Istanbul. Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC nations including Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Oman will meet on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss the current situation in the oil market.  Nigeria's oil minister, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, was invited to the meeting but is unable to attend due to another commitment, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters at the same Istanbul event. Instead, the group will probably ask a technical committee involving the six OPEC and non-OPEC members, which is due to convene before the ministers hold their talks, to meet Nigerian and Libyan representatives to discuss their production plans, he said.  We extended the invitation but unfortunately there is a previous commitment for the Nigerian oil minister,  the minister said.  We did not talk about capping, at least we can talk about production plans right now,  he added. The monitoring panel, called the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee which Kuwait chairs, could recommend expanding the pact to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November.  Both Nigeria and Libya were given exemptions to the supply cut, under which OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers are reducing their output by about 1.8 million barrels per day because their output has been curbed by conflict.  OPEC delegates have said bringing Nigeria or Libya into the production pact would likely focus on capping their output, rather than asking them to cut their supply so soon after it had recovered from involuntary curbs. Kachikwu has said that Nigeria was not opposed in principle to joining OPEC's production cap, but would have to wait and see if production returned to acceptable levels. OPEC has not been in touch with Libya on the issue of capping the country's output, an OPEC delegate said. The Libyan government has not received an invitation to attend the ministerial meeting in Russia, he added. In comments to Reuters on Monday, the head of Libya's National Oil Corporation did not indicate any willingness to cap output yet, saying Libya's humanitarian problems must be considered in any talks on the subject. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla added Libya could assist with efforts to stabilize the market by informing OPEC about its plans to restore production.

After an investigation, prosecutors said there was evidence that Orlando Chacin acquired cars through a  handpicked  contracting committee. The prosecutors claim Chacin overpaid for the cars and that he also paid for them in foreign currency instead of the local bolivar currency specified in the tender. The office added that one of those vehicles was assigned to Chacin for personal use. It requested Chacin and his lawyers appear on Friday to be formally charged. Prosecutors did not provide any further details such as who received the excess funds or the dollar amount involved.     PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chacin did not respond to an email.     Chacin, a geophysical engineer, was vice president of exploration and production for PDVSA until late January when he was demoted to an internal director amid a broader overhaul.      Although Chacin will be the highest-ranking state oil executive to be charged in a corruption case in Venezuela, the case could face internal political hurdles.  The prosecutor's office is clashing with the leftist government, and the chief prosecutor has said she expects to be fired after accusing President Nicolas Maduro of human rights violations and erosion of democracy.      PDVSA's reputation has been tarnished in recent years by corruption investigations that have involved high-profile staff. The company has acknowledged the problem, but said they are the work of a few individuals.     Last year, the opposition-led congress said that some $11 billion was lost at PDVSA during the period in which Rafael Ramírez was in charge of the company between 2004 and 2014.

The views expressed are his own) U.S. Independence Day marked a turning point in the oil market, when a short-covering rally ran out of momentum and gave way to a renewed and very aggressive bear market. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 46 million barrels in the week leading up to July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2uInAFV). Funds increased their net long position for the first time after reducing it by a cumulative 231 million barrels over the previous four weeks, according to data from regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2tzCiRh). The move had all the characteristics of a short covering rally, with crude prices rising steadily between June 21 and July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2t4K7ek). The commencement of short-covering was widely anticipated after hedge funds established a record number of short positions in crude, gasoline and heating oil by June 27. The total number of short positions held by hedge fund managers in the five major crude and products contracts declined from a record 510 million barrels on June 27 to 463 million barrels on July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2u9sW00). Fund managers cut short positions in WTI by 14 million barrels, Brent by 13 million, U.S. gasoline by 8 million and U.S. heating oil by 13 million in the week running up to Independence Day. Even so, only a small number of short positions had been closed out by July 4.  But then something very unexpected happened. Instead of prices continuing to climb as more short positions were closed, prices began to sink in the second half of last week. From a positioning perspective, the balance of risks remained tilted to the upside, with a small number of long positions left to liquidate and a large number of shorts still needing to be closed out. So the renewed decline in oil prices therefore marked an unusual and aggressive move, with extra selling from unknown traders pushing prices lower. Oil prices continued to slide despite an unusually large drawdown in U.S. commercial crude stocks reported on July 6. From a positioning perspective, positions still appear very stretched on the downside. There is still a very high risk of the trade becoming crowded. But sentiment in the oil market has become exceptionally bearish, with most traders concluding OPEC won't, or can't, do anything to support prices, and U.S. shale producers can't, or won't, moderate the drilling boom. Prices may therefore have to continue falling low enough for long enough to enforce a strategy correction from the shale drillers or OPEC. The result is an unresolved tension between positioning risks (which remain biased to the upside) and fundamental risks (which are increasingly tilted to the downside).

With only three weeks left before a summer recess scheduled to stretch until Sept. 5, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared determined to keep trying to find agreement on a partisan, all-Republican bill. If he cannot, he will be faced with giving up on a seven-year Republican promise to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare - and possibly turning to Democrats for help in fixing problems with U.S. health insurance markets. The Republican legislation would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Since the start of 2017, when they took control of the White House, Republicans who also control Congress have been struggling over how to replace former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation - which they see as  government intrusion - with less comprehensive federal healthcare provisions. Related CoverageU.S. Senate Republican leader delays Senate's August recessConservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz favors offering a choice of cheaper healthcare plans that would not have to meet minimum standards established by Obamacare, such as coverage for maternity care and prescription drugs. Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins dismissed that approach on Monday, telling reporters:  I believe that it would cause further destabilization of the individual (insurance) market, it would erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions  and cause premiums to rise. Trump Urges Action U.S. President Donald Trump waves as walks on the South Lawn of the White House upon his return to Washington, U.S., from the G20 Summit in Hamburg, July 8, 2017.Yuri GripasEarlier on Monday, Trump used Twitter to prod Republican senators to pass a bill, and senior lawmakers, including the Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, said legislation could advance to votes next week in the deeply divided chamber.   I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!  tweeted Trump, who made repealing and replacing Obamacare a central pledge of his 2016 campaign. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved its healthcare bill in May, knowing the Senate would amend it. Slideshow (14 Images)Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told reporters he was worried about how rural hospitals would be treated in the Senate bill, which is being assembled in secret. He said lawmakers were awaiting an assessment of a retooled Senate bill from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office before making decisions. Senior Republican Orrin Hatch said he did not yet know whether the minimum 50 Republican senators would come together on a bill, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the potential tiebreaking vote. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote to McConnell urging a bipartisan effort to stabilize the health insurance market, noting that McConnell had been quoted recently as saying Congress would need to shore up that market if lawmakers fail to repeal Obamacare. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued data on Monday showing a 38 percent decrease in applications by insurers to sell health plans in the Obamacare individual market in 2018 compared with this year. Scores of protesters voiced opposition to the legislation outside Republican National Committee headquarters and at the offices of some Republican lawmakers, chanting slogans including  Trumpcare kills  and  Healthcare is a human right.   U.S. Capitol Police said 80 people were arrested.

Trump Jr. hired New York lawyer Alan Futerfas, who specializes in criminal defense and whose clients have included reputed organized crime figures, computer hackers and white-collar criminals. Futerfas would not say when he was retained or whether he played any part in the statements Trump Jr. made over the weekend about his June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, during the presidential election campaign. Trump Jr. said he agreed to meet Veselnitskaya, described by the New York Times as having links to the Kremlin, after being promised damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Trump's then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also attended, the Times said. It called the encounter the first confirmed private meeting of members of Donald Trump's inner circle with a Russian national during the campaign. Allegations of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia have cast a shadow over the Republican president's first months in office and sparked investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel, Robert Mueller, into whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with the Trump campaign. Moscow denies interfering, and Trump, who became president on Jan. 20, says there was no collusion. Futerfas told Reuters: “I look forward to assisting Donald Jr. and, quite frankly, there is nothing to all of the media buzz about the June 9th, 2016 meeting. That will be proven to be the case.” A Republican member of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Susan Collins, called on Trump Jr. to testify before the panel, which is looking into accusations of Russian meddling in the election.  Our intelligence committee needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting,  Senator Susan Collins told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, said it  absolutely  wants to speak to Trump Jr. about the meeting. Warner said he and the Republican committee chairman, Richard Burr, will decide later whether to ask Trump Jr. to testify in public or in a classified setting. 'Someone We'll Want to Talk to'  Rest assured, Donald Trump Jr. will be someone that we'll want to talk to,  Warner told reporters outside his Senate office. Burr would not say if the committee would talk to Trump Jr., but he told reporters the panel would look into the purpose of the meeting, who set it up and how the process unfolded before making a decision on who to interview.  The committee will see everybody we think has value,  Burr said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said there was nothing inappropriate about the meeting with lawyer Veselnitskaya.  Don Junior took a very short meeting from which there was absolutely no follow-up,  Sanders told reporters. But Republican Senator Pat Toomey said it was not appropriate for presidential campaigns to solicit or accept negative information about a rival from a Russian.  It encourages countries to come in and undermine our democratic process. And these countries have great capabilities to do that sort of thing,  he told MSNBC. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that the Kremlin did not know the identity of the Russian lawyer.  No, we don't know who it is and, certainly, we cannot track down all movements of all Russian lawyers both within Russia and abroad,  Peskov said. Public relations specialist Rob Goldstone said he arranged the meeting at the request of singer and businessman Emin Agalarov, a Moscow-based client of his. He told Trump Jr. the meeting was with a Russian lawyer who apparently claimed to have information regarding illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee.

Authorities at Bahrain's information affairs office could not immediately be reached for comment. Bahrain has repeatedly denied systematic rights abuses. The Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said Rajab had been unable to attend the trial, having been at an interior ministry hospital since his health deteriorated in April. He was detained a year ago.  This outrageous sentence against someone speaking the truth exhibits the brutality of the Bahraini government and its heinous crimes and that of its kangaroo court,  said Sayed Al-Wadaei, director of advocacy at BIRD. In a January 2015 media interview cited by the prosecution, according to al-Wadaei, Rajab had said Bahrain's jails housed political prisoners who were subject to torture. Rajab was a leading figure in a 2011 pro-democracy uprising which Bahrain crushed with the help of fellow Gulf Arab countries. He was arrested in June last year after tweets from his account suggested that security forces had tortured detainees in a Bahraini prison and during a military campaign in Yemen.  Blatant Injustice  Amnesty International called Rajab's imprisonment  a flagrant violation of human rights, and an alarming sign that the Bahraini authorities will go to any length to silence criticism . Human Rights First called the ruling  blatant injustice designed to serve political interests . Rajab criticized U.S. President Donald Trump in a New York Times column in May for selling arms to his country and to Saudi Arabia, citing their human rights records. Trump's White House has green-lighted a $5 billion military sale to Bahrain held up by the administration of his predecessor Barrack Obama last year over human rights concerns. The island state is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet.  The Sunni-ruled kingdom, most of whose population is Shi'ite, says it faces a threat from neighboring Shi'ite theocracy Iran. It accuses the Islamic Republic of radicalizing and arming some members of its majority Shi'ite population in an effort to bring about the downfall of the ruling Al Khalifa family. Tehran denies any meddling in Bahrain. Rajab faces further charges related to an article he published in the New York Times last year and tweets from his account critical of the intervention in the Yemen war by a Saudi-led coalition.

The dollar was 0.1 percent higher at 114.160 yen following a rise to a two-month high of 114.300 overnight. The euro was effectively flat at $1.1397 after inching down about 0.1 percent the previous day.  The dollar is capped as the surge in German bund yields stopped overnight and in turn dragged down U.S. Treasury yields. The recent surge in bond yields appears overdone and we are seeing a bit of a correction,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. Investors have dumped euro zone government bonds over the past two weeks on expectations the European Central Bank (ECB) would unwind extraordinary stimulus sooner rather than later. The resulting surge in euro zone yields had also helped the benchmark Treasury yield climb to two-month highs on Friday. Japanese government bond (JGB) yields had also tracked the rise in their U.S. and euro zone counterparts. Last week, however, the Bank of Japan stepped in and halted the move through a special debt-buying operation, intent on keeping yields anchored close to zero. With U.S. yields free to rise, the spread between 10-year Treasury and JGB yields is the widest it has been in two months, contributing to the dollar's strength against the yen.  JGB yields can't move at all after the BOJ came out and stopped the yield rise with brute force, leaving the door open for the U.S.-Japan yield spread to widen,  said Ishizuki at Daiwa Securities. The next large cue for the currency market was seen coming from Fed's Yellen, due to make a semi-annual testimony before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Dollar bulls are banking on Yellen to retain her hawkish stance, emboldened by last Friday's relatively robust U.S. non-farm jobs report. The pound was little changed at $1.2880. It was within reach of a two-week low of $1.2855 plumbed overnight after a run of lacklustre data cast doubt over the Bank of England's recent warnings that it is on the verge of raising borrowing costs. BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent is due to speak later in the day, giving investors a chance to hear the views of an interest-rate setter's first public comments since a narrow vote to keep rates unchanged last month. The Australian dollar was flat at $0.7606 while the New Zealand dollar slipped 0.3 percent to $0.7254. (Editing by Sam Holmes)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL4N1K203D"},

The Camp Street Prison was the largest in the tiny Caribbean nation, which sits on the shoulder of South America between Venezuela, Brazil and Suriname.  A fire during the riot destroyed the building, primarily made from wood, which housed 600 inmates. President David Granger said that while the prison had been destroyed, authorities' priority was to ensure the safety of the Guyanese people.  Guyanese can be assured that there are not going to be prisoners roaming about the city or countryside,  Granger told the state broadcaster.

Williams was convicted on seven counts of murder and five counts of manslaughter. Director of Prisons Gladwin Samuels said Williams had sought his freedom on Sunday and plotted with another inmate to set the building on fire and escape. A prison warden, Odinga Wickham, died of gunshot wounds, though details of the shooting were unclear. The fire began around 5 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Sunday, but emergency services were unable to enter to building as many prisoners were armed, said authorities. It quickly spread and destroyed the prison.

Western Digital, in court documents filed July 7, said it has made six proposals since February, including a proposal on June 27 matching the best offer. On June 21, Toshiba said its preferred bidder was a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors offering $18 billion. Since February, Toshiba has been scrambling to sell its memory chip business, the second largest in the industry after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, to cover losses from its ailing nuclear reactor division. But suitor Western Digital sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court for an injunction to stop the sale, arguing that a joint-venture it has with Toshiba at a plant in Japan means the chipmaker cannot sell without its consent. In a filing on July 7, Mark Long, the chief financial officer of Western Digital, said the company's most recent offer on June 27, made with private equity firm KKR,  is in line with the highest competing bids for (Toshiba's chip unit) that have been reported in the press.  The actual dollar figure of Western Digital's offer is redacted from the document. Western Digital declined to comment. Toshiba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Toshiba has asked the court in San Francisco to dismiss Western Digital's attempt to stop the sale, arguing that the U.S. court does not have proper jurisdiction over a business that is based primarily in Japan and that an injunction would cause it irreparable harm. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. Aaron Rakers, a managing director with Stifel, said in a note to clients on Sunday that the new filings suggest the two parties could reach a deal before the court hearing.  Given that some negotiations between (Western Digital) and Toshiba on proposed acquisition terms started over the past month, we think a resolution could be possible prior to the (July 14) hearing,  Rakers wrote.

Animals there last week, on average, fetched $117.75 per cwt.

His blood alcohol level was nearly four times higher than the legal limit. The legal drinking age in Pennsylvania is 21. “Brandon could have stopped it at any time,” Scicchitano said at the preliminary hearing at Centre County Court of Common Pleas in Bellefonte. “He was the president. He had total authority to stop all that.” Young and seven others face felony aggravated-assault charges that could put them in prison for years. The rest are charged with misdemeanors, including involuntary manslaughter. Frank Fina, Young's lawyer, told the hearing that neither his client nor any of the defendants forced Piazza to consume the alcohol that led to his death.  The pledge chose to drink to please the fraternity, said Fina, best known as a prosecutor in the child sexual abuse case against former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller argued at Monday's hearing that the state anti-hazing law under which the accused was charged assumes a lack of consent by the alleged victim. Scicchitano, under cross-examination by Fina at a continuation of a hearing that started on June 10, also testified that two private guards hired to check for alcohol visited the house on the night when Piazza sustained his fatal injuries. But neither the guards, known as  social checkers,  nor an assistant athletic director who lived at the house were there when Piazza fell down the stairs, Schiccitano said. The detective said guards hired by an inter-fraternity council were generally ineffective in stopping abuses because most were students and did not have full access to patrol frat houses. Earlier, he said Beta Theta Pi members bought more than $2,000 worth of drinks for the initiations. Most of the pledges, including Piazza, who was 19, were underage. After the hearing, Magisterial District Judge Allen Sinclair will decide whether the 16 defendants, and two others who waived preliminary hearings, will stand trial.

Trump,Jeb Hensarling,Keith Noreika,Richard Cordray,Richard Hunt,USA,CONSUMERS/ARBITRATION,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks and credit card companies could be prevented from blocking customers from banding together to sue them under a rule released by the country's consumer finance agency on Monday. In releasing the rule, which goes into full effect in eight months, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fired the first shot in a likely brutal political battle between Republicans and Democrats over regulators' reach into banks' workings and customer rights. Banks blasted the rule, which bars financial firms from forcing customers to agree to settle disputes only through arbitration as a condition of opening new accounts, but consumer advocates said it will make sure wronged customers have their day in court.  Mandatory arbitration  clauses that block customers from filing or joining a class-action lawsuit appear in contracts for a wide variety of products. The rule was proposed last year under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat who appointed the current director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray. Republicans now control both Congress and the White House, and are already looking into stopping it in its tracks. Just before the CFPB unveiled the final rule, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika wrote Cordray to raise  safety and soundness  concerns with a draft version he had read and asked the CFPB to share data it used in crafting the rule, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters. The CFPB did not share the final rule with him ahead of the announcement, according to an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency spokesman. In the letter, Noreika, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, cited a section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that allows his office to set aside possibly unsafe CFPB rules. Eliminating mandatory arbitration  could result in less effective consumer protection and remedies, while simply enriching class-action lawyers,  he wrote, adding the rule  may potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers, while increasing their costs.  In the final rule, the bureau requires financial companies to give customers the option of arbitration or of banding together to sue in class actions. Companies must also provide redacted records of claims and awards reached through arbitration, which the CFPB will post on its website beginning in July 2019. Rule critics say class actions are costly, suck up time and result in lower awards for consumers. In recent months, they have worked to undo regulations barring the fine print from contracts for nursing-homes and for-profit colleges. Supporters say Americans have the right to take complaints to court, and group lawsuits are effective in publicly correcting bad corporate behavior. They say arbitrations are secretive and rigged in favor of companies. California may soon allow state residents to sue financial institutions after clauses inserted into Wells Fargo account-opening agreements blocked customers from suing over the bank's creation of unauthorized accounts in their names. Opposition in Congress, the Courts Calling the new CFPB rule  anti-consumer,  the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Representative Jeb Hensarling said Congress should reject it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which gives lawmakers power to kill newly minted regulations. The Consumer Bankers Association has already begun lobbying lawmakers to use the CRA on the rule, said its president Richard Hunt. Cordray, too, told reporters on a call he expects Congress to look into nullifying the rule but questioned the level of support for the move. Congress has already banned mandatory arbitration clauses for mortgages and contracts involving members of the military, he said. Meanwhile, one of Washington's most powerful lobby groups and CFPB critics, the Chamber of Commerce, said it will  consider every approach to address our concerns,  which many interpreted as a threat to sue.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-consumers-arbitration-idUSL1N1K10WL"},

Jeronimo Yanez, was an officer with the St. Anthony Police Department, when he shot Castile five times during a traffic stop in July 2016. He was found not guilty last month of second-degree manslaughter.  The death of Castile, 32, drew national attention as it occurred during a wave of high-profile police killings of black men. The incidents sparked street protests in cities across the United States accusing police of using excessive force against blacks.  A reasonable voluntary separation agreement brings to a close one part of this horrible tragedy,  the city of St. Anthony said in a statement.     The City concluded this was the most thoughtful way to move forward and help the community-wide healing process proceed.   Yanez, who is Hispanic, was not convicted of a crime so he would have appeal and grievance rights if terminated, the statement added.  Details of the agreement were not disclosed. City officials could not be reached for comment after business hours. An attorney for Yanez did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Yanez, 29, testified that he had feared for his life after Castile told him that he was carrying a firearm and reached for his wallet when Yanez asked to see identification.  Prosecutors said Yanez was not justified in firing his gun, saying that Castile was courteous and non-threatening. Castile's girlfriend, who was in the car with him when he was shot, live-streamed the bloody aftermath on social media. The video quickly went viral.  Shortly after the verdict, the city of St. Anthony said Yanez, the son of a Mexican immigrant, would not return to active duty and it was negotiating a  voluntary separation agreement  with him. Castile's family reached a $3 million settlement with the city of St. Anthony last month.

There is no issue, except do they want to pass a Russia sanctions bill or not,  Senator Bob Corker told reporters at the U.S. Senate. The Senate passed the sanctions measure by 98-2 on June 15, but it has been stalled in the House, where President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans hold a larger majority than in the Senate. House Republican leaders insisted the delay was purely because the bill violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues must originate in the House, not the Senate. They also blamed Democrats for holding it up. Democrats, and some Republicans, scoffed. They said the bill could have been fixed and passed in the House in a matter of minutes. Trump administration officials said they disagree with provisions in the bill requiring the president to get Congress' permission before easing any sanctions, and the fact that many of the new sanctions are mandatory, so that the president cannot opt to waive them for national security reasons. Some Republicans have also echoed concerns raised by U.S. energy firms and European governments that the legislation could complicate investment in Russian energy projects, and potentially cost industry jobs. Corker said the bill was written to allow the Trump administration to address energy-related issues. And he said any White House would prefer to conduct foreign policy without Congress, but the administration had not asked him to kill the bill.  No one has called me and said, 'We don't want this legislation to pass.' That has never occurred,  Corker said. Lawmakers and aides said administration officials had held meetings in Congress in the past few weeks to express their concerns about the measure. The Senate passed the bill a second time by unanimous consent on June 29, with a “fix” to address the procedural issue, but it has still not been taken up by the House. House Republicans said on Monday that the Senate change had not satisfied the procedural concern and that the Senate would have to change it and vote again.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. The hospital said in a short statement Liu was also suffering from kidney problems, with an increasingly swollen stomach, partial intestinal obstruction and falling blood pressure, and that in his condition, it was not appropriate to treat him with radiotherapy. His family had been informed, it said. Questions have arisen over the possibility of Liu getting treatment abroad, and, if he wanted to go and was fit enough to go, if authorities would let him leave. Calls have grown from rights groups and Western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife, Liu Xia, to be treated overseas.     A German and U.S. doctor who visited Liu said on Sunday he could be moved abroad safely for treatment and he wanted to go to either Germany or the United States, but any move needed to happen soon. They added that  additional options  may exist to treat him, including radiotherapy. Jared Genser, a U.S. attorney who represents Liu, urged the Chinese government to allow a transfer, noting that additional treatment abroad could extend Liu's life for several weeks and that better palliative care would reduce his pain.  By denying him treatments that would extend his life, the Chinese government is intentionally hastening his death,  Genser said in a statement late on Monday. Asked on Monday at a daily news briefing whether China would allow Liu to go abroad for treatment, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said:  China hopes relevant countries will respect China's sovereignty and will not use individual cases to interfere with China's internal affairs.  Pro-democracy activists stage a sit-in protest demanding the release of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 10, 2017.Bobby YipThe government has said Liu is getting the best care possible and is being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts. Video Clips Controversy also arose over video clips that appeared on YouTube, in which two foreign men, apparently the German and U.S. doctors, appeared to praise the quality of care Liu has received. Several video clips of Liu have appeared on YouTube, which is blocked in China, since his sickness came to light. One clip showed Chinese doctors asking whether there was any better treatment possible for Liu, followed by a man, identified in text posted with the video as German doctor Markus Buechler, saying:  I don't think we can do better in Germany.  Slideshow (5 Images)In another clip, Buechler was seen telling Liu's wife that they considered their invitation a sign that Chinese doctors wanted to do their best to care for Liu. The German embassy in Beijing said in a statement the recordings were made  against the expressed wishes of the German side, which were communicated in writing prior to the visit .  It seems that security organs are steering the process, not medical experts. This behaviour undermines trust in the authorities dealing with Mr Liu's case, which is vital to ensure maximum success of his medical treatment,  the embassy said. China has kept a tight control on information about Liu's case and has imposed strict security at the hospital. The 23rd floor of building number 1 of the First Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang, where friends of Liu say he is being treated, has been sealed off, with access only for patients or family members. Friends have confirmed that Liu's family have been able to visit him. A man in plain clothes who identified himself as working for the hospital told a Reuters journalist who went to the floor to leave. Asked if Liu was being treated there, the man, whose ID badge identified him as Teng Zhi, said:  Regardless of whether he is here or not, you cannot go in unless you are a family member.  Police in plain clothes blocked a Reuters journalist from taking video of the hospital entrance. When asked if filming was not allowed because of Liu Xiaobo, they said:  Who's that?  The journalist was then escorted to what was described as a  media centre  in a nearby hotel where a man, who only gave his last name Zhang, said no one at the hospital was available for an interview.

Elliott revealed in documents published on its website it was unhappy with the recovery to some creditors under an $18.1 billion deal announced by billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire on Friday. The hedge fund believes its acquisition offer would result in a higher payout to debtholders. New York-based Elliott's proposal to acquire Energy Future Holdings Corp calls for a complex conversion of its debt to equity and for an outside equity partner to help finance the deal. Reuters first reported on Elliott exploring a bid for Oncor on Friday. The offer from the hedge fund, which says it has more than $32 billion under management, would be a rare challenge to Buffett, who avoids auctions for companies and has told his investors he does not like to participate in bidding wars. But even without a competing bid, Buffett's deal faces a difficult road securing the approval of a bankruptcy court judge without Elliott supporting it.   We are extremely concerned that introducing a transaction with Berkshire at the current time will significantly undercut and potentially limit Elliott's ability to provide a portion of the financing necessary to achieve the higher and otherwise superior transaction Elliott has proposed,  the hedge fund said in a letter to the board of Energy Future dated July 5 and released on Monday. Berkshire's offer would help Energy Future exit its costly bankruptcy, which has stretched for over three years as other deals for its crown jewel Oncor fell apart. Energy Future's power generation and retail electricity business were separated from Oncor and emerged from bankruptcy last year. Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, also disclosed on Monday that it would keep in place a corporate  ringfencing  structure that would prevent debt from being added to Dallas-based Oncor, or too much cash being paid out as dividends.  Regulators in the utility's home state of Texas have demanded such a structure. That was the reason Florida utility NextEra Energy Inc's (NEE.N) $18.7 billion deal for the utility collapsed earlier this year. Berkshire Hathaway already has reached an agreement on a consensual approval process with regulators, according to a statement from an adviser to Energy Future filed in bankruptcy court. Oncor did not immediately comment on Elliott's letter, while Berkshire was not immediately available for comment. Elliott declined to comment. Elliott's disclosures came after Energy Future filed its new bankruptcy plan of reorganization on Friday. It proposed repaying the unsecured debt that Elliott holds at 18 cents on the dollar.  Should Elliott succeed in its offer for Energy Future its unsecured debt would have a recovery of 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the matter. Elliott holds $2.9 billion of Energy Future's secured and unsecured debt, enough to try to block the reorganization plan with Berkshire, the people said.  Elliott built up most of its position in Energy Future's debt after Texas regulators rejected NextEra's offer earlier this year, causing bond prices to crash, the sources said. The hedge fund would break even on its debt investment if the Berkshire bid prevails because gains in some parts of its debt holdings, which would be paid out in full, would offset losses in the unsecured bonds it holds, where it would take a deep haircut, the people said. Elliott, known for its aggressive tactics including a 12-year battle over sovereign debt in Argentina, also may pursue litigation to block the deal, the sources said.  Elliott said in the letter it would support a deal with Berkshire or a third party if those bids exceeded the value proposed by the hedge fund.  We fear that the Berkshire transaction does not provide such value,  the hedge fund said in the letter.

Courts have previously denied Connie Yates and Chris Gard the right to send their 11-month-old son Charlie Gard to the United States on the grounds it would prolong his suffering without any realistic prospect of it helping. Charlie Gard suffers from a form of mitochondrial disease, a rare genetic condition causing progressive muscle weakness and brain damage.

The dollar rose after the Bank of Japan last week offered to buy an unlimited amount of bonds and following an unexpected drop in May in Japanese machinery orders that pressured the yen. Stocks on Wall Street edged higher as gains in technology outweighed losses in consumer staples and healthcare. Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN.O), lifted by the one-day sale event for subscribers to its Amazon Prime service, contributed the most points to the benchmark S&P; 500. Amazon rose 1.8 percent to $996.47.

The data is likely to add to concerns that consumer demand has slowed further after a weak first quarter, as the effect of the fall in the pound after last year's vote to leave the European Union increasingly makes itself felt. Payments company Barclaycard said year-on-year consumer spending growth slowed to a 15-month low of 2.5 percent in June from 2.8 percent in May, as spending on household goods and entertainment slowed. The British Retail Consortium said its measure of retail spending growth rose to 2.0 percent last month from 0.2 percent in May, above its average of 1.4 percent in the past six months. But the BRC's chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the pick-up reflected a temporary boost from warmer weather lifting clothing sales, as well as the higher cost of food.  Rising food prices are responsible for the main component of growth and have prompted more cautious spending towards discretionary non-food items,  she said. On a like-for-like basis, which strips out changes in store size, the BRC said sales increased by 1.4 percent year-on-yaer after a 0.4 percent drop in May. The Barclaycard and BRC figures are not adjusted for inflation, which is running at a near four-year high of 2.9 percent according to the consumer prices index.  As a result, consumer spending's contribution to second-quarter economic growth - which is adjusted for inflation - may be limited. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said that the extent to which consumer spending slows - and whether stronger exports and investment can compensate for this - will be important in determining if the BoE starts to raise rates. Three policymakers voted last month for a rate rise, and both Carney and his chief economist Andy Haldane have said they could vote for a rate rise later this year. But weakening business surveys over the past week have made many economists doubt the BoE will press ahead with its first rate rise in a decade at a time when the shape of Britain's Brexit deal is highly uncertain. Barclaycard said its data showed shoppers were increasingly going to discount supermarkets and looking for bargains online as they  come to terms with a 'new normal' of subdued wage growth and creeping inflation . Spending on necessities had outpaced non-essentials for most of this year, in contrast to previous years. The BRC said sales of clothing, beauty products  and outdoor toys were strong last month - reflecting warm weather and the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr. But spending on home furnishings dropped, possibly reflecting a slowing housing market.

Optimism in the financial services sector - Britain's biggest source of tax revenue - has now declined in five out of the last six quarters.

In releasing the rule, which goes into full effect in eight months, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fired the first shot in a likely brutal political battle between Republicans and Democrats over regulators' reach into banks' workings and customer rights. Banks blasted the rule, which bars financial firms from forcing customers to agree to settle disputes only through arbitration as a condition of opening new accounts, but consumer advocates said it will make sure wronged customers have their day in court.  Mandatory arbitration  clauses that block customers from filing or joining a class-action lawsuit appear in contracts for a wide variety of products. The rule was proposed last year under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat who appointed the current director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray. Republicans now control both Congress and the White House, and are already looking into stopping it in its tracks. Just before the CFPB unveiled the final rule, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika wrote Cordray to raise  safety and soundness  concerns with a draft version he had read and asked the CFPB to share data it used in crafting the rule, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters.  The CFPB did not share the final rule with him ahead of the announcement, according to an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency spokesman. In the letter, Noreika, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, cited a section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that allows his office to set aside possibly unsafe CFPB rules. Eliminating mandatory arbitration  could result in less effective consumer protection and remedies, while simply enriching class-action lawyers,  he wrote, adding the rule  may potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers, while increasing their costs.  In the final rule, the bureau requires financial companies to give customers the option of arbitration or of banding together to sue in class actions. Companies must also provide redacted records of claims and awards reached through arbitration, which the CFPB will post on its website beginning in July 2019. Rule critics say class actions are costly, suck up time and result in lower awards for consumers. In recent months, they have worked to undo regulations barring the fine print from contracts for nursing-homes and for-profit colleges.

Twelve years after first getting the better of Nadal on the All England Club lawns -- since when his career has trundled along in unspectacular fashion -- 16th seed Muller stood firm in 135-minute fifth set of interminable tension. Nine times in that heart-pounding decider, 31-year-old French Open champion Nadal served to stay alive. Men of lesser resolve than the 34-year-old Muller would have cracked -- but the left-handed serve-and-volleyer was relentless in pursuit of victory and it was 15-times grand slam champion Nadal who succumbed when asked to walk the tightrope for the 10th time at 13-14. A miss-hit forehand gave Muller two more match points and this time there was no escape for Nadal as another error off his trusty weapon ballooned over the baseline. Muller stood motionless for a few seconds, taking in the enormity of his victory as the Court One crowd which has spent the past two hours on the edge of their seats, rose as one. There was little doubt he deserved the ovation. He outplayed Nadal in the opening two sets and then, after weathering a ferocious fightback, made the running in the fifth when his baseline craft matched Nadal's.

I'm just glad it's over,  Muller, who was cheered on from the stands by Prince Felix of Luxembourg, said. Big Battle  I did really well in the first two sets, then Rafa stepped it up. It was a big battle. When I had the last two match points, I thought I just had to give it a shot.  Somehow in the end I made it.  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 10, 2017   Spain’s Rafael Nadal reacts during his fourth round match against Luxembourg’s Gilles MullerMatthew ChildsNadal has now failed to get past the fourth round since losing the 2011 final to Novak Djokovic, whose match against Adrian Mannarino was postponed to Tuesday because of the late-running drama taking place on Court One. Since then Nadal has lost to the likes of Lukas Rosol, Steve Darcis and Nick Kyrgios but this year, having claimed a 10th French Open, the Spaniard arrived at Wimbledon in peak form and fitness and looked a good bet for the title. Had he pulled this match out of the fire who knows where it would have taken Nadal. The crowd, despite loving an under-dog at Wimbledon, were firmly in his corner but even with their vocal backing he gave himself too much to do.  I think I didn't play my best the first two sets, then I was always playing against the scoreboard. And that's so difficult against a player like him,  Nadal told reporters. Slideshow (6 Images) So well done to him. He played well. Especially in the fifth, he played a great game.  It was a great atmosphere. I put everything on the court. I played with all my passion.  Muller, one of the few players on the tour who is happy to come to the net, harassed Nadal from the start and took the first set with a single break of serve in the sixth game. Nadal made a mess of an attempted dropshot to give Muller a break at 4-4 in the second set and the man from Luxembourg moved two sets ahead when Nadal netted a backhand. When Nadal broke early in the third though it signaled a shift in momentum that took the match to a deciding set in which logic suggested the Spaniard would dominate. Muller had other ideas. Nadal was forced to save two match points, one with an ace, at 4-5, then two more again at 9-10, the first with a steadfast volley after moving Muller around the court. Muller came under fire at 6-6, saving a break point, and fought off four break points in an absorbing 18th game. After 32 holds of serve something had to give and surprisingly it was Nadal.

One of the many men who travel the world, playing in the less noticed tournaments, picking up the more modest appearance fees, Muller's record and age suggested he would end his career as barely a footnote in the annals of the sport. His second round appearance at the All England Club last year was barely noticed, understandably for a player who had made the last eight at a grand slam event just once in his career - at the U.S. Open in 2008. On Monday though, the left-hander produced one of the most memorable upsets in the history of Wimbledon -- beating 15-times grand slam winner Rafa Nadal in an astonishing 6-3 6-4 3-6 4-6 15-13 battle that lasted four hours and 48 minutes. Muller puts his delayed emergence down to a 2013 elbow injury that, almost threatened his career, kept him off the courts and let him work on fitness and other aspects of his game.  This is definitely the biggest victory since then, since I came back, especially at that stage of a grand slam, playing one of the guys who is dominating the tennis this year again. Definitely the biggest win,  he said.  Since 2014 when I came back, I'm able to play full seasons without any breaks during the season. I have a lot of confidence in my body now, which I didn't have before.   All this is changing a lot for me. For sure that has been the key for me in the last few years, to be that successful.  While viewed as a grasscourt specialist, he can be an awkward opponent with his fondness for old-school serve-and-volley play.  Although he had beaten Nadal 12 years ago at Wimbledon, few gave him a chance on Monday against the fourth seed and French Open champion. But Muller has risen up the rankings this year, capturing his first two titles on the tour, in Sydney earlier this year and then on grass at Den Bosch in the lead up to Wimbledon.  He is ranked 26th in the world but his comfort on grass earned him a 16th seed at Wimbledon -- a placing that he has more than justified. Cool to the point of being emotionless, Muller coped with giving up a two-set lead to the Spaniard and then continued, unruffled, through the marathon two hours 15 minutes final set before finally sealing victory. Muller had been unable to take advantage of four match points prior to the decisive game and when he finally clinched victory, the calmness he had shown throughout the match remained.  A lot of relief. I had those match points before. I mean, the noise the crowd made every time he saved a match point was just massive,  he said.   So at that moment ... in my head I was thinking, 'We have to finish this now or otherwise we're going to come back tomorrow'. I knew it was going to be maybe another 10, 15 more minutes maximum.  Just a lot of relief to finally get it done.  Next up for Muller is seventh-seeded Croatian Marin Cilic, who beat him on grass last month in the semi-finals at Queen's Club.  It's going to be a tough match, for sure,  said Muller. Maybe but after Monday's magnificent heroics, who would bet against the man from Schifflange, population 9,332, producing another upset?

In releasing the rule, which goes into full effect in eight months, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fired the first shot in a likely brutal political battle between Republicans and Democrats over regulators' reach into banks' workings and customer rights. Banks blasted the rule, which bars financial firms from forcing customers to agree to settle disputes only through arbitration as a condition of opening new accounts, but consumer advocates said it will make sure wronged customers have their day in court.  Mandatory arbitration  clauses that block customers from filing or joining a class-action lawsuit appear in contracts for a wide variety of products. The rule was proposed last year under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat who appointed the current director of the CFPB, Richard Cordray. Republicans now control both Congress and the White House, and are already looking into stopping it in its tracks. Just before the CFPB unveiled the final rule, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika wrote Cordray to raise  safety and soundness  concerns with a draft version he had read and asked the CFPB to share data it used in crafting the rule, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters.  The CFPB did not share the final rule with him ahead of the announcement, according to an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency spokesman. In the letter, Noreika, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, cited a section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that allows his office to set aside possibly unsafe CFPB rules. Eliminating mandatory arbitration  could result in less effective consumer protection and remedies, while simply enriching class-action lawyers,  he wrote, adding the rule  may potentially decrease the products and services offered to consumers, while increasing their costs.  In the final rule, the bureau requires financial companies to give customers the option of arbitration or of banding together to sue in class actions. Companies must also provide redacted records of claims and awards reached through arbitration, which the CFPB will post on its website beginning in July 2019. Rule critics say class actions are costly, suck up time and result in lower awards for consumers.

Wolf had 10 days from June 30th to either sign or veto the legislation. He chose to let it become law automatically at midnight without his signature. The legislature approved the spending part of the budget June 30th, beating a July 1 deadline by just hours. However, Republicans, who dominate both houses of the legislature, were unable to agree on a way to close the budget gap.  In the coming days, it is my hope that the General Assembly will come together to pass a responsible solution to balance our books,” Wolf, a Democrat said in a statement. “There are many options available to balance the budget in the long-term.” The fiscal 2018 budget is about $450 million larger than last year. The budget shortfall is due in large part to revenue collections this fiscal year which were $1.6 billion below expectations. In order to close the gap, the state is considering borrowing $1 billion, to be repaid with money U.S. states still receive every year from their 1998 legal settlement with tobacco companies for health expenses. Republicans have also discussed a wide expansion in casino gambling, and discussed but rejected placing as many as 40,000 video gambling devices around the state. Democrats want a severance tax on oil and gas production that would feed the general fund. That idea has failed to pass in previous years.  Every year our Commonwealth borrows money and uses accounting gimmicks to meet our obligations, digging us deeper and deeper into a hole,” said Democratic Senator Daylin Leach.

The findings, published in The Lancet medical journal on Tuesday, mark the first time an immunization has shown any protection against gonorrhea and point to new avenues in the search for a gonorrhea vaccine, scientists said.  This new research could be game-changing,  said Linda Glennie, an expert at the Meningitis Research Foundation who was not directly involved in the study. Gonorrhea has become an increasingly urgent global health problem in recent years as strains of the bacterial infection have developed high levels of drug resistance. The World Health Organization warned last week that some totally drug-resistance superbug strains of the disease already pose a major threat. Yet so far, efforts to develop a gonorrhea vaccine have yielded disappointing results: Four potential shots have reached the clinical trial stage, but none has been effective.  In New Zealand, around 1 million people under age 20 received a meningitis vaccine known as MeNZB during a 2004-2006 immunization program. This provided a valuable opportunity to test for cross-protection, the scientists explained. For their study, the team used data from 11 sexual health clinics for all people aged 15 to 30 who had been diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia, or both, and who had also been eligible to be immunized against meningitis in the 2004-2006 campaign. They found that those who had been vaccinated were significantly less likely to have gonorrhea. And taking into account factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, geographical area and gender, having the MeNZB vaccine reduced the incidence of gonorrhea by around 31 percent. Helen Petousis-Harris, who co-led the study at the University of Auckland, said the findings  provide experimental evidence and a proof of principle  that meningitis vaccines might offer moderate cross-protection against gonorrhea.  Our findings could inform future vaccine development for both the meningococcal and gonorrhea vaccines,  she said. Despite the diseases being very different in symptoms and transmission modes, she added, the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis have an up to 90 percent genetic match, providing a biologically plausible mechanism.

It followed strong Irish economic data and signs that support in next-door Britain for a hard exit from the European Union may have weakened. Ireland's economy has been the best performing in Europe for the last three years, dramatically cutting unemployment, but households have complained the wealth has not trickled down and Brexit -- to which Ireland is particularly vulnerable -- has hit confidence about the country's future. The KBC Bank Ireland/ESRI Consumer Sentiment Index surged to 105.0 in June from 100.5 in May, its highest level since February last year, though well below the 15-year high of 108.6 posted in January 2016. The survey showed 52 percent of consumers expect the Irish economy to strengthen in the year ahead, the first time a majority of consumers have expressed this opinion since the British referendum last year. KBC chief economist Austin Hughes described the surge in the main index as  slightly surprising .  The scale of the improvement ... may reflect relief that the threat of a hard Brexit is seen as reduced because of the outcome of the recent UK election as well as reassurance from the continued strength of recent Irish economic indicators,  Hughes said. Britain's election in June deprived Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May of a majority in Britain's parliament, making it harder for her to get legislation through, including on Brexit. Irish unemployment fell to 6.3 percent in June, down from 15 percent five years ago, while the government collected 4 percent more tax in the first half of the year than in the same period last year. The election last month of Ireland's youngest ever prime minister, Leo Varadkar, could also have had an impact on sentiment, the survey's authors said. But while confidence around the wider economy is high, only 28 percent of consumers feel their own financial circumstances will improve in the coming year.  This hints at a potentially troublesome disconnect between the perceptions of consumers and recent warnings about an overheating Irish economy,  Hughes said.

The data is likely to add to concerns that consumer demand has slowed further after a weak first quarter, as the effect of the fall in the pound after last year's vote to leave the European Union increasingly makes itself felt. Payments company Barclaycard said year-on-year consumer spending growth slowed to a 15-month low of 2.5 percent in June from 2.8 percent in May, as spending on household goods and entertainment slowed. The British Retail Consortium said its measure of retail spending growth rose to 2.0 percent last month from 0.2 percent in May, above its average of 1.4 percent in the past six months. But the BRC's chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the pick-up reflected a temporary boost from warmer weather lifting clothing sales, as well as the higher cost of food.  Rising food prices are responsible for the main component of growth and have prompted more cautious spending towards discretionary non-food items,  she said. On a like-for-like basis, which strips out changes in store size, the BRC said sales increased by 1.4 percent year-on-yaer after a 0.4 percent drop in May. The Barclaycard and BRC figures are not adjusted for inflation, which is running at a near four-year high of 2.9 percent according to the consumer prices index.  As a result, consumer spending's contribution to second-quarter economic growth - which is adjusted for inflation - may be limited. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said that the extent to which consumer spending slows - and whether stronger exports and investment can compensate for this - will be important in determining if the BoE starts to raise rates. Three policymakers voted last month for a rate rise, and both Carney and his chief economist Andy Haldane have said they could vote for a rate rise later this year. But weakening business surveys over the past week have made many economists doubt the BoE will press ahead with its first rate rise in a decade at a time when the shape of Britain's Brexit deal is highly uncertain. Barclaycard said its data showed shoppers were increasingly going to discount supermarkets and looking for bargains online as they  come to terms with a 'new normal' of subdued wage growth and creeping inflation . Spending on necessities had outpaced non-essentials for most of this year, in contrast to previous years. The BRC said sales of clothing, beauty products  and outdoor toys were strong last month - reflecting warm weather and the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr. But spending on home furnishings dropped, possibly reflecting a slowing housing market.

It added, however, that government should avoid adding to regulations Last year, Prime Minister Theresa May set up a review into modern employment practices after an outcry over the increasing use of zero-hour contracts and the rising number of self-employed people working for apps in fast-growing sectors such as takeaway delivery and taxi services. May will use the publication of the report as a chance to relaunch her leadership and appeal for opposition lawmakers to back her domestic reforms after a botched election cost her party its majority in parliament.  While avoiding overbearing regulation, we will make sure people have the rights and protections they need,  May will say. Companies say the burgeoning  gig economy , in which people can work simultaneously for different employers without fixed contracts, gives greater flexibility to both them and their staff. Such practices have been criticised as exploitative by unions, however. Last year, judges sided with two self-employed drivers at Uber, who had argued that they deserve workers' rights such as the minimum wage, in a move which would add to the San Francisco-based firm's costs, prompting it to appeal. In Britain, the self-employed have no entitlement to employment rights beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination laws. Regular workers, by contrast, receive entitlements such as annual leave, rest breaks and the minimum wage. The report suggested an employment category be created known as  dependent contractors  with an eye on those working for platforms such as apps.  We need to provide additional protections for this group and stronger incentives for firms to treat them fairly,  according to the report, compiled for the government by Chief Executive of The Royal Society of Arts Matthew Taylor.  The best way to achieve better work is not national regulation but responsible corporate governance, good management and strong employment relations within the organisation.  Firms will also be made to prove that a person working for them is able to earn at least 1.2 times the national living wage, which stands at 7.50 pounds  ($9.65) an hour for the over-25s, the BBC reported on Monday.

The findings, published in The Lancet medical journal on Tuesday, mark the first time an immunization has shown any protection against gonorrhea and point to new avenues in the search for a gonorrhea vaccine, scientists said.  This new research could be game-changing,  said Linda Glennie, an expert at the Meningitis Research Foundation who was not directly involved in the study. Gonorrhea has become an increasingly urgent global health problem in recent years as strains of the bacterial infection have developed high levels of drug resistance. The World Health Organization warned last week that some totally drug-resistance superbug strains of the disease already pose a major threat. Yet so far, efforts to develop a gonorrhea vaccine have yielded disappointing results: Four potential shots have reached the clinical trial stage, but none has been effective.  In New Zealand, around 1 million people under age 20 received a meningitis vaccine known as MeNZB during a 2004-2006 immunization program. This provided a valuable opportunity to test for cross-protection, the scientists explained. For their study, the team used data from 11 sexual health clinics for all people aged 15 to 30 who had been diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia, or both, and who had also been eligible to be immunized against meningitis in the 2004-2006 campaign. They found that those who had been vaccinated were significantly less likely to have gonorrhea. And taking into account factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, geographical area and gender, having the MeNZB vaccine reduced the incidence of gonorrhea by around 31 percent. Helen Petousis-Harris, who co-led the study at the University of Auckland, said the findings  provide experimental evidence and a proof of principle  that meningitis vaccines might offer moderate cross-protection against gonorrhea.  Our findings could inform future vaccine development for both the meningococcal and gonorrhea vaccines,  she said. Despite the diseases being very different in symptoms and transmission modes, she added, the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis have an up to 90 percent genetic match, providing a biologically plausible mechanism.

Wolf had 10 days from June 30th to either sign or veto the legislation. He chose to let it become law automatically at midnight without his signature. The legislature approved the spending part of the budget June 30th, beating a July 1 deadline by just hours. However, Republicans, who dominate both houses of the legislature, were unable to agree on a way to close the budget gap.  In the coming days, it is my hope that the General Assembly will come together to pass a responsible solution to balance our books,” Wolf, a Democrat said in a statement. “There are many options available to balance the budget in the long-term.” The fiscal 2018 budget is about $450 million larger than last year. The budget shortfall is due in large part to revenue collections this fiscal year which were $1.6 billion below expectations. In order to close the gap, the state is considering borrowing $1 billion, to be repaid with money U.S. states still receive every year from their 1998 legal settlement with tobacco companies for health expenses. Republicans have also discussed a wide expansion in casino gambling, and discussed but rejected placing as many as 40,000 video gambling devices around the state.

Peru said construction of the concrete wall, part of an urban revival project, violates a peace treaty signed by both countries because it comes too close to a canal in populated areas along the Zarumilla River, which forms part of the border for the two countries. Ecuador said it lamented Peru's decision to recall its ambassador and said Peru had not responded to its request last week to discuss the dispute in a high-level meeting.  Ecuador believes that dialogue is the valid mechanism to overcome any divergence between sister countries, and therefore reiterates its willingness and openness to address these issues immediately,  the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement. The dispute marks a rough start to bilateral relations between Ecuador and Peru under centrist Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Ecuador's socialist President Lenin Moreno, both of whom took office in the past year.

Slideshow (2 Images)Ecuador has said the wall would help control flooding that affects border towns every year but Peru said it could disrupt the flow of water in the canal and raise flood risks for Peruvians. Peru had extreme flooding earlier this year after a sudden warming of Pacific waters off its coast triggered some of the nation's heaviest rains in decades. More than 150 people died and reconstruction efforts could cost up to $9 billion, according to the government. Peru also has said the wall would hurt efforts to remove bureaucratic barriers at the border.

Some, noting the sunny weather, even enjoyed being diverted onto a free, specially arranged ferry across the Hudson River.  The three railroads that carry tens of thousands of people each day to and from Pennsylvania Station in midtown Manhattan have canceled some trains and rerouted others for the eight weeks the work on the tracks is expected to take. Some riders from New Jersey complained about lengthened commutes, while noting they were already used to delays after a string of derailments and stalled trains at the station this year that the repairs are intended to remedy. Many riders and transit officials attributed the relatively smooth start to a successful public awareness campaign, including numerous station attendants who answered questions, handed out pamphlets and herded disoriented passengers.

This way to the 39th Street ferry!  shouted another. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had predicted a  summer of hell  for commuters as the repairs continued through to Sept. 1. Bill McLeer, who works in data analysis and was waiting in an unusually subdued Penn Station for a train home to Mount Laurel in New Jersey, called the governor's warning  completely overblown.  And some commuters relished a free ride on a ferry that normally costs $9.

Isn't this relaxing?    Another ferry rider, Kathleen Lynn, was less rhapsodic.  It's going to add 20 minutes,  said Lynn, a Summit, New Jersey, resident who works in financial services.  Or an hour. Depends on whether everything hooks up.  Penn Station, an underground maze of low ceilings and mediocre dining spots built in the 1960s, serves about 95,000 New Jersey Transit customers and about 116,000 Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) customers on an average weekday, according to 2016 data. Slideshow (19 Images)Amtrak, the national passenger rail corporation and the station's owner, says an average of 28,000 rides a day on its intercity services begin or end in Penn Station. The commuter crunch highlights lagging investment in U.S. infrastructure, and especially in New York City, which is dependent on mass transit.  Even so, Amtrak reported most of its trains ran on time or close to it, and the Penn Station departures board showed no delays during the evening rush.  We've had a good commute this morning,  Amtrak's president, Charles  Wick  Moorman, said in an interview.  It's the first morning of a long process, but right now we feel good.  Joe Lhota, who oversees the LIRR as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's chairman, praised riders, saying  they did everything perfect today.   Tomorrow is another day, we start afresh,  he told reporters during the evening rush.  We're expecting thunderstorms in the morning.

The fighting began on Sunday when armed groups opposed to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli tried to approach the capital and met resistance from rival groups that have aligned themselves with the government. It is the latest in a series of attacks by armed opponents of the Government of National Accord (GNA), which have continued despite the GNA's attempts to win the cooperation of militias operating in the city and to calm bouts of violence inside or close to the capital.  At the moment we can hear heavy gunfire,  said Al-Shareef Jaballah, a spokesman for the municipality of Garabulli, about 50 km (30 miles) from Tripoli, speaking to Reuters by telephone shortly after midday.  The clashes have resulted in severe damage to houses and shops because of indiscriminate shelling, and forced a large number of residents ... to flee,  he said.  The coastal road is still closed. The residents who have fled their homes are trapped because of the closure of the road.  The health ministry later confirmed that at least four people including two foreign workers had been killed and 21 wounded over two days of fighting. The GNA has struggled to impose its authority since arriving in Tripoli in March last year. It has been rejected by factions that control eastern Libya, where military commander Khalifa Haftar has been consolidating his position and installing military-appointed mayors. As temperatures have climbed this month, parts of western Libya have once again been suffering from power and water cuts that residents have criticised the GNA for failing to resolve.

The 31-year-old Spaniard had rolled back the years in reaching the fourth round and seemed in the mood, and form, for a serious title assault at the All England Club just weeks after winning the French Open for a 10th time. But left-handed Luxembourger Muller, seeded 16th, had other ideas though and edged an epic fifth-set 15-13 after Nadal had staved off four match points in a thrilling climax. Magnanimous as ever, 15-times grand slam champion Nadal made no excuses, admitting Muller was the better player, but said he had wasted a golden opportunity to go all the way.  I had my chances, and he had some mistakes, but not enough,  Nadal, who returned to form at the start of the year when reaching the Australian Open final, told reporters.

That's what happened.  It's not the result that I was expecting. I played better than other years, true. At the same time I was ready for important things, so I lost an opportunity.  Until Monday, Nadal had not lost a set in grand slam play since losing January's Melbourne Park final to Roger Federer.  However, this was not to be his day. He thumped his head on a ceiling while limbering up in a corridor before the start of play, appeared to turn his ankle slightly in the third set and was blinded by the sinking sun glinting against part of the Court One structure deep in the fifth set as he desperately tried to fight Muller off. Ultimately, he paid for losing the first two sets 6-3 6-4 and while he hit back impressively to win the next two by the same margin, he was unable to complete what would have been only his fourth recovery from two sets down.  When you play against these kind of players, you cannot have mistakes with yourself. That's what I did. I did twice, in the first and in the second. That cost me two sets,  he said.

Analysts at the three major rating agencies, which rate Illinois one or two notches above junk, declined to comment on the timing of their decisions.  With the help of some Republican votes, the Democratic-controlled Illinois Legislature last Thursday overrode Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's vetoes and enacted a $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and a $5 billion income tax increase. The action ended an unprecedented two-year budget impasse that ballooned the state's unpaid bill backlog to about $15 billion. Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a Democrat, on Monday unveiled a five-step plan to avoid a junk rating that included Rauner taking steps to issue up to $6 billion of bonds the legislature authorized to begin paying off bills. He also recommended the governor visit credit rating agencies to assure them he intends to implement the budget package. A junk rating would make future bond sales more difficult and expensive. Eleni Demertzis, Rauner's spokeswoman, did not answer questions about the borrowing but underscored the governor's dissatisfaction with the budget.  Even with the tax increase, this budget remains $2 billion out of balance for fiscal year 2018,  she said.  The best thing we can do is to work collaboratively to pass truly balanced budgets that pay down our debt, reform our pension system, and make the changes necessary to drive economic growth in our state.  Moody's cited the budget's  substantial implementation risk  when the state's Baa3 rating was placed on review last week for a possible downgrade to junk. Analyst Ted Hampton said risks include revenue and cost-saving assumptions built in to the budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.  Hampton and S&P; analyst Gabriel Petek said they expected Rauner to implement the budget as required by law. John Humphrey, co-head of credit research at Gurtin Municipal Bond Management, said optimism that Illinois finally has a budget should be tempered against the state's strained finances and how much execution risk remains.  I think Moody's has been pretty clear that they view the state's political dysfunction combined with continued unaddressed long-term liabilities, and unfavorable baseline revenue performance as casting some degree of skepticism on the state's ability to manage out of the very fragile financial situation they are in,  he said.

While there are multiple avenues we would be eager to explore ... today Vintage proposes to acquire 100 percent of the common stock ... in a go-private transaction for $15 per share,  the firm's managing partner, Brian Kahn, wrote in a June 20 letter to the company's investment bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N).  The company's stock closed at $11.10 on Monday. Shares hit$40.31 in August 2013 and have steadily declined amid a sales and profit slump. Vintage Capital declined to comment on the letter or the offer. Rent-A-Center said on Monday it responded to Vintage Capital on July 5.  It said in an emailed statement to Reuters that Vintage Capital's proposal  significantly undervalues the company  and its strategic plan.  These initiatives are already delivering substantial progress in key performance metrics, including improved same-store sales and reductions in delinquencies,  Rent-A-Center said in the statement. Rent-A-Center, a $609 million company based in Plano, Texas, rents out furniture and electronics and also allows customers the ability to own the products through a lease program.  Last month, shareholders ousted three of Rent-A-Center's board directors after a campaign by activist hedge fund Engaged Capital for major changes ended in a full-blown proxy fight. Three of Engaged Capital's nominees replaced the company's directors as a result. Engaged publicly pressed the board to agree to explore the potential sale of the company, among other demands. The hedge fund now holds a 16.9 percent stake in Rent-A-Center, filings show. Fellow activist Marcato Capital Management held just under 1 percent of the stock as of last quarter, Thomson Reuters filings show. Vintage Capital is the majority owner of Buddy's Home Furnishings, a privately run rent-to-own (RTO) peer of Rent-A-Center. Vintage Capital tried to buy fellow RTO company Aaron's Inc (AAN.N) in February 2014 for $2.3 billion, a bid Vintage dropped two months later after the company resisted.

The 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's personal lawyer also represented the local agent of the German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems set to build the vessels. The six, who were questioned under caution on suspicion of bribery, fraud and tax offences, include public officials and private citizens, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. No further details were immediately available. German authorities also are looking into the deal. In June, German magazine Der Spiegel reported Germany's national security council had approved the sale of the three nuclear-capable submarines to Israel and that authorities inserted a clause into the contract giving it the right to void it if corruption allegations were proven. The Justice Ministry said in February that Netanyahu himself was not a suspect in the investigation into the 2016 contract for ThyssenKrupp to build three submarines and a 2015 agreement with the company to purchase four patrol vessels for Israel's navy. Israeli Channel 10 reported last year that ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems' Israeli intermediary had retained Netanyahu's personal lawyer, David Shimron, to act on his behalf.  Shimron has denied any wrongdoing and has said he never discussed the deal with the prime minister so as to avoid any conflict of interest. Netanyahu has given his full backing to his lawyer, who is a distant relative. Netanyahu is under investigation in two other criminal cases and denies any wrongdoing in both. One case involves gifts from businessmen and the other focuses on discussions Netanyahu held with a newspaper publisher on more favorable media coverage in return for curbs on competition from a rival newspaper.

Analysts at the three major rating agencies, which rate Illinois one or two notches above junk, declined to comment on the timing of their decisions.  With the help of some Republican votes, the Democratic-controlled Illinois Legislature last Thursday overrode Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's vetoes and enacted a $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and a $5 billion income tax increase. The action ended an unprecedented two-year budget impasse that ballooned the state's unpaid bill backlog to about $15 billion. Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a Democrat, on Monday unveiled a five-step plan to avoid a junk rating that included Rauner taking steps to issue up to $6 billion of bonds the legislature authorized to begin paying off bills. He also recommended the governor visit credit rating agencies to assure them he intends to implement the budget package. A junk rating would make future bond sales more difficult and expensive. Eleni Demertzis, Rauner's spokeswoman, did not answer questions about the borrowing but underscored the governor's dissatisfaction with the budget.  Even with the tax increase, this budget remains $2 billion out of balance for fiscal year 2018,  she said.  The best thing we can do is to work collaboratively to pass truly balanced budgets that pay down our debt, reform our pension system, and make the changes necessary to drive economic growth in our state.  Moody's cited the budget's  substantial implementation risk  when the state's Baa3 rating was placed on review last week for a possible downgrade to junk. Analyst Ted Hampton said risks include revenue and cost-saving assumptions built in to the budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.  Hampton and S&P; analyst Gabriel Petek said they expected Rauner to implement the budget as required by law. John Humphrey, co-head of credit research at Gurtin Municipal Bond Management, said optimism that Illinois finally has a budget should be tempered against the state's strained finances and how much execution risk remains.  I think Moody's has been pretty clear that they view the state's political dysfunction combined with continued unaddressed long-term liabilities, and unfavorable baseline revenue performance as casting some degree of skepticism on the state's ability to manage out of the very fragile financial situation they are in,  he said.

In an email, the panel's designated officer, Andrew Kossack, asked state elections officers to  hold on submitting any data,  the commission said in court filings.  Several state elections officials confirmed receiving a letter from the panel stating that it would provide further instructions after a federal judge had ruled on a complaint filed by a watchdog group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is seeking a temporary restraining order. Earlier on Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, alleging violations of federal law requiring transparent government. The bipartisan panel, led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, asked the 50 U.S. states for a host of voter data, including birth dates and the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers.  Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance, which many called unnecessary and a violation of privacy.  “This has been a misadventure from the get-go,  Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, who had refused to give the commission any data, said by phone. In Wisconsin, elections officials halted plans to inform the commission how it could purchase for $12,500 its public voter data, not including Social Security numbers or birth dates.   We're just putting everything on hold,  said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Arkansas, however, had already sent in a limited batch of publicly available data, according to the office of Secretary of State Mark Martin, In a court document, the government said it would not download the information from Arkansas and would instead delete it. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.         The commission last week said it would meet on July 19 in Washington near the White House. On Monday, critics cheered the move and expressed hope the commission would permanently abandon efforts to collect voter data.  The commission has effectively conceded,  EPIC President Marc Rotenberg said by phone. State officials from both parties and election experts widely agree that voter fraud is rare. Civil rights groups called the commission a voter suppression tactic by Trump.  The Republican president created the panel in May following his claim, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.

Schuyler Marshall, chairman of the board of the real estate company Rosewood Corp, said under cross-examination by Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, that he was not claiming Shkreli was autistic.  The reference here was that this was just an intensely focused, bright guy who knew his stuff,  Marshall told jurors. Hoffman's character in the 1988 film is an autistic savant with exceptional mental abilities but difficulty relating to other people. Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety in 2015 when he raised the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent as the chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals, sparking outrage among patients and U.S. lawmakers and earning him the nickname  pharma bro.  The charges he is on trial for stem not from his time at Turing, but from his management of hedge fund MSMB Capital Management, another fund called MSMB Healthcare and drug company Retrophin between 2009 and 2014. Prosecutors say he deceived investors in the funds and eventually repaid them with money stolen from Retrophin, which Shkreli founded in 2011 but was ousted from as CEO in 2014. Marshall's testimony fit into the picture that Brafman painted in his fiery opening argument of Shkreli as a socially awkward  nerd  who was bullied and manipulated by others. Like other investors who have testified in the trial, Marshall, who invested more than $200,000 in MSMB Capital, said that while Shkreli misled him about the fund's operations, he did not lose money. At one point, Marshall testified, he even used the phrase  no harm, no foul  in a communication with Shkreli.  He paid back my investment and then some,  Marshall said. The trial, now in its seventh day, is expected to last up to six weeks.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-shkreli-idUSL1N1K11OD"},

The small ex-Yugoslav republic has seen a sharp rise in asylum applications after around half a million migrants and refugees crossed its territory in 2015 and 2016 en route for wealthier western Europe via the Balkan route from Turkey. Most migrants at that time did not stay in Slovenia but as border controls across the region have tightened, more have decided to seek aslyum in EU member Slovenia, one of the more prosperous nations of southeastern Europe.  (Slovenia) is becoming a country of destination for asylum seekers, and the authorities should improve the quality of the services available to them, including by shortening the length of asylum procedures,  said Nils Muiznieks, the human rights commissioner of the Council of Europe, in a report on Slovenia. Slovenian interior ministry data show an asylum procedure usually lasts about seven months but can take more than a year. Last year Slovenia received 1,308 asylum requests, up from 277 in 2015. It granted asylum to 170 of those people, up from 46 in 2015, the data showed. Slovenia has faced public pressure like neighboring countries such as Hungary and Austria to tighten border restrictions. In January, its parliament passed legislation which would allow authorities to close the borders to migrants whenever lawmakers believe this is needed for national security. The law has not yet been invoked. Muiznieks also urged Slovenia to provide language courses and swifter access to the labor market to migrants and asylum seekers to help facilitate their social integration. In the report he also said Slovenia should ease up on austerity measures imposed after the global financial crisis, saying the number of poor people had jumped since 2008.

Peru said construction of the concrete wall, part of an urban revival project, violates a peace treaty signed by both countries because it comes too close to a canal in populated areas along the Zarumilla River, which forms part of the border for the two countries. Ecuador said it lamented Peru's decision to recall its ambassador and said Peru had not responded to its request last week to discuss the dispute in a high-level meeting.  Ecuador believes that dialogue is the valid mechanism to overcome any divergence between sister countries, and therefore reiterates its willingness and openness to address these issues immediately,  the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement. The dispute marks a rough start to bilateral relations between Ecuador and Peru under centrist Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Ecuador's socialist President Lenin Moreno, both of whom took office in the past year. FILE PHOTO: Ecuadorean workers build a wall along the border between Peru and Ecuador in Aguas Verdes, Peru, June 8, 2017.Nestor Quinones/File PhotoThe dispute underscores both countries' sensitivity to the kind of heavy flooding in the border region that could become more extreme with climate change. Slideshow (2 Images)Ecuador has said the wall would help control flooding that affects border towns every year but Peru said it could disrupt the flow of water in the canal and raise flood risks for Peruvians. Peru had extreme flooding earlier this year after a sudden warming of Pacific waters off its coast triggered some of the nation's heaviest rains in decades. More than 150 people died and reconstruction efforts could cost up to $9 billion, according to the government. Peru also has said the wall would hurt efforts to remove bureaucratic barriers at the border.

Part of my job has always been one not far from that of a lay-Historian, to understand that I am a part of the documenting of the human condition and the American idea, even in the silliest of stories,  he added in the statement.  Hanks has appeared in numerous films based on historical events and figures, including the World War Two drama  Saving Private Ryan  and crime thriller  Catch Me If You Can,  based on the true story of fraudster Frank Abagnale.

He was also an executive producer and co-writer/director on the 2001 World War Two television miniseries  Band of Brothers.    He's served in World War II (in both the European and Pacific Theaters), negotiated for the U.S. in the Cold War, fought in Vietnam, worked in Congress, and led the space program,  said David Ferriero, archivist of the United States and board member of the National Archives Foundation.  A past winner of the award is Steven Spielberg, who directed Hanks in  Saving Private Ryan,   Bridge of Spies  and the upcoming Pentagon Papers movie  The Papers.      Previous recipients also include Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Ron Chernow, Tony award-winning film and theater director Thomas Kail and Tony award-winning  Hamilton  composer, lyricist and performer Lin-Manuel Miranda.

The dollar rose after the Bank of Japan last week offered to buy an unlimited amount of bonds and following an unexpected drop in May in Japanese machinery orders that pressured the yen. Stocks on Wall Street edged higher as gains in technology outweighed losses in consumer staples and healthcare. Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN.O), lifted by the one-day sale event for subscribers to its Amazon Prime service, contributed the most points to the benchmark S&P; 500. Amazon rose 1.8 percent to $996.47. Investors, especially ETF traders who like sectors, have tried in recent weeks to establish new leadership in the U.S. equity market but have returned to the technology sector, said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The biggest motivating thing in today's market, and it's certainly thin trading, is the Amazon Prime day, which has gotten people interested in Amazon again,  Meckler said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 5.82 points, or 0.03 percent, to end at 21,408.52, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 2.25 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,427.43 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 23.31 points, or 0.38 percent, to 6,176.39.

Greenback Gains The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was little changed at 96.053. Against the yen JPY= the dollar rose 0.13 percent, to 114.03 yen, after earlier hitting 114.29 yen, its highest since May 11. Traders work in front of the German share price index, DAX board, at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, July 3, 2017.Staff/Remote The dollar has been broadly supported over the past couple of days and is showing some mild signs of recovery after weakness in the prior week,  said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. U.S. Treasury yields slipped after rising for more than a week, in line with weakness in European bond markets. Investors consolidated positions after last week's strong U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which has kept the Federal Reserve on track toward raising interest rates at least once more this year. U.S. long-dated yields, which move inversely to prices, fell for just the second time in nine days.  This is mostly consolidation given there's not a lot of data,  said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at Societe Generale in New York. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields fell to 2.373 percent US10YT=RR, from 2.393 percent on Friday. After Friday's jobs report, U.S. 10-year yields hit an eight-week high of 2.398 percent.

Schuyler Marshall, chairman of the board of the real estate company Rosewood Corp, said under cross-examination by Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, that he was not claiming Shkreli was autistic.  The reference here was that this was just an intensely focused, bright guy who knew his stuff,  Marshall told jurors. Hoffman's character in the 1988 film is an autistic savant with exceptional mental abilities but difficulty relating to other people. Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety in 2015 when he raised the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent as the chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals, sparking outrage among patients and U.S. lawmakers and earning him the nickname  pharma bro.  Martin Shkreli, former chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals and KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc, departs with his attorney Benjamin Brafman after a hearing at U.S. Federal Court in Brooklyn, New York.Lucas JacksonThe charges he is on trial for stem not from his time at Turing, but from his management of hedge fund MSMB Capital Management, another fund called MSMB Healthcare and drug company Retrophin between 2009 and 2014. Prosecutors say he deceived investors in the funds and eventually repaid them with money stolen from Retrophin, which Shkreli founded in 2011 but was ousted from as CEO in 2014. Marshall's testimony fit into the picture that Brafman painted in his fiery opening argument of Shkreli as a socially awkward  nerd  who was bullied and manipulated by others. Like other investors who have testified in the trial, Marshall, who invested more than $200,000 in MSMB Capital, said that while Shkreli misled him about the fund's operations, he did not lose money. At one point, Marshall testified, he even used the phrase  no harm, no foul  in a communication with Shkreli.  He paid back my investment and then some,  Marshall said. The trial, now in its seventh day, is expected to last up to six weeks.

The Frenchman provided Murray with the latest test of his title credentials as well as of his injured hip, but the champion reached the last eight for the 10th straight year with some comfort.  Like Murray's previous opponents -- Alexander Bublik, Dustin Brown and Fabio Fognini -- Paire was not out of a conventional tennis mold.   His backhand was stronger than his forehand and capable of inflicting damage and there were moments in the match when Murray's chances of a third title looked questionable, especially when his serve was broken twice in the first set. Related CoverageHighlights of Wimbledon seventh dayYet while Paire was able to dish out occasional blows, hitting 50 winners and 44 unforced errors, it was Murray's weapons that were more frequently on target and carried the greater destructive power.  Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of the victory for Murray, however, would have been his movement, which seems to have improved significantly, even if he continues to hobble awkwardly between points.  Paire had begun the encounter by trying to test Murray's willingness to chase down numerous dropshots, but seeing the Scot rise time and again to the challenge, he had his own view about Murray's hip problems.  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 10, 2017   Great Britain’s Andy Murray throws his sweatbands into the crowd as he celebrates after winning the fourth round match against France’s Benoit PaireStefan Wermuth Between the points, he can do what he wants, but during the point he can run like a rabbit,  Paire told reporters. Murray was certainly slicker around the court than he had been against Fognini, when the Italian snatched a set and almost pushed the match into a decider.  Slideshow (3 Images) I'm moving well, I didn't feel like I moved that well against Fabio. But the first two matches and today, I felt like I moved really good. I certainly feel like I've been tested in that department a lot because the guys I've played against have done a lot of forward movements,  Murray said.  All in all, Murray had too much guile for Paire and wrapped up his 26th successive win against French opposition in two hours and 21 minutes, even if there were moments when he did not have everything his own way.  Paire broke Murray twice in successive games in the first set which ended up going to a tiebreak that the top seed won comfortably. The next two sets were hardly routine for Murray, but there was little doubt that he would prevail to set up a tie with 24th seed Sam Querrey, who beat Kevin Anderson.   I've done a good job so far here,  Murray said.   I mean, today was by far the best I hit the ball, the cleanest I hit the ball. I was happy about that.

The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 2.8 percent, while energy climbed nearly 1 percent. Still, the materials group has lost more than 15 percent since Feb. 10. Energy is down nearly 22 percent this year.  There is certainly no rush to reestablish positions in these sectors, but there's certainly some people dipping their toe in the water,  said Bruce Latimer, senior equity trader at Eight Capital. Fertilizer producer Potash Corp was the most influential gainer, rising 5.2 percent to C$22.13, while Agrium Inc, which is set to merge with Potash this year, advanced 5.4 percent to C$123.33. Barrick Gold Corp rose 2.8 percent to C$20.37. Gold futures rose 0.2 percent to $1,210.9 an ounce. U.S. crude oil futures settled 17 cents higher at $44.40 a barrel, but increased drilling activity in the United States and uncertainty over Libyan and Nigerian production cuts clouded the future supply outlook.

On Friday, the index posted its lowest close since November at 15,027.16. Gains for the index on Monday came as Wall Street started the week on an upbeat note, led by gains in technology stocks as investors were optimistic ahead of earnings. Nine of the TSX's 10 main groups ended higher, including a 0.1 percent gain for the financials group, which accounts for about a third of the index's weight. Home Capital Group fell 4.4 percent to C$14.47. The stock has retreated in recent sessions following news that Canada plans to ban some bundled residential mortgages to clamp down on risky lending. Consumer discretionary shares climbed 0.7 percent, with cable company Cogeco Communications Inc rising 2.9 percent to C$82.09 following news its subsidiary Atlantic Broadband would buy MetroCast's assets for about $1.4 billion, expanding its presence in the United States. Ritchie Bros Auctioneers Inc fell 7.2 percent to C$34.77 after it posted on Friday its June 2017 auction metrics, while CIBC cut its target price on the stock to $28 from $36.

The stock fell as low as $16.95 in late afternoon trading before closing at $16.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 1.1 percent. The Snapchat owner's March market debut was the hottest U.S. technology listing in years.  Earlier on Monday, Credit Suisse analysts cut their price target for Snap to $25 from $30, although they kept their  outperform  rating. The analysts said they expect Snap to be volatile in the near term as more than 700 million shares potentially come out of their lock-up period later this month. The Snapchat messaging app is popular among people under 30 who enjoy applying bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto their pictures. But many on Wall Street have been critical of Snap's high valuation and slowing user growth, and the company has warned it may never become profitable. Rival Facebook Inc's (FB.O) Instagram in May introduced face-tracking filters, adding to its existing Snapchat-like camera and messaging features. The IPO breach came in Snap's 90th trading day on the public market. The stock had previously dipped to $17 in mid-June. Snap's low on Monday was 42.4 percent below the record high of $29.44 reached in its second day of trading. Dipping below an IPO price is seen on Wall Street as a setback to be avoided by chief executives and their underwriters, but it is not uncommon for Silicon Valley companies. [nL1N1G919F] Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) slipped under its IPO price 233 days after its stock market debut while Facebook dipped below its IPO price in its second day of trading. Facebook shares have now quadrupled from their IPO price. Aside from Facebook, IPOs  have not done well if you hold them for a year or two,  said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners in Memphis, Tennessee.  It could be why more and more of these companies remain private and out of the public eye. It is easier to build a company outside of the view of the public.

The results don't necessarily mean coffee directly prevents people from dying, but researchers suggest they should at least reassure people who can't get by without their daily cup of joe.  It’s premature that people start consuming coffee to improve health outcomes,  said Alice Lichtenstein, director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston.  However, if they do so, they should probably do it without a lot of concern.   I think for some people, it’s going to put their minds at ease,  said Lichtenstein, who wasn't involved with either of the new studies. Previous research from the United States and Japan found a reduced risk of death among coffee drinkers, but little was known about whether such a link also existed in Europe, where coffee-drinking habits vary between countries. People in Denmark drink larger quantities of coffee than Italians who drink smaller and stronger drinks like espresso, for example.    For one of the new studies published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the authors examined data collected over about 16 years from 521,330 people living in 10 European countries. There were 41,693 deaths over the study period. Men who reported drinking the most coffee were about 12 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period, compared to men who didn't drink coffee. Similarly, women who drank the most coffee were about 7 percent less likely to die during that time than women who didn't drink any. Despite the people being so different from country to country, the researchers saw a consistent relationship, said co-lead author Neil Murphy, of the Inter Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France. They found coffee tied to a reduced risk of death from digestive diseases among both men and women, along with a decreased risk of death from circulatory and cerebrovascular diseases among women. Women with the biggest coffee habit, however, had an increased risk of death from ovarian cancer.  A lot more research is needed to tease apart what it is in coffee that might be having these effects,  Murphy told Reuters Health. Until more is known, he, too, said the findings at least suggest coffee isn't detrimental to people's health. A second study also looked at coffee consumption among diverse populations in the U.S.   Finding in one population doesn’t necessarily apply to others,  said V. Wendy Setiawan, of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. For their study, the researchers analyzed data on 185,855 people aged 45 to 75 years who were African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, Latino or white. Over roughly 16 years of follow up, 58,397 people died. Compared to people who drank no coffee, those who drank one cup per day were 12 percent less likely to die during follow up. People who drank two or more cups per day were 18 percent less likely to die. Setiawan also said their study can't say what is behind the link between coffee and lower risk of death.  Caffeine is the most studied compound, but we see similar patterns among people who drink decaffeinated,  she said. Lichtenstein also said it could be that people who drink coffee aren't drinking other beverages with a lot of calories like apple juice.  I always felt its one of the few things that I enjoy that doesn’t have calories,  she said. Of course, she said that doesn't apply if people add a lot of cream and sugar.

Analysts at S&P;, which rates Illinois one notch above junk at BBB-minus, and Fitch Ratings, which has the state two notches above junk at BBB, declined to comment on the timing of their decisions. A Moody's Investors Service analyst was not immediately available to comment. With the help of some Republican votes, the Democratic-controlled Illinois Legislature last Thursday overrode Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's vetoes and enacted a $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and a $5 billion income tax increase. The action ended an unprecedented two-year budget impasse that ballooned the state's unpaid bill backlog to about $15 billion. Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a Democrat, on Monday urged Rauner to immediately take steps to issue up to $6 billion of bonds the legislature authorized to begin paying off bills. He also recommended the governor visit credit rating agencies to assure them he intends to implement the budget package. A junk rating would make future bond sales more difficult and expensive. Eleni Demertzis, Rauner's spokeswoman, did not answer questions about the borrowing but underscored the governor's dissatisfaction with the budget.  Even with the tax increase, this budget remains $2 billion out of balance for fiscal year 2018,  she said.  The best thing we can do is to work collaboratively to pass truly balanced budgets that pay down our debt, reform our pension system, and make the changes necessary to drive economic growth in our state.  Moody's cited the budget's  substantial implementation risk  given its lack of broad bipartisan support when the state's Baa3 rating was placed on review last week for a possible downgrade to junk. S&P; analyst Gabriel Petek said implementation was expected given the budget for the fiscal year that began July 1 is now law. John Humphrey, co-head of credit research at Gurtin Municipal Bond Management, said optimism that Illinois finally has a budget should be tempered against the state's strained finances and how much execution risk remains.  I think Moody's has been pretty clear that they view the state's political dysfunction combined with continued unaddressed long-term liabilities, and unfavorable baseline revenue performance as casting some degree of skepticism on the state's ability to manage out of the very fragile financial situation they are in,  he said.

The stock fell as low as $16.95 in late afternoon trading before closing at $16.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 1.1 percent. The Snapchat owner's March market debut was the hottest U.S. technology listing in years.  Earlier on Monday, Credit Suisse analysts cut their price target for Snap to $25 from $30, although they kept their  outperform  rating. The analysts said they expect Snap to be volatile in the near term as more than 700 million shares potentially come out of their lock-up period later this month. The Snapchat messaging app is popular among people under 30 who enjoy applying bunny faces and vomiting rainbows onto their pictures. But many on Wall Street have been critical of Snap's high valuation and slowing user growth, and the company has warned it may never become profitable. Rival Facebook Inc's (FB.O) Instagram in May introduced face-tracking filters, adding to its existing Snapchat-like camera and messaging features. The IPO breach came in Snap's 90th trading day on the public market. The stock had previously dipped to $17 in mid-June. Snap's low on Monday was 42.4 percent below the record high of $29.44 reached in its second day of trading. Dipping below an IPO price is seen on Wall Street as a setback to be avoided by chief executives and their underwriters, but it is not uncommon for Silicon Valley companies. [nL1N1G919F] Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) slipped under its IPO price 233 days after its stock market debut while Facebook dipped below its IPO price in its second day of trading. Facebook shares have now quadrupled from their IPO price. Aside from Facebook, IPOs  have not done well if you hold them for a year or two,  said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners in Memphis, Tennessee.  It could be why more and more of these companies remain private and out of the public eye. It is easier to build a company outside of the view of the public.

At 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2888 to the greenback, or 77.59 U.S. cents, down 0.1 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2870 and C$1.2932.     After years of being warned that borrowing costs would have to rise eventually, debt-happy Canadians may be about to face a reckoning if the Bank of Canada hikes rates this week.                  Forecasters are divided on whether the central bank will raise rates on Wednesday, but data from the overnight index swaps market shows that money markets are almost fully priced for an increase, while an 80 percent chance of a second hike has been implied by December.                             We're struggling to buy into a hawkish narrative from the Bank of Canada,  said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco.      They may just only be taking back the 2015 rate cut, not necessarily moving into a full tightening cycle,  he said, adding the Canadian economy was not ready for an aggressive move, given lingering signs of a lack of business investment, concerns over inflation and uncertainty over North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations.     The U.S. dollar        climbed against a basket of major currencies, boosted by robust jobs data on Friday, although investors were wary of adding big positions before Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's testimony, also on Wednesday.                   This is a big week for evaluating how hawkish the hawks really want to be,  said Sahota.     On Friday, the loonie touched its strongest level in nearly 10 months at C$1.2860 after stronger-than-expected domestic jobs data boosted chances of a rate increase as soon as this week.     Speculators cut bearish bets on the loonie for a sixth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 39,372 contracts as of July 3 from 49,495 a week earlier.     Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield curve, with the two-year            up 2 Canadian cents to yield 1.154 percent and the 10-year             down 3 Canadian cents to yield 1.888 percent.

Schuyler Marshall, chairman of the board of the real estate company Rosewood Corp, said under cross-examination by Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, that he was not claiming Shkreli was autistic.  The reference here was that this was just an intensely focused, bright guy who knew his stuff,  Marshall told jurors. Hoffman's character in the 1988 film is an autistic savant with exceptional mental abilities but difficulty relating to other people. Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety in 2015 when he raised the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent as the chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals, sparking outrage among patients and U.S. lawmakers and earning him the nickname  pharma bro.  Martin Shkreli, former chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals and KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc, departs with his attorney Benjamin Brafman after a hearing at U.S. Federal Court in Brooklyn, New York.Lucas JacksonThe charges he is on trial for stem not from his time at Turing, but from his management of hedge fund MSMB Capital Management, another fund called MSMB Healthcare and drug company Retrophin between 2009 and 2014. Prosecutors say he deceived investors in the funds and eventually repaid them with money stolen from Retrophin, which Shkreli founded in 2011 but was ousted from as CEO in 2014. Marshall's testimony fit into the picture that Brafman painted in his fiery opening argument of Shkreli as a socially awkward  nerd  who was bullied and manipulated by others. Like other investors who have testified in the trial, Marshall, who invested more than $200,000 in MSMB Capital, said that while Shkreli misled him about the fund's operations, he did not lose money. At one point, Marshall testified, he even used the phrase  no harm, no foul  in a communication with Shkreli.  He paid back my investment and then some,  Marshall said. The trial, now in its seventh day, is expected to last up to six weeks.

Gabbai, 50, a relative newcomer to Israeli politics, last year defected to center-left Labour from the center-right Kulanu party, which is part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government. Labour and a smaller party headed by Tzipi Livni, a past foreign minister, have formed the Zionist Union, the largest opposition faction in the 120-seat Knesset with 24 seats. Elections are not due until 2019 and Netanyahu's strong position at the helm of Israeli politics appears secure, although he could be damaged by investigations in two criminal cases in which he denies wrongdoing. Avi Gabbai, the new leader of Israel's centre-left Labour party, gestures as he delivers his victory speech after winning the Labour party primary runoff, at an event in Tel Aviv, Israel July 10, 2017.Amir Cohen (Israel) needs a leadership that is capable of taking significant decisions for the good of everybody, that looks after Dimona (the working classes in the periphery) and not just after Amona (West Bank settlements),  Gabbai said in his victory speech.  Although not a lawmaker, Gabbai served as environment minister in Netanyahu's government. He quit in 2016 in protest at the sacking of defense minister Moshe Yaalon to make way for Avigdor Lieberman from a rightist coalition partner. Slideshow (3 Images)Jerusalem-born Gabbai, the son of immigrants from Morocco, does not have a seat in the current parliament and so in his victory speech he asked Isaac Herzog to stay on as opposition leader for the time being. Gabbai garnered 52.4 percent of the Labour membership vote to overcome Peretz, a previous party leader who was supported by most of its establishment. Peretz won last week's initial party vote with Gabbai second, and Herzog finishing third. Recent polls had predicted that with Herzog at the helm, the Zionist Union would fare far worse than in the 2015 elections and would fall behind Yair Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party but Gabbai's win could bolster Labour's fortunes, pundits said.

The rebels said they came under attack at dawn in a sparsely populated desert area that lies east of the pro-government controlled city of Sweida, mainly inhabited by the Druze minority. The air and ground offensive, backed by Russian air power, was waged on eight villages from Tal Asfar to Tlul al Shuhaib that had been seized at the end of March by Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels from Islamic State after the hardline militants had retreated to regroup further north.  This is the biggest attack by the regime and on the villages of eastern Sweida. They have used all types of weapons from aerial bombing to artillery and an unprecedented ground offensive,  said Mohammad Adnan, spokesman of Jaish Ahrar al Ashaer, a rebel group composed of tribal fighters operating in the border area with Jordan.  In the years when Daesh controlled these area, the army never clashed with them,  Adnan added. Related CoverageKurdish fighters say they clash with Turkish forces in northwest SyriaAdnan later said the army was able to seize at least seven villages. An army statement said they had recaptured several towns, villages and strategic hilltops in the eastern Sweida countryside. Bedouin Tribes Houses are seen near the border between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Quneitra, seen from the Syrian side of the border in Quneitra, Syria July 10, 2017.Alaa al-FaqirThe rugged area east of Sweida is mainly inhabited by Bedouin tribes who have long defied government authority. Many of them make up the main rebel groups based in the area.   The area is not part of the U.S.-Russian brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria that came into effect on Sunday in the first peace-making effort of the war by the U.S. government under President Donald Trump.  In the southwest, where the ceasefire was generally holding, rebels said the army had stopped aerial bombardments but intermittent shelling continued on rebel-held areas in Deraa city and in the Syrian Golan Heights.  We are monitoring violations by the regime in several areas using mortars and heavy artillery,  said Major Issam al Rayes, spokesman for the Southern Front coalition of Western-backed rebel groups. The Syrian army backed by Iranian-backed militias have since June stepped up their bombardment of rebel-held areas in the border city of Deraa in a bid to reach the Jordanian border.  It has also been sending reinforcements further toward the southeastern desert to prevent areas left by Islamic State from falling into the hands of the FSA.  The Iranian Shi'ite militias are continuing to pour reinforcements into the Badia to expand their area of control. We are doing what we can to repel them,  said Saed Saif, an official from the FSA's Ahmed Abdo Martyrs Brigade. The advances in areas that had been in Islamic State hands  has brought them within reach of the Iraqi frontier for the first time in years. They have also effectively encircled FSA-controlled desert territory stretching to the Jordanian and Iraqi borders and close to the Tanf garrison in Syria where U.S. forces are based.

President Petro Poroshenko, whose country is fighting a Kremlin-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine, revived the prospect of NATO membership during a visit by NATO Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg who himself used the occasion to call on Moscow to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.  Ukraine has clearly defined its political future and its future in the sphere of security,  Poroshenko speaking to reporters alongside Stoltenberg.    Today we clearly stated that we would begin a discussion about a membership action plan and our proposals for such a discussion were accepted with pleasure.  Russia, deeply opposed to enlargement of NATO toward its borders, weighed in quickly, saying the prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine would not promote stability and security in Europe. Related CoverageRyanair cancels plan to start flights to UkraineKremlin: Possible NATO membership for Ukraine won't boost stabilityKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, reacting to Stoltenberg's comment repeated Russia's assertion that it had never had troops in Ukraine. NATO leaders agreed at a summit in 2008 that Ukraine would one day become a member of the alliance. But there was little popular support for the issue at the time and it was never pursued by Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovich. Support for NATO membership however has soared since Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014, following the fall of Yanukovich, and the outbreak of the war in eastern Ukraine, which has killed more than 10,000 people. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko shake hands during a joint news conference following a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission in Kiev, Ukraine, July 10, 2017.Valentyn OgirenkoSome 69 percent of Ukrainians want to join NATO, according to a June poll by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, compared to 28 percent support in 2012 when Yanukovich was in power. Most observers say any prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine is years off. No dates were issued for when talks on a membership action plan might begin and Poroshenko himself said:  This does not mean that we will soon be applying for membership.   Slideshow (5 Images)Poroshenko, in separate comments issued by his office, said Ukraine was determined to conduct reforms in order to  have a clear schedule of what must be done by 2020 to meet the NATO membership criteria.  A NATO spokeswoman said these would relate to defense, anti-corruption measures, governance and law enforcement.  But the war in the east, which still ticks on despite a theoretical ceasefire, also poses a big obstacle to membership since NATO rules state that aspiring members must first settle international disputes by peaceful means. Stoltenberg called on Russia to withdraw thousands of troops from Ukraine - forces that Moscow has repeatedly denied sending - and raised concerns about the growing threats to the safety of international teams monitoring the conflict.  He also said NATO had provided Ukraine with new equipment to uncover the perpetrators of a cyber attack that hit Ukraine in June and spread globally.  A cyber attack that began in Ukraine on June 27 spread around the world, knocking out computers and disrupting factories and shipping. Ukrainian politicians pinned the blame on Russia, while Russia denied involvement.

A relatively normal peak morning commute into the United States' busiest transportation hub appeared to show commuters following a highly publicized contingency plan aimed at easing concerns of overcrowding due to reduced train service.  It's early days yet,  Moorman said on Monday afternoon from inside Penn Station, which is owned and maintained by Amtrak.  The test cases are going to be - first - the evening commute... when people accumulate.  Eight weeks of track repairs at Penn Station, the destination for more than 600,000 daily commuters, began shortly after the July Fourth holiday, when many workers take time off. The second trial for the contingency plan, which includes additional bus and ferry service, will come as more commuters return to work, Moorman said.  We'll watch the passenger load as it goes up over the next two or three weeks,  he said. Amtrak expedited the repair work, which could cost the national passenger rail company $30 million to $40 million, after recent derailments and other problems delayed commuters throughout the greater New York City area because of decaying infrastructure. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo, who said the work would cause a  summer of hell  for commuters, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have publicly blamed Amtrak for Penn Station's problems. Both governors have threatened to stop the regular payments they make to Amtrak to rent tracks at Penn Station for regional commuter train operators New Jersey Transit Corp (NJ Transit) and the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). So far, neither state has stopped payments, Moorman said.  The simple fact of the matter is nobody should want to take money away from Penn Station,  he said. Moorman is stepping down at the end of the year but will share the top job at Amtrak with former Delta Air Lines chief Richard Anderson until Dec. 31.

The statement, which was distributed to its joint venture partners and which Reuters saw, comes after a prominent government-allied lawyer said a new legislative body could rewrite parts of the constitution to ensure the state has full ownership of the oil industry.  The new  constituent assembly  would supersede other institutions and has sparked fears that President Nicolas Maduro's unpopular administration could take aim at joint venture partners, which include large oil companies Chevron Corp and Rosneft. But PDVSA, whose full name is Petroleos de Venezuela, was quelling fears that a more radical wing of the ruling Socialist Party could be out to nationalize companies, as late leader Hugo Chavez did a decade ago.  PDVSA  guarantees legal security to investors, partners, and others,  the statement read.  In the case of joint ventures, PDVSA has honored and will continue to honor the legal norms that allow the possibility of doing business with private companies.  Venezuelan oil laws enacted under Chavez allow for minority participation of private companies in oilfield joint ventures, and numerous companies formed such partnerships despite nationalizations in the sector.  PDVSA did not directly mention the comments by Hermann Escarra, a constitutional lawyer and candidate for the constituent assembly. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bruised Oil Industry  Nationalizing oil ventures would worsen a severe drop in production in Venezuela, home to the world's largest crude reserves. That would hurt the country's already ailing coffers, which depend on oil sales for more than 90 percent of their revenue. And PDVSA has been offering more stakes in joint ventures to foreign companies, including key Russian ally Rosneft and ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of India's top explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, as it tries to minimize operating costs, Reuters has reported.  So, some observers see Escarra's comments as political show, and instead anticipate fire sales ahead.  In our view once the Constituent Assembly is in place and Chavismo feels that is settled, it will aggressively seek to sell stakes in projects,  said Raul Gallegos, an analyst with the consultancy Control Risks.  Still, as Venezuela's political crisis worsens, a half-dozen oil industry sources consulted by Reuters said the situation was becoming more uncertain.  Companies may curtail investments as they await clarity on the July 30 vote for the constituent assembly, which Maduro's foes have denounced as a bid to consolidate dictatorship via a sham election.  Imagine justifying to your board of directors that you put more money into Venezuela when there was an announcement from the president's top adviser that he was going to nationalize companies,  said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston.  This will pour cold water (on investments).  Reporting by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-idUSKBN19V1SM"},

Chile is part of South America's  lithium triangle,  home to more than half the known global reserves of the mineral, which plays an essential part in powering electric car batteries. But only abroad is lithium developed into products consumers can use, a fact Chile's government wants to change. In March, Chilean state development agency CORFO invited bids from companies to manufacture value-added projects from the country's lithium. The winner will secure a steady supply of the metal at a favorable price, part of a deal CORFO made with U.S.-based supplier Albemarle Corp. Among the proposals are projects to create  next-generation  batteries, lithium salts, lithium metal, and several other materials, CORFO Executive Vice President Eduardo Bitran told journalists.  We've had great success because here we're uniting the global electro-mobility industry with the largest lithium reserves in the world,  he said. Bitran added that the selection process should be completed around January and that more than one winner could be selected. Projects resulting from the auction, CORFO said, should come online in 2019.

Young adults recruited to use a commercial brain-training program for 10 weeks got better at that program's specific tasks, but on a standard test of so-called executive function - the brain’s ability to regulate itself - they improved just as much as peers who had played video games for 10 weeks. People should be skeptical about what benefits they can gain from brain training programs, said senior author Caryn Lerman, of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia.  They may need to manage those expectations a little better,  she told Reuters Health.  Our laboratory at Penn has been focused for many years on understanding why it is so hard for people to change habits and behaviors that they know may increase their risk for certain diseases,  Lerman said. The lab's research suggests there are certain factors that make it easier for some people to quit smoking than for others, for example. The new study aimed to examine whether brain training could modify factors like executive function to change how people react in certain situations and ultimately make healthier choices. The researchers recruited 128 participants between 18 and 35 years old who were split into two groups. While one group spent 10 weeks using the brain-training program Lumosity five days a week for 30 minutes each day, the comparison group spent the same amount of time playing online video games chosen specifically not to target executive function or to increase the level of challenge players faced. Before the study started and after 10 weeks of online training or gaming, all participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan to measure brain activity while they performed assorted decision-making tasks.  The tasks tested whether the individual would choose smaller immediate rewards or larger rewards later, and smaller rewards that are guaranteed versus larger, less certain rewards. The participants’ overall cognitive activity was also measured with tests examining attention, memory and other abilities.  After 10 weeks, there were no differences seen in the brain activity scans between the brain-training and video-game groups, the researchers report in the Journal of Neuroscience. Both groups also experienced similar improvements on the standard cognitive and decision-making tests over the course of the study. In a statement to Reuters Health, a spokesperson for Lumosity said the research's scope was narrow.  There remain many open questions in the field - how, why, and in what circumstances cognitive training is efficacious - and so painting in such broad strokes potentially undermines this important, ongoing research area,  wrote Sara Colvin in an email.  We remain committed to supporting quality research, regardless of the outcome: every study can be built on, and they all move us closer to answering open questions - in turn, improving the quality of products available.  Colvin also said the company provides researchers - including those who conducted the new study - access to Lumosity and some data through its research network known as the Human Cognition Project. Lerman also cautioned that the new study can't say whether brain training would lead to differences for older people since her team focused on young adults.  If it was effective we’d expect to see it in younger participants as well,  she noted.

The statement, which was distributed to its joint venture partners and which Reuters saw, comes after a prominent government-allied lawyer said a new legislative body could rewrite parts of the constitution to ensure the state has full ownership of the oil industry.  The new  constituent assembly  would supersede other institutions and has sparked fears that President Nicolas Maduro's unpopular administration could take aim at joint venture partners, which include large oil companies Chevron Corp and Rosneft. But PDVSA, whose full name is Petroleos de Venezuela, was quelling fears that a more radical wing of the ruling Socialist Party could be out to nationalize companies, as late leader Hugo Chavez did a decade ago.  PDVSA  guarantees legal security to investors, partners, and others,  the statement read.  In the case of joint ventures, PDVSA has honored and will continue to honor the legal norms that allow the possibility of doing business with private companies.  Venezuelan oil laws enacted under Chavez allow for minority participation of private companies in oilfield joint ventures, and numerous companies formed such partnerships despite nationalizations in the sector.  PDVSA did not directly mention the comments by Hermann Escarra, a constitutional lawyer and candidate for the constituent assembly. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bruised Oil Industry  Nationalizing oil ventures would worsen a severe drop in production in Venezuela, home to the world's largest crude reserves. That would hurt the country's already ailing coffers, which depend on oil sales for more than 90 percent of their revenue. And PDVSA has been offering more stakes in joint ventures to foreign companies, including key Russian ally Rosneft and ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of India's top explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, as it tries to minimize operating costs, Reuters has reported.  So, some observers see Escarra's comments as political show, and instead anticipate fire sales ahead.  In our view once the Constituent Assembly is in place and Chavismo feels that is settled, it will aggressively seek to sell stakes in projects,  said Raul Gallegos, an analyst with the consultancy Control Risks.  Still, as Venezuela's political crisis worsens, a half-dozen oil industry sources consulted by Reuters said the situation was becoming more uncertain.  Companies may curtail investments as they await clarity on the July 30 vote for the constituent assembly, which Maduro's foes have denounced as a bid to consolidate dictatorship via a sham election.  Imagine justifying to your board of directors that you put more money into Venezuela when there was an announcement from the president's top adviser that he was going to nationalize companies,  said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston.  This will pour cold water (on investments).  Reporting by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil-idUSL1N1K10LB"},

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has asked the attorney general's office to investigate previous charges that the government spied on private citizens, saying he wanted to get to the bottom of the accusations that he called  false.  Citizen Lab said it had found a trace of the Pegasus software in a phone belonging to a group of experts backed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) who had traveled to Mexico to investigate the disappearance of the 43 students.

This is a very delicate matter ... a big problem. Any state must react immediately,  Angela Buitrago, part of the IACHR's team of experts, told Reuters. Buitrago said that if any sensitive data was leaked it could have influenced the investigation.  The disappearance of the students from a rural teachers college in 2014 marked one of Mexico's worse atrocities, and the government's handling of the case marked a low point for Pena Nieto's popularity. Last month, Citizen Lab identified 15 activists, human-rights lawyers, journalists and opposition officials who had also seen attempts to infect their phones with the spyware.

While the Swiss master had the purists purring on Centre Court as he dispatched Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 6-2 6-4 in the fourth round, across the concourse on Court One his main rival Rafa Nadal was bowing out in a gruelling five-setter against Luxembourg's Gilles Muller. The Spanish two-time champion's defeat did Novak Djokovic no favors either.  Scheduled to play Monday's third match on Court One, organizers were forced to push the Serbian second seed's encounter against France's Adrian Mannarino back to Tuesday due to the late finish of the Nadal-Muller epic that lasted almost five hours. Meanwhile the final member of tennis's Fab Four, Andy Murray, struggled to live up to his billing as world number one in a labored victory against another Frenchman, Benoit Paire. So does that combination of circumstances put 35-year-old Federer, who missed this year's claycourt season to better prepare for his favorite tournament, in pole position to win an eighth Wimbledon?

I've had... not the toughest matches. I can look at this quarter-final (on Wednesday against Milos Raonic) in a totally relaxed fashion,  he told a news conference. The Canadian ousted Federer at the semi-final stage in 2016, but  physically I'm not fighting anything like last year with my knee (injury).   Slideshow (3 Images)The Swiss always looked in control on Monday, holding serve comfortably and playing the crunch points better than his 26-year-old opponent in a win that oozed confidence and control. And after mining a rich seam of nostalgia in spectacular fashion in January's Australian Open final, when he beat Nadal in a five-set thriller, Federer is not lacking motivation either.  I definitely put (that win) in the top five at least, if not top three,  he said.    I really just had a wonderful time in Melbourne... Maybe what I was most happy about is so many people were happy for me, that I actually was able to experience that feeling one more time to win a grand slam.  Even if he says he is anticipating a tough finish to this year's Wimbledon championships, at this stage few would bet against him rewinding the clock one more time on Sunday.

Detective David March and Officers Joseph Walsh and Thomas Gaffney were each charged last month with conspiracy, official misconduct and obstruction of justice. The men entered their pleas at their arraignment in a packed Chicago courtroom before Circuit Judge Diane Gordon Cannon. The next hearing is Aug. 29. The indictments arose from the 2014 incident in which Laquan McDonald, 17, was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke. Video footage of the incident showed he was shot as he walked away from police while holding a pocket knife. March, Walsh and Gaffney, who were on the scene the night of the shooting, are alleged to have conspired to conceal the facts of McDonald's killing to protect their fellow officer from criminal investigation and prosecution, according to prosecutors. A police dash-cam video of the shooting, released more than a year after the incident, led to days of protests and thrust Chicago into a national debate over the use of excessive force by police against minorities. The indictment said the officers created false reports on the killing of McDonald.

Gaffney was suspended without pay, Chicago police representatives said. All three men are white.  Tom Breen, Walsh's lawyer, told reporters that his client would be acquitted. The judge set bond at $50,000 and released the men on the their own recognizance. Van Dyke, accused of murder in the McDonald shooting, pleaded not guilty in 2015. In March, he pleaded not guilty to  16 new counts of aggravated battery. No trial date has been set. The cases come after Chicago police in May finalized stricter limits on when officers can use firearms and other force, the latest attempt to reform a department roiled by misconduct and criticism in the wake of McDonald's death. Last month, members of Black Lives Matter and other groups sued the city to force federal court oversight of those reforms.  Until people, particularly police officers that do wrong, are held accountable and arrested and put in jail, until that happens there will be no trust among the community and law enforcement,  said the Rev.

Unconventional shale oil and alternative energy resources are an important factor to help meet future demand but it is premature to assume that they can be developed quickly to replace oil and gas, Amin Nasser told a conference in Istanbul.  If we look at the long-term situation of oil supplies, for example, the picture is becoming increasingly worrying,  Nasser said.  Financial investors are shying away from making much needed large investments in oil exploration, long-term development and the related infrastructure.  Investments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it,  Nasser said. About $1 trillion in investments have already been lost since a decline in oil prices from 2014. Studies show that 20 million barrels per day of new production will be needed to meet demand growth and offset natural decline of developed fields over the next five years, he said.   New discoveries are also on a major downward trend. The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years has more than halved compared with the previous four,  Nasser said. Inflection Point FILE PHOTO: Logo of Saudi Aramco is seen at the 20th Middle East Oil & Gas Show and Conference (MOES 2017) in Manama, Bahrain, March 7, 2017.Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo A lack of investment is definitely not helping, so if that continues over the next couple of years there will be an inflection point where what we see today will have an impact on consumers at the end and supply will be impacted for the next couple of years,  Nasser told CNBC.  What we need to see is more investments from various sectors to make sure there is an adequate supply over the long term,  he said to CNBC. State oil giant Aramco, which is preparing to sell around 5 percent in itself next year in an initial public offering, is continuing to invest in maintaining its oil production capacity of 12 million barrels per day.  We plan to invest more than $300 billion over the coming decade to reinforce our pre-eminent position in oil, maintain our spare oil production capacity, and pursue a large exploration and production program centering on conventional and unconventional gas resources,  Nasser said. Nasser reiterated the IPO was on track for the second half of 2018. Asked by CNBC if the current oil price will possibly delay the IPO, Nasser said the company's investments are  geared towards the long term.   Even though we have the highest 260 billion of reserves we have the biggest exploration program,  he told CNBC. Nasser said in his speech that one of Aramco's priorities was  direct conversion of crude oil into petrochemicals  while adding the company was also focusing on solar and wind projects.

Two BNDES directors resigned last week after BNDES head Paulo Rabello de Castro said the new benchmark, announced two months before he took the reins of the bank in May, could be less predictable for borrowers than the current government-set rates because it would be linked to market rates. BNDES, the main provider of long-term corporate loans in Brazil, has offered subsidized loans for decades in an effort to boost economic growth and create jobs.  Rising public debt and increased scrutiny of the bank's lending policies after recent corruption scandals have led policymakers to propose changes to boost transparency, such as the new market-based benchmark. The shift began last year with former BNDES chief Maria Silva Bastos Marques, who resigned in May citing personal reasons. She was heavily criticized by industry lobbies and many lawmakers for curbing lending even as the economy struggled to emerge from recession. Oliveira nevertheless said she did a very good job and that new BNDES chief Rabello de Castro was maintaining most of her advances, while trying to streamline project approvals.   BNDES is a transatlantic ship. It does not change its policies overnight,  Oliveira said.  He added that while lawmakers could suggest changes to the new BNDES benchmark rate, the government was working toward its approval.  We will have a very respectful discussion with Congress. What is important to say is that there are no discussions within the government about changing the proposal,  Oliveira said.  According to the government's proposal, the TLP rate will be linked to the IPCA inflation index and to the returns of local inflation-linked bonds. The old benchmark, the TJLP rate, which is set every three months by policymakers, currently stands at 7 percent, lower than the central bank's base 10.25 percent rate.  The minister said he called Rabello de Castro on Friday to discuss the new benchmark. Asked if the new benchmark could be linked to the official inflation target, as suggested by Rabello de Castro according to Valor newspaper, Oliveira said the idea had not been discussed.

The Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council established the inquiry in March, but Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar's civilian government and also its foreign minister, has rejected the allegations and opposes the mission. A Myanmar official said on June 30 that the country would refuse entry to the U.N. investigators. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in New York, Nikki Haley, said,  It is important that the Burmese government allow this fact-finding mission to do its job.

A U.N. report from February, based on interviews with some of the Rohingya refugees, said Myanmar's security forces have committed mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya in a campaign that  very likely  amounts to crimes against humanity and possibly ethnic cleansing.  No one should face discrimination or violence because of their ethnic background or religious beliefs,  Haley said.  Myanmar's government regards the approximately 1 million Rohingya as illegal migrants from neighboring Bangladesh and denies them citizenship, even though Rohingya families have lived there for generations.

The 40-year-old Mayweather is coming out of retirement to face McGregor on Aug. 26 that could net the boxer a nine-figure payday. The IRS wants Mayweather (49-0) to pay his taxes for 2015.

Coming at a time of critical underfunding among UK pension funds, who have been among the biggest buyers of otherwise poor-value gilts, a bond-punishing recession would further undermine Britain’s retirement system. With a fragile Conservative-led government engaged in fraught Brexit negotiations in which they are the weak hand, bad economic news continues to rain down on Britain. A survey from credit-card company Visa released Monday showed consumer spending falling by 0.3 percent in the three months to June compared to a year ago. Another from accountants Deloitte showed 72 percent of CFOs gloomy about post-Brexit business prospects. Companies expect a fall in hiring, capital expenditure and discretionary spending, Deloitte said. Not only are they not spending, British consumers are spending the smallest proportion of disposable income in more than 50 years, as below-inflation wage growth hits home. This is in an economy which was already at something close to a stall: first-quarter GDP growth, released in late June, showed the economy expanding at just 0.2 percent a year. Complicating matters is hawkish sentiment among Bank of England policymakers, who must grapple with above-target inflation and a massive current account deficit which leaves sterling vulnerable. About half of BOE policymakers who have spoken recently either called for or said they may consider an interest rate increase soon, in what would be the first increase in base rates in 10 years. Even Governor Mark Carney said in June he might consider a hike, reversing earlier comments, if wage growth and business investment picks up, neither likely. “The UK relies on the kindness of strangers at a time when risks to trade, investment, and financial fragmentation have increased,” Carney said in June, in remarks which may tip his underlying concern. It is not inconceivable that Britain could see both economic contraction, and, if the mood in financial markets turns ugly toward British assets, rate hikes to defend the pound. So rather than bonds in investment portfolios serving their accustomed role as ballast, doing relatively well during downturns as equities suffer, bonds too could take a substantial beating during a recession, even before taking into account any hit to global investors from sterling weakness. Sadly, We Must Start from Where We Are All of this is happening at a time when UK gilts represent particularly bad value in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms. Ten-year index-linked gilts have a real yield of -1.7 percent and even someone willing to lend the UK 30-year money in an inflation-adjusted bond faces a negative yield of -1.42 percent. Those values are the result partly of a market view that growth will be subdued, both globally and in Britain. Those values are also, crucially, because many British pension funds want to hedge the monies they must, hopefully, someday pay out. As Legal and General Investment Management points out, UK defined-benefit pension funds have 1.765 trillion pounds of liabilities, generally linked to inflation, but the inflation-linked gilt market is only 400 billion pounds. “But taking the UK’s structural weakness to its limit, particularly if policymakers misdiagnose problems or miscalculate their response, there is a risk that real yields reverse direction, potentially in a dramatic fashion,” Anton Eser and Daniela Russell of LGIM said in a note to clients. Firstly, a downturn, or threat of one, could prompt whomever is leading Britain to loosen fiscal policy dramatically in an effort to stave off or diminish a recession. Secondly, and perhaps in concert, foreign investors may lose confidence in UK assets, driving down sterling and forcing the BOE to hike, not just to fight inflation but also support the pound. Having rushed to buy gilts to hedge their liabilities, in large part due to regulatory encouragement, a gilt sell-off during a recession, surely accompanied by a fall in equities, would be difficult for many UK pension funds to weather. Consultants Punter Southall said it expects one in three UK defined benefit pension schemes to fail to pay out their promised benefits in full. Only 20 percent of schemes are rated by Punter Southall as “strong”. (www.riskofruin.co.uk/) If rates must rise even as the UK economy falters, those figures may prove optimistic.

As stricter regulations are implemented to tackle environmental problems that have decimated fish populations, local companies had forecast stable output in 2017 after a 20 percent decline a year earlier due to a deadly algae bloom. Production now looks likely to surpass expectations, said Felipe Sandoval, president of the SalmonChile association, which represents producers.  The companies are in better sanitary conditions. There has been less mortality,  Sandoval told Reuters last week. He said production could reach 720,000 tonnes in 2017. Chile's department of fish and agriculture, part of the  Finance Ministry, said last year's salmon harvest was 675,000 tonnes in the world's No. 2 salmon producer, a level last seen in 2011. The low global supplies sent international prices soaring. Norway has also struggled to raise output levels in recent years due to outbreaks of sea lice and disease.  After gains of as much as 200 percent in 2016, shares of Chilean salmon producers like Multiexport Foods, Camanchaca, Invermar and Australis Seafoods rose between 20 and 50 percent in the first half of the year, well above growth rates of Santiago's benchmark index.       Analysts and traders said the shares have continued last year's gains due to a combination of solid growth and demand.  We have been aiming to improve our efficiency levels, focused on reducing costs, which, in spite of the production cycles, has already been reflected in our results,  said AquaChile, Chile's largest salmon producer, in an e-mailed response to questions. Salmon producers have benefited from lower food costs as fishmeal production rises, while the use of antibiotics has decreased, according to government data. AquaChile lowered costs by 13 percent in the first quarter of 2017, in line with other competitors. The company's shares rose 60 percent in 2016 and 13 percent in the first half of the year to 323 pesos and could rise another 25 percent, Guillermo Araya, analyst at local brokerage Renta 4 Chile said.

Pemex last year formed a joint venture with Australia's BHP Billiton to develop the $11-billion flagship Trion deepwater project in Mexico's Gulf, the first partnership after the Latin American country opened its doors to foreign investment in a large oil reform. The company expects to take on joint venture partners for additional projects including two onshore, one in shallow water and the coveted Maximino-Nobilis deepwater area, which would be awarded before the end of this year.  The engineers are telling us this is a good field... I would expect, being very optimistic, much interest. I think (the partner) would be a very big company,  Gonzalez Anaya said when comparing the coming auction for Maximino-Nobilis with the one for Trion. Estimated reserves in Maximino-Nobilis are about 503 million barrels of oil equivalent compared with 485 million barrels in Trion. It also is closer to the U.S. border, which would make building transportation infrastructure easier, faster and cheaper, Gonzalez Anaya said.  Exploration expenditures so far for Maximino-Nobilis are about $1 billion. Pemex expects its partner to include this in the joint venture's cost structure, so the Mexican company would not have to put in additional capital until the partner reached that threshold. Gonzalez Anaya said there was no limit to the number of joint ventures that could be struck. They will depend on time and the level of investment required from Pemex. But the firm will try to focus on deep water and onshore fields that require secondary recovery techniques as those would need more capital.  (After the first farmouts) we will only be missing partners for non-conventional areas, but our idea is to replicate the farmout model much faster,  he said.  In the meantime, Pemex wants to move fast in Trion. A development plan could be approved this week by the two companies and be submitted to Mexico's regulator.  We are in a rush because we are ready for it and because we need to start as soon as possible,  he said. Early production from Trion is expected in 2023. Inflection Point      Gonzalez Anaya also said in the interview that he expected the company to reach its goal of producing 1.94 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude this year and maintain or slightly increase output in 2018.  If Pemex met these numbers, 2018 would mark an inflection point for Mexico, whose production has been declining since 2004. Falling output has also affected exports and increased the need for fuel imports that have eroded the country's balance of payment. Pemex also is in talks to find partners for refining units that need investment for modernization or expansion projects. The company recently announced it was looking for a partner for a $4-billion project to upgrade a coking unit at its Tula refinery and it planned to do the same to revamp hydrogen units at Cadereyta and Madero refineries. Pemex is open to talks with investors interested in partnerships for specific operational units or a whole refinery. But a refinery sale is not being considered, Gonzalez Anaya said.

Arena's shares soared 40 percent to $25.76 in trading after the bell following the news. PAH occurs when the arteries of the lungs constrict, forcing the heart to work harder and potentially leading to heart failure. Its symptoms include shortness of breath and fatigue. The disease has no cure, but there is an arsenal of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs used to manage the condition. However, experts believe those drugs merely reflect the tip of the iceberg, raising the need for improved therapeutic options. Arena's drug, ralinepag, was tested against a placebo in a 61-patient study in which patients were already on standard therapy, the company said. Arena said the oral, long-acting drug induced a statistically significant improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance of nearly 30 percent when compared to the placebo. Study data also showed improvements from the drug in patients' exercise capacity as measured by a six-minute walk test. The results show ralinepag may bring about a consistent therapeutic effect similar to that of intravenous therapy, San Diego-based Arena's Chief Medical Officer Preston Klassen said in an interview. Analysts at Leerink Partners had in May forecast peak ralinepag sales of $1.1 billion. Johnson & Johnson last month bought Europe's biggest biotech group Actelion for $30 billion, to gain access to Opsumit and Uptravi, which treat PAH. Ralinepag has the same underlying mechanism of action as Uptravi and is important for Arena as it seeks to revamp itself under new management, having undergone a reorganization. Arena was originally betting on an obesity pill called Belviq as its main drug but tepid sales and poor adoption led it to renegotiate an agreement with partner Eisai Co Ltd, which acquired the rights to Belviq earlier this year.

As stricter regulations are implemented to tackle environmental problems that have decimated fish populations, local companies had forecast stable output in 2017 after a 20 percent decline a year earlier due to a deadly algae bloom. Production now looks likely to surpass expectations, said Felipe Sandoval, president of the SalmonChile association, which represents producers.  The companies are in better sanitary conditions. There has been less mortality,  Sandoval told Reuters last week. He said production could reach 720,000 tonnes in 2017. Chile's department of fish and agriculture, part of the  Finance Ministry, said last year's salmon harvest was 675,000 tonnes in the world's No. 2 salmon producer, a level last seen in 2011. The low global supplies sent international prices soaring. Norway has also struggled to raise output levels in recent years due to outbreaks of sea lice and disease.  After gains of as much as 200 percent in 2016, shares of Chilean salmon producers like Multiexport Foods, Camanchaca, Invermar and Australis Seafoods rose between 20 and 50 percent in the first half of the year, well above growth rates of Santiago's benchmark index.       Analysts and traders said the shares have continued last year's gains due to a combination of solid growth and demand.  We have been aiming to improve our efficiency levels, focused on reducing costs, which, in spite of the production cycles, has already been reflected in our results,  said AquaChile, Chile's largest salmon producer, in an e-mailed response to questions. Salmon producers have benefited from lower food costs as fishmeal production rises, while the use of antibiotics has decreased, according to government data. AquaChile lowered costs by 13 percent in the first quarter of 2017, in line with other competitors. The company's shares rose 60 percent in 2016 and 13 percent in the first half of the year to 323 pesos and could rise another 25 percent, Guillermo Araya, analyst at local brokerage Renta 4 Chile said.

Over the years, the group run by Stephen Schwarzman has expanded far beyond its leveraged-buyout roots. Now it’s using capital that had been focused on hedge funds to take a stake in rival private-equity firm Leonard Green. The return comparisons are too stark to ignore. Though it started 32 years ago as a merger advisory shop, Blackstone raised its first LBO fund soon after the October 1987 market crash. With real estate, credit and hedge funds fully in the mix, private equity now accounts for just over a quarter of the firm's nearly $370 billion under management. The $3.3 billion Strategic Capital Holdings fund started three years ago bought into Marathon Asset Management, a $13.6 billion credit specialist, and Magnetar Capital, a hedge-fund firm with $13.7 billion to invest. These trades are relatively simple. In exchange for some capital and advice on how to set up a lasting business, Blackstone gets a cut of the roughly 2 percent of management fees and 20 percent share of profit the firms typically keep for themselves. Hedge-fund returns have been lagging, though. Blackstone’s own related business has generated a net internal rate of return of 6 percent since inception through March 31. By comparison, its credit funds have returned 14 percent, private equity 15 percent and real estate 16 percent. It's not unusual to buy into private-equity firms. A decade ago, for example, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System acquired a piece of Apollo Global Management. But this is the first time Blackstone has done so. Leonard Green's historic retail specialty, including a stake in embattled clothier J.Crew, could be cause for concern given the state of the industry. At the same time, it has diversified, too, by investing in hamburger chain Shake Shack, medical-services provider ExamWorks and staffing-services firm Insight Global. The Los Angeles-based shop also raised a hearty $9.6 billion last year. Its three previous funds had produced returns of 11.2 percent, 18.1 percent and 13.4 percent, as of September 2015, according to one pension fund. If sustainable, those sorts of numbers hold far greater appeal than what hedge funds have been yielding. Blackstone, of all firms, should know where to find the best alternative.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

U.S. long-dated yields, which move inversely to prices, fell for just the second time in nine days.  This was a retracement of last week's losses,  said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.  The market is kind of settling down at this point. The perception in the market was that the market got oversold last week. So we're in a wait-and-see mode right now,  she added. A surprisingly strong surge in U.S. jobs in June, even with low wage growth, affirmed expectations that the world's largest economy was steadily improving and supported the Federal Reserve's credit tightening path. That has lifted Treasury yields, which had been rising the last few weeks on a round of generally solid U.S. economic data. U.S. Treasuries have also been moving in tandem with global markets. On Monday, euro-zone bond yields fell, with investors buying back bonds after a two-week sell-off. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, was headed for its biggest one-day fall in almost four weeks, down 4 basis points at 0.54 percent. In late trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell to 2.373 percent, from 2.393 percent last Friday. After Friday's jobs report, U.S. 10-year yields hit an eight-week high of 2.398 percent. U.S. 30-year yields slid to 2.927 percent, from 2.935 percent last Friday. They hit a more than six-week peak of 2.943 percent after the U.S. jobs data. On the front-end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields slipped to 1.387 percent, from Friday's 1.407 percent. The U.S. Treasury this week will auction a combined $56 billion in notes and bonds, including $24 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday, $20 billion in reopened 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $12 billion in opened 30-year bonds on Thursday. The U.S. yield curve continued to steepen on Monday. The yield gap between shorter-dated and longer-dated Treasuries widened on Monday, with the spread between two-year and 10-year yields at 98.40 basis points. Last Friday in the aftermath of the jobs report, the curve was at its steepest in seven weeks. Analysts at Action Economics said worries over the unwinding of stimulus has overwhelmed bonds and overshadowed the bullish impact of tepid inflation.

State regulators have become more proactive in recent months toward utility mergers and acquisitions, intervening in deals as they seek to protect local markets amid tough operating conditions for the power industry. Regulatory considerations are also a big part of the $18 billion-plus battle for Texas' Oncor Electric Delivery Co, which is subject to competing interest from Berkshire Hathaway and Elliott Management.  I'm okay admitting that we were disappointed with the order in April, but the order was specific in what [the regulator] wanted changed and that they were open to us working together to reach a solution,  Mark Ruelle, chief executive officer of Westar Energy, told Reuters in a phone interview. The companies are working with all stakeholders including regulators to gain necessary approvals, with the aim of closing the merger in the first half of 2018, according to a joint statement. Balancing Act Under the revised terms, the two firms will approach the tie-up as a merger of equals, with a holding company created, in which Westar Energy shareholders will get one share for each of their current shares, and Great Plains stockholders getting 0.5981 shares for each they own. Previously, Great Plains had proposed buying Westar and making it a subsidiary, using around $8 billion of borrowing: a level of debt with which the Kansas regulator was unhappy.  The ultimate structure of merger of equals was the only way to meet the interests of both (shareholders and consumers),  Terry Bassham, chief executive officer of Great Plains, told Reuters. The duo have proposed a one-off pool worth upwards of $50 million, which would be distributed to consumers in 2018, while Westar shareholders should expect a 15 percent increase in dividend payouts to match the payout Great Plains stockholders currently receive. The combined company will also buy back around 30 million shares in both 2018 and 2019, Bassham added. Annual cost savings generated by the merger, rising to $140 million to $170 million in 2021, from $35 million to 45 million next year, would help finance these measures, while also allowing the company to achieve the profit level allowed by a regulated utility without increasing customer rates.

This is a very delicate matter ... a big problem. Any state must react immediately,  Angela Buitrago, part of the IACHR's team of experts, told Reuters. Buitrago said that if any sensitive data was leaked it could have influenced the investigation.  The disappearance of the students from a rural teachers college in 2014 marked one of Mexico's worse atrocities, and the government's handling of the case marked a low point for Pena Nieto's popularity. Last month, Citizen Lab identified 15 activists, human-rights lawyers, journalists and opposition officials who had also seen attempts to infect their phones with the spyware.

The world's biggest software maker is looking to carve out a niche among customers who cannot or do not want to move all their computing operations to the massive shared data centers that are collectively known as the cloud.  “One of the key differentiations we have with Azure versus our two biggest competitors in the cloud platform space is our ability to support true hybrid solutions,” Judson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president of worldwide commercial business, told Reuters.  Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, pegged by most market share studies as second in cloud computing behind Amazon Web Services. Dell EMC, Lenovo Group Ltd and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co will provide new servers and equipment needed to run the service, Microsoft said. The companies will ship the first systems to customers in September. Julia White, corporate vice president of Azure, said that the new service, called Azure Stack, is aimed at businesses that want to use Azure but have specific needs for a localized version of the software.  “Azure Stack is an extension of Azure,” White said. “It’s not a replacement for your legacy private cloud.” White said Azure Stack could be used by companies with operations in remote locations where it can be difficult to get an internet connection, such as oil rigs or cruise ships, or those in regions with regulations that require that data be kept locally. “We’ve seen a lot of pent-up demand from end-user customers as well as third-party providers who are anxious to deploy this solution,” said Gartner analyst Ed Anderson. “I anticipate that this offering will provide a significant boost to Microsoft’s overall cloud business.”     Microsoft also announced Microsoft 365, a service that allows customers to purchase the Office 365 productivity suite, Windows 10 and other services in one bundle.      The product announcements, part of the company's Inspire customer conference in Washington, come just days after news that Microsoft plans to lay off thousands of sales reps.  Microsoft is reorganizing to simplify its sales and marketing efforts and put more emphasis on partnerships with services companies such as KPMG.

The talks, sponsored by Greece, Turkey and Britain as well as the United Nations, failed to reach a deal to end a conflict that has dragged on for decades and which is a source of friction between Greece and Turkey.      What I want to make absolutely clear ... (is that) the Greek Cypriot side is ready to negotiate a solution within the parameters set by the United Nations Secretary General,  Anastasiades told a news conference. He said he was still ready to negotiate a deal based on a timetable for the full withdrawal of Turkish troops from the north of the divided island and a commitment from Turkey that it will cease intervening in Cypriot affairs.  The latest of many attempts to broker an accord on Cyprus ended on July 7 after 10 days of negotiations at a Swiss Alpine resort attended by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides along with Britain, Greece and Turkey.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called a halt after what diplomats said was a particularly charged debate over a dinner that stretched on through the night. Anastasiades said that, during negotiations, Guterres was given the impression Turkey would be flexible on both the issue of Turkish intervention and the presence of its armed forces in Cyprus. But Turkey would not commit to those positions in writing, Anastasiades said.     Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades talks during a news conference at the Presidential Palace in Nicosia, Cyprus July 10, 2017.Yiannis KourtoglouCyprus was split after a Turkish invasion that was triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup in 1974. The seeds of division were sown years earlier after a power-sharing arrangement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots crumbled as a constitutional deadlock led to violence. A settlement to the long-simmering conflict has been given sharper focus by the prospect of sizeable deposits of natural gas in the eastern Mediterranean.  Anastasiades, who runs an internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot Government, said attempts to search for gas deposits would go on despite opposition from Turkey, which disputes those rights.  We are continuing our energy program according to schedule,  he said. Following the talks' collapse, it was unclear what further efforts the U.N. might undertake to resolve the conflict. While conceding failure, Anastasiades said islanders should strive for independence even without help from third parties.  I want to tell Greek and Turkish Cypriots that we should unite and look at the prospects of independence, of true independence and integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as an EU member state which ensures the rights of all,  he said.

Talks to reunite the ethnic Greek and Turkish sides of Cyprus collapsed in anger and recrimination in the early hours of Friday, ending a process many saw as the most promising in generations to heal decades of conflict. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, speaking at an energy conference in Istanbul, called on Greek Cypriots to refrain from taking  one-sided measures  after talks failed. It was a clear reference to plans by the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government to exploit potential hydrocarbon deposits around the Mediterranean island. The government has already issues a maritime advisory for a natural gas drill from July to October.  We want to remind once again that the hydrocarbon resources around Cyprus belongs to both sides,  Yildirim said.  The Greek Cypriot leadership must seek a constructive approach rather than setting an obstacle for peace. We advise that they refrain from unilateral measures in the east Mediterranean.  Related CoverageCypriot president says wants zero forces, guarantees from TurkeyErdogan, speaking later at the same conference, went further, with a not-very-veiled threat to oil companies who may be tempted to participate in the Greek Cypriots' plans.  It is impossible to appreciate that some energy companies are acting with, and becoming part of some irresponsible measures taken by, Greek Cypriots,  Erdogan said.  I want to remind them that they could lose a friend like Turkey.   New Tensions Greek Cypriots say it is its sovereign right to explore for hydrocarbons, and it has signed maritime delimitation agreements with most of its neighbors. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan makes a speech at the 22nd World Petroleum Congress in Istanbul, Turkey, July 10, 2017.Murad SezerAsked on Sunday if there was any pressure on Cyprus regarding the drilling schedule, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said:  Nothing (pressure) is being applied, nor will there be a postponement.   A number of energy companies have already beaten a path to the island. Italy's ENI, ExxonMobil, France's Total and Korea's KOGAS have won offshore exploration licenses Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim speaks during a joint news conference with his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras after their meeting at the Maximos Mansion in Athens, Greece, June 19, 2017.Costas BaltasA drilling ship contracted by Total, the West Capella, is already heading for Cyprus.  What we expect from anyone who takes sides in the developments in Cyprus is that they should refrain from steps that might pave the way for new tensions in the region,  Erdogan said. Asked by Reuters at the petroleum conference whether the company was worried that drilling could alienate Turkey, Arnaud Breuillac, Total's president of exploration and production, said the company had  no concerns . The issue has risen to the fore again because of the failure of the latest round of reunification talks, which were started in part to try to solve the energy issue. A week of United Nations-mediated talks in the Swiss Alps culminated in a  yelling and drama  session, leaving the conflict unresolved. Cyprus's Greek and Turkish Cypriots have lived estranged since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek- inspired coup. Turkey has 30,000 troops stationed in northern Cyprus and their status in any post-settlement peace deal proved to be the undoing of a process one diplomat lamented came  so, so close  to succeeding. Cyprus talks have collapsed before, most spectacularly in 2004, when Greek Cypriots rejected a U.N. reunification blueprint in a referendum while Turkish Cypriots backed it. It took several years for the United Nations to re-engage.

The world's biggest software maker is looking to carve out a niche among customers who cannot or do not want to move all their computing operations to the massive shared data centers that are collectively known as the cloud.  “One of the key differentiations we have with Azure versus our two biggest competitors in the cloud platform space is our ability to support true hybrid solutions,” Judson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president of worldwide commercial business, told Reuters.  Azure is Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, pegged by most market share studies as second in cloud computing behind Amazon Web Services. Dell EMC, Lenovo Group Ltd and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co will provide new servers and equipment needed to run the service, Microsoft said. The companies will ship the first systems to customers in September. Julia White, corporate vice president of Azure, said that the new service, called Azure Stack, is aimed at businesses that want to use Azure but have specific needs for a localized version of the software.  “Azure Stack is an extension of Azure,” White said. “It’s not a replacement for your legacy private cloud.” White said Azure Stack could be used by companies with operations in remote locations where it can be difficult to get an internet connection, such as oil rigs or cruise ships, or those in regions with regulations that require that data be kept locally. “We’ve seen a lot of pent-up demand from end-user customers as well as third-party providers who are anxious to deploy this solution,” said Gartner analyst Ed Anderson. “I anticipate that this offering will provide a significant boost to Microsoft’s overall cloud business.”     Microsoft also announced Microsoft 365, a service that allows customers to purchase the Office 365 productivity suite, Windows 10 and other services in one bundle.      The product announcements, part of the company's Inspire customer conference in Washington, come just days after news that Microsoft plans to lay off thousands of sales reps.  Microsoft is reorganizing to simplify its sales and marketing efforts and put more emphasis on partnerships with services companies such as KPMG.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency said in a filing made available on Monday that ETP violated rules against storm water discharges, industrial waste disposal and the release of bentonite slurry, a clay and water mix, into waterways. One of the spills contained traces of diesel in the slurry, which is not allowed.  We have been and will continue to discuss these matters with the Ohio EPA in hopes of resolving all outstanding issues,  Alexis Daniel, a spokeswoman at ETP, said in an email. The $4.2 billion Rover project from Pennsylvania to Ontario is the biggest gas pipeline under construction in the United States. ETP has long said it expects the first phase of Rover to enter service in late July with the second phase by Nov. 1. Several energy traders and analysts, however, have said an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on May 10 banning ETP from new horizontal directional drilling after a spill in Ohio in April could cause delays. The pipeline will move up to 3.25 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to customers in Ohio, Michigan, Ontario and elsewhere. One bcf of gas is enough to power about 5 million U.S. homes. Analysts expect several energy companies to increase gas production once Rover enters service to fill the pipe, including Antero Resources Corp, Eclipse Resources Corp, EQT Corp, Gulfport Energy Corp, Rice Energy Inc , Range Resources Corp and Southwestern Energy Co.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/energy-transf-pipeline-idUSL1N1K11ED"},

PAH occurs when the arteries of the lungs constrict, forcing the heart to work harder and potentially leading to heart failure. Its symptoms include shortness of breath and fatigue. The disease has no cure, but there is an arsenal of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs used to manage the condition. However, experts believe those drugs merely reflect the tip of the iceberg, raising the need for improved therapeutic options. Arena's drug, ralinepag, was tested against a placebo in a 61-patient study in which patients were already on standard therapy, the company said. Arena said the oral, long-acting drug induced a statistically significant improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance of nearly 30 percent when compared to the placebo. Study data also showed improvements from the drug in patients' exercise capacity as measured by a six-minute walk test. The results show ralinepag may bring about a consistent therapeutic effect similar to that of intravenous therapy, San Diego-based Arena's Chief Medical Officer Preston Klassen said in an interview. Analysts at Leerink Partners had in May forecast peak ralinepag sales of $1.1 billion. Johnson & Johnson last month bought Europe's biggest biotech group Actelion for $30 billion, to gain access to Opsumit and Uptravi, which treat PAH. Ralinepag has the same underlying mechanism of action as Uptravi and is important for Arena as it seeks to revamp itself under new management, having undergone a reorganization. Arena was originally betting on an obesity pill called Belviq as its main drug but tepid sales and poor adoption led it to renegotiate an agreement with partner Eisai Co Ltd, which acquired the rights to Belviq earlier this year.

I announce from here the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism which the terrorist Daesh announced from Mosul,  he said in a speech shown on state television, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. The fall of Mosul effectively marks the end of the Iraqi half of the Islamic State caliphate, which also includes territory in Syria. The group still controls territory west and south of the city. A 100,000-strong coalition of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias launched the offensive to recapture the city from the militants in October, with key air and ground support from a U.S.-led coalition.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday reiterated the central bank's pledge to keep Japanese government bond yields anchored near zero.  It's the global backdrop of rising bond yields, 10-year Treasuries most importantly,  said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist, at TD Securities in New York. The spread between 10-year U.S. Treasury yields and their Japanese counterpart is close to the widest in nearly two months, drawing bets that play on the divergence between rising Western government bond yields and low Japanese equivalents.  The BOJ has provided a reminder that while everybody else has put in a bit of a hawkish pivot, if you will, the BOJ is very much not in that camp yet,  Issa said. The greenback was up 0.15 percent to 114.05 yen, after hitting a two-month high of 114.29 yen, earlier in the session.  At the current level we would not be chasing the move higher here, especially not before earnings,  said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.  Dollar-yen, of course, remains very sensitive on the risk front.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.04 percent to 96.049. Traders were wary of adding big positions ahead of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress on Wednesday and U.S. consumer inflation data on Friday.  It's been pretty quiet. There's a lot more event risk later in the week,  Issa said. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar was down slightly against its U.S. counterpart while investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision on Wednesday. Forecasters are divided on whether the central bank will hike rates but data from the overnight index swaps market show that money markets are almost fully priced for an increase.  The Canadian dollar was the first currency to reprice in a hawkish direction, and this will also be the first one now to have a bit of a test, so that's the one we will be looking at the most closely,  Marino said.

The S&P; 500 technology index was up 1 percent, followed by a 0.8 percent gain in the materials index. Technology is expected to have had among the strongest earnings growth for the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.

New money is coming into the market. We typically have new money coming in at the start of a new quarter, and you've already had a pullback in tech,  she said.

The three major indexes are trading close to record-high levels, boosted by strong economic data and robust corporate performance in the first quarter. Markets closed on a high on Friday after a monthly payrolls report exceeded expectations, giving investors more confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony will be the highlight this week for investors looking for cues on further interest rate hikes. She will testify on Wednesday and Thursday.

One of the spills contained traces of diesel in the slurry, which is not allowed.  We have been and will continue to discuss these matters with the Ohio EPA in hopes of resolving all outstanding issues,  Alexis Daniel, a spokeswoman at ETP, said in an email. The $4.2 billion Rover project from Pennsylvania to Ontario is the biggest gas pipeline under construction in the United States. ETP has long said it expects the first phase of Rover to enter service in late July with the second phase by Nov. 1. Several energy traders and analysts, however, have said an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on May 10 banning ETP from new horizontal directional drilling after a spill in Ohio in April could cause delays.  The pipeline will move up to 3.25 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to customers in Ohio, Michigan, Ontario and elsewhere. One bcf of gas is enough to power about 5 million U.S. homes. Analysts expect several energy companies to increase gas production once Rover enters service to fill the pipe, including Antero Resources Corp, Eclipse Resources Corp, EQT Corp, Gulfport Energy Corp, Rice Energy Inc, Range Resources Corp and Southwestern Energy Co.

Speaking at the start of five days of peace talks in Geneva, de Mistura said discussions were being held in Amman to monitor implementation of a ceasefire for southwest Syria brokered by the United States and Russia, the first peacemaking effort of the war by the U.S. government under President Donald Trump.  When two superpowers ... agree fundamentally at that level in trying to make that ceasefire work, there is a strong chance that that will take place,  he said. So far, the agreement that went into force mid-day on Sunday was broadly holding, he added.  He also struck a positive note on ceasefire talks in the Kazakh capital Astana last week, which failed to agree on a monitoring mechanism for a Russian-Iranian-Turkish de-escalation deal but produced a lot of work  in the right direction . U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was in Turkey discussing a particular problem area on Monday, the rebel-held town of Idlib in Syria, de Mistura said, adding that it was a deal that  could almost have been announced .  The world was perhaps witnessing the simplifying phase of the most complex conflict of our time, the veteran mediator said, adding that de-escalation of the war must be an interim phase and not undermine Syria's territorial integrity. It should lead rapidly to a stabilisation phase, he said.  This could become very much a priority anyway just after the liberation of Raqqa,  de Mistura said, referring to the Islamic State stronghold in northeastern Syria. Asked if the war was ending after almost six and a half years and hundreds of thousands of deaths, de Mistura said several stars were aligning - on the ground, regionally and internationally.  In that sense ... there is a higher potential than we are seeing in the past for progress.  De Mistura said he was not expecting breakthroughs in this week's talks, but he had had a working lunch with the heads of the three rival opposition delegations, and he hoped that they could work together more. In six rounds of talks since early 2016, the fractured opposition has never united in one delegation, meaning that de Mistura cannot hold face-to-face talks between the Syrian government and a single, united opposition delegation.

Investors saw Abercrombie's failure to sell itself as yet another blow to a retail sector already struggling to cope with changing consumer tastes and growing pressure from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other online retailers. Shares of Gap Inc (GPS.N), American Eagle Outfitters Inc (AEO.N) and Express Inc (EXPR.N) all fell more than 4 percent. Abercrombie, which has a market value of $650 million, had said in May it was in talks with several bidders regarding a potential sale, a day after Reuters reported that the retailer was working with an investment bank to field takeover interest from other retailers. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners came closest to acquiring Abercrombie, but could not meet the company's valuation expectations, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.  Sycamore agreed two weeks ago to acquire U.S. office supplies chain Staples Inc (SPLS.O) for $6.9 billion, the biggest deal in the buyout firm's history. A person carries a bag from the Abercrombie & Fitch store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., February 27, 2017.Andrew KellyAmerican Eagle had also looked at striking a deal for Abercrombie in partnership with private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, sources previously told Reuters.  Several teen retailers have struggled as their primary customers have abandoned malls in favor of fast-fashion chains such as European brand Zara (ITX.MC), while the rise of online dropping has forced retailers to slash prices to compete.  Aeropostale Inc, Wet Seal and BCBG Max Azria Group LLC are among the retailers that have filed for bankruptcy over the past two years. New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie defined teen apparel in the 1990s with its risqué advertising and its large logo on apparel, but has been hit hard as a new generation of shoppers avoids heavy branding in favor of more independent style. In response, Abercrombie has attempted to reinvent itself, and dropped its logo in 2014. Abercrombie said on Monday it will focus on its surf-wear brand Hollister, the one bright spot of growth for the company.

According to Twitter posts by lawyers who were there, the chief justice said he reads reply briefs first, especially in complicated cases. And according to followup tweets from former Supreme Court clerks, the chief is not alone. Several lawyers said they write reply briefs assuming judges and justices will read them first.  That’s bad news for Conagra and other class action defendants.  Here’s why. Conagra, as you may recall, has asked the Supreme Court to grant review of a decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that affirmed certification of a class of Wesson Oil purchasers claiming the product was falsely advertised as all natural. The 9th Circuit, like the 6th and 7th Circuits before it (and the 8th Circuit afterward), rejected Conagra’s argument that plaintiffs must offer a “reliable and administratively feasible” method to identify class members, deepening a split among the federal circuits on the hot-button issue of whether the federal rules governing class actions contain an implied “ascertainability” requirement.  The 3rd Circuit was the first to discern this implied requirement, but Conagra told the Supreme Court in its petition for review that the 2nd, 4th and 11th Circuits have endorsed the 3rd Circuit’s interpretation of class action rules. Class action defendants, obviously, are eager for the Supreme Court to do the same, imposing a new and difficult obstacle for class certification, especially in low-dollar consumer cases.  But first, defendants need to persuade the Supreme Court to grant review of the ascertainability issue – which the justices have already twice declined to do, in the 7th Circuit case that initially created a split with the 3rd Circuit and the 6th Circuit case that deepened the divide. In their brief opposing Supreme Court review, the plaintiffs suing Conagra, represented by New York University professor Samuel Issacharoff, said the company had exaggerated the magnitude of the circuit split, which, they said, might well resolve itself under the Supreme Court’s 2016 class action decision in Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo. According to the plaintiffs, the 3rd Circuit is really the only appeals court on the other side of the divide, and it may come around without the Supreme Court getting involved.  Conagra, represented at the Supreme Court by Jones Day, filed its reply brief last Wednesday. The brief skewered plaintiffs for suggesting the 3rd Circuit stands alone on ascertainability. There’s also strong precedent from the 2nd Circuit, Conagra said, in 2015’s Brecher v. Republic of Argentina, which held that plaintiffs have to propose an “objective” and “readily identifiable class” in order to be certified.  Even if the 3rd Circuit were to backtrack on ascertainability, Conagra argued, the 2nd Circuit’s Brecher precedent means “there would still be a split,” the reply brief said. “This entrenched split isn't going away.”  But to the extent that Conagra relies on the 2nd Circuit’s Brecher decision, it just did. On Friday, a three-judge 2nd Circuit panel used its decision in parallel securities class actions against the Brazilian energy company Petrobras to clarify the circuit’s holding on ascertainability. And contrary to what Conagra argued at the beginning of its reply brief at the Supreme Court, the 2nd Circuit in Petrobras said its Brecher precedent did not create an independent ascertainability requirement.  In fact, the 2nd Circuit said in Petrobras, it agrees with the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Circuits that courts should not impose the 3rd Circuit’s ascertainability test. “With all due respect to our colleagues on the 3rd Circuit, we decline to adopt a heightened ascertainability theory that requires a showing of administrative feasibility at the class certification stage,” wrote U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis of Brooklyn, sitting by designation on a panel that also included Judges Peter Hall and Debra Livingston. “The reasoning underlying our decision in Brecher does not suggest any such prerequisite, and creating one would upset the careful balance of competing interests codified in the explicit requirements of Rule 23.”  Moreover, the 2nd Circuit referred to “growing consensus” among the federal circuits that the 3rd Circuit misinterpreted the federal rules on class action procedures. That’s a powerful endorsement of one of the arguments plaintiffs made in opposing Supreme Court review of ascertainability.  It’s a very good bet that plaintiffs will submit a brief to the Supreme Court, informing the justices of the essential flaw in Conagra’s reply brief now that the 2nd Circuit has clarified what it really meant in the case Conagra cited. Supreme Court rules allow supplemental briefing “calling attention to new cases, new legislation or other intervening matter not available at the time of the party's last filing.”  In fairness to Conagra, the company quoted the 2nd Circuit’s 2015 Brecher decision entirely accurately. In Brecher, the 2nd Circuit held that “a class is ascertainable when defined by objective criteria that are administratively feasible and when identifying its members would not require a mini‐hearing on the merits of each case.”  You can see why Conagra, in its petition for Supreme Court review (and I, in recounting Conagra’s argument), interpreted that language to require plaintiffs to provide an administratively feasible method of identifying class members, which is the 3rd Circuit’s standard for ascertainability.  But in Petrobras, the 2nd Circuit said that what it really meant in Brecher was only that judges must be sure “a class is defined using objective criteria that establish a membership with definite boundaries,” the court said. “This modest threshold requirement will only preclude certification if a proposed class definition is indeterminate in some fundamental way.”  The appeals court said the two classes of Petrobras debt and equity investors certified to proceed with fraud claims against Petrobras met ascertainability requirements. It also said, however, that U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff of Manhattan committed legal error in certifying a class of noteholders to sue under the Securities Act. Only noteholders whose purchases have a tangible connection to the U.S. can bring claims in U.S. courts under the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Morrison v. National Australia Bank.  The 2nd Circuit said Judge Rakoff hadn’t taken sufficient account of whether noteholders could meet the Morrison test when he held that class issues predominate over individual inquiries. It remanded the case so the trial judge can reconsider that question. The Petrobras class is represented by Pomerantz. Petrobras has counsel from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, and its underwriters are represented by Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom.  To be clear, the 2nd Circuit’s Petrobras opinion does not erase the split between the 3rd Circuit and the five other federal appellate courts that have now explicitly rejected its heightened ascertainability requirement. There’s still a clear divide among the circuits, so if the Supreme Court now wants to take up this issue - despite having passed up two previous opportunities – it’s well justified.  Just not as well justified as it was on Friday.  Conagra Supreme Court lawyer Shay Dvoretzky said in an email statement that the 2nd Circuit's Petrobras decision  recognizes and itself reflects the persistent circuit split regarding ascertainability and administrative feasibility at the class certification stage.  Vacating Judge Rakoff's class certification in the Securities Act case, he said, contravenes the approach of the 9th Circuit,  which upheld certification in Conagra's case even though there is no way besides mini-trials to identify those who bought Wesson Oil in the past ten years.

Yahya Farooq Mohammad, 39, who studied engineering at Ohio State University from 2002 to 2004 and married a U.S. citizen in 2008, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Toledo to one count of conspiracy to provide and conceal material support to terrorists and one count of solicitation to commit a crime of violence, the Department of Justice said in a statement. Mohammad is expected to be sentenced to 27-1/2 years in prison and then deported under the terms of his plea agreement, according to the department. Mohammad and three co-defendants were charged in 2015 with conspiring to funnel money to Anwar al Awlaki and a Yemen-based affiliate of al Qaeda to support of attacks on U.S. forces. Awlaki, a cleric, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011. U.S. intelligence had identified him as the head of external operations for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an offshoot of the militant group. In July 2009, Mohammad traveled with others to Yemen to deliver $22,000 that they had raised to Awlaki, according to prosecutors. The case against three other defendants is pending, and they have pleaded not guilty. While awaiting trial in April 2016, Mohammad admitted soliciting an undercover FBI agent posing as a hitman to kidnap and murder U.S. District Judge Jack Zouhary, who was assigned to his terrorism case. He was introduced to an undercover agent by another prisoner at the Lucas County Corrections Center in Toledo, and he told the agent he would pay him $15,000 for the job. He provided $1,000 as a down payment though a family member and said the rest of the money was coming, according to court documents.

Front-month gas futures rose 6.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to settle at $2.929 per million British thermal units, marking the biggest daily percentage gain since late June and the highest close for the contract since July 3. U.S. gas consumption was projected to rise to 79.4 billion cubic feet per day next week from 77.9 bcfd this week with temperatures expected to remain at above-normal levels, keeping air conditioning use high, according to Thomson Reuters data. Gas production was expected to fall to 70.9 bcfd on Monday, its lowest in over two weeks. Over the past 30 days, output has averaged 71.5 bcfd, up from 70.8 bcfd during the same period a year earlier, the data showed. That, however, was down from the 73.5-bcfd 30-day average in 2015 when production was at a record high. U.S. exports were expected to average 8.0 bcfd this week, up 38 percent from a year earlier, the data showed. Analysts forecast utilities added 59 billion cubic feet of gas to storage during the week ended July 7, the least since 2012, leaving inventories about 6 percent above-normal for this time of year. That compared with a 61 bcf increase during the week a year earlier and a five-year average build of 72 bcf. Meteorologists forecast temperatures in July would be slightly higher-than-normal but not quite as hot as last year, prompting power generators to burn a little more gas than usual to meet cooling demand, though less than in 2016. Temperatures in August are expected to be near average. Analysts forecast gas inventories will rise by only 1.6 trillion cubic feet during the April-October injection season because of relatively low output so far in 2017 and higher sales abroad. That build, far below the five-year average of 2.1 tcf, would leave storage at just 3.7 tcf at the end of October, below the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf. After two unusually mild winters, traders say the possibility of low inventories and even normally cold weather during December through February could cause prices to spike late this year. But with inventories remaining above-normal for this time of year and production slowly rising from last year, speculators have lost the rationale to keep bullish bets near record highs over the past several weeks. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Thomson Reuters Supply Chain & Commodities Research (SC&CR;), formerly known as Thomson Reuters Analytics    cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageid=usa-gas GRAPHIC-Baker Hughes rig count     here GRAPHIC-U.S. natural gas inventories vs five-year range    tmsnrt.rs/2ewaRk2 GRAPHIC-U.S./Canada natural gas rig count vs Henry Hub futures price     tmsnrt.rs/2eT9k44 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Bernard Orr and Tom Brown","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-natgas-nymex-idUSKBN19V2HX"},

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. The hospital said in a short statement Liu was also suffering from kidney problems, with an increasingly swollen stomach, partial intestinal obstruction and falling blood pressure, and that in his condition, it was not appropriate to treat him with radiotherapy. His family had been informed, it said. Questions have arisen over the possibility of Liu getting treatment abroad, and, if he wanted to go and was fit enough to go, if authorities would let him leave. Calls have grown from rights groups and Western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife, Liu Xia, to be treated overseas.     A German and U.S. doctor who visited Liu said on Sunday he could be moved abroad safely for treatment and he wanted to go to either Germany or the United States, but any move needed to happen soon. They added that  additional options  may exist to treat him, including radiotherapy. Jared Genser, a U.S. attorney who represents Liu, urged the Chinese government to allow a transfer, noting that additional treatment abroad could extend Liu's life for several weeks and that better palliative care would reduce his pain.  By denying him treatments that would extend his life, the Chinese government is intentionally hastening his death,  Genser said in a statement late on Monday. Asked on Monday at a daily news briefing whether China would allow Liu to go abroad for treatment, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said:  China hopes relevant countries will respect China's sovereignty and will not use individual cases to interfere with China's internal affairs.  Pro-democracy activists stage a sit-in protest demanding the release of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 10, 2017.Bobby YipThe government has said Liu is getting the best care possible and is being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts. Video Clips Controversy also arose over video clips that appeared on YouTube, in which two foreign men, apparently the German and U.S. doctors, appeared to praise the quality of care Liu has received. Several video clips of Liu have appeared on YouTube, which is blocked in China, since his sickness came to light. One clip showed Chinese doctors asking whether there was any better treatment possible for Liu, followed by a man, identified in text posted with the video as German doctor Markus Buechler, saying:  I don't think we can do better in Germany.  Slideshow (5 Images)In another clip, Buechler was seen telling Liu's wife that they considered their invitation a sign that Chinese doctors wanted to do their best to care for Liu. The German embassy in Beijing said in a statement the recordings were made  against the expressed wishes of the German side, which were communicated in writing prior to the visit .  It seems that security organs are steering the process, not medical experts. This behaviour undermines trust in the authorities dealing with Mr Liu's case, which is vital to ensure maximum success of his medical treatment,  the embassy said. China has kept a tight control on information about Liu's case and has imposed strict security at the hospital. The 23rd floor of building number 1 of the First Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang, where friends of Liu say he is being treated, has been sealed off, with access only for patients or family members. Friends have confirmed that Liu's family have been able to visit him. A man in plain clothes who identified himself as working for the hospital told a Reuters journalist who went to the floor to leave. Asked if Liu was being treated there, the man, whose ID badge identified him as Teng Zhi, said:  Regardless of whether he is here or not, you cannot go in unless you are a family member.  Police in plain clothes blocked a Reuters journalist from taking video of the hospital entrance. When asked if filming was not allowed because of Liu Xiaobo, they said:  Who's that?  The journalist was then escorted to what was described as a  media centre  in a nearby hotel where a man, who only gave his last name Zhang, said no one at the hospital was available for an interview.

U.S. crude futures settled up 17 cents or 0.4 percent to $44.40 a barrel, while Brent crude futures also rose 17 cents or 0.36 percent to $46.88 a barrel. Despite the modest rally on the day, Brent crude prices were 17 percent below their 2017 opening level. With lingering questions surrounding production cuts, the market is  iffy on what OPEC is going to do,  said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC members agreed in May to curtail production until March 2018, but the move has failed to eliminate a global glut of crude. Several key OPEC ministers will meet non-OPEC country Russia on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss oil markets. Kuwait said on Sunday that Nigeria and Libya had been invited to the meeting and their production could be capped earlier than November, when OPEC is scheduled to hold formal talks, according to Bloomberg. However, Nigeria's oil minister was unable to attend the OPEC meeting because of a previous commitment, the Kuwait Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters on Monday. Libya said on Monday it was ready for talks but added that its political, economic and humanitarian situation should be taken into account in talks on caps. Meanwhile on Monday the CEO of Saudi Aramco Amin Nasser told a conference in Istanbul he thought the world was headed for a global supply shortage.  The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years has more than halved compared with the previous four,  Nasser said. Yet U.S. oil production continues to grow, rising more than 10 percent since mid-2016. U.S. energy firms added seven oil drilling rigs last week, marking a 24th week of increases out of the last 25 and bringing the count to 763, the most since April 2015, energy services company Baker Hughes said.    BNP Paribas joined a growing list of investment banks and analysts that have cut their crude oil price forecasts for the coming year.  We thus have made deep cuts to our crude oil price forecasts. We now see the price of WTI averaging $49/bbl in 2017 (-$8/bbl revision) and that of Brent $51/bbl (-$9/bbl revision),  the bank said in a note.

De Maiziere, a member of Merkel's conservatives, said a triple-digit number of foreigners intent on violence had traveled to Hamburg from abroad for the protests while hundreds of other left-wing extremists had been rejected at the borders.  He said it would make sense to have a European database on left-wing extremists, who had spent up to two years preparing for the summit and had secretly taken slingshots and other objects to Hamburg long before the G20 leaders arrived. Justice Minister Heiko Maas, a member of the Social Democrats, the junior party in the ruling coalition, said authorities had lacked relevant data from some European countries about violent extremists who traveled to Hamburg. Maas told German broadcaster NDR he backed creation of a database of left-wing extremists, but said it could take a long time to set up. In the meantime, countries should at least exchange data about those convicted of violent acts, he said. About 20,000 police struggled to contain several hundred demonstrators who torched cars, looted shops and hurled Molotov cocktails and stones during the July 7-8 summit. Tens of thousands more people demonstrated peacefully. The violence has angered Germans and raised awkward questions for Chancellor Angela Merkel less than three months before an election.   The brutality with which extremely violent anarchists have proceeded in Hamburg since Thursday is unfathomable and scandalous,  de Maiziere told reporters. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere during a statement at the Messe ahead the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 4, 2017.Christian Charisius/POOLMilitants who burned cars or plundered supermarkets were not activists or G20 opponents but rather  despicable violent extremists just like neo-Nazis and Islamist terrorists , the interior minister said. He added that people who had thrown paving slabs from rooftops had essentially been  preparing attempted murder . Martin Schulz, the Social Democrat (SPD) challenger to Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany's national election in September, said the militants had acted like terrorists. He said the  marauding gangs  could not claim to have any political legitimacy for their actions, adding:  It had the characteristics of terrorism.   Such small-minded skirmishes are the business of people who took a whole city hostage for their dim-wittedness in an almost terrorist manner,  said Schulz, whose party is trailing Merkel's conservatives in the opinion polls. Police said almost 500 officers were injured during the protests, with 186 people arrested and 225 taken into custody. Some commentators have criticized Merkel's choice of Hamburg, a seaport with a strong radical leftist tradition, to host the meeting, saying her desire to demonstrate her commitment to freedom of speech had backfired. Merkel has promised compensation to those who had property damaged.  De Maiziere said he expected judicial authorities to pass tough sentences on the militants and added that breaching the peace could result in prison sentences lasting several years.

Chile is part of South America's  lithium triangle,  home to more than half the known global reserves of the mineral, which plays an essential part in powering electric car batteries. But only abroad is lithium developed into products consumers can use, a fact Chile's government wants to change. In March, Chilean state development agency CORFO invited bids from companies to manufacture value-added projects from the country's lithium. The winner will secure a steady supply of the metal at a favorable price, part of a deal CORFO made with U.S.-based supplier Albemarle Corp. Among the proposals are projects to create  next-generation  batteries, lithium salts, lithium metal, and several other materials, CORFO Executive Vice President Eduardo Bitran told journalists.  We've had great success because here we're uniting the global electro-mobility industry with the largest lithium reserves in the world,  he said. Bitran added that the selection process should be completed around January and that more than one winner could be selected. Projects resulting from the auction, CORFO said, should come online in 2019. The companies that have applied to the program, officials said, are China's Sichuan Fulin Industrial Group Co, SinoVenture Chile, Gansu Daxiang Energy Technology Co, and a joint venture of Shenzheng Metal Tech Co and Jiangmen Kanhoo Industry Co; Chile's Molymet, Imelsa, and a joint venture of Invermer and Corporacion IDEOJ; Russia's TVEL Fuel Company of Rosatom; South Korea's Samsung SDI Co; U.S. firm Bravo Motor Co; Belgium's Umicore; and a joint venture of Canada's Rubystock Financial Capital Corp and Fallingbrook Commodities.

U.S. crude futures settled up 17 cents or 0.4 percent to $44.40 a barrel, while Brent crude futures also rose 17 cents or 0.36 percent to $46.88 a barrel. Despite the modest rally on the day, Brent crude prices were 17 percent below their 2017 opening level. With lingering questions surrounding production cuts, the market is  iffy on what OPEC is going to do,  said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC members agreed in May to curtail production until March 2018, but the move has failed to eliminate a global glut of crude. Several key OPEC ministers will meet non-OPEC country Russia on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss oil markets. Kuwait said on Sunday that Nigeria and Libya had been invited to the meeting and their production could be capped earlier than November, when OPEC is scheduled to hold formal talks, according to Bloomberg. However, Nigeria's oil minister was unable to attend the OPEC meeting because of a previous commitment, the Kuwait Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters on Monday. Libya said on Monday it was ready for talks but added that its political, economic and humanitarian situation should be taken into account in talks on caps. Meanwhile on Monday the CEO of Saudi Aramco Amin Nasser told a conference in Istanbul he thought the world was headed for a global supply shortage.  The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years has more than halved compared with the previous four,  Nasser said. Yet U.S. oil production continues to grow, rising more than 10 percent since mid-2016. U.S. energy firms added seven oil drilling rigs last week, marking a 24th week of increases out of the last 25 and bringing the count to 763, the most since April 2015, energy services company Baker Hughes said.    BNP Paribas joined a growing list of investment banks and analysts that have cut their crude oil price forecasts for the coming year.  We thus have made deep cuts to our crude oil price forecasts. We now see the price of WTI averaging $49/bbl in 2017 (-$8/bbl revision) and that of Brent $51/bbl (-$9/bbl revision),  the bank said in a note.

Financial Markets Minister Per Bolund told TT the reasons to analyse whether joining the union would be a benefit were Britain's decision to quit EU and top Nordic bank Nordea's transformation into a branch rather than a subsidiary structure. The central bank has said that change increases the scope of Sweden's undertakings and Bolund said the merging of subsidiaries in Denmark, Finland and Norway into a branch structure increases the size of Sweden's banking sector in relation to the economy.  That means there may be reason to consider sharing the risk with other countries,  Bolund told TT. He said the government would undertake a thorough analysis of what it would mean for Sweden to become a member.  If the inquiry would clearly show that there are big advantages for a country like Sweden to join, then it is not ruled out,  Bolund said.

Security Council resolution to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea over its long-range ballistic missile test, said several senior U.N. diplomats. Haley told some U.N. diplomats late last week of the ambitious timeline for a U.N. response to North Korea's launch on Tuesday of a missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast.  The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment on the timeline for a council vote. Some Security Council diplomats have expressed doubt that a draft resolution could be put to a vote quickly. Following a nuclear weapons test by North Korea in September, while U.S. President Barack Obama was still in office, it took the U.N. Security Council three months to agree to strengthened sanctions. The United States gave China a draft resolution to impose stronger sanctions on Pyongyang after the 15-member Security Council met on Wednesday to discuss the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, diplomats said.  China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told Reuters on Monday that it was important to ensure that any action the Security Council might take should be conducive to achieving the goal of a denuclearized, peaceful and stable Korean peninsula.  We really must think very carefully about what is the best approach in the Security Council because a resolution, sanctions, are themselves not an objective,  he said. The intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14. North Korea appeared to have used a Chinese truck, originally sold for hauling timber, but converted for military use, to transport and erect the missile on Tuesday.  KCNA/via REUTERSWhen asked if the council could act within weeks, Liu said it would depend on how members  see the way forward in terms of council action, in terms of how that is put into the wider context of ... improving the situation, preventing further tests, ensuring Security Council resolutions will be abided by.  Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. Diplomats said the United States would informally keep Britain and France in the loop, while China was likely talking to Russia. The United States, China, Russia, Britain and France are the Security Council's permanent veto-wielding powers. The United States could also face a battle to persuade Russia that council action against North Korea is needed. On Thursday, Russia objected to a council condemnation of North Korea's missile launch because the U.S.-drafted statement labeled it an ICBM, a designation Moscow disagrees with. Diplomats said that negotiations on the statement had stalled. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the council has ratcheted up the measures in response to the country's five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches. During the Security Council meeting last Wednesday, Haley said some options to strengthen U.N. sanctions were to restrict the flow of oil to North Korea's military and weapons programs, increasing air and maritime restrictions and imposing targeted sanctions on senior officials. Diplomats said Washington proposed such options to Beijing two months ago, but that China had not engaged in discussions on the measures and instead only agreed to adding some people and entities to the existing U.N. sanctions list in June.

In an email, the panel's designated officer, Andrew Kossack, asked state elections officers to  hold on submitting any data,  the commission said in court filings.  Several state elections officials confirmed receiving a letter from the panel stating that it would provide further instructions after a federal judge had ruled on a complaint filed by a watchdog group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is seeking a temporary restraining order. Earlier on Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, alleging violations of federal law requiring transparent government. The bipartisan panel, led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, asked the 50 U.S. states for a host of voter data, including birth dates and the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers.  Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance, which many called unnecessary and a violation of privacy.  “This has been a misadventure from the get-go,  Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, who had refused to give the commission any data, said by phone. In Wisconsin, elections officials halted plans to inform the commission how it could purchase for $12,500 its public voter data, not including Social Security numbers or birth dates.   We're just putting everything on hold,  said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Arkansas, however, had already sent in a limited batch of publicly available data, according to the office of Secretary of State Mark Martin, In a court document, the government said it would not download the information from Arkansas and would instead delete it. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.         The commission last week said it would meet on July 19 in Washington near the White House. On Monday, critics cheered the move and expressed hope the commission would permanently abandon efforts to collect voter data.  The commission has effectively conceded,  EPIC President Marc Rotenberg said by phone. State officials from both parties and election experts widely agree that voter fraud is rare. Civil rights groups called the commission a voter suppression tactic by Trump.  The Republican president created the panel in May following his claim, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election.

Oculus is cutting the combined price of its Rift headset and Touch controllers to $399 for six weeks beginning on Monday, said Jason Rubin, Oculus vice president for content. That matches the price of another virtual reality set, PlayStation VR, made by Sony Corp. Vive, a virtual reality set developed by HTC Corp, is listed for sale at $799 on its website, and it has not recently cut the price. Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees in 2014. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the medium, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view through headsets, would  become a part of daily life for billions of people.  That has not happened, although it is unclear if that is because of high prices, something inherent in the technology or some other reason. Pricing discounts are sometimes a sign of weak product sales. Rubin, though, said in an interview that was not the case with Oculus, which he said could have cut the price sooner but wanted to wait until there were enough games, movies and other entertainment to keep a broad audience busy. The pace of game releases has quickened, making a wider appeal possible, Rubin said:  We're now in a space where the mass market can be much happier.  Oculus cut its price once before this year, dropping it from $798 to $598 in March. In May, Oculus shut the doors of its Story Studio, two years after it launched at the Sundance Film Festival, to focus on external content makers. Another setback was a $500 million legal judgment against Oculus in February, when a jury found in favor of video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc in a lawsuit accusing Facebook and Oculus of copyright infringement.

The dollar rose after the Bank of Japan last week offered to buy an unlimited amount of bonds and following an unexpected drop in May in Japanese machinery orders that pressured the yen. Stocks on Wall Street edged higher as gains in technology outweighed losses in healthcare. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors rose, with the infotech index up 0.9 percent and the healthcare index down 0.35 percent. Shares of Amazon.com Inc, lifted by the one-day sale event for subscribers to its Amazon Prime service, contributed the second most points to the benchmark S&P; 500, slightly behind Apple Inc. Facebook Inc, Microsoft Corp and Nvidia Corp were the next biggest gainers. Amazon rose 2.1 percent to $998.87, and Apple rose 1.16 percent to $145.85. Investors, especially ETF traders who like sectors, have tried in recent weeks to establish new leadership in the U.S. equity market but have returned to the technology sector, said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The biggest motivating thing in today's market, and it's certainly thin trading, is the Amazon Prime day, which has gotten people interested in Amazon again,  Meckler said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.35 points, or 0.11 percent, to 21,438.69. The S&P; 500 gained 5.88 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,431.06, and the Nasdaq Composite added 33.78 points, or 0.55 percent, to 6,186.86. Stock markets advanced around the world as well. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.42 percent to close at 1,500.77, while MSCI's gauge of global stocks gained 0.39 percent. Surprisingly strong data on German exports in May lifted German equities and provided a bounce for European shares. The data show a strong German economy ahead of a Sept. 24 election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term. Greenback Gains The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, traded flat at 96.005. Against the yen the dollar was up 0.18 percent, to 114.09 yen, after earlier hitting 114.29 yen, its highest level since May 11.  The dollar has been broadly supported over the past couple of days and is showing some mild signs of recovery after weakness in the prior week,  said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. U.S. Treasury yields slipped after rising for more than a week, in line with weakness in European bond markets. Investors consolidated positions after last week's strong U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which has kept the Federal Reserve on track towards raising interest rates at least once more this year. U.S. long-dated yields, which move inversely to prices, fell for just the second time in nine days.  This is mostly consolidation given there's not a lot of data,  said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at Societe Generale in New York. Euro-zone bond yields fell, with investors buying back bonds after a two-week sell-off on the belief the European Central Bank would unwind its stimulus sooner rather than later. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond , the benchmark for the region, posted its biggest one-day decline in almost four weeks, down 4 basis points at 0.54 percent.

Gold holdings at the world's largest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, fell 2 percent in the week to Friday.           Standard Chartered analysts said that investors should buy at about $1,200 because Indian demand, which was dented by a new sales tax, is likely to recover and U.S. interest rates are expected to rise slowly over the next few years.      Technical support for gold was at $1,200 and $1,195, the March low, ScotiaMocatta analysts said in a note.      Spot silver        edged up 0.45 percent to $15.65 per ounce, after earlier falling to $15.16. Prices are near their lowest since April last year and investors' bullish stance in the week to July 3 fell to its lowest since December 2015.                   Platinum        was down 0.47 percent at $899.25 per ounce and palladium        was up 0.27 percent at $840.78 per ounce.

The hearing before a three-judge panel at a U.S. district court in San Antonio could affect U.S. congressional races in the largest Republican-controlled state next year. It comes as the U.S. Supreme Court has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination. Plaintiffs including voters in contested districts and civil rights groups told the panel that Republicans, who dominate state politics, deliberately drew the lines to undermine the power of groups including Latinos, who make up about 40 percent of the state's population. Texas did not deny that many districts are serpentine, but its lawyers argued the boundaries were drawn for Republican partisan advantage, which is legal. They dismissed claims the districts were drawn illegally with the intention to disenfranchise racial and ethnic groups, who typically tend to favor Democrats. The hearing, expected to take a week, is part of a six-year legal battle over the maps. The panel in March dealt a blow to the state when in a 2-1 decision it ruled Texas lawmakers drew up three U.S. congressional districts to undermine the influence of Hispanic voters. On the national level, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in June to decide whether the U.S. Constitution limits how far lawmakers can go to redraw voting districts to favor one political party in a case that could have huge consequences for American elections. A decision is likely several months off.  In May, the Supreme Court found that Republican legislators in North Carolina had drawn two electoral districts to diminish the statewide political clout of black voters. Texas has 36 congressional districts, with Republicans holding 25 seats from the state in the U.S. House of Representatives and Democrats 11. In recent elections, one district has been considered competitive.  Every district is very Republican or very Democrat. Does that really help the system?  U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar,  a Democrat whose district winds more than 150 miles through south Texas into parts of San Antonio, said in an interview. Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak said in an interview:  The party that is in power always tries to use redistricting to their advantage. We see that in Texas on the Republican side and we see that in California on the Democratic side.

The work, due to run through Sept. 1, will reduce the number of train platforms available for arrivals and departures, limiting service and causing delays at a facility that has been plagued by operating woes. Many of the 600,000 commuters who arrive at the station each morning from New Jersey and Long Island will have to scramble for alternative ways into the city. Penn Station's partial closure is not the first time that New York City has faced a commuting crisis. Here is a list of some of the worst chapters in the recent history of the city's mass transit system. Superstorm Sandy, October 2012 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the subway system's operator, shut down all subway and commuter rail services for 67 hours when Superstorm Sandy made landfall in New York City in October 2012. Limited subway service resumed after 83 hours. The MTA estimated that Sandy caused $4.8 billion of infrastructure damage on the New York City transit system, including severe flooding at the newly rebuilt South Ferry station in lower Manhattan. The station remained closed until June 2017.  World Trade Center attack, Sept. 11, 2001 The attack on the WTC and the destruction of its landmark twin towers resulted in a total shutdown of the New York City subway system for about two hours. Many stations in lower Manhattan remained shut for months. The MTA estimated the cost of infrastructure repair at $855 million. Transit Strike, December 2005 A strike by the Transport Workers Union in December 2005 caused a three-day shutdown in the city's subway system. The city's economy suffered $400 million in losses each day of the walkout, and the MTA reported revenue dropped $27.3 million that month.  Power blackout, August 2003 New York City subway service was interrupted for 36 hours in August 2003 during the largest power failure in U.S. history. The MTA reported a loss in passenger revenue of $9.8 million.

However, the IOC would still have to decide who goes first, and the two candidates are lobbying intensely to try to get the 2024 Games they originally bid for. Macron's presence on Tuesday is an unusual move. Heads of state generally turn up only for the host city vote, which this year will take place in Lima, Peru, on Sept. 13.

Paris has already failed in three attempts to land the  Olympics, in 1992, 2008 and 2012.  A unique team in France set up this project,  Macron said. He had already met with the IOC two days after being elected in May.  The project was built by a team, the national Olympic committee, the city of Paris, and is marked by the complete unity behind this project.

Trump,John McCain,Mitch McConnell,Reince Priebus,Ted Cruz,USA,HEALTHCARE/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans expressed increasing pessimism on Sunday about the prospects for the healthcare bill in the U.S. Senate aimed at rolling back Obamacare as lawmakers prepared to return from a week-long recess. One prominent Republican lawmaker, Senator John McCain, said he thought the Republican bill would probably fail.  My view is that it's probably going to be dead,  McCain, said on the CBS program  Face the Nation,  adding that Republicans, who narrowly control the chamber, would likely need to work with Democrats on a healthcare bill. President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to put pressure on Republicans to stay the course.  For years, even as a  civilian,  I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!  he tweeted. The Senate bill, which faces unified Democratic opposition, has been further imperiled during the recess, when Republican senators have had to return to their states and face constituents strongly opposed to the measure. Senators return to Washington on Monday. The Senate bill keeps intact much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation, popularly known as Obamacare, but strips away most of its funding. It repeals most Obamacare taxes, overhauls the law's tax credits and ends its Medicaid expansion. It also goes beyond repealing Obamacare by cutting funding for the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled beginning in 2025. At least 10 Republican senators have opposed the bill in its current form, but many more have criticized the legislation or said they are undecided. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said on Sunday the draft bill was undergoing a  serious rewrite.   Clearly, the draft plan is dead,  he said on Fox News.  Is the serious rewrite plan dead? I don't know. I've not seen the serious rewrite plan.  Critics have derided the bill as a giveaway to wealthy Americans who would see some tax increases rolled back. Opponents also warn that the legislation would cause millions of poor and sick Americans to lose healthcare coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which assesses the impact of legislation, estimated 22 million people would lose health insurance over the next decade under the Senate bill. In a separate report, it found the proposal would cut government spending on Medicaid by 35 percent come 2036. Cruz: Failure 'Not an Option' White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said on Fox News on Sunday that Trump expected Congress to pass a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare before lawmakers leave Washington for their August recess. A spokesman for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Senate leadership was continuing to work with Republican senators and the CBO on the legislation, but did not comment on McCain's remarks or the bill's future. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said on Sunday that failure to pass the bill was  not an option  and that the Senate effort must focus on lowering premiums. He pointed to an amendment he offered that is being scored by the CBO. Cruz's amendment would allow insurers to offer plans that do not comply with Obamacare's mandate that they charge sick and healthy people the same rates and cover a set of essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drugs, as long as they also offer plans that do comply with the regulations. Cruz's amendment has drawn support from conservative senators and groups, who say the amendment will help lower premiums. But moderate Republicans and outside critics say it will erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions and make their insurance unaffordable. McConnell has said he plans to hold a vote on the legislation, which needs the support of at least 50 of the Senate's 52 Republicans, before a six-week recess that begins on July 29. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed its version of a bill overhauling healthcare in May. Yet McConnell himself voiced doubts on the Senate bill's prospects last week, telling a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky that if Republicans fail to pass a repeal of Obamacare, they may need to work with Democrats to shore up private health insurance markets to keep them from collapsing.

Activist investor Jonathan Litt and his company Land & Buildings, who last month disclosed a 4.3 percent stake in HBC, called the Saks Fifth Avenue owner  a real estate company, full stop,  asking the company board in a June letter to consider monetizing or repurposing its real estate, shuttering stores, or taking the company private. Four shareholders, who jointly own more than 7 percent of HBC and include two top-ten investors in terms of percentage of holdings, told Reuters they support Litt's efforts. But a fifth investor with about a 1.4 percent holding supported the board, saying it does not need an activist investor to push it. About 50 percent of HBC shares are held by insiders and investors close to the company. Litt's efforts could force HBC to shift its focus away from retail and more into real estate, the area where Richard Baker, the architect behind taking the company public in 2012, made his name. Many of Litt's supporters say they bought into HBC for its premium real estate holdings, which include two iconic Fifth Avenue buildings in New York City with a combined 1.33 million square feet of space and a total appraised value close to $4.4 billion. HBC also holds majority stakes in two joint ventures for its other global properties. The push from Litt taps into shareholder frustration over the company's share price not reflecting the value of its real estate holdings, and comes at a time when it is struggling to revive sales amid a fundamental downturn in the broader retail industry. Department stores, with their cavernous shopping spaces, have been particularly hard hit by changing consumer preferences and growing online competition.  Because of the environment we're in, the company should be open to dramatic change,  said Joshua Varghese, a fund manager at CI Investments with a 4.6 percent stake according to Thomson Reuters data. HBC should reinvest any real estate proceeds into flagship stores and pay down debt, not open more locations, he said. Litt has not yet engaged with HBC's board or management in person to discuss his plan, a person familiar with the matter said. Litt's public relations firm declined to comment. Jonathan Norwood, a fund manager at Mackenzie Investments, a top 10 shareholder with 2.5 percent ownership, would prefer HBC focus on its property assets over its retail operations.  If they can right the retail business, that's just icing on the cake for us,  said Norwood. Litt and some shareholders say HBC should lease its marquee real estate to other retailers or companies seeking prime office space, or add a hospitality or residential component. HBC has said it is reviewing Litt's letter and would respond in due course, and declined to comment further. To be sure, HBC has said it would look to monetize its real estate portfolio including a possible initial public offering (IPO) for one or both of the joint ventures. Improving Efficiency HBC's average sales per square foot, a retail metric that measures productivity, is within range of its department store peers, at $365 for Saks and Off 5th and $170 at HBC's Lord & Taylor stores, the latest data from eMarketer Inc show. Neiman Marcus stood at $466, Nordstrom Inc, including Nordstrom Rack, was at $373, and Macy's Inc at $150. Apple Inc, which Litt suggested could be an ideal candidate for HBC's landmark Manhattan properties, brought in an industry-leading $5,060 in sales per square foot. Even as HBC plans to open new stores under its growth plan, Lee Matheson, a partner at Ewing Morris, said the company should close some 20 Lord & Taylor stores and 40 to 50 Hudson's Bay stores in smaller markets, arguing the cost benefit would outweigh losses in sales revenue and economy of scale.  None of these assets today are killing them. But it's death by a thousand cuts,  Matheson, whose firm owns about 250,000 shares, said. But some say the board is already 100 percent focused on creating shareholder value and does not need activist pressure.  The board is very strong and capable,  said Geoff Barratt, a managing director at Sprott Asset Management, who has previously dealt with HBC's board.  They are completely aligned with shareholders.  Still, shareholders point to Litt's reputation and connection to director William Mack as a sign HBC could take some action sooner than later. Litt was on the Mack-Cali Realty Corp board, where Mack serves as Chairman. Benjamin Halliburton, Chief Investment Officer at Traditional Capital Management, welcomed Litt's move, saying it was making the stock more attractive and the firm could again purchase shares at the right price.  There's still a lot of value to be squeezed out,  said Halliburton, whose firm retains a modest holding.

Paris is also hoping to stage the Games for a third time, having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, and Macron said he came with  a sense of pride, determination and humility . French President Emmanuel Macron, who is also the head of the Paris 2024 candidate city delegation, his wife Brigitte Macron (L), and Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo arrive at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland July 10, 2017.Pierre Albouy I came here for two things: pride, for the candidature and being part of this win-win-win situation, and also to carry the values of Olympism the world over. I support them fully,  Macron said.  We need multilateralism, the structures that provide agreement among nations ... and tolerance, which the Olympic movement illustrates well.  Paris has already failed in three attempts to land the  Olympics, in 1992, 2008 and 2012.  A unique team in France set up this project,  Macron said. He had already met with the IOC two days after being elected in May.  The project was built by a team, the national Olympic committee, the city of Paris, and is marked by the complete unity behind this project.    Bach, whose meeting with Macron lasted close to an hour and a half compared with 40 minutes for the mayor of Los Angeles, said a decision to give the green light on a double allocation would  create a win-win-win situation for LA, Paris and the entire Olympic movement.  Paris is seen as the frontrunner in the race for the 2024 Games, with Los Angeles having hinted they would accept the Games for 2028. Four other cities -- Hamburg, Rome, Budapest and Boston -- were in the running for the 2024 Games before dropping out over cost and size concerns, forcing the IOC to overhaul the bidding  with the double awarding to make it more attractive to potential hosts of the Games.

EU state aid rules for banks were revised in the wake of the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis and allow public support for lenders after shareholders and junior bondholders have contributed to the rescue.  The state aid rules are less strict than more recent banking rules, known as the bail-in, which dictate that senior bondholders and uninsured depositors must take losses before taxpayers' money can be used to help banks.  The question is if the state aid rules, that apply in any case, should not be adjusted now,  Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters in reply to a question on whether Italy's public rescue of Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza was in line with the spirit of EU banking rules. Arriving at a regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels, Dijsselbloem said EU banking rules were respected by Italy, but that a discussion would be held at the Eurogroup meeting on possible changes to EU competition rules.  After the meeting, he said no joint conclusions were adopted by ministers but that discussions will continue on this issue.  We need to make sure that even if other legal frameworks apply, the state aid rules should be to the same kind of level,  Dijsselbloem said. EU rules are proposed by the executive European Commission and approved by EU states and the European Parliament. Italy used the state aid framework to wind down the Veneto banks because the small size of the lenders permitted it.   Arriving at the same meeting, the European Commission vice president in charge of the issue, Valdis Dombrovskis, said the EU executive  at a certain stage  will discuss whether state aid rules for banks need to be changed. But he stressed that there would be no proposal for the moment as possible side effects of amending the rules need to be carefully assessed. As he arrived at the meeting, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Italy had  done very well  in handling problems with troubled banks and that its actions were a good basis for further improvements.

The hearing before a three-judge panel at a U.S. district court in San Antonio could affect U.S. congressional races in the largest Republican-controlled state next year. It comes as the U.S. Supreme Court has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination. Plaintiffs including voters in contested districts and civil rights groups told the panel that Republicans, who dominate state politics, deliberately drew the lines to undermine the power of groups including Latinos, who make up about 40 percent of the state's population. Texas did not deny that many districts are serpentine, but its lawyers argued the boundaries were drawn for Republican partisan advantage, which is legal. They dismissed claims the districts were drawn illegally with the intention to disenfranchise racial and ethnic groups, who typically tend to favor Democrats. The hearing, expected to take a week, is part of a six-year legal battle over the maps. The panel in March dealt a blow to the state when in a 2-1 decision it ruled Texas lawmakers drew up three U.S. congressional districts to undermine the influence of Hispanic voters. On the national level, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed in June to decide whether the U.S. Constitution limits how far lawmakers can go to redraw voting districts to favor one political party in a case that could have huge consequences for American elections. A decision is likely several months off. In May, the Supreme Court found that Republican legislators in North Carolina had drawn two electoral districts to diminish the statewide political clout of black voters. Texas has 36 congressional districts, with Republicans holding 25 seats from the state in the U.S. House of Representatives and Democrats 11. In recent elections, one district has been considered competitive.  Every district is very Republican or very Democrat. Does that really help the system?  U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat whose district winds more than 150 miles through south Texas into parts of San Antonio, said in an interview. Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak said in an interview:  The party that is in power always tries to use redistricting to their advantage. We see that in Texas on the Republican side and we see that in California on the Democratic side. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/texas-election-idUSL1N1K114J"},

If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!  he tweeted, referring to the daughter of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival in last year's presidential election. Chelsea Clinton responded on Twitter:  Good morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not.          White House adviser Ivanka Trump briefly sat in her father's chair on Saturday at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, during a closed-door session on African development as the World Bank president spoke.  Her appearance prompted a string of reactions on Twitter and caught the attention of the German media and other outlets.   Donald Trump, in a separate tweet, called the arrangement  very standard  and  also noted that German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was hosting the G20 summit, agreed. Merkel had dismissed the move at a news briefing after the summit.  Ivanka Trump takes her seat at the beginning of the third working session of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017.Ludovic Marin/POOL Ivanka belongs to the U.S. delegation,  Merkel, who has worked with her on various issues, said last week.       Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also defended Ivanka, saying on Sunday that the president's daughter had often sat in on meetings with her and Trump, especially those regarding women and business. Ivanka Trump ran a clothing and jewelry business before taking a formal job at the White House after her father took office in January and has adopted women's issues as a signature policy area. At the G20, she also took the spotlight at a separate event alongside World Bank President Jim Yong Kim for a public-private loan program aimed at boosting female entrepreneurs in developing countries. Lawrence Summers, a former World Bank official and economic adviser under former Democratic president Barack Obama, said it was rare for government heads to leave during major summits and that, when they must, foreign ministers or other very senior government officials normally fill in.   There is no precedent for a head of government’s adult child taking a seat,  he wrote in the Washington Post.  There is no precedent for good reason. It was insulting to the others present and sent a signal of disempowerment regarding senior government officials.

Alphabet unit Google, the world's most popular internet search engine, is drawing on the expertise of at least five top law firms in Brussels to help it deal with its EU regulatory troubles, people familiar with the matter said. The EU competition authority hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty last month for unfairly favouring its shopping service. Antirust regulators are also weighing a record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and a third case involves its AdSense for Search platform. The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second highest, will be the first battleground for Google if, as expected, it challenges the European Commission's June decision and potentially disruptive changes to its business practices. Cleary Gottlieb, Allen & Overy, Slaughter and May, Garrigues and White & Case have all been tapped by Google. Google did not immediately respond to an email for comment. The company's decision to rely on a diverse range of lawyers makes sense because of the risks it faces, Ian Giles, a partner at London-based law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said.  Given the potential penalties and damages actions it faces, Google will want to invest in the best possible defence team, and direct legal costs will be a relatively minor consideration,  he said.  There may be simple capacity reasons as to why they are sharing the workload between a number of law firms, but there is also value to seeking a second opinion, reconsidering strategy, and bringing new ideas to the table,  Giles said. Expect fireworks, economist Georgios Petropoulos at think-tank Bruegel said.  There has been no similar case in European law in the past. It is a very challenging case and difficult to prove one or the other,  he said, referring to issues such as market dominance, definition of the relevant market, among others. Google may also well be preparing for expensive litigation ahead from rivals that do not need to establish its liability following the Commission's ruling on Google shopping.  The (Commission's mention of a) 45-fold increase in traffic to Google shopping and the 85 percent drop in traffic to some competitor sites suggest there is significant potential for such actions, as does the size of the penalty,  Collyer Bristow lawyer Stephen Critchley wrote in a recent note. The legal battles will also provide helpful markers for the fast-moving tech industry and regulators struggling to impose old rules on new markets and dominant social platforms, said Petropoulos.  We need some decisions on what is good and what is bad. All these will provide more clarity on how this market works,  he said. Cleary Gottlieb is advising on the Google shopping case, Allen & Overy together with Cleary on the Android smartphone case and Slaughter and May on the AdSense case, the sources said.

EU state aid rules for banks were revised in the wake of the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis and allow public support for lenders after shareholders and junior bondholders have contributed to the rescue.  The state aid rules are less strict than more recent banking rules, known as the bail-in, which dictate that senior bondholders and uninsured depositors must take losses before taxpayers' money can be used to help banks.  The question is if the state aid rules, that apply in any case, should not be adjusted now,  Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters in reply to a question on whether Italy's public rescue of Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza was in line with the spirit of EU banking rules. Arriving at a regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels, Dijsselbloem said EU banking rules were respected by Italy, but that a discussion would be held at the Eurogroup meeting on possible changes to EU competition rules.  After the meeting, he said no joint conclusions were adopted by ministers but that discussions will continue on this issue.  We need to make sure that even if other legal frameworks apply, the state aid rules should be to the same kind of level,  Dijsselbloem said. EU rules are proposed by the executive European Commission and approved by EU states and the European Parliament. Italy used the state aid framework to wind down the Veneto banks because the small size of the lenders permitted it.   Arriving at the same meeting, the European Commission vice president in charge of the issue, Valdis Dombrovskis, said the EU executive  at a certain stage  will discuss whether state aid rules for banks need to be changed. But he stressed that there would be no proposal for the moment as possible side effects of amending the rules need to be carefully assessed. As he arrived at the meeting, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Italy had  done very well  in handling problems with troubled banks and that its actions were a good basis for further improvements.

Now, a study released on Monday shows that survivors suffer an elevated risk of cancer, especially lung and colorectal malignancies. Israeli researchers examined the medical records of more than 152,000 holocaust survivors over more than 45 years and compared those who qualified for compensation as a result of their persecution during the war to those whose compensation bids were rejected. Survivors whose compensation bids were rejected were generally those who had been caught up in the war but who spent little or no time in a closed ghetto or a concentration camp and who survived with minimal disability. Cancer was diagnosed in 22 percent of those granted compensation and 16 percent of those denied it, according to the report in the journal Cancer.  The differences were most striking for lung and colon cancers. Survivors granted compensation had a 37 percent higher risk of lung cancer and a 12 percent higher risk of colorectal cancer than those denied compensation, after adjustments for age, gender and country of origin. “This study brings to light again that outside forces can cause cancer,” said cancer epidemiologist Electra Paskett of The Ohio State University in Columbus. “Stress really does get under your skin to cause disease.” “Many have not given this hypothesis its due justice,” she said in an email. Paskett was not involved with the study but was one of the authors of an accompanying editorial. The study also found heightened cancer risk for survivors born in countries occupied by Nazi Germany compared to survivors born elsewhere.  Survivors born in Nazi-occupied countries had an 8 percent higher risk of developing cancer than survivors born elsewhere, the study found. Those born in occupied countries also had a 12 percent higher risk of lung cancer and an 8 percent higher risk of colorectal cancer. Holocaust survivors experienced a myriad of potential risk factors for cancer, including infectious disease, severe and prolonged hunger, mental stress, physical abuse and overcrowding, lead author Dr. Siegal Sadetzki of the Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer, Israel said in a phone interview.  Although the study cannot explain the reasons for heightened risk, Sadetzki speculated about a possible explanation for the increase in lung cancer among compensated holocaust survivors. “I believe the risk for lung cancer is by a secondary, indirect mechanism,” she said. “Due to the stress, maybe the holocaust survivors smoked more and experienced lifestyle habits that are not so good for you.” Previous studies have found that starvation might protect against colon cancer. But prolonged starvation and deprivations from all vitamins and nutrients, such as what holocaust survivors experienced, might have had a different effect, Sadetzki said. An alternative theory for the rise in colon cancer rates could be that survivors compensated for their lack of food during the war by overeating afterward, she said.   A previous study also found an overall increased risk of cancer, and in particular colorectal and lung cancer, among Jewish holocaust survivors. The prior study also reported an increased risk of breast cancer among women survivors. The new study, however, showed no increase in risk for breast or gynecologic cancer among female survivors.  Nearly 95 percent of Hungarian Jewish women held in concentration camps during the war stopped menstruating, another previous study found.  Not menstruating appears to protect against breast cancer. The longer women menstruate, the more likely they are to be diagnosed with hormone-related cancers, like breast cancer, the authors write. In their editorial, Paskett and her colleagues draw parallels between the privations experienced by holocaust survivors and those experienced by poor racial minority groups in the United States today.  “Both groups had or have stressors of violence, lack of food, housing insecurity, discrimination and loss of power,” Paskett said. “Today we can think about those living in urban neighborhoods or rural areas with crumbling housing, drug use and unemployment, or low wages, contributing to increasing violence, lack of good food in area food markets, discrimination and even environmental pollution caused by large businesses.” “We need people who are willing to go into these communities and work with the people who live there to develop strategies and solutions to be able to help themselves,” she said.

Shares of the broadcaster, known for its  telenovela  soap operas, jumped 4.7 percent to 94.10 pesos and were on track for their strongest one-day gain since February. Televisa's New York-traded shares rose 5.4 percent. Like its U.S. peers, Televisa is under pressure as younger viewers shun cable bundles in favor of cheaper streaming options including Netflix Inc. Televisa's stock this year has lagged Mexico's benchmark index. Several analysts predicted in recent reports that Televisa's second-quarter revenue, expected to be released after the market close on Monday, would be in line with the year-ago period. In a note to clients, Banorte Ixe pointed to potentially lower advertising sales and lost subscribers, as well as a strengthening peso, which may have increased the cost of content while reducing financing costs. Televisa may see a pickup in pay-TV subscribers in the second half of 2017, while its ad revenue will get a boost from the World Cup beginning in June 2018, Interacciones analyst Martin Lara wrote in a preview.  These results could have a short-term negative effect on Televisa's share price,  Lara wrote of the second-quarter release.  However, we recommend taking advantage of any adjustment as we believe that Televisa's medium-term outlook is encouraging.  Options on Televisa's U.S.-listed shares drew bullish activity on Monday. Overall trading volume rose to 2,400 contracts, or about 13 times the average daily volume, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert Televisa is expected by analysts on average to report a 0.5 percent increase in second-quarter revenue to 23.63 billion pesos ($1.31 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data. The world's largest maker of Spanish-language content, Televisa has been subject to tougher regulations since 2014 as part of a sweeping sector reform aimed at making the Mexican market more competitive. It recently won a court order blocking the sale of Roku streaming devices in Mexico on the grounds that the gadgets are used by criminals to illegally sell pirated television content.

Facebook in January also announced plans to build a data center in Denmark, only its third outside of the United States. Apple has pledged to back the Paris climate accord by switching to renewable energy and has recently issued a $1 billion green bond after the United States pulled out of the pact. Chief Executive Tim Cook was one of several CEOs who directly appealed to President Donald Trump to keep the United States in the pact before he made his decision. Apple said the data center would begin operations in the second quarter of 2019 in Aabenraa in southern Denmark near the German border. It will power Apple's online services, including the iTunes Store, App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri for customers across Europe.  We're thrilled to be expanding our data center operations in Denmark, and investing in new sources of clean power,  Erik Stannow, Nordic manager for Apple, said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  The planned facility in Aabenraa, like all of our data centers, will run on 100 percent renewable energy from day one, thanks to new clean energy sources we're adding,  he said. Apple's first data center in Denmark near the town of Viborg is due to begin operations later this year. Apple said a planned data center in Athenry, Ireland, announced in 2015 had yet to begin construction. Apple confirmed that the Irish data center is currently under judicial review. Denmark, a leader in wind power, has abundant supplies of wind energy as well biomass energy.  The reliability of the Danish grid is one of the main reasons we will operate two sites in Denmark,  Stannow said. The small Nordic country hopes these investments will boost its IT sector.

Alphabet unit Google, the world's most popular internet search engine, is drawing on the expertise of at least five top law firms in Brussels to help it deal with its EU regulatory troubles, people familiar with the matter said. The EU competition authority hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty last month for unfairly favoring its shopping service. Antirust regulators are also weighing a record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and a third case involves its AdSense for Search platform. The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second highest, will be the first battleground for Google if, as expected, it challenges the European Commission's June decision and potentially disruptive changes to its business practices. Cleary Gottlieb, Allen & Overy, Slaughter and May,  Garrigues and White & Case have all been tapped by Google. Google did not immediately respond to an email for comment. The company's decision to rely on a diverse range of lawyers makes sense because of the risks it faces, Ian Giles, a partner at London-based law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said.  Given the potential penalties and damages actions it faces, Google will want to invest in the best possible defense team, and direct legal costs will be a relatively minor consideration,  he said.  There may be simple capacity reasons as to why they are sharing the workload between a number of law firms, but there is also value to seeking a second opinion, reconsidering strategy, and bringing new ideas to the table,  Giles said. Expect fireworks, economist Georgios Petropoulos at think-tank Bruegel said.  There has been no similar case in European law in the past. It is a very challenging case and difficult to prove one or the other,  he said, referring to issues such as market dominance, definition of the relevant market, among others. Google may also well be preparing for expensive litigation ahead from rivals that do not need to establish its liability following the Commission's ruling on Google shopping.  The (Commission's mention of a) 45-fold increase in traffic to Google shopping and the 85 percent drop in traffic to some competitor sites suggest there is significant potential for such actions, as does the size of the penalty,  Collyer Bristow lawyer Stephen Critchley wrote in a recent note. The legal battles will also provide helpful markers for the fast-moving tech industry and regulators struggling to impose old rules on new markets and dominant social platforms, said Petropoulos.  We need some decisions on what is good and what is bad. All these will provide more clarity on how this market works,  he said. Cleary Gottlieb is advising on the Google shopping case, Allen & Overy together with Cleary on the Android smartphone case and Slaughter and May on the AdSense case, the sources said.

Nineteen-year-old Tulasi Shahi from Nepal's western Dailekh district is reported to have died after being bitten by a poisonous snake while staying in a shed where she was required to sleep during her period, WaterAid said in a statement. The practice of  chhaupadi  banishes menstruating girls and women to animal sheds for the duration of their period as they are thought to be impure.  Sadly, this is not an isolated case as every day, girls and women in parts of Nepal are forced to live outside their communities just because they are menstruating,  Tim Wainwright, Chief Executive at WaterAid UK said in the statement.  The ancient practice of chhaupadi is perhaps the most acute example of how the stigmatization of periods impinges on women's everyday lives.  Chhaupadi was outlawed in 2005, but reports of women and girls dying in attacks by wild animals and from snake bites, or being raped while they are in seclusion show the archaic practice still continues in Nepal's remote west. Similar confinement also occurs when women give birth. As well as physical exclusion, girls are forbidden during their period from taking part in ordinary communal activities. They are often without basic necessities, such as sanitary pads. In December, a 15-year-old girl in western Nepal suffocated to death after being forced to stay in a poorly ventilated shed. WaterAid also said it had reports that a 14-year-old had died in recent weeks from an illness contracted while staying in a chhaupadi shed. Although there have been no reported prosecutions, the Nepalese government  has committed to break the silence that shrouds menstruation and eradicate chhaupadi... (and) develop a national menstrual hygiene policy framework,  WaterAid said.

The Japanese automaker said the incident occurred in Florida in June 2016 when an individual was working on repairs on a 2001 Honda Accord and the air bag ruptured. At least 17 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide are now tied to the defect that prompted the largest ever auto safety recall and led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection last month. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks The Honda Accord was among a group of more than 300,000 unrepaired recalled Honda vehicles equipped with inflators with a substantial risk of rupturing. Honda said the vehicle's registered owners had received at least 12 recall notices but never got recommended repairs. The individual working on the vehicle in Florida died a day after sustaining injuries when the air bag deployed. Last year, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) urged owners to stop driving the  unsafe  cars until they were fixed. NHTSA said 2001-2003 model Honda and Acura vehicles have as high as a 50 percent chance of a dangerous air bag inflator rupture in a crash. Of the deaths linked to Takata's inflators, 16 took place in Honda vehicles since May 2009, including five in Malaysia using a different type Takata inflator, while one death occurred in a Ford Motor Co (F.N) vehicle in South Carolina in December 2015. Separately, a federal judge in Detroit on Monday said he planned to name law professor Eric D. Green to oversee $975 million in compensation funds for Takata air bag victims and automakers. Green, who teaches at Harvard, has served as a mediator in many major cases, including the U.S. Microsoft antitrust case, and currently serves as a Justice Department monitor overseeing the implementation of billions of dollars in consumer relief linked to settlements with banks stemming from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, said in a court affidavit last month in its bankruptcy filing that the company  faces insurmountable claims  relating to the recalls and owes billions of dollars to automakers.

It has always been assumed that if babies are allowed to control their own food intake then they will be better at judging when they have ‘had enough,’” Anne-Louise M. Heath and Rachael W. Taylor from University of Otago in Dunedin told Reuters Health by email.  “So we were surprised that letting babies feed themselves their solids from the start, rather than being spoon-fed by someone else, didn’t seem to improve their ability to stop eating when they were full. And that they were just as likely to become overweight as babies who had been spoon-fed.”  There has been considerable discussion of the possible benefits and harms of baby-led weaning, but precious little research, the authors note in JAMA Pediatrics. Their Baby-Led Introduction to Solids (BLISS) study of 206 mothers and their infants was designed to see whether the baby-led approach reduces the risk of becoming overweight.  Mothers were recruited during pregnancy and divided into two groups, one of which would apply the baby-led approach to feeding after the babies were 6 months old, the age at which most guidelines recommend beginning to introduce solid foods in addition to ongoing breastfeeding. Most of the mothers exclusively breastfed for five to six months, with mothers in the baby-led feeding group having access to additional counseling to help them keep breastfeeding for the full six months. At 12 and 24 months into the study, however, there was no difference between the baby-led group and the spoon-fed group in rates of overweight. There were other differences, though.  “We were very interested to find that babies following this baby-led approach to introducing solids enjoyed their food more and were less likely to be picky eaters as one year olds than babies who had been spoon-fed,” Heath and Taylor said. “This is particularly interesting because the difference in picky eating was fairly large, even though the families had been randomly assigned to follow this feeding approach with their baby.”  A commonly expressed concern is that baby-led infants may not eat enough to sustain their growth. At least in this study, that didn't happen with any infant. In a related editorial, Rajalakshmi Lakshman and colleagues from University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine in the UK remind us of the importance of rigorous testing of infant feeding approaches, even though they already have wide popularity among parents and experts based on intuition and limited evidence. It might be, they say, that infants have a natural tendency toward overconsumption, a tendency that is partly influenced by the same genetic differences that predict adult weight and obesity risk.   Instead of autonomy, adult supervision and some restriction to avoid excessive food intake may be required until children are sufficiently mature to exert the higher executive functions necessary to self-regulate their energy intakes,” they write.   I think it is important to realize that there is no one right way to introduce solids to a baby,” said Amy Brown of Swansea University in the UK. “Family experience and context will influence this. Importantly this data shows that babies who follow a baby-led approach are consuming sufficient energy and are not at increased risk of underweight which should be reassuring,” she said by email.  “It should also be noted that if your baby has developmental difficulties or has had very slow weight gain, then you should talk to your health professional before starting solids as a baby-led approach might not be appropriate,” said Brown, who wasn’t involved in the current study. “What is of central importance is feeding your baby responsively; looking to them for signs of hunger and fullness, and not trying to get them to finish a portion if they do not want to. This applies whether you are spoon-feeding or letting babies self-feed, and indeed is important during milk feeding and for older children, too. Offer a range of tastes, varieties, and textures and let your baby eat as much as they need,” Brown said.

Upmarket chain Waitrose, which is part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership , said on Monday that all 46 of its own-label tea products will be Fairtrade certified by October, up from 43 currently. Companies can use the Fairtrade logo if they guaranteed farmers a fair price for crops and an extra premium to spend on community projects like roads and schools.  We're proud supporters of the Fairtrade Foundation and have seen first-hand their strong track record of supporting farmers who most need it,  Waitrose's Commercial Director Rupert Thomas said in a statement. The global Fairtrade movement is represented in the UK by the Fairtrade Foundation, which was established in 1992 by charities including Christian Aid and Oxfam. Waitrose, Britain's seventh largest supermarket retailer, first committed to the Fairtrade Foundation in 2007 and currently stocks 250 Fairtrade-certified products. Sainsbury's, the country's second largest supermarket group, moved to 100 percent Fairtrade tea almost a decade ago, but in May it launched a pilot of its own  fairly traded  scheme on its own brand tea.  We know that times have moved on and our farmers in Africa are facing increasing challenges. That’s why we’re now trialing a scheme where farmers receive even more funding and support than Fairtrade,  a spokesman for Sainsbury's said on Monday.  We’d be happy to share our progress with other retailers,  he said. Sainsbury's board was criticised over the pilot at its annual shareholders' meeting last Wednesday, with some private investors and campaign groups voicing concerns the scheme could be extended to other products. That prompted Chief Executive Mike Coupe to defend the trial.  We're committed to the base standards that Fairtrade currently apply. But we have to move them on to make sure that they cover environmental and economic standards as well,  he said. He stressed that the results of the pilot would be published  in an open and transparent way.

Alphabet unit Google, the world's most popular internet search engine, is drawing on the expertise of at least five top law firms in Brussels to help it deal with its EU regulatory troubles, people familiar with the matter said. The EU competition authority hit the company with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty last month for unfairly favoring its shopping service. Antirust regulators are also weighing a record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and a third case involves its AdSense for Search platform. The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second highest, will be the first battleground for Google if, as expected, it challenges the European Commission's June decision and potentially disruptive changes to its business practices. Cleary Gottlieb, Allen & Overy, Slaughter and May,  Garrigues and White & Case have all been tapped by Google. Google did not immediately respond to an email for comment. The company's decision to rely on a diverse range of lawyers makes sense because of the risks it faces, Ian Giles, a partner at London-based law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said.  Given the potential penalties and damages actions it faces, Google will want to invest in the best possible defense team, and direct legal costs will be a relatively minor consideration,  he said.  There may be simple capacity reasons as to why they are sharing the workload between a number of law firms, but there is also value to seeking a second opinion, reconsidering strategy, and bringing new ideas to the table,  Giles said. Expect fireworks, economist Georgios Petropoulos at think-tank Bruegel said.  There has been no similar case in European law in the past. It is a very challenging case and difficult to prove one or the other,  he said, referring to issues such as market dominance, definition of the relevant market, among others. Google may also well be preparing for expensive litigation ahead from rivals that do not need to establish its liability following the Commission's ruling on Google shopping.  The (Commission's mention of a) 45-fold increase in traffic to Google shopping and the 85 percent drop in traffic to some competitor sites suggest there is significant potential for such actions, as does the size of the penalty,  Collyer Bristow lawyer Stephen Critchley wrote in a recent note. The legal battles will also provide helpful markers for the fast-moving tech industry and regulators struggling to impose old rules on new markets and dominant social platforms, said Petropoulos.  We need some decisions on what is good and what is bad. All these will provide more clarity on how this market works,  he said. Cleary Gottlieb is advising on the Google shopping case, Allen & Overy together with Cleary on the Android smartphone case and Slaughter and May on the AdSense case, the sources said. Garrigues and White & Case, which signed up former General Court judge Nicholas Forwood last year, are also providing competition advice.  Forwood took part in the Luxembourg court's 2007 and 2012 rulings on Microsoft, which did battle with the EU in several investigations that ultimately cost it more than 2.2 billion euros in penalties.

The European Union imposed the sanctions after Russia's 2014 annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine, a move it sees as breaking international law.  Siemens, which has repeatedly insisted it was not aware the turbines were destined for Crimea, said it would press criminal charges against those responsible for diverting the turbines.   Siemens has received information from reliable sources that at least two of the four gas turbine sets, which were delivered for the project in Taman, Southern Russia, have been moved to Crimea against our will,  it said in a statement.   Over the last few months, our customer has confirmed to us numerous times in writing that a delivery to Crimea would not occur. As a consequence, Siemens will initiate criminal charges against the responsible individuals.   Reuters reported last week that the Siemens turbines had been delivered to Crimea.  A Siemens spokesman said the customer in question was Russian state-owned engineering company Technopromexport, which bought the turbines from Siemens. Technopromexport had no immediate comment, and Russia's energy ministry declined to comment. Related CoverageRussian minister says power project in Crimea will go aheadVladimir Putin, who is expected to seek reelection as Russian president next year, has vowed to ensure energy security for Crimea, but has no home-grown company that could easily supply such turbines. The Kremlin said on Monday the power turbines being installed in Crimea had been made in Russia using Russian components - an apparent reference to the fact that the turbines were produced at a factory in St. Petersburg. The plant's owner, Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies LLC, is 65 percent owned by Siemens and uses Siemens technology. Diplomacy            Siemens - a multinational whose activities include trains,  factory automation and healthcare equipment - will mark 170 years' presence in Russia this year, and invested about 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) there in the early years of this decade, mostly in energy. Joe Kaeser met Putin several times during his first year as chief executive, including a widely criticized visit to Russia shortly after the annexation of Crimea during which he reaffirmed his commitment to the country. Germany is still one of Russia's top trading partners. A spokesman for the German Economy Ministry, when asked about the Siemens affair on Monday, said that it was up to Siemens to ensure it respected the EU sanctions. The issue has been raised in diplomatic circles in Moscow, a Siemens source familiar with the matter said.  Three sources close to the matter told Reuters last week that Russia's ZAO Interautomatika had been hired to help install the turbines in Crimea. Siemens said on Monday it had expanded investigations by an internal taskforce to all of its Russian-based entities and relevant partners to ensure that no equipment or services could be supplied that could violate export control restrictions.  This also applies to Siemens' minority stake in Interautomatika,  it said, adding that Interautomatika had confirmed in writing Siemens' insistence that all relevant activities with respect to Crimea be immediately terminated. Siemens added that it would file lawsuits to halt any further deliveries to Crimea and to return already-dispatched equipment to its original destination. It said it was evaluating what additional actions were possible. The Siemens source had earlier told Reuters that the company was taking legal steps to address the issue.

Jeffrey Pearlman, a former Insys district sales manager, had sought to modify his bail conditions so that he could continue using marijuana prescribed by a New Jersey doctor to help kick an opioid addiction he developed after a spine injury. Pearlman is one of several former employees and executives of Arizona-based Insys to face U.S. charges related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients containing fentanyl, an addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. His lawyers argued that requiring Pearlman to give up medical marijuana would force him to return to using opioids, impairing his constitutional rights to fully participate in his defense and to due process. But U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Merriam in New Haven, Connecticut said on Friday that argument rested on the  faulty assumption  that Pearlman would have to go back to using opioids when in fact other treatment options exist.  Other reasonable treatments exist; indeed, in states with no medical marijuana law or more restrictive laws, patients with defendant's condition must use other forms of treatment,  she wrote. Defendants who are out on bail are also required to not violate federal law, and that possession of marijuana, even if legal under state law, remains illegal under federal law, Merriam said. A lawyer for Pearlman did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. Federal prosecutors in Boston in December charged six ex-Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, who prosecutors say participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys. They have pleaded not guilty. Insys has said it is working toward a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. Prosecutors said Pearlman and sales representatives he managed induced doctors, advanced practice registered nurses and physicians' assistants to prescribe Insys' fentanyl spray by paying them to participate in sham  speaker programs.  Speaker fees ranged from $1,000 to several thousands of dollars, prosecutors said. One Connecticut healthcare provider who participated in these programs earned $83,500 in kickbacks to prescribe Insys' fentanyl spray, prosecutors said. Pearlman has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate anti-kickback laws. He is scheduled to face trial in November. The case is U.S. v.

The French Open champion, who has shaken up women's tennis with her high-risk game, passed up seven chances to finish off Wimbledon opponent Elina Svitolina, but rather than go into her shell she merely took her high-risk game up a notch. She eventually blasted her way into the quarter-finals for the first time with a 6-3 7-6(6) victory on Monday in which she struck a remarkable 42 winners and made 39 unforced errors. To put those stats into perspective, her opponent, the Ukrainian fourth seed, hit 14 of each.  Related CoverageOstapenko loss seems hard to stomach for Svitolina I really needed to stay very aggressive to win the point,  the Latvian told reporters.  Even the match points, the rallies were really long. I really had to go for it to win the match.  Ostapenko does not do defensive tennis and the idea that you might seek to win a point by waiting for your opponent to make a mistake is anathema to the hard-hitting Latvian.  The tactic seems to be working out well on Wimbledon's fast lawns. The 13th seed, who faces Venus Williams in the next round, is now just three matches away from completing what would be astonishing grand slam double.

This was only her second win against a top five-player, following her success against Simona Halep in the final at Roland Garros, and despite a brief wobble in the second set it never looked in doubt.  Slideshow (2 Images)She broke in the opening game with one of many forehand winners and again for a 4-1 lead.  The weaknesses in her game were also apparent, however, and the error count was also swiftly mounting as Svitolina broke back following an Ostapenko double fault. That was not the start of a comeback, however, and Ostapenko wrapped up the first set with another break before racing into a 5-2 lead in the second.  Against Venus, she will probably need to be more ruthless than she was in finishing off Svitolina.  She passed up a match point at 5-2, four more in the following game and after being pegged back and forced into a tiebreak, where she missed two more chances to kill off the game, Svitolina netted a backhand to hand her opponent the match.

Jeffrey Pearlman, a former Insys district sales manager, had sought to modify his bail conditions so that he could continue using marijuana prescribed by a New Jersey doctor to help kick an opioid addiction he developed after a spine injury. Pearlman is one of several former employees and executives of Arizona-based Insys to face U.S. charges related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients containing fentanyl, an addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. His lawyers argued that requiring Pearlman to give up medical marijuana would force him to return to using opioids, impairing his constitutional rights to fully participate in his defense and to due process. But U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Merriam in New Haven, Connecticut said on Friday that argument rested on the  faulty assumption  that Pearlman would have to go back to using opioids when in fact other treatment options exist.  Other reasonable treatments exist; indeed, in states with no medical marijuana law or more restrictive laws, patients with defendant's condition must use other forms of treatment,  she wrote. Defendants who are out on bail are also required to not violate federal law, and that possession of marijuana, even if legal under state law, remains illegal under federal law, Merriam said. A lawyer for Pearlman did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. Federal prosecutors in Boston in December charged six ex-Insys executives and managers, including former Chief Executive Michael Babich, who prosecutors say participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys. They have pleaded not guilty. Insys has said it is working toward a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. Prosecutors said Pearlman and sales representatives he managed induced doctors, advanced practice registered nurses and physicians' assistants to prescribe Insys' fentanyl spray by paying them to participate in sham  speaker programs.  Speaker fees ranged from $1,000 to several thousands of dollars, prosecutors said. One Connecticut healthcare provider who participated in these programs earned $83,500 in kickbacks to prescribe Insys' fentanyl spray, prosecutors said. Pearlman has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate anti-kickback laws. He is scheduled to face trial in November. The case is U.S. v.

The city will be developed over 50-square km of land in the oil producing region, SPA said quoting a cabinet statement. An earlier report said the city will be close to Abqaiq and will develop energy-related industries.  The government approved Aramco's offer to set up a developer that will undertake laying out the infrastructure of the city, manage its fixed assets.  This company will eventually own the fixed assets in the city. Aramco will also set up another company to handle operations and maintenance of the city. SPA did not provide further details on the Energy Industrial City which have been in Aramco's plans for a few years. Low oil prices have drastically slowed Saudi Arabia's economy so it is trying to create manufacturing jobs and produce goods and services which it has traditionally imported. Its strategy is to use large amounts of government money and the procurement budgets of big state-run enterprises, such as national oil firm Aramco, to attract foreign expertise to develop strategic industries. The creation of  industrial cities  - huge projects in which state institutions play key roles in planning and raising finance, but which seek to attract private investment - is part of the government's efforts to jump-start development. A senior Aramco official said in March, investments in the city are expected to be 16.5 billion riyals ($4.4 billion). In May, Saudi Aramco signed deals to build the Gulf's largest shipyard through a joint venture with three companies, a $5.2 billion project aimed at helping reduce the economy's reliance on oil and create jobs, a key part of Vision 2030.  The country in general is pushing manufacturing big time and Aramco is playing a bigger role to promote local manufacturing with potential added value to the industry,  said a source.  Expanding energy industries will achieve the target set by the kingdom to promote local content, the energy city is the core of localizing the solar industry for example as well as oil and gas services and the establishment of two companies could be seen as something that is in line with the arrangements of Aramco's privatization plans,  said Fadl al-Buainain, a Saudi economist. Saudi Aramco said in its 2016 annual review released on Thursday the value of its direct material procurement from local manufacturers increased by $800 million to $2.9 billion in 2016, representing 43.5 percent of its material procurement spending and is the highest level of local content in the its history.  Aramco launched the In-Kingdom Total Value Add (IKTVA) initiative to double the percentage of locally produced energy-related goods and services to 70 percent of the total spent by 2021.

The 28-year-old seventh seed has reached the quarter-finals this year almost under the radar with straight-set victories over solid opponents Philipp Kohlschreiber, Florian Mayer and Steve Johnson, before downing Bautista Agut, who is ranked a healthy 19th in the world. But the Spaniard looked way out of his depth against the 1.98m (6 ft 6 in) Cilic, who used every centimeter of his height on the fast surface to serve nine aces and whack 39 winners past  his opponent, who stands 15 cm shorter.  You have everywhere advantages and disadvantages,  Cilic said of his size and reach.  (It's) just the way you take them and tennis is a game that is extremely complex and you can play it any way you want, so you have to obviously use your advantages well.  Court 12 is billed as a show court, but it is a small arena well to the south of the All England Club ground and away from the hurly burly of the central stages. Cilic, a former U.S. Open champion, clearly thrived out of the limelight, wrapping up the match in a brisk one hour 40 minutes.   Bautista Agut tried everything, looking for tight angles on groundstrokes and attempting dropshots. He even tried to finish a long rally in the second set with a lob only to see Cilic jump up and win the point with a high backhand volley. The in-form Croat, runner-up at the Queen's Club warm-up tournament last month, wobbled a little as he served for a place in the last eight, with the Spaniard saving three match points. But Cilic sealed the match on the fourth with a big serve that Bautista Agut could only parry into the net. It is the fourth time in a row that Cilic has reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals and he has rarely looked more comfortable.   With all the parts of my game...the level is, I would say, quite solid,  Cilic said.   Considering that, (I'm) returning well, serving well. I'm moving on the court really good. So with everything, really satisfied.  Cilic has spent nearly a year with coach Jonas Bjorkman, who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2006, and said the Swede had helped add  small pieces  to his game.  He has helped me also a little bit with the mental attitude. We worked also on my serve as also on the other shots. I feel it's getting much more consistent now and also following up after the serve has been working so well.  He will meet Rafa Nadal or Gilles Muller in the last eight on Wednesday.

And then we get to the real nigger in the wood pile which is, in two years, what will happen if there is no deal,  she told a gathering of politicians, lawyers and senior city figures.

May said she had been shocked to hear about the comment, which she described as  completely unacceptable .  I immediately asked the Chief Whip to suspend the party whip,  May said in a statement.  Language like this has absolutely no place in politics or in today’s society.  Suspending the party whip means Morris is excluded from the party and will sit as an independent, potentially reducing May's ability to pass legislation. Her government already relies on a smaller party after losing its majority at a June election. Morris can still choose to vote in line with the government, and is likely to continue to do so. May did not say how long the suspension would last or if expulsion was possible. Several lawmakers, both from the main opposition parties and from within the Conservatives, had called for Morris to be suspended for her use of the phrase, believed to be rooted in slavery in the United States.  It came to be used to describe something unexpected and wrong but is now generally viewed with disdain as racist.

Macron, 39, who won election in May as France's youngest leader since Napoleon, was due to arrive later on Monday and be part of Paris's 2024 presentation to IOC members on Tuesday as the French capital goes up against a bid from Los Angeles. LA 2024's bid team will also present on Tuesday but, as is usually the case at this July IOC meeting, it will not have any political support on site. Heads of state are usually present at the host city vote, which this year will take place in September to give their bid a final push, but Macron has opted to be present now.  It is a very good sign to say that we are confident and we will win,  Hidalgo told reporters, referring to Macron's presence.  It is very good for us, very good for us.  This is not the first time Macron will meet with the IOC, having hosted its evaluation commission two days after being elected to office.

Four other cities dropped out of the race out of cost concerns. That forced the IOC to change the bidding process and award two Games at the same time, making bidding more attractive to potential hosts.

Los Angeles has hinted it would accept the 2028 Olympics.  We wanted to engage immediately with the new president (Macron). He was very receptive and committed. Two days after taking office he decided to welcome the evaluation commission,  said 2024 Games co-chair Tony Estanguet.  For him  it is a national project, a national priority.  The Games were previously staged in Paris in 1900 and 1924, and in Los Angeles in 1932 and 1984.

In a Monday conference call with investors, Chief Financial Officer Adezio Lima said Cemig had decided to fully dispose of a majority, 43 percent stake in Rio de Janeiro utility Light SA and focus on in-house generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. Cemig, Brazil's No. 3 power utility, is making headway on efforts to cut capital spending this year after losing the licensing rights for several hydropower dams and seeing a surge in fresh capital needs from some subsidiaries, Lima said. There are 13 interested parties in the Light stake, he added. Reuters first reported Cemig's plans to exit Light in March. The state-controlled utility wants to ease creditor concerns over how it will repay debt by downsizing after growing too big, too fast in the past decade. A federal government decision that scrapped power contracts brought about a decline in the value of Cemig's power assets, tripling its debt since 2012.  What's clear is that Cemig's cash generation is not enough to honor looming maturities,  said Raul Grego Lemos, an analyst with Eleven Financial Research. Lima expects banks to agree on terms for longer Cemig maturities within 20 days. Every percentage-point decline in Brazil's benchmark overnight rate cuts Cemig's debt-servicing costs by 125 million reais, he said. Cemig's preferred shares rose 1.3 percent to 8.43 reais on Monday afternoon trading. Subpar Returns Cemig's divestiture plans have taken longer than those of rivals, demonstrating the difficulties of trimming a company that expanded beyond power into fiber optics, information technology and gas distribution in recent years. Most of those takeovers have delivered subpar returns. Proceeds from the sale of a stake in power transmission firm Taesa Transmissora Aliança de Energia SA could be used to facilitate the Light exit, Lima said. The process to conclude the sale of Cemig's stake in Renova Energia SA could take up to 60 days, Lima said. On Friday, Reuters reported that Brookfield Asset Management Inc proposed buying out the stakes that Cemig and Light have in Renova. Lima said negotiations to exit the Santo Antônio hydropower dam are near conclusion and pending regulatory approval. $1 = 3.2702 reais Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Luciano Costa; Editing by Bill Rigby and Andrew Hay","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/cemig-divestiture-idUSL1N1K10GY"},

The American, seeded 24, won the last-16 match 7-6(4) 6-4 to advance to the quarter-finals. She was more aggressive and took more risks than Wozniacki, and her strategy paid off - she fired 38 winners across the net compared with her opponent's 16. She credited her increased focus on court to her coaching partnership with former Wimbledon champion Cash, who she hired in the run-up to the tournament.  He's kept the same kind of mantra through the start of us working together ... of focusing - it's kind of the demand he has,  Vandeweghe said of the Australian, adding that he had spent Sunday night celebrating the 30th anniversary of his 1987 victory at the championships.

She will be the favourite against 87th-ranked Magdalena Rybarikova, even though the Slovak beat her at the French Open in May. Against Wozniacki on Monday, there was little between the two players in the first set, which Vandeweghe edged in the tiebreak. She closed out the match with a break at the end of the second set, forcing an error from her Danish opponent with a ferocious crosscourt forehand.      Wozniacki, who had beaten Vandeweghe in their two previous encounters, said she had nothing to prove to the outside world.  I don't play tennis for anyone else, I play for myself. I love being out there. I'm not there to prove anything to anyone except for myself,  said the 26-year-old, who has finished two seasons as world number one - 2010 and 2011 - but has never won a grand slam.

Feinberg has overseen compensation funds for the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, General Motors (GM.N) ignition switch victims and the fallout from the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (BP.L). He also worked as an consultant to Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) on a compensation program stemming from its massive diesel emissions cheating scandal. Federal judge Edward Chen in San Francisco said in an order issued last week that  there is a pressing need to determine if all or some of the pending matters can be resolved by the parties sooner rather than later.

The Patriot battery was brought to the Siauliai military airbase on Monday, ahead of the Tobruk Legacy exercise, and will be withdrawn when the exercise ends on July 22, a Lithuanian defense ministry spokeswoman told Reuters. The NATO wargames take place ahead of the large-scale Zapad 2017 exercise by Russia and Belarus which NATO officials believe could bring more than 100,000 troops to the borders of Poland and the three Baltic NATO allies - the biggest such Russian maneuvers since 2013.  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia possess only short-range anti-aircraft missiles, leaving the skies largely unprotected in the event of hostilities and have expressed concern about their air defense weakness following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. As a deterrent to Russia in the flashpoint region, the United States has deployed detachments of troops since the Crimea annexation, which have been augmented by four NATO battle groups of more than 1,000 soldiers. Referring to the NATO exercise starting on Tuesday, Lithuania's Defence Minister Raimondas Karoblis said:  The deployment of Patriots is important because it demonstrates that such moves are no longer a taboo in the region.   It proves that the missiles can be brought to wherever they are needed, which is very important,  he told Reuters.

The sources acknowledged that European infrastructure data networks face regular attacks similar to those which the Washington Post newspaper said on Sunday had been launched by Russian government hackers against business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other companies involved in energy production. One former senior British security official said it was an  article of faith  that Russian government hackers were seeking to penetrate UK critical infrastructure though the official said he could not cite public case studies. A European security source acknowledged that UK authorities were aware of the latest reports about infrastructure hacking attempts and that British authorities were in regular contact with other governments over the attacks. UK authorities declined to comment on the extent of any such attempted or successful attacks in Britain or elsewhere in Europe or to discuss what possible security measures governments and infrastructure operators might be taking.  The Washington Post said recent attempted Russian hacking attacks on infrastructure related systems in the United States appeared to be an effort to  assess  such networks. But there was no evidence that hackers had actually penetrated or disrupted key systems controlling operations at nuclear plants. The Post cited several U.S. and industry officials saying that this was the first time hackers associated with the Russian government are known to have tried to get into US nuclear power companies.  The newspaper said that in late June the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the U.S. Homeland Security Department warned energy companies that unnamed foreign hackers were trying to steal login and password information so they could hack into networks. U.S. officials have acknowledged that many key computer systems which run critical infrastructure ranging from power grids to transportation networks originally were not built with strong security protection against outside hackers.  Security experts in the U.S. and Europe acknowledge that the development and evolution of security measures to protect critical infrastructure system against outside intruders has often run behind the ability of hackers to invent tools to get inside such systems.

Surveys on Monday showed that major companies have curtailed investment plans and consumers have spent less on their credit cards, adding to a picture of a British economy struggling to regain momentum after a soft start to the year. A strong U.S. payrolls report on Friday afternoon added to the pain for the pound after unexpected falls in already slow UK construction, manufacturing and industrial output.      That raises the stakes ahead of UK wage and unemployment numbers this week. Poor readings on those could further undermine the credibility of Bank officials' statements about possible rate increases in the coming months. Sterling traded as low as $1.2855 on Monday, its weakest since June 28, before edging up to $1.2878 by 1630 GMT. That was still down 0.1 percent on the day. It was flat against the euro at 88.51 pence.   There is some scepticism in the FX market as to whether the BoE will really follow through on raising rates,  said MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman.   There is a little bit of concern over whether the economy has started to slow (and) that’s one of the reasons sterling is still struggling to break above $1.30, alongside the political uncertainty since the election.  Hardman added that a major point of focus this week would be a speech on Wednesday by BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent. If he hints that rates should be raised in the coming months, that would give sterling a significant lift, said Hardman, and should quieten the Bank's naysayers.  Many companies and investors had begun to believe the worst of the pound's post-Brexit referendum sell-off was now behind them. But there are now nerves that a weak government and the impact of a slow departure from Europe could leave the currency exposed over the coming years.   Little sign of wage growth could trigger a BoE reality check,  said ING analyst Viraj Patel.   With markets still pricing in around a 45 percent chance of a rate hike later this year, we continue to believe that a dovish repricing – and a move lower in short-term UK rates – remains the key downside risk to sterling in the near-term.

MetroCast is the latest acquisition in a rapidly consolidating U.S. cable sector that has seen regional providers find new homes in recent months. In April, U.S. cable mogul John Malone's Liberty Interactive Corp said it would acquire Alaska-based cable provider General Communication Inc while private-equity backed RCN announced it would buy Wave in May. Cogeco shares rose about 2 percent to C$81.28. The deal, which includes a $315 million equity investment by Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), will add about 120,000 internet and 76,000 video customers to Atlantic Broadband's U.S. base. The deal allows the company  to increase its presence in the growing and lucrative U.S. cable market,  Cogeco's Chief Executive Officer Louis Audet said in a statement. In an attempt to find growth outside of Canada, Cogeco first entered the U.S. market in 2012 when it bought Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion. Cogeco said it expects MetroCast to have about $230 million in revenue for 2017 and adjusted earnings of $121 million. Cogeco said Atlantic Broadband should realize tax benefits of about $310 million, and after adjusting for these tax benefits, it is paying about 9 times MetroCast's adjusted annual earnings. MetroCast's network covers areas in New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. Atlantic Broadband previously acquired MetroCast's Connecticut business in 2015. Credit Suisse was Cogeco's financial adviser, and Stikeman Elliott and Kirkland & Ellis LLP were its legal advisers. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP legally advised Harron Communications, which sold MetroCast.

Trading resumed fully later on Monday, with quotes for individual stocks finally restored with just over an hour of trade left after three attempts to re-open.  The disruption frustrated traders and put a spotlight on the NSE when it is facing a regulatory probe over whether some brokers were given unfair access to its servers. The glitch also coincides with a string of record highs for Indian share indexes, including on Monday, with the country's stock markets attracting billions of dollars in foreign investments. The NSE attributed the disruption to an unidentified  software problem  and said it had not been related to any cyber-attack.  NSE deeply apologises for the glitch. The matter is being examined by the internal technical team and external vendors, to analyse and identify the cause which led to the issue and to suggest solutions to prevent recurrence,  the exchange said. Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said in a statement it had asked for a detailed report on the matter and ordered NSE to review its contingency plans for dealing with trading disruptions. The Finance Ministry has also asked for a report, a senior ministry official said. This will increase scrutiny of the NSE, which submitted an application for an initial public offering in December but has yet to win regulatory approval for the listing that bankers estimate could raise as much as $1 billion. The NSE's listing plans have been delayed by a regulatory investigation due to its disclosure in December that some brokers may have been provided unfair access to its servers in recent years. The NSE has also had to cope with a management upheaval after previous chief executive Chitra Ramkrishna resigned shortly before the NSE's disclosure about the potentially unfair access provided to traders, citing personal reasons. Newly appointed CEO Vikram Limaye is due to take over later this month. Traders Fume The disruption, which affected traders from the market's open, lasted longer than a three-hour disruption at its rival exchange, the BSE Ltd, in July 2014 because of a network outage. Traders were angry about the lack of communication and questioned why NSE did not have a back-up plan.     Although the markets re-opened for trading at midday, traders were frustrated that individual stocks were not immediately updating, or had wide gaps in bid and offer prices.  NSE said in a statement it had not invoked its business continuity plan because it was reserved for natural disasters, hardware failures and connectivity-related issues and added it had expected to rectify the problem quickly. Most traders switched to the BSE, which saw a surge in trading volumes by about 50 percent from last week's average, while shares rose as much as 1.2 percent to a record high. After trading resumed, the NSE's broader index .NSEI also rose as much as 1.2 percent to a record high, but volumes were only a fraction of the average seen last week. The NSE is by far the larger index of the two, and hence any disruption is felt more widely.  Varun Khandelwal, managing director of brokerage Bullero Capital, criticized the NSE for keeping traders in the dark.  He said the exchange then compounded the confusion with failed attempts at re-starting trade and by allowing derivatives trading to continue before finally fixing the lack of stock price updates.  Such a situation is very unfortunate and reflects very poorly on the managerial oversight at the NSE presently,  he said.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is expected to face a tough political fight over the regulation, which would make it easier for customers to join class-action lawsuits. Many observers expect the Republican-led Congress to swiftly try to repeal it. The CFPB released a draft of the rule more than a year ago, when former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was still in office. The regulator said that class actions, where people band together to sue over the same alleged wrongdoing, would make lawsuits more affordable. Many Republicans, including President Donald Trump, are skeptical of the CFPB as well as class actions, which they say waste time and money without helping possible victims of fraud. The CFPB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the timing of the CFPB's final rule.

A spokesman for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin region, Rojhat Roj, said the Turkish military and Syrian rebels it supports shelled Tal Rifaat, Sheikh Issa and other towns north of Aleppo city. The bombardment with  artillery and rocket launchers  killed two people and injured seven, he said. Kurdish fighters and allied groups retaliated and firing was continuing. There was no immediate comment from the Turkish army. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said the two sides exchanged fire in the area. The mounting tensions between two U.S. allies in northwest Syria threaten to open another major front in the multi-sided Syrian war.  The head of the YPG told Reuters last week that Turkish military deployments near Kurdish-held areas of northwest Syria amounted to a  declaration of war . Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus retorted that his country was not declaring war but that its forces would respond to any hostile move by the YPG. Rebels said last week that the Turkish deployment aimed to regain control of a string of Arab villages near the border which Kurdish-led militias seized last year. Turkish policy in northern Syria has focused on countering the growing sway of Kurdish groups which have established autonomous regions since Syria's conflict began in 2011. Ankara sees the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades.

In a test of several consumer wearable activity monitors and one used by researchers and doctors, the accuracy of step counts was better when the device was worn at the waist versus the wrist, but also varied widely depending on walking or running speed. “Current world health recommendations are for people to complete 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week to assist with improving overall health outcomes,” senior study author Belinda Parmenter told Reuters Health by email. “Studies have indicated that a reference goal of 10,000 steps per day can also provide an appropriate level of activity to meet the minimum recommendations,” said Parmenter, an exercise physiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. She and her colleagues recruited 31 adults to complete three minutes on a treadmill at five different speeds ranging from about 3 miles per hour to about 7.5 miles per hour. The researchers videotaped each session to manually count steps for comparison to the monitors. Each participant wore an Actigraph monitor - often used by researchers and clinicians for sleep or activity monitoring - on the waist and another Actigraph on the wrist. They also wore a Fitbit One on the waist, and on both wrists, a Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge HR and Jawbone UP24. When the study team examined step counts for all the devices, they found errors ranging from about 41 percent for the wrist-worn Actigraph and less than 1 percent for both the waist-worn Fitbit One and Actigraph, according to the report in Gait and Posture.  For instance, in three-minute bouts at speeds ranging from 5 kilometers per hour to 12 kph, the Actigraph monitor worn at the waist had average step counts less than 1 percent more or less than the manual count by the researchers. But worn on the wrist, the Actigraph was off by an average 29 percent at slow speeds to 50 percent at the highest speed. Fitbit One worn at the waist was always less than 2 percent off the manual count, while wrist-worn monitors ranged from less than 1 percent to about 12 percent difference, depending on speed.  “The Fitbit One worn around the waist performed the most accurate across all speeds when compared to all the devices worn around the wrist (Jawbone, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Flex, Actigraph),” Parmenter said. “During walking and running, the body’s center of mass is located at the pelvis. Movement of the center of mass provides the best indication of whole body movement.” Since waist-worn devices are close to the pelvis, they can provide more accurate measurements of the body’s movement than wrist-worn devices, she added. But among the wrist-worn devices, the Jawbone was the most accurate, performing well at both the slower walking speeds of the average adult, as well as the running speeds, Parmenter said. “Other wrist-worn devices became more accurate as walking/running speed increased. For researchers, the Actigraph wGT3XBT worn on the waist matched the Fitbit One.”  People using step counts to meet the physical activity recommendations of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise (or 30 minutes five times a week) can do so by completing at least 3,000 steps in 30 minutes, she added. “These studies have shown that this equates to an intensity high enough to meet the current physical activity recommendations. So, for healthy individuals, as one way to meet the recommendations, we could be aiming to complete 3,000 steps in 30 minutes at least 5 times a week, as a part of our 10,000 steps a day goal,” Parmenter said. The study also found that for the wrist-worn devices, there was no difference between the step counts measured on the dominant and non-dominant hand, Parmenter noted. “However, the results are based purely on a treadmill test and did not include the effects of activities of daily living such as brushing teeth etc. More studies need to be done in a free-living environment,” she said.

Morocco, the region's biggest energy importer, has been working with a technical mission from the IMF on liberalising its currency regime after a drop in global oil prices helped strengthen its finances. Two weeks ago, Morocco's central bank postponed a planned announcement of the first phase of the reform for  a few days . The central bank gave no reason for the delay, but last week Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani said the government needed  further studies  of the liberalisation plan. Postponing  by a few days, or weeks, is not a problem , said Nicolas Blancher, head of mission for Morocco in the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia Department.  Morocco has been ready, as we've already said. It's a sovereign and voluntary decision the Moroccan authorities have taken as part of a long process of integrating the country into the world economy,  he told reporters in the Moroccan capital, Rabat, after an IMF staff visit to Morocco.  We don't see any big exposure to risk, we've done stress tests in the financial sector and we've seen the resistance of the Moroccan economy to external shocks,  he said, adding that there was  no fundamental reason for the dirham to depreciate.  Othmani has dismissed speculation that the liberalisation plan ran into problems and denied reports that one reason for the delay was a depletion of foreign reserves by $4.4 billion in the last two months. Central bank governor Abdellatif Jouahri has said the reform programme would not include any planned devaluation of the currency. Blancher, who met Othmani earlier on Monday, also said it was up to Moroccan authorities whether they wanted to renew a two-year, $3.5 billion credit line agreed in July 2016 that is intended to help Morocco carry out structural reform.

In a rulemaking petition seen by Reuters, a coalition of 25 institutional investors including the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) has called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to craft regulations requiring public companies to provide details they see as material to investors. These would include details about worker demographics, skillsets, safety, productivity, human rights, compensation and incentives, the petition shows. Under current rules, companies are only required to provide investors with an employee headcount.  The way you structure and pay a sales force ... can definitely affect the business performance,  said Meredith Miller, the chief corporate governance officer with UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, a leading coalition member.   Effective management of human capital can really boost the bottom line for a company, and at the same time, poor management of workforce issues like training and development, or health and safety or diversity, can create liability.  The 29-page petition, seen by Reuters, lays out an argument for why so-called human capital management disclosures would be material to investors, though it does not prescribe how those disclosures should be presented and defers that decision to the SEC. The demand for additional information on how companies treat their workers comes less than a year after Wells Fargo & Co was fined by U.S. regulators who found that its compensation structure and unrealistic sales goals led employees to open some two million unauthorized accounts. The petition cites a series of studies about how workforce issues can impact companies' bottom lines as evidence for why new disclosure rules are needed. For instance, one study cited in the petition found that cutting work hours - a common practice among retailers - was found to harm a company's profitability. The SEC typically receives a handful or more of public rulemaking petitions each year from interested stakeholders such as trade groups and good governance non-profits. But the SEC is not required to take up the proposals.  A 2011 petition calling for companies to disclose their political spending, for instance, was never formally proposed by the agency despite receiving a record number of comments and signatures.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said two of Lilly Cassirer's great-grandchildren may sue the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum for the return of Camille Pissarro's 1897 depiction of a Paris street scene,  Rue Saint-Honoré, Après-midi, Effet de Pluie.  Monday's decision revived a 16-year legal battle that began after the Cassirers learned that the Pissarro, whose value may exceed $40 million, was on display in the Madrid museum, its home since 1992. Applying Spanish law, the appeals court said it was an open question whether the museum knew the painting was stolen when it acquired it in 1993 in a $338 million purchase of Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza's art collection. It said that price was well below the collection's estimated $1 billion to $2 billion value, and the baron may have known he also got a bargain when he bought the Pissarro from a New York art dealer for $275,000 in 1976.  The Cassirers have created a triable issue of fact whether (the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection) knew the painting was stolen from Lilly when TBC purchased the painting from the Baron,  Circuit Judge Carlos Bea wrote.  There is a triable issue of fact as to the Baron's good faith.  Bea also said Lilly Cassirer did not waive her ownership rights when Germany's government paid her 120,000 marks for the loss of the painting in 1958, when its whereabouts were unknown. The Pasadena, California-based appeals court returned the case to U.S. District Judge John Walter in Los Angeles, who dismissed the lawsuit in June 2015.   We're obviously very pleased,  said Stephen Zack, a Boies, Schiller & Flexner partner representing the Cassirers, in a phone interview.  This has been a scar they've had to deal with for generations.  David Boies, a prominent U.S. lawyer, had argued the  Cassirers' appeal. Thaddeus Stauber, a lawyer for the foundation that runs the museum, wrote in an email that the baron and the museum acquired the Pissarro in good faith.  We remain confident that the foundation's ownership of the painting will once again be confirmed,  Stauber said. Both sides agreed that Lilly Cassirer's sale of the Pissarro to Berlin art dealer Jackob Scheidwimmer amounted to a forcible taking. Pissarro's works had been popular among European Jewish collectors.

MetroCast is the latest acquisition in a rapidly consolidating U.S. cable sector that has seen regional providers find new homes in recent months. In April, U.S. cable mogul John Malone's Liberty Interactive Corp said it would acquire Alaska-based cable provider General Communication Inc while private-equity backed RCN announced it would buy Wave in May. Cogeco shares rose about 2 percent to C$81.28.   The deal, which includes a $315 million equity investment by Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), will add about 120,000 internet and 76,000 video customers to Atlantic Broadband's U.S. base.     The deal allows the company  to increase its presence in the growing and lucrative U.S. cable market,  Cogeco's Chief Executive Officer Louis Audet said in a statement. In an attempt to find growth outside of Canada, Cogeco first entered the U.S. market in 2012 when it bought Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion. Cogeco said it expects MetroCast to have about $230 million in revenue for 2017 and adjusted earnings of $121 million. Cogeco said Atlantic Broadband should realize tax benefits of about $310 million, and after adjusting for these tax benefits, it is paying about 9 times MetroCast's adjusted annual earnings.  MetroCast's network covers areas in New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. Atlantic Broadband previously acquired MetroCast's Connecticut business in 2015.

Surveys on Monday showed that major companies have curtailed investment plans and consumers have spent less on their credit cards, adding to a picture of a British economy struggling to regain momentum after a soft start to the year. A strong U.S. payrolls report on Friday afternoon added to the pain for the pound after unexpected falls in already slow UK construction, manufacturing and industrial output.      That raises the stakes ahead of UK wage and unemployment numbers this week. Poor readings on those could further undermine the credibility of Bank officials' statements about possible rate increases in the coming months. Sterling traded as low as $1.2855 on Monday, its weakest since June 28, before edging up to $1.2878 by 1630 GMT. That was still down 0.1 percent on the day.

There is a little bit of concern over whether the economy has started to slow (and) that’s one of the reasons sterling is still struggling to break above $1.30, alongside the political uncertainty since the election.  Hardman added that a major point of focus this week would be a speech on Wednesday by BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent. If he hints that rates should be raised in the coming months, that would give sterling a significant lift, said Hardman, and should quieten the Bank's naysayers.  Many companies and investors had begun to believe the worst of the pound's post-Brexit referendum sell-off was now behind them. But there are now nerves that a weak government and the impact of a slow departure from Europe could leave the currency exposed over the coming years.   Little sign of wage growth could trigger a BoE reality check,  said ING analyst Viraj Patel.   With markets still pricing in around a 45 percent chance of a rate hike later this year, we continue to believe that a dovish repricing – and a move lower in short-term UK rates – remains the key downside risk to sterling in the near-term.

MetroCast is the latest acquisition in a rapidly consolidating U.S. cable sector that has seen regional providers find new homes in recent months. In April, U.S. cable mogul John Malone's Liberty Interactive Corp said it would acquire Alaska-based cable provider General Communication Inc while private-equity backed RCN announced it would buy Wave in May. Cogeco shares rose about 2 percent to C$81.28.   The deal, which includes a $315 million equity investment by Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), will add about 120,000 internet and 76,000 video customers to Atlantic Broadband's U.S. base.     The deal allows the company  to increase its presence in the growing and lucrative U.S. cable market,  Cogeco's Chief Executive Officer Louis Audet said in a statement. In an attempt to find growth outside of Canada, Cogeco first entered the U.S. market in 2012 when it bought Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion. Cogeco said it expects MetroCast to have about $230 million in revenue for 2017 and adjusted earnings of $121 million. Cogeco said Atlantic Broadband should realize tax benefits of about $310 million, and after adjusting for these tax benefits, it is paying about 9 times MetroCast's adjusted annual earnings.  MetroCast's network covers areas in New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. Atlantic Broadband previously acquired MetroCast's Connecticut business in 2015. Credit Suisse was Cogeco's financial adviser, and Stikeman Elliott and Kirkland & Ellis LLP were its legal advisers. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP legally advised Harron Communications, which sold MetroCast. CDPQ was advised by CIBC Capital Markets and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.

Detective David March and Officers Joseph Walsh and Thomas Gaffney were each charged last month with conspiracy, official misconduct and obstruction of justice. The men entered their pleas at their arraignment in a packed Chicago courtroom before Circuit Judge Diane Gordon Cannon. The next hearing is Aug. 29. The indictments arose from the 2014 incident in which Laquan McDonald, 17, was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke. Video footage of the incident showed he was shot as he walked away from police while holding a pocket knife. March, Walsh and Gaffney, who were on the scene the night of the shooting, are alleged to have conspired to conceal the facts of McDonald's killing to protect their fellow officer from criminal investigation and prosecution, according to prosecutors. A police dash-cam video of the shooting, released more than a year after the incident, led to days of protests and thrust Chicago into a national debate over the use of excessive force by police against minorities. The indictment said the officers created false reports on the killing of McDonald. Walsh and March are no longer with the force. Gaffney was suspended without pay, Chicago police representatives said. All three men are white. Tom Breen, Walsh's lawyer, told reporters that his client would be acquitted. The judge set bond at $50,000 and released the men on the their own recognizance. Van Dyke, accused of murder in the McDonald shooting, pleaded not guilty in 2015. In March, he pleaded not guilty to 16 new counts of aggravated battery. No trial date has been set. The cases come after Chicago police in May finalized stricter limits on when officers can use firearms and other force, the latest attempt to reform a department roiled by misconduct and criticism in the wake of McDonald's death. Last month, members of Black Lives Matter and other groups sued the city to force federal court oversight of those reforms.  Until people, particularly police officers that do wrong, are held accountable and arrested and put in jail, until that happens there will be no trust among the community and law enforcement,  said the Rev. Michael Pfleger, an activist who was at the hearing.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/chicago-police-idUSL1N1K10V8"},

Investors saw Abercrombie's failure to sell itself as yet another blow to a retail sector already struggling to cope with changing consumer tastes and growing pressure from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other online retailers. Shares of Gap Inc (GPS.N), American Eagle Outfitters Inc (AEO.N) and Express Inc (EXPR.N) all fell more than 4 percent. Abercrombie, which has a market value of $650 million, had said in May it was in talks with several bidders regarding a potential sale, a day after Reuters reported that the retailer was working with an investment bank to field takeover interest from other retailers. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners came closest to acquiring Abercrombie, but could not meet the company's valuation expectations, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.  Sycamore agreed two weeks ago to acquire U.S. office supplies chain Staples Inc (SPLS.O) for $6.9 billion, the biggest deal in the buyout firm's history. A person carries a bag from the Abercrombie & Fitch store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., February 27, 2017.Andrew KellyAmerican Eagle had also looked at striking a deal for Abercrombie in partnership with private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, sources previously told Reuters.  Several teen retailers have struggled as their primary customers have abandoned malls in favor of fast-fashion chains such as European brand Zara (ITX.MC), while the rise of online dropping has forced retailers to slash prices to compete.  Aeropostale Inc, Wet Seal and BCBG Max Azria Group LLC are among the retailers that have filed for bankruptcy over the past two years. New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie defined teen apparel in the 1990s with its risqué advertising and its large logo on apparel, but has been hit hard as a new generation of shoppers avoids heavy branding in favor of more independent style. In response, Abercrombie has attempted to reinvent itself, and dropped its logo in 2014. Abercrombie said on Monday it will focus on its surf-wear brand Hollister, the one bright spot of growth for the company.  Abercrombie also said it will  continue to refine and implement strategies to position the Abercrombie brand for revitalized performance  for its eponymous brand, which has reported falling quarterly sales since 2014.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/abercrombie-ma-idUSL1N1K10V1"},

The proposal to sell privately owned CHX for an undisclosed amount to a consortium led by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group (CCEG) has drawn attention because it would be the first time a U.S. exchange has been bought by Chinese investors. There are also U.S. investors in the group.  With little or no insight and transparency into government-dominated Chinese markets, the SEC will be unable to monitor the ownership structure of CCEG after approval, leaving CHX open to undue, improper, and possibly state-driven influence,  the Republican and Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to the SEC. CHX declined to comment. The SEC, which reviews proposed mergers involving exchanges to ensure they comply with federal regulations and appropriately self-police their brokerage members, said in early June it would take up to another 60 days to make a decision on the sale. CHX is a niche player in the U.S. equities market, executing less than 0.5 percent of U.S. stock transactions. Casin Group, a privately held company that invests in real estate development and financial holdings, said its long-term goal is to list Chinese companies in the United States through CHX, which has locations in Chicago and New Jersey. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns, approved the planned sale in December, but the SEC still needs to sign off for it to go ahead.

Six of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with technology index's 0.69 percent gain boosting the broader index. Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia propped up the S&P; 500 index. The healthcare index was down 0.08 percent, weighed down by Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic. President Donald Trump's effort to roll back Obamacare faced growing obstacles on Monday as Republicans remained divided over how to curb the costs of their proposed healthcare bill and prevent millions from losing coverage.  We're going to have to wait and see what the plan B is. With that I think healthcare obviously comes under pressure as it falls into the void of the unknown,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. Investors were wary of making big bets ahead of the start of the earnings season, with big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup reporting on Friday. In a significant victory for the banking industry, the Fed late last month approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes.  I think that's very reflective of the fact that you've got a market that's looking ahead to catalysts and probably not going to react much in front of them,  Hogan said.  When the market takes a wait-and-see attitude, the markets tend to react like this.  The three major indexes are trading close to record levels, boosted by strong economic data and robust corporate performance in the first quarter. Markets closed on a high on Friday after a better-than-expected payrolls report gave investors more confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy. The dollar climbed to a two-month high against the Japanese yen on Monday as a robust jobs data propped up U.S. Treasury yields. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony is the key highlight of this week for investors looking for cues on further rate hikes. She will testify on Wednesday and Thursday. At 12:31 p.m. ET (16:31 GMT)the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 23.12 points, or 0.11 percent, at 21,437.46, the S&P; 500 was up 4.91 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,430.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 23.83 points, or 0.39 percent, at 6,176.91. Amazon.com Inc shares rose as much as 2 percent to $998.46 ahead of its popular Prime Day shopping festival. United Health was down 0.33 percent at $187.34 after the President Trump's plan to replace Obamacare continued to face obstacles. Abercrombie & Fitch shares were down 21.3 percent at $9.56 after the teen apparel retailer terminated discussion on a potential deal following a review. ClubCorp shares were up 30 percent at $17.08 after the owner of private golf and country clubs got a takeover offer from private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC.

An army convoy was attacked on the road between the towns of Gao and Menako on Sunday, said army spokesman Colonel Diarran Kone, in a region increasingly under threat from a resurgence of militant groups, some with links to al Qaeda.   We were ambushed, we have about 10 missing soldiers and we lost four vehicles. We are taking stock of the situation,  Kone said without providing further details. Militant groups took control of Mali's north in 2012 though French-led forces pushed them back a year later. But maintaining peace in the remote desert region has proved difficult and jihadists continue to launch attacks on Malian soldiers and U.N. peacekeepers.  African powers launched a multinational military force to tackle Islamist militants in the Sahel this month, as violence spreads beyond north Mali to neighboring states. Militant groups linked to al Qaeda last month killed at least five people at a luxury resort popular with Westerners just outside the capital Bamako, in the southern part of the country generally considered more secure. Meanwhile, fighting flared up last week between rival Tuareg clans, unsettling the Kidal region in the far north.  Clashes on Friday pitting the pro-government Platform coalition, led by the GATIA militia, against the separatist Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA) caused some casualties, though the government was unable to specify how many.

It was for sure the best match for a long time for me ... But I think I'm still on a good way,  she said after the 4-6 6-4 6-4 defeat which means either Simona Halep or Karolina Pliskova will replace her at the top of the rankings next Monday. Kerber, winner of the U.S. and Australian Opens in 2016, came into the tournament on the back of a poor clay season and a year in which she has struggled to live up to the billing of being the world's best player. The 29-year-old German was beaten by 40th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova at the French Open, thus becoming the first top seeded woman to lose in the opening round of the French Open since the sport turned professional in 1968. She was also forced to withdraw from a warm-up event in Birmingham last month due to a hamstring injury, further lowering expectations for Wimbledon. A fourth round exit is a disappointment but Kerber senses that her form is starting to re-emerge.  When I came here, I was telling myself, I was practising good after Paris. For me, I'm still looking forward to the next months, next weeks. I think I'm again on a good way to playing again a high level of tennis,  she said. Certainly Kerber showed plenty of grit and determination against Muguruza, producing some brave attacking shots with several superb down-the-line winners in particular. She had hardly looked back to her best in wins over Irina Falconi and Kirsten Flipkens and she was in real danger in the third round where she battled back from a set and a break down to defeat American Shelby Rogers. But compared to some of her performances this year, the way she played against Muguruza was a distinct improvement.  I think it's just step by step. I think all the matches I played, starting in Eastbourne, where I had good matches, but also matches (here) that I turned around, close matches that I won, and also this match where I really played good tennis, as well, and everything came together,  she said. Now her thoughts will turn to defending her title at Flushing Meadows.   I will go home and I will take few days off, then I'm looking forward to going to the U.S,  she added.   I think I will go there also with a good motivation, good positive emotion. For me, it was really important that I played the grass season well.   I know that I'm back, I can play good matches. This is what counts for me at the end.   Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-showcase-kerber-quot-idUSKBN19V25R"},

Ebola survivor Salomé Karwah, who worked with charity Doctors Without Borders after recovering from the often deadly virus, died in February four days after giving birth by Caesarean section in a major hospital. Her family say staff refused to touch Karwah because she had contracted Ebola in 2014. Liberia's health ministry in March started investigating the claim, which was rejected by the hospital, saying workers had done all they could to save her.  Yet despite being told in April that the investigation into her death had been concluded, Karwah's relatives say they have since been denied access to the findings by the health ministry. Liberian authorities were not immediately available to comment.  It has been four months since her death and we are worried that this episode will drag on and on until people forget,  her brother Reginald Karwah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We deserve to know the truth ... we want to move on,  he said, adding that the family were considering suing the hospital if they did not receive the results of the investigation soon. The health ministry's chief medical officer, Francis Kateh, in March said it was  tragic that one of our heroes, who survived Ebola, died from childbirth in a hospital , but that he did not think that stigma or fear were factors in her death.  Karwah was one of five people featured on the Time magazine cover in 2014 for their work battling Ebola.  Since her previous exposure - when Ebola killed a number of her relatives - had rendered her immune, she was able to make direct contact with sick patients that most carers could not. Liberia was hit hardest by the world's worst Ebola outbreak, losing more than 4,800 people in an epidemic which killed about 11,300 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016. Traces of Ebola can hide in survivors' bodies long after they have recovered, but health experts say the risk of the virus re-emerging and being transmitted to others is very low.  Despite that, there is stigma around survivors of the virus in West Africa, and some experts fear that could lead to further preventable deaths.

British media reported that the fee for the 24-year-old is about 75 million pounds ($97 million), making him the Old Trafford club's second most expensive signing after last year's world-record deal for France midfielder Paul Pogba.  Romelu is a natural fit for Manchester United. He is a big personality and a big player,  United manager Jose Mourinho said in a statement.  It is only natural that he wants to develop his career at the biggest club. He will be a great addition to the group and I know they will make him very welcome.

The pan-European STOXX 600  was up 0.4 percent at its close, rising in concert with euro zone stocks .STOXXE and blue-chips .STOXX50E. Strong gains in banks .SX7P led by Bank of Ireland (BIRG.I) boosted the benchmarks, while basic resources .SXPP reversed course to trade higher as metals prices firmed. Outside the main blue chips, UK midcap construction support services company Carillion (CLLN.L) grabbed traders' attention after a profit warning and CEO exit sent its shares tumbling nearly 40 percent in heavy volumes. Carillion shares are among the most heavily shorted across the UK market with hedge funds including Marshall Wace and Naya Capital reporting sizeable bearish bets according to FCA disclosure data. The worst-performing European stock was infrastructure company Balfour Beatty (BALF.L), down more than 3 percent as traders read across from Carillion. Shipping company Moeller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) jumped 4 percent to a 14-month high and was among top STOXX gainers after Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for it and peer Hapag (HLAG.DE), on an analysis of shipping rates.  The broker however estimated a recent cyber-attack could take a $150-200 million chunk out of Maersk's revenue in the third quarter, leaving its overall profit forecast for the firm unchanged at $1.5 billion. PostNL (PTNL.AS) was the biggest riser, up more than 4 percent after the outgoing Dutch economy minister Henk Kamp suggested that regulatory changes were needed in Dutch postal services. CHR Hansen (CHRH.CO) gained 1.5 percent after a raise to  buy  from Goldman Sachs, which said the company had strong pricing power. The broker found input costs for European consumer staples increased 13 percent year-to-date versus 2016, suggesting 2017 would be the first year of input cost inflation since 2011, helping drive firmer pricing.  As input costs rise, we prefer companies with pricing power (from high gross margins or concentrated market structure) and/or self-help opportunities,  analysts at Goldman said. Food and beverage companies .SX3P were one of the best-performing sectors, up nearly 1 percent. German utility E.ON (EONGn.DE) rose 2.2 percent, a top-performer in the buoyant utilities sector .SX6P after HSBC said recent weakness offered an  excellent buying opportunity , raising the stock to a 'buy' from 'reduce'. Analysts at UBS said that although relative outperformance of European versus U.S. equities has slowed recently, they saw the region regaining momentum as monetary policy began to tighten.  Europe craves higher rates and U.S. bond yields,  they wrote, pointing to the region's higher weighting in materials, industrials, financials and energy, against U.S. equities' concentration in technology and consumer discretionary sectors more suited to lower rates.

The dollar rose after the Bank of Japan offered last week to buy an unlimited amount of bonds and following an unexpected drop in May in Japanese machinery orders that pressured the yen. Stocks on Wall Street edged higher as gains in technology outweighed losses in healthcare. Five of 11 major S&P; sectors rose, with the healthcare index down 0.21 percent and the infotech index up 0.62 percent. Amazon, lifted by its online sale event, contributed the most points to the benchmark S&P; 500, followed by gains in Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia Corp. Amazon rose 1.7 percent to $995.46. Investors, especially ETF traders who like sectors, have tried in recent weeks to establish new leadership in the U.S. equity market but have returned to the technology sector, said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The biggest motivating thing in today's market and it's certainly thin trading, is the Amazon Prime day, which has gotten people interested in Amazon again,  Meckler said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.54 points, or 0.05 percent, to 21,424.88. The S&P; 500 gained 3.18 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,428.36 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.39 points, or 0.22 percent, to 6,166.47. Stock markets advanced around the world as well. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.46 percent, while MSCI's gauge of global stocks gained 0.29 percent. Surprisingly strong data on German exports in May lifted German equities and provided a bounce for European shares. The data show a strong German economy ahead of a Sept. 24 election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term. Greenback Gains The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.07 percent at 96.073. The dollar was up 0.17 percent to 114.07 yen, after hitting 114.29 yen, its highest since May 11, earlier in the session.  The dollar has been broadly supported over the past couple of days and is showing some mild signs of recovery after weakness in the prior week,  said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. U.S. Treasury yields slipped after rising for more than a week, in line with weakness in European bond markets. Investors consolidated positions following a strong U.S. non-farm payrolls report that has kept the Federal Reserve on track towards raising interest rates at least once more this year. U.S. long-dated yields, which move inversely to prices, fell for just the second time in nine days.  This is mostly consolidation given there's not a lot of data,  said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist, at Societe Generale in New York. On Monday, euro-zone bond yields fell, with investors buying back bonds after a two-week selloff. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, was headed for its biggest one-day fall in almost four weeks, down 4 basis points at 0.54 percent. In late morning trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell to 2.3659 percent, from 2.393 percent last Friday. After Friday's jobs report, U.S. 10-year yields hit an eight-week high of 2.398 percent. Crude oil rebounded. Brent crude futures were last up 33 cents on the day at $47.04 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures were last up 30 cents at $44.53 a barrel.

The LMEprecious suite of gold and silver contracts was developed with a group of backers including banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which then set up EOS Precious Metals to promote trade in the contracts and benefit from a 50:50 revenue-sharing deal with the LME. The LME launched its contracts at 0000 GMT on Monday, though volumes did not pick up until the start of the European trading day at 0700 GMT. By 1609 GMT, 66,200 ounces (2.06 tonnes) of gold had traded on the LMEprecious spot contract, exchange data showed. That would be worth more than $80 million at current spot prices.  Typical interbank trade between one party and another would be 5,000-10,000 ounces in a single trade,  said Ross Norman, chief executive of bullion trader Sharps Pixley.  It will be nice to see what the trend is -- if (it picks up), you'd begin to think, here we go.  Market makers were quoting prices on monthly spreads out to June next year. A source at one of the EOS partners said:  At this early stage players are finding their feet. It may be a while until people start trading in size.  As well as Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the EOS partnership includes banks ICBC Standard Societe Generale and Natixis, proprietory trader OSTC and the World Gold Council, an industry market development body. All the banks except Natixis are general clearing members of LMEPrecious, along with brokers Marex Financial and BOCI Global Commodities (UK). OSTC, XTX Markets and Morgan Stanley's commodities unit are non-clearing members. Natixis is an individual clearing member. U.S. exchanges CME Group and ICE have also launched London gold contracts this year, hoping to lure business from the traditional OTC market. Liquidity Split? Both the LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing , and ICE are in the running to take over as operators of the global silver benchmark, the LBMA Silver Price, when incumbents Thomson Reuters and CME Group step down. On the gold front, meanwhile, CME Group's introduction of a spot spread contract in London this year and ICE's launch of a futures contract in January have led market participants to suggest that market liquidity could be fractured.  We will be monitoring volumes and comparing with LBMA to see how LME impinges on OTC volume,  Rhona O'Connell, head of research and forecasts at GFMS, told the Reuters Global Gold Forum on Monday.  With the wings of the regulators beating ever closer with respect to transparency, then some OTC business may well move onto the exchange.  Increased scrutiny of London's financial markets since the LIBOR scandal has led to tighter regulatory capital requirements, increasing the push for trades that were once routinely carried out between counterparties to be performed on the exchanges. Clearing, where an exchange acts as an intermediary to settle trades, is seen by some as an inevitable progression for the gold market.  The clearing aspect, especially for the market makers, reduces capital charges,  one market participant said.

The laws, which also increase royalties tax on gold and other minerals, were passed by parliament last week despite opposition from the mining industry body.  Magufuli reiterated on Monday that no new mining licenses would be issued until Tanzania  puts things in order  and that the government would review all existing mining licenses with foreign investors.  We must benefit from our God-given minerals and that is why we must safeguard our natural resource wealth to ensure we do not end up with empty mining pits,  Magufuli told a rally in his home village in Chato district, northwestern Tanzania. The president has sent shock-waves through the mining community with a series of actions since his election in 2015, which he says are aimed at distributing revenue to the Tanzanian people.  The new mining laws, which were fast-tracked through parliament, raise royalties tax for gold, copper, silver and platinum exports to six percent from four percent. They also give the government the right to tear up and renegotiate contracts for natural resources like gas or minerals, and remove the right to international arbitration.  I would like to thank parliament for making the legislative changes. I signed the bills into law the same day Parliament concluded its session on July 5,  Magufuli said. Passage of the new legislation also followed months of wrangling between the government and the country's biggest gold miner, London-listed Acacia Mining Plc, over mining contracts after Magufuli decided in March to ban exports of gold and copper concentrates to push for the construction of a domestic mineral smelter. Magufuli said on Monday that talks between Tanzania and Barrick Gold Corp., Acacia's majority owner, would begin in two days to try to resolve allegations of tax evasion against Acacia. Tanzania accused Acacia of tax evasion in 2016 in a case that is ongoing.  Acacia, which denies all allegations, said on July 4 it was seeking an adjudicator to resolve its dispute with the Tanzanian government.  Tanzania is also pushing for the mandatory listing of mining companies on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) by August as part of measures aimed at increasing transparency and spreading wealth from the country's natural resources. Other major foreign-owned mining companies in Tanzania include AngloGold Ashanti and Petra Diamonds.

The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating primarily reflects Schroders research-led investment processes, implemented in a disciplined manner across a diversified book of businesses and within a solid risk management framework. Fitch views positively the actions taken by Schroders to address industry challenges, re-investing in future, higher-margin business growth while implementing a more cost-efficient operating model. The rating factors in the execution risk inherent in the roll-out of the enterprise-wide Aladdin operational system. It also factors in the business and investment risks arising from both capabilities expansion (such as private assets and alternatives, innovative solutions) and client base development (notably in North America and Asia Pacific). Schroder's 'Excellent' rating is based on the following category scores: Investment Process: Excellent Investment Resources: Excellent Risk Management: Excellent Investment Performance: Consistent Company and Client Servicing: Excellent The above category scores result from an asset weighting average of the scores obtained in each of the main business units / strategies of Schroders, namely equities, multi-assets and fixed income. Schroders' IMQ Rating references the investment activities based in the global investment hub, London (excluding the alternatives and real estate business). Investment Process Schroders' active, mainly research-driven investment process is implemented across a broad range of strategies by accountable, focused staff in a risk-controlled manner. Overall, portfolio construction follows a disciplined risk-budgeting approach, supported by proprietary risk analytics. The investment process has proven stable, with notable enhancements as markets, client needs and financial engineering evolve. Accordingly, Schroders is enhancing its capabilities in private assets, alternatives and multi-asset solutions. Investment Resources Schroders has managed to keep its organisation of investment teams and processes simple and efficient, despite its business growing in size and complexity over the past five years. Notably, a new product division was recently created to enhance strategic innovation and product development and to consolidate the solutions business. Schroders' board and senior management changes in 2015-2016 have now settled down and are well-integrated, demonstrating the organisation's ability to renew leadership and manage successions. Schroders is in the process of rolling out the Aladdin system and upgrading its data architecture globally. The implementation of a single, enterprise-wide system aims to simplify the existing IT platform, streamline related operational processes, and enhance global integration, ultimately reducing infrastructure costs. Risk Management Schroders has an effective, highly structured, risk and governance framework that is deeply embedded in the business and which also benefits from the independent oversight by influential risk functions and committees. Mechanisms to address risk challenges and risk escalation are formalised and operate effectively, in Fitch's view. Investment risk management is embedded in the investment process via detailed risk budgeting and investment guidelines. Risk management procedures have evolved to adapt to the increasing sophistication of Schroders' strategies and instruments. Investment Performance Overall, Schroders' risk-adjusted performance has been consistent, relative to peers and benchmarks, with an overall improvement observed over the past 12 months. Seventy-four per cent and 85% of Schroder's assets under management (AUM) have outperformed benchmarks over three and five years gross of fees, respectively, as at end-December 2016 - an improvement on the previous year. Also, Fitch estimates that 50% to 60% of AUM (funds excluding mandates) have a Sharpe ratio (a risk-adjusted measure of performance) above that of the Lipper category average over three and five years, based on Lipper data. A majority of AUM (excluding mandates) also show better drawdown statistics than the fund's Lipper category average over three and five years. Company and Client Servicing The company has a global, diversified, long-established and expanding franchise. The business evolved mainly through organic growth but more recently, through targeted acquisitions in key regions (eg the US) and asset classes (eg securitised credit, private assets). Schroders is a global asset management company and the core subsidiary of Schroders Plc (A+/Stable/F1). At end-March 2017, Schroders managed GBP361.9 billion (GBP405.1 billion, including wealth management), of which 64% was for institutional clients, 35% for intermediaries. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating may be sensitive to material adverse changes to any of the aforementioned rating drivers, notably through weakened financial conditions, heightened staff turnover or deterioration of processes and policies. A material deviation from Fitch's guidelines for any key rating drivers could cause the rating to be downgraded. Specifically, should Fitch determine that the rollout of Aladdin results in process disruption, operational losses or staff turnover, the agency may place the rating on Negative Watch while it evaluates the extent to which investment and operational capabilities are undermined. Fitch will closely monitor implementation risks during the 18-24 month system migration period.

Nestle, Europe's most valuable public company, announced a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback program last month coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritize acquisitions in high-growth areas as it battles slowing demand for packaged food. The move came just two days after the billionaire hedge fund manager urged Nestle to more aggressively improve returns as his Third Point fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake that made it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder. But Nestle's plan did not address Loeb's calls for it to exit its $26 billion stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal (OREP.PA) or set a formal margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020, up from 15.3 percent in 2016. Unilever (ULVR.L) and Danone (DANO.PA) have recently set their own respective 2020 margin targets of 20 percent and more than 16 percent. Some analysts now expect Nestle to set, or at least imply, a long-term margin target at its Sept. 26 investor seminar, when new chief executive Mark Schneider will lay out his plans.  Third Point's stake may add urgency to margin delivery and sharpens focus on the September investor days,  Liberum analysts said.     Loeb's move on Nestle comes months after Unilever fended off a surprise $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O). Both events highlight the magnitude of the trouble rocking the packaged food sector, as a new generation of consumers flock to smaller brands, leaving companies racing to improve profits through cost cuts. Nestle has a cost-savings program but has not said how much of this will go toward raising its margins, which are at the low end of its peer group. Improved productivity was first on Third Point's wish list, and the source, who declined to be identified, said it was the most important.  Loeb, dubbed a  constructivist  for his increasingly cooperative approach, first met Schneider on June 2, the source said, adding that no other meetings are currently planned before the September seminar, which Third Point plans to attend. Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under its new CEO, the first outside leader in nearly a century, said the source, but it wants to see greater urgency. A Nestle company logo is pictured on a bar of Milky Bar chocolate in Manchester, Britain April 25, 2017.Phil NobleAside from the share buyback, Schneider, who became CEO in January, has already scrapped a long-term sales model and announced a review of Nestle's U.S. confectionery business.  Maybelline for Maggi   Third Point, which has not commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter due later this month, the source said, adding that its plan was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company.  It has suggested that Nestle review its portfolio, which includes more than 2,000 brands including Maggi, Gerber, Perrier and Nescafe. It wants a divestiture of the L'Oreal stake, and has floated an exchange offer whereby Nestle shareholders are offered shares of L'Oreal, maker of Maybelline make-up. Nestle has not commented on this, but behind closed doors, its board does not seem keen, the source said, confirming what another source had previously told Reuters. Nestle, which has owned the stake for more than four decades, has long touted it as strategic and value-creating, and a source last month told Reuters that view had not changed. After carefully assessing all companies in the sector, including Unilever, Third Point started buying Nestle shares earlier this year, when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said, noting that Nestle had the greatest opportunity for upside. The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed and the stock was trading at 82.90 francs per share at 1559 GMT, up 1.3 percent.  That stands to boost Third Point's performance, which is already outshining its rivals this year. For example, Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source.  That compares to an average activist hedge fund performance of 1.27 percent in June and 4.21 percent for the year, according to industry tracker Hedge Fund Research. Since founding Third Point in 1995, Loeb has campaigned for changes at companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Sothebys and famously brought his tactics to Japan via now-exited positions in Sony Corp (6758.T) and Seven & I Holdings (3382.T).

Now a private letter written by the author to her niece could well make someone very happy indeed. A letter critiquing a contemporary author for being  prosy  goes under the hammer at a London auction house on Tuesday. The letter is from Austen to Anna Lefroy, the eldest daughter of the author's eldest brother Rev. James Austen. Auctioneers Sotheby's expect it to fetch 80,000 pounds  ($103,000) to 100,000 pounds. The subject of the letter is a  most tiresome and prosy  Gothic novel entitled  Lady Maclairn, the Victim of Villainy , published by her contemporary Rachel Hunter.   It's very interesting to have a letter by Jane Austen talking about writing, talking about novels, talking about someone else’s novels because there are not many instances in Jane Austen's writing where we get that , said Gabriel Heaton, Sotheby’s director of books and manuscripts. The auctioneers said that the letters, dating from 29-30 October 1812  when the  Pride and Prejudice  author was at her literary peak, had belonged to the Austen family, and had never been offered for sale before. A measure of the author's enduring popularity, Austen memorabilia can command spectacular sums. In 2011, the earliest surviving Austen manuscript, a handwritten draft for a book that was never published, sold for 993,250 pounds ($1.6 million) at auction. The auction will be held on July 11th.

The long awaited premiere of the ballet about Rudolf Nureyev, one of the first Soviet artists to defect to the West, was due to be held on July 11, but the Bolshoi said on its website late on Saturday it would not take place. Vladimir Urin, the theatre's director general, told a news conference on Monday it had been pulled because rehearsals had shown it was not ready. He said it would be staged in May next year instead.  We watched one run-through, and given the quality of the ballet, we realised it was bad,  Urin told reporters.  But TASS cited a spokeswoman for Vladimir Medinsky, the culture minister, as saying he had spoken to Urin beforehand, suggesting there were other concerns.  Yes there was a long conversation with Urin,  TASS cited Irina Kaznacheeva, the spokeswoman, as saying.  But a ban is the not the ministry's working style.  She said she did not know details of the conversation.

Under the legislation, which the European Court of Human Rights ruled last month breached European treaty rules, any event or act regarded by the authorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors is illegal and punishable by a fine.  Makhar Vaziev, ballet director of the Bolshoi Theatre, attends a news conference on the postponement of the world premiere of the Nureyev ballet, weeks after its director Kirill Serebrennikov was questioned as a witness in a fraud investigation, at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia, July 10, 2017.Maxim Shemetov I realised from the very beginning ... that this was a controversial figure, with a tragic fate, and that it would be pretty difficult to tell this story,  Urin told reporters on Monday, referring to how socially conservative elements of Russian society would respond to a production which touched on Nureyev's homosexual relationships.  Believe me, I understood well it was a specific theme that could be rejected by a number of people.  In 1958-61 Nureyev was a principal dancer of the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Ballet in St Petersburg. He asked for political asylum in France while on tour in Paris in 1961. The postponement has caused a scandal in Moscow. The Bolshoi, which was founded in 1776, was last embroiled in controversy in 2013 when its then artistic director, Sergei Filin, had acid thrown in his face in an episode which lifted the lid on poisonous rivalries over roles, money and power at one of Russia's most prominent cultural institutions.

The laws, which also increase royalties tax on gold and other minerals, were passed by parliament last week despite opposition from the mining industry body.  Magufuli reiterated on Monday that no new mining licenses would be issued until Tanzania  puts things in order  and that the government would review all existing mining licenses with foreign investors.  We must benefit from our God-given minerals and that is why we must safeguard our natural resource wealth to ensure we do not end up with empty mining pits,  Magufuli told a rally in his home village in Chato district, northwestern Tanzania. The president has sent shock-waves through the mining community with a series of actions since his election in 2015, which he says are aimed at distributing revenue to the Tanzanian people.  The new mining laws, which were fast-tracked through parliament, raise royalties tax for gold, copper, silver and platinum exports to six percent from four percent. They also give the government the right to tear up and renegotiate contracts for natural resources like gas or minerals, and remove the right to international arbitration.  I would like to thank parliament for making the legislative changes. I signed the bills into law the same day Parliament concluded its session on July 5,  Magufuli said. Passage of the new legislation also followed months of wrangling between the government and the country's biggest gold miner, London-listed Acacia Mining Plc, over mining contracts after Magufuli decided in March to ban exports of gold and copper concentrates to push for the construction of a domestic mineral smelter. Magufuli said on Monday that talks between Tanzania and Barrick Gold Corp., Acacia's majority owner, would begin in two days to try to resolve allegations of tax evasion against Acacia. Tanzania accused Acacia of tax evasion in 2016 in a case that is ongoing.  Acacia, which denies all allegations, said on July 4 it was seeking an adjudicator to resolve its dispute with the Tanzanian government.  Tanzania is also pushing for the mandatory listing of mining companies on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) by August as part of measures aimed at increasing transparency and spreading wealth from the country's natural resources. Other major foreign-owned mining companies in Tanzania include AngloGold Ashanti and Petra Diamonds.

Now a private letter written by the author to her niece could well make someone very happy indeed. A letter critiquing a contemporary author for being  prosy  goes under the hammer at a London auction house on Tuesday. The letter is from Austen to Anna Lefroy, the eldest daughter of the author's eldest brother Rev. James Austen. Auctioneers Sotheby's expect it to fetch 80,000 pounds  ($103,000) to 100,000 pounds. The subject of the letter is a  most tiresome and prosy  Gothic novel entitled  Lady Maclairn, the Victim of Villainy , published by her contemporary Rachel Hunter.   It's very interesting to have a letter by Jane Austen talking about writing, talking about novels, talking about someone else’s novels because there are not many instances in Jane Austen's writing where we get that , said Gabriel Heaton, Sotheby’s director of books and manuscripts. The auctioneers said that the letters, dating from 29-30 October 1812  when the  Pride and Prejudice  author was at her literary peak, had belonged to the Austen family, and had never been offered for sale before. A measure of the author's enduring popularity, Austen memorabilia can command spectacular sums. In 2011, the earliest surviving Austen manuscript, a handwritten draft for a book that was never published, sold for 993,250 pounds ($1.6 million) at auction. The auction will be held on July 11th.

Investors saw Abercrombie's failure to sell itself as yet another blow to a retail sector already struggling to cope with changing consumer tastes and growing pressure from Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers. Shares of Gap Inc, American Eagle Outfitters Inc and Express Inc all fell more than 4 percent. Abercrombie, which has a market value of $650 million, had said in May it was in talks with several bidders regarding a potential sale, a day after Reuters reported that the retailer was working with an investment bank to field takeover interest from other retailers. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners came closest to acquiring Abercrombie, but could not meet the company's valuation expectations, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Sycamore agreed two weeks ago to acquire U.S. office supplies chain Staples Inc for $6.9 billion, the biggest deal in the buyout firm's history. American Eagle had also looked at striking a deal for Abercrombie in partnership with private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, sources previously told Reuters. Several teen retailers have struggled as their primary customers have abandoned malls in favor of fast-fashion chains such as European brand Zara, while the rise of online dropping has forced retailers to slash prices to compete. Aeropostale Inc, Wet Seal and BCBG Max Azria Group LLC are among the retailers that have filed for bankruptcy over the past two years. New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie defined teen apparel in the 1990s with its risqué advertising and its large logo on apparel, but has been hit hard as a new generation of shoppers avoids heavy branding in favor of more independent style. In response, Abercrombie has attempted to reinvent itself, and dropped its logo in 2014. Abercrombie said on Monday it will focus on its surf-wear brand Hollister, the one bright spot of growth for the company. Abercrombie also said it will  continue to refine and implement strategies to position the Abercrombie brand for revitalized performance  for its eponymous brand, which has reported falling quarterly sales since 2014.

The Prosecutor General's office said in a statement that Fernando Rocha Andrade, Joao Vasconcelos and Jorge Costa Oliveira, all of whom resigned from the government on Sunday, had been named  arguidos , or formal suspects, in an investigation of an alleged  improper receipt of benefits .  None of the three returned calls seeking comment on Monday. The three secretaries of state -- for tax affairs, industry and internationalization -- had accepted trips and tickets to the Euro 2016 soccer championship in France that were paid for by energy company Galp.  They have since paid back the costs of the trips, which were first reported by Portuguese media in August 2016. The three have denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest in accepting the invitations. Galp, which sponsored the Portuguese team at Euro 2016, has also said there was nothing unethical about its invitations.  The government earlier said that Rocha Andrade, Vasconcelos and Costa Oliveira had requested they be named as suspects when they resigned, so as to better defend themselves. The prosecutor's office did not say they had volunteered to be  arguidos .      The case is another embarrassment for Prime Minister Antonio Costa, who is already under pressure from the opposition to sack his interior and defense ministers over deadly forest fires in June and a major arms theft from a military depot. Some analysts say a wider government reshuffle may follow, although those two cabinet ministers are expected to stay on after Costa's Socialist minority government defended their actions and general competence. Last week, prosecutors said international arms dealers and militants were suspected to be behind the theft of more than 100 grenades and ammunition from a poorly-guarded military arms depot at the end of June. The attention-grabbing theft has piled up pressure on the government after it was criticized for the  handling of the country's deadliest-ever forest fire on June 17-18. The blaze killed 64 people. The minority government has seen its approval ratings grow thanks to strengthening economic growth and improving public finances. A survey on Friday by pollster Eurobarometro put the Socialists at 40.4 percent of voting intentions, well ahead of the main opposition Social Democrats, on 28.6 percent.

The pan-European STOXX 600  was up 0.4 percent at its close, rising in concert with euro zone stocks .STOXXE and blue-chips .STOXX50E. Strong gains in banks .SX7P led by Bank of Ireland (BIRG.I) boosted the benchmarks, while basic resources .SXPP reversed course to trade higher as metals prices firmed. Outside the main blue chips, UK midcap construction support services company Carillion (CLLN.L) grabbed traders' attention after a profit warning and CEO exit sent its shares tumbling nearly 40 percent in heavy volumes. Carillion shares are among the most heavily shorted across the UK market with hedge funds including Marshall Wace and Naya Capital reporting sizeable bearish bets according to FCA disclosure data. The worst-performing European stock was infrastructure company Balfour Beatty (BALF.L), down more than 3 percent as traders read across from Carillion. Shipping company Moeller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) jumped 4 percent to a 14-month high and was among top STOXX gainers after Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for it and peer Hapag (HLAG.DE), on an analysis of shipping rates.  The broker however estimated a recent cyber-attack could take a $150-200 million chunk out of Maersk's revenue in the third quarter, leaving its overall profit forecast for the firm unchanged at $1.5 billion. PostNL (PTNL.AS) was the biggest riser, up more than 4 percent after the outgoing Dutch economy minister Henk Kamp suggested that regulatory changes were needed in Dutch postal services. CHR Hansen (CHRH.CO) gained 1.5 percent after a raise to  buy  from Goldman Sachs, which said the company had strong pricing power. The broker found input costs for European consumer staples increased 13 percent year-to-date versus 2016, suggesting 2017 would be the first year of input cost inflation since 2011, helping drive firmer pricing.  As input costs rise, we prefer companies with pricing power (from high gross margins or concentrated market structure) and/or self-help opportunities,  analysts at Goldman said. Food and beverage companies .SX3P were one of the best-performing sectors, up nearly 1 percent. German utility E.ON (EONGn.DE) rose 2.2 percent, a top-performer in the buoyant utilities sector .SX6P after HSBC said recent weakness offered an  excellent buying opportunity , raising the stock to a 'buy' from 'reduce'. Analysts at UBS said that although relative outperformance of European versus U.S. equities has slowed recently, they saw the region regaining momentum as monetary policy began to tighten.  Europe craves higher rates and U.S. bond yields,  they wrote, pointing to the region's higher weighting in materials, industrials, financials and energy, against U.S. equities' concentration in technology and consumer discretionary sectors more suited to lower rates.

After suffering for months on concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could scrap NAFTA, the Mexican peso has since stabilized as he adopted a more constructive rhetoric.      Trump hailed progress on trade after meeting Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. The Mexican government has said it expects a general agreement on reworking the trade deal by the end of 2017.     The peso firmed 0.7 percent, touching its strongest since late June. Also boosting the demand for the currency was a central bank decision to renew $200 million worth of foreign exchange hedging instruments.     The Brazilian real also found support in central bank intervention, after the bank indicated it could fully roll over $6.2 billion worth of currency swaps maturing next month.      Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.8 percent, as shares of miner Vale SA tracked iron ore prices higher.     Shares of Alpargatas SA, the maker of Havaianas flip-flops, fell 1.6 percent after Reuters reported controlling shareholder J&F; Investimentos ended talks to sell a controlling stake in the company.     Power utility Light SA jumped to the highest level in 16 years after shareholder Cia Energética de Minas Gerais SA decided to fully dispose of its stake as part of a divestment plan.

McKesson Chief Executive John Hammergren was paid more than $20 million for the year ended March 31, despite the company's record $150 million settlement paid to resolve a U.S. investigation into whether it failed to report suspicious orders of addictive painkillers.  Recent pay decisions ... send completely the wrong message to shareholders, regulators, lawmakers and the public about executive accountability,  the Teamsters wrote in a letter to other shareholders filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. The union did not disclose how many McKesson shares it owns, but said it had substantial holdings in the company. It asked shareholders to vote against a proposal to approve executive compensation and for a proposal asking for an independent chairman. The  say-on-pay  proposal is an advisory, non-binding vote. McKesson said in a statement the company has invested millions into and enhanced its controlled substances monitoring program. It also filed slides defending its pay practices, noting that Hammergren's pay had declined 27 percent over the past 4 years.  McKesson and its shareholders have been well served during John Hammergren’s service as both CEO and chairman of the board,  the company said. McKesson's $150 million settlement with the U.S. Justice Department earlier this year followed an earlier settlement with the company over similar violations in 2008. In addition to being McKesson investors, the Teamsters also represent some of McKesson's workers.

Also pressuring the metals market was subdued inflation data in top market China as the economy loses momentum. China's producer price inflation was unchanged in June amid lingering oversupply issues in the steel sector and as signs of economic weakness weighed on the outlook for prices.  The data was quite steady, giving policymakers in China a sweet spot ... to implement deleveraging (and) fine tuning of the economy,  said Xiao Fu, head of commodity market strategy at Bank of China International in London. Some investors have been worried that monetary tightening in China would hit economic growth, but Fu said the authorities there were wary about moving too fast.  Overall, I think that there are some headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and deleveraging in China, so we are neutral to cautious about base metals in the second half.  * COPPER: London Metal Exchange benchmark copper closed down 0.1 percent at $5,824 a tonne, paring losses after touching $5,792, the weakest since June 27. * COPPER INVENTORIES: Stocks in LME warehouses rose by 4,900 tonnes to 319,975 on Monday and have gained 32 percent since June 28, showing supplies are adequate. * COPPER MINES: Losses in copper were limited by the prospect of strikes. Antofagasta in Chile has been facing possible strikes at two mines since last week. * ZINC: LME zinc finished down 0.5 percent at $2,780.50. Alastair Munro, of broker Marex Spectron, said the metal has struggled to break $2,809/11 July highs and that he expects support into the $2,725 area. * ALUMINIUM: LME aluminium dropped 1.7 percent to end at $1,897, the biggest one-day percentage fall since April 27.  A short-term pullback can't be ruled out first towards $1,912/1,910 ... with next support at $1,900,  Stéphanie Aymes, head of technical analysis at Societe Generale, said in a note.  However this is just a consolidation within the overall up trend and eventually the up move is expected to persist.  * TIN: Tin stocks on the Shanghai Futures Exchange have surged in the past two months and now stand at about three times the volume of LME tin stocks. (reut.rs/2t47LHN) LME tin closed 1.6 percent higher at $19,880. * DOLLAR: The dollar touched a two-month high against the Japanese yen on Monday after robust jobs data propped up U.S. Treasury yields. A stronger dollar erodes the purchasing power of buyers outside the United States for commodities priced in the U.S. currency.

Talks to reunite the ethnic Greek and Turkish sides of Cyprus collapsed in anger and recrimination in the early hours of Friday, ending a process many saw as the most promising in generations to heal decades of conflict. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, speaking at an energy conference in Istanbul, called on Greek Cypriots to refrain from taking  one-sided measures  after talks failed. It was a clear reference to plans by the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government to exploit potential hydrocarbon deposits around the Mediterranean island. The government has already issues a maritime advisory for a natural gas drill from July to October.  We want to remind once again that the hydrocarbon resources around Cyprus belongs to both sides,  Yildirim said.  The Greek Cypriot leadership must seek a constructive approach rather than setting an obstacle for peace. We advise that they refrain from unilateral measures in the east Mediterranean.  Related CoverageCypriot president says wants zero forces, guarantees from TurkeyErdogan, speaking later at the same conference, went further, with a not-very-veiled threat to oil companies who may be tempted to participate in the Greek Cypriots' plans.  It is impossible to appreciate that some energy companies are acting with, and becoming part of some irresponsible measures taken by, Greek Cypriots,  Erdogan said.  I want to remind them that they could lose a friend like Turkey.   New Tensions Greek Cypriots say it is its sovereign right to explore for hydrocarbons, and it has signed maritime delimitation agreements with most of its neighbors. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan makes a speech at the 22nd World Petroleum Congress in Istanbul, Turkey, July 10, 2017.Murad SezerAsked on Sunday if there was any pressure on Cyprus regarding the drilling schedule, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said:  Nothing (pressure) is being applied, nor will there be a postponement.   A number of energy companies have already beaten a path to the island. Italy's ENI, ExxonMobil, France's Total and Korea's KOGAS have won offshore exploration licenses Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim speaks during a joint news conference with his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras after their meeting at the Maximos Mansion in Athens, Greece, June 19, 2017.Costas BaltasA drilling ship contracted by Total, the West Capella, is already heading for Cyprus.  What we expect from anyone who takes sides in the developments in Cyprus is that they should refrain from steps that might pave the way for new tensions in the region,  Erdogan said. Asked by Reuters at the petroleum conference whether the company was worried that drilling could alienate Turkey, Arnaud Breuillac, Total's president of exploration and production, said the company had  no concerns . The issue has risen to the fore again because of the failure of the latest round of reunification talks, which were started in part to try to solve the energy issue. A week of United Nations-mediated talks in the Swiss Alps culminated in a  yelling and drama  session, leaving the conflict unresolved. Cyprus's Greek and Turkish Cypriots have lived estranged since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek- inspired coup. Turkey has 30,000 troops stationed in northern Cyprus and their status in any post-settlement peace deal proved to be the undoing of a process one diplomat lamented came  so, so close  to succeeding. Cyprus talks have collapsed before, most spectacularly in 2004, when Greek Cypriots rejected a U.N. reunification blueprint in a referendum while Turkish Cypriots backed it. It took several years for the United Nations to re-engage.

The Prosecutor General's office said in a statement that Fernando Rocha Andrade, Joao Vasconcelos and Jorge Costa Oliveira, all of whom resigned from the government on Sunday, had been named  arguidos , or formal suspects, in an investigation of an alleged  improper receipt of benefits .  None of the three returned calls seeking comment on Monday. The three secretaries of state -- for tax affairs, industry and internationalization -- had accepted trips and tickets to the Euro 2016 soccer championship in France that were paid for by energy company Galp.  They have since paid back the costs of the trips, which were first reported by Portuguese media in August 2016. The three have denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest in accepting the invitations. Galp, which sponsored the Portuguese team at Euro 2016, has also said there was nothing unethical about its invitations.  The government earlier said that Rocha Andrade, Vasconcelos and Costa Oliveira had requested they be named as suspects when they resigned, so as to better defend themselves. The prosecutor's office did not say they had volunteered to be  arguidos .      The case is another embarrassment for Prime Minister Antonio Costa, who is already under pressure from the opposition to sack his interior and defense ministers over deadly forest fires in June and a major arms theft from a military depot. Some analysts say a wider government reshuffle may follow, although those two cabinet ministers are expected to stay on after Costa's Socialist minority government defended their actions and general competence. Last week, prosecutors said international arms dealers and militants were suspected to be behind the theft of more than 100 grenades and ammunition from a poorly-guarded military arms depot at the end of June. The attention-grabbing theft has piled up pressure on the government after it was criticized for the  handling of the country's deadliest-ever forest fire on June 17-18. The blaze killed 64 people. The minority government has seen its approval ratings grow thanks to strengthening economic growth and improving public finances. A survey on Friday by pollster Eurobarometro put the Socialists at 40.4 percent of voting intentions, well ahead of the main opposition Social Democrats, on 28.6 percent.

They were responding after the Dutch road authority (RDW) found that the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Suzuki Vitara models produced unacceptably high levels of toxic emissions during road tests. The RDW said that there are approximately 27,000 of the Jeeps and 42,000 of the Suzukis on European roads. The RDW said in a statement that its tests of more than a dozen car makers in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal had singled out Jeep and Suzuki. Other manufacturers were not found to have violated regulations. The Dutch agency has been investigating what it called  impermissible defeat devices  for the past year, following the disclosure in the United States in 2015 that Volkswagen had used software to alter its emissions during testing. The RDW's investigation was centered on nitrogen oxide emission levels in diesel cars that appeared much higher than legally allowed during road driving rather than under laboratory test conditions. The agency said that in all cases carmakers argued that the reason for the discrepancy was software intended to protect the motor from harm under certain conditions. Such software is permissible under current European law and the agency no longer refers to it as a  defeat device  but uses the term  impermissible software  for when the pollution seems out of proportion with any need to protect the engine.  For the 14 other carmakers we were able to get to the core of the matter and ask all the questions that we wanted and got satisfactory answers,  said Maarten Balk, Manager for Licensing and Supervision at the RDW.  But not for these two, up to the present.  Suzuki representatives in Europe could not immediately be reached for comment. Jeep representatives did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. The RDW said Suzuki Vitaras appeared to emit much more nitrogen oxide after a short time on the road. The company has offered a fix and is currently rolling it out for the roughly 8,000 Vitara models on Dutch roads. The Jeep Grand Cherokee appeared to emit higher levels of pollutants when its engine was hot, the RDW said. There are very few of them in the Netherlands, and the model is no longer in production. Jeep has proposed a software fix for the Cherokees this month, but the RDW hasn't had a chance to evaluate it yet. RDW Director Paul Dietz said that this is the first time his agency has taken such an action. He said the agency has no power to levy fines, that will be up to prosecutors. The RDW will continue to pressure the two firms to offer remedies and follow up to make sure the offending models are retrofitted. European cars in the future will have to comply with a road test, rather than a laboratory test, he said, removing the motive for installing software that tries to beat the test.

Frenchman Bardet, runner-up last year, had his AG2R-La Mondiale team pile on the pressure in the descent from the Col de la Biche - one of three out-of-category climbs - which led Chris Froome's lieutenant Geraint Thomas to crash and break his right collarbone. AG2R-La Mondiale, who are based in the Chambery area where the stage was held, used their knowledge of the terrain to blow the race wide open. Bardet, known for his aggressive style, went on the attack on the last descent, distancing race leader Froome and other rivals. He was only caught two kilometres from the finish after a bold solo ride in the final flat part of the stage won by Colombian Rigoberto Uran.  I loved it, they took risks, AG2R were really aggressive,  LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in a daily chat with Reuters.  I love seeing a team strategy that's really ripping things apart. It's part of the strategy to string things out.  What Bardet did was grand style.  Bardet sits third overall, 51 seconds behind Froome of Team Sky and 33 seconds adrift of Italian Fabio Aru (Astana).     There will be other battles to fight in the Pyrenees and in the Alps,  the Frenchman warned. LeMond believes that although Froome remains the overwhelming favorite to add to his 2013, 2015 and 2016 titles, three riders are still in the mix to unsettle the Briton.  The real players are Froome, Aru, Bardet and Uran, who is going to do better than people think. He's the dark horse,  said the American, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990. Uran is fourth overall, 55 seconds off the pace, and his Cannondale-Drapac team manager Jonathan Vaughters refers to him as  Voldemort, the guy whose name can't be mentioned.  Monday is a rest day on the Tour, which resumes with a flat 10th stage between Perigueux and Bergerac on Tuesday before the big guns battle it out again in the Pyrenees on Thursday.

Renzi, leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD), proposed Italy should run a stable budget deficit of 2.9 percent of gross domestic product for five years instead of trying to lower the deficit towards zero, as current plans call for. Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told reporters in Brussels that Renzi's proposal, contained in extracts of a book released on Sunday,  seems to be a question for the next legislature,  and declined any other comment. Industry Minister Carlo Calenda said Italy's next budget would be drawn up in September by Padoan and Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and would respect current commitments. Those envisage a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP this year and 1.2 percent in 2018. Renzi, who quit as prime minister in December after losing a referendum on constitutional reform, should open a broad discussion on Italy's economic strategy rather than focus on deficit targets, Calenda told the newspaper Corriere della Sera. He also said any increased deficit leeway would be best used to increase investments. Renzi, on the other hand, said  fiscal space should be used entirely and only for tax cuts.  Renzi said the EU's fiscal compact, which was agreed in 2012 and sets tough deficit- and debt-reduction goals for high-debt countries like Italy, was  mindless  and should be scrapped. His proposal means none of Italy's main parties are in favor of respecting the fiscal compact, with parliamentary elections to be held by May next year.         Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, told reporters in Brussels that EU fiscal rules had been jointly agreed, were re-discussed only last year and changing them  is not going to be easy.  Renzi repeatedly tussled with Brussels over Italy's deficit during his nearly three years as prime minister, when he raised deficit reduction targets that the European Commission said were needed to cut Italy's huge public debt. The debt, at about 133 percent of GDP, is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's.

Soldiers passing through the narrow alleyways and abandoned homes of the Old City on Sunday scrambled over stone blocks, reinforced steel poles and sheets of aluminum to inspect the military's latest gains while their comrades fought on nearby. Charred bodies, mostly covered with blankets, lay amid the rubble. A man's hand stuck out from under one cover, another's dusty feet extended from another. Some were clearly militants but others looked like civilians, including a woman and a child. As the nearly nine-month U.S.-backed offensive to retake Mosul draws to an end, the Old City has been among the hardest hit areas by the house-to-house fighting backed by air strikes, artillery and heavy machine guns to uproot the insurgents who have resisted with suicide bomb attacks. The riverside district, whose mosques, churches and markets date to the Medieval Ages and even earlier, were long neglected before Islamic State took over in 2014. The insurgents have blown up several landmarks there including the iconic Hadba minaret and its adjoining Grand Nuri Mosque, where leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a modern-day  caliphate  three years ago. Several hundred militants were holed up in the Old City among tens of thousands of civilians when Iraqi forces breached the area last month. Those numbers have dwindled, with a few dozen militants maintaining resistance as Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi traveled to Mosul to declare victory. Moments before his arrival on Sunday, a half dozen air strikes pounded the last pocket of the city where the insurgents are gathered. The blasts sent unidentified fragments toward the sky including what appeared to be an Islamic State flag. The explosions, mixed with sporadic gunfire, continued on Monday as Abadi met with local officials. Destroyed buildings from clashes are seen in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 10, 2017.Thaier Al-SudaniClearing Rubble Soldiers combing the ruins passed a hole knocked into the side of a building, revealing a relatively intact living room, with cushioned chairs and a couch covered in dust. Another small room was furnished with foam sleeping mats and scattered with food scraps, indicating it was recently inhabited by retreating insurgents or advancing soldiers, or possibly both in quick succession. Slideshow (3 Images)The soldiers walked through a burnt-out elementary school and an outdoor basketball court where a mural painted on one wall bears the adage:  Cleanliness is part of faith . A bulldozer was already clearing rubble in an open area nearby. In another section of the Old City with broader streets and taller buildings, federal police dot a moonscape scene. Storefronts were gutted, a six-storey apartment block had collapsed in on itself and a two-storey home was knocked off its foundations and leaned on its side. The police showed off explosive vests they found alongside the militants, who they said were of Asian origin. They said they still had to clear tunnels running underneath the Old City to make sure Islamic State fighters were not hiding there. While some Mosul districts were only lightly affected by the battle, nearly a third of western neighborhood have been heavily damaged according to the United Nations, which estimates it will take more than $1 billion and at least a year just to repair restore basic services to the entire city. A soldier returning from the front on Sunday unfurled a black Islamic State flag, holding it upside down and posing for pictures. He boasted it is the last of its kind in Mosul. In reality, military officials say Islamic State has set up sleeper cells across the city and that they are working to prevent a new wave of guerrilla-style attacks as the group goes to ground.

The European Union imposed the sanctions after Russia's 2014 annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine, a move it sees as breaking international law.  Siemens, which has repeatedly insisted it was not aware the turbines were destined for Crimea, said it would press criminal charges against those responsible for diverting the turbines.   Siemens has received information from reliable sources that at least two of the four gas turbine sets, which were delivered for the project in Taman, Southern Russia, have been moved to Crimea against our will,  it said in a statement.   Over the last few months, our customer has confirmed to us numerous times in writing that a delivery to Crimea would not occur. As a consequence, Siemens will initiate criminal charges against the responsible individuals.   Reuters reported last week that the Siemens turbines had been delivered to Crimea.  A Siemens spokesman said the customer in question was Russian state-owned engineering company Technopromexport, which bought the turbines from Siemens. Technopromexport had no immediate comment, and Russia's energy ministry declined to comment. Related CoverageRussian minister says power project in Crimea will go aheadVladimir Putin, who is expected to seek reelection as Russian president next year, has vowed to ensure energy security for Crimea, but has no home-grown company that could easily supply such turbines. The Kremlin said on Monday the power turbines being installed in Crimea had been made in Russia using Russian components - an apparent reference to the fact that the turbines were produced at a factory in St. Petersburg. The plant's owner, Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies LLC, is 65 percent owned by Siemens and uses Siemens technology. Diplomacy            Siemens - a multinational whose activities include trains,  factory automation and healthcare equipment - will mark 170 years' presence in Russia this year, and invested about 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) there in the early years of this decade, mostly in energy. Joe Kaeser met Putin several times during his first year as chief executive, including a widely criticized visit to Russia shortly after the annexation of Crimea during which he reaffirmed his commitment to the country. Germany is still one of Russia's top trading partners. A spokesman for the German Economy Ministry, when asked about the Siemens affair on Monday, said that it was up to Siemens to ensure it respected the EU sanctions. The issue has been raised in diplomatic circles in Moscow, a Siemens source familiar with the matter said.  Three sources close to the matter told Reuters last week that Russia's ZAO Interautomatika had been hired to help install the turbines in Crimea. Siemens said on Monday it had expanded investigations by an internal taskforce to all of its Russian-based entities and relevant partners to ensure that no equipment or services could be supplied that could violate export control restrictions.  This also applies to Siemens' minority stake in Interautomatika,  it said, adding that Interautomatika had confirmed in writing Siemens' insistence that all relevant activities with respect to Crimea be immediately terminated. Siemens added that it would file lawsuits to halt any further deliveries to Crimea and to return already-dispatched equipment to its original destination. It said it was evaluating what additional actions were possible. The Siemens source had earlier told Reuters that the company was taking legal steps to address the issue.

Busisiwe Mkhwebane, whose job is to ensure proper conduct in public office, recommended last month that the South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) mandate of maintaining price and currency stability be changed to focus on economic growth. That set off a political row that has hit the rand and government bonds and prompted court challenges from SARB Governor Lesetja Kganyago, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete. They argue that Mkhwebane had gone beyond the scope of her mandate. The Public Protector's spokeswoman Cleopatra Mosana said on Thursday that Mkhwebane had filed a notice opposing the challenges to her recommendation. Mkhwebane said she was empowered by the constitution to intervene in such affairs. On Monday, however, her offices said Mkhwebane would no longer be putting up a defence of her recommendation in court.  Having considered the legal advice from the Senior Counsel, which advice she accepted, the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has decided not to oppose SARB’s review application,  Mkhwebane's office said in a statement. The rand was unmoved by the news. Analysts say it is unclear what prompted Mkhwebane's recommendation. It will now be up to the courts to decide whether her mandate extends to the central bank. The SARB has requested for a hearing of the case in August. The ruling African National Congress has stated that it is opposed to altering the mandate the central bank. But its ally Cosatu, the country's biggest union, has backed calls for changes saying the bank is not acting in the interests of South Africa's poor majority. Mkhwebane made the proposal to change the bank's mandate when she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of a bank that was subsequently bought by Absa, now a unit of Barclays Africa Group.

The announcement comes ahead of elections on Aug. 8 when Kenya chooses a president, lawmakers and other regional officials, and is certain to be viewed favourably by the average Kenyan voter who sees members of parliament in particular as symbols of a greedy political culture. In 2013, the lawmakers, even then among the world's best-paid lawmakers, voted to increase their salaries to more than 130 times the minimum wage in defiance of government plans to cut them as part of spending reforms. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission, which advises the government on the wages of public sector officials, said members of parliament would now earn 621,250 shillings a month down from 710,000 shillings previously. It said the president's salary would be cut to 1.44 million shillings a month from 1.65 million shillings, while his deputy will earn 1.23 million shillings from 1.4 million shillings.  To ensure that the desired public services are delivered in a cost-effective and fiscally sustainable manner will require effective management of wage bill spending,  the SRC said in a statement. Incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is seeking re-election in August, said in March that the overall wage bill had to be cut.

He also said any increased deficit leeway would be best used to increase investments. Renzi, on the other hand, said  fiscal space should be used entirely and only for tax cuts.  Renzi said the EU's fiscal compact, which was agreed in 2012 and sets tough deficit- and debt-reduction goals for high-debt countries like Italy, was  mindless  and should be scrapped. His proposal means none of Italy's main parties are in favor of respecting the fiscal compact, with parliamentary elections to be held by May next year.         Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, told reporters in Brussels that EU fiscal rules had been jointly agreed, were re-discussed only last year and changing them  is not going to be easy.  Renzi repeatedly tussled with Brussels over Italy's deficit during his nearly three years as prime minister, when he raised deficit reduction targets that the European Commission said were needed to cut Italy's huge public debt. The debt, at about 133 percent of GDP, is the highest in the euro zone after Greece's.

Our investigators say that potentially criminal content has not been passed on for a long time solely via traditional ways of communication,  a spokesman for the Justice Ministry said. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Telegram secure private messages with end-to-end encryption, which means that messages can only be seen by the sender and the recipient. Austria sent the draft law detailing the proposals to political, technical, civil rights and legal experts on Monday. Vienna is seeking access to real-time conversation data in cases where a court has granted permission and which might be connected to terrorism or crimes that are punished by at least five years in prison, the spokesman added. Austrian courts have already sentenced several people to jail for links to terrorist organisations after verdicts which have been supported by data acquired from seized devices. The new law would give police wider, remote access. But it would not grant blanket access to hard drives, the spokesman added. The bill still needs to go to parliament after a deadline for the submission of expert opinions on Aug. 21. Austria's government and police have said the law would provide the necessary legal basis for authorities to seek a technical solution for circumventing encrypted communication remotely and in real time. But tech experts say that weakening encryption by creating back doors for governments will leave phones, computers and other devices far more vulnerable. The justice ministry spokesman said Austria's bill followed in the footsteps of other European countries such as Spain, France, Italy and Poland. In Germany, police and intelligence services technically have the right to install malware on suspect phones, but this is highly controversial and it is unclear how widely used it is. And the Dutch Senate is voting on a new digital security law on Tuesday that includes provisions to allow intelligence services to target criminal suspects with malware. Meanwhile, Britain's Intelligence Act, which is still being implemented, explicitly gives power to police and intelligence services for the mass interception of communications. But the United States Senate failed last year to require firms like Apple to help law enforcement crack encrypted data. In Mexico the government targeted opposition officials with software designed to fight criminals, a report by the University of Toronto said last month.

The statement, which was distributed to its joint venture partners and which Reuters saw, comes after a prominent government-allied lawyer said a new legislative body could rewrite parts of the constitution to ensure the state has full ownership of the oil industry. The new  constituent assembly  would supersede other institutions and has sparked fears that President Nicolas Maduro's unpopular administration could take aim at joint venture partners, which include large oil companies Chevron Corp and Rosneft. But PDVSA, whose full name is Petroleos de Venezuela, was quelling fears that a more radical wing of the ruling Socialist Party could be out to nationalize companies, as late leader Hugo Chavez did a decade ago. PDVSA  guarantees legal security to investors, partners, and others,  the statement read.  In the case of joint ventures, PDVSA has honored and will continue to honor the legal norms that allow the possibility of doing business with private companies.  Venezuelan oil laws created under Chavez allow for minority participation of private companies in oilfield joint ventures, and numerous companies formed such partnerships despite nationalizations in the sector. PDVSA did not directly mention the comments by Hermann Escarra, a constitutional lawyer and candidate to the constituent assembly. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bruised Oil Industry Nationalizing oil ventures would worsen a severe drop in production in Venezuela, home to the world's largest crude reserves. That would hurt the country's already ailing coffers, which depend on oil sales for more than 90 percent of their income. And PDVSA has been offering its foreign partners more stakes in joint ventures to foreign companies, including key Russian ally Rosneft and ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of India's top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp, as it tries to minimize operating costs, Reuters has reported. Still, as Venezuela's political crisis worsens, a half-dozen oil industry sources consulted by Reuters said the situation was becoming more uncertain. Companies may curtail investments as they await clarity on the July 30 vote for the constituent assembly, which Maduro's foes have denounced as a bid to consolidate dictatorship via a sham poll.  Imagine justifying to your board of directors that you put more money into Venezuela when there was an announcement from the president's top adviser that he was going to nationalize companies,  said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston.  This will pour cold water (on investments). ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil-idUSL1N1K10RM"},

The blue chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.3 percent at 7,370.03  points at its close, whereas the mid-caps were down 0.2 percent, held back by a near-40-percent fall in Carillion's shares. The construction and support services group plunged after its CEO stepped down as it issued a full-year profit warning, citing difficult markets and deterioration in some contracts. Carillion is one of the most-shorted UK firms, according to FCA disclosure data.  (Carillion's) issued a profit warning, saying that profits are going to be lower ...  also they've got a big debt pile, which isn't getting any smaller, and that all raises the prospect that they might have to raise more capital, perhaps through a rights issue at some stage,  said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  Put all these things together, add on top of that the CEO stepping down and you've got a pretty grisly statement and consequently a very negative reaction from the market.  Peer Balfour Beatty also fell more than 3 percent. While moves among blue chips were fairly muted, financials added the most points to the index, with lenders HSBC and Standard Chartered making gains. Asset management firm Schroders was the biggest riser, jumping more than 2 percent and hitting a two-month high after RBC raised its rating on the stock to  outperform .  The underlying business is in good shape and cost control will likely surprise on the upside,  analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note.  Given Schroders' relative share price underperformance recently and a conservative consensus, we believe current levels represent an attractive entry point,  they added. Earlier in the session mining firms were the weakest performers on the index, but they recovered as the price of copper pared losses and oil prices gained. Anglo American and BHP Billiton both rose around 1.7 percent, closely followed by precious metals miner Randgold Resources, which gained 1.5 percent, helped by a firmer gold price.

Ebola survivor Salomé Karwah, who worked with charity Doctors Without Borders after recovering from the often deadly virus, died in February four days after giving birth by Caesarean section in a major hospital. Her family say staff refused to touch Karwah because she had contracted Ebola in 2014. Liberia's health ministry in March started investigating the claim, which was rejected by the hospital, saying workers had done all they could to save her.  Yet despite being told in April that the investigation into her death had been concluded, Karwah's relatives say they have since been denied access to the findings by the health ministry. Liberian authorities were not immediately available to comment.  It has been four months since her death and we are worried that this episode will drag on and on until people forget,  her brother Reginald Karwah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We deserve to know the truth ... we want to move on,  he said, adding that the family were considering suing the hospital if they did not receive the results of the investigation soon. The health ministry's chief medical officer, Francis Kateh, in March said it was  tragic that one of our heroes, who survived Ebola, died from childbirth in a hospital , but that he did not think that stigma or fear were factors in her death.  Karwah was one of five people featured on the Time magazine cover in 2014 for their work battling Ebola.  Since her previous exposure - when Ebola killed a number of her relatives - had rendered her immune, she was able to make direct contact with sick patients that most carers could not. Liberia was hit hardest by the world's worst Ebola outbreak, losing more than 4,800 people in an epidemic which killed about 11,300 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016. Traces of Ebola can hide in survivors' bodies long after they have recovered, but health experts say the risk of the virus re-emerging and being transmitted to others is very low.  Despite that, there is stigma around survivors of the virus in West Africa, and some experts fear that could lead to further preventable deaths.

Investors dumped government bonds over the past two weeks on the belief that the European Central Bank (ECB) would unwind extraordinary stimulus sooner rather than later. This pushed yields up to levels where they were starting to look attractive again, resulting in Monday's dip, analysts said.  It is a retracement after a very strong move over the last two weeks,  Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire said.  With Bunds where they are, you are always going to get some buyers willing to buy (bonds with) zero risk at over 50 basis points.  The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond , the benchmark for the region, recorded its biggest one-day fall in almost four weeks, down 3 basis points at 0.54 percent. But they are more than double the 0.25 percent level at which it began on June 27, the day ECB President Mario Draghi opened the door to tweaks in the ECB's aggressive stimulus policy in a speech in Sintra, Portugal. Other euro zone bond yields were down 2 to 6 bps on Monday. Strong U.S. employment data on Friday bolstered a feeling that central banks across the world have more reason then ever to continue to unwind the loose policy stance of the post-crisis era. U.S. 10-Year treasury yields might trade in a 2.50 to 2.75 percent range by the end of the year, Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, said last week. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan offered its most optimistic view of the country's regional economies in more than a decade on solid exports and private consumption, underscoring its conviction a steady recovery is gathering momentum.  Unlike in recent years, where there was very patchy growth across the world, we are seeing a synchronised upswing in the global economy,  Alex Dryden, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said.  So while it may not be coordinated communication, I do think there's been a change in rhetoric from central banks across the world - though the ECB is the central bank to watch in the second half of the year.

Jolts to financial markets from North Korea's military provocations are frequent but were until recently contained by an implicit expectation that global diplomatic efforts could limit Pyongyang's aggression. Now, however, there is as much market anxiety about Trump's unrestrained Tweets and a hawkish White House response as there is about North Korean agitations. Since Trump's election in November, price reactions to North Korean long-range missile tests in credit and currency derivatives, typically used by traders to hedge geopolitical risk, have been distinctly sharper.  Trump has moved markets and China more within months than (Barack) Obama in eight years,  said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.     The reclusive North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in defiance of U.N. resolutions for decades as it is still at war with South Korea after the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Before Trump's election, missile tests came with such regularity that markets learned to shrug them off. This year, the options market shows the cost of insuring investments against North Korean-related risks has surged, with 3-month protection against a drop in the won, for example, reaching a high of 231 basis points in mid-April, double the levels six months earlier. This spike came as the U.S. diverted a warship towards the Korean Peninsula and showed off its strike capability in Syria, which it conducted just as Trump met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The cost of owning the option to sell the won in April was the highest it had been since August 2015, when the two Koreas were in a tense military standoff.  It's the Trump-on-stage reaction,  a currency trader in Seoul said.  Trump's hard line approach, and his past crazy comments on everything from the Mexico-wall to Syria policies have created a whole new range of uncertainties for traders investing here.  A woman talking on the phone walks past an electronic board of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) at the Korea Exchange (KRX) in Seoul, South Korea, January 20, 2016Kim Hong-JiPricing in Trump Despite heightened geopolitical tensions, South Korea's main asset markets have performed well this year with the won KRW=KFTC and Kospi stock benchmark .KS11 up 4.6 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively, on robust exports and an upbeat outlook on second quarter corporate earnings. The cost of hedging, however, is where investors have felt the pain: options to sell Korean won for dollars were perversely more expensive after Trump's November presidential victory than when North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test two months earlier. The premium on three-month options to sell the won had hovered around 100 basis points for years before Trump took office, and barely budged even when then U.S. President Obama issued a stern warning to Pyongyang following a missile test in April 2016.  Financial markets have become more sensitive to the U.S. stance with more hard line policies under Trump, compared to when the Democrats were in power,  Shim Hyun-soo, a senior fund manager with the quantitative management team of Kyobo AXA Investment Managers, said. In other derivatives markets, the spread on South Korea's 5-year credit default swap KRGV5YUSAC=MG--the contracts that offer investors protection against default on debt--reached a 10-month high of 60 basis points on April 17.

Five of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by 0.65 percent rise in technology index. Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia propped up the S&P; 500 index. The healthcare index was down 0.21 percent, weighed down by Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic. President Donald Trump's effort to roll back Obamacare faced growing obstacles on Monday as Republicans remained divided over how to curb the costs of their proposed healthcare bill and prevent millions from losing coverage.  We're going to have to wait and see what the plan B is. With that I think healthcare obviously comes under pressure as it falls into the void of the unknown,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. Investors were wary of making big bets ahead of the start of the earnings season, with big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup reporting on Friday. In a significant victory for the banking industry, the Fed late last month approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes.  I think that's very reflective of the fact that you've got a market that's looking ahead to catalysts and probably not going to react much in front of them,  Hogan said.  When the market takes a wait-and-see attitude, the markets tend to react like this.  The three major indexes are trading close to record levels, boosted by strong economic data and robust corporate performance in the first quarter. Markets closed on a high on Friday after a payrolls report gave investors more confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 222,000 jobs last month, a report by the U.S. Labor Department showed on Friday. It was the second biggest increase this year and topped economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. The dollar climbed to a two-month high against the Japanese yen on Monday as a robust jobs data propped up U.S. Treasury yields. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony is the key highlight of this week for investors looking for cues on further rate hikes. She will testify on Wednesday and Thursday. At 11:32 a.m. ET (15:32 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.42 points, or 0.03 percent, at 21,420.76, the S&P; 500 was up 2.77 points, or 0.114218 percent, at 2,427.95 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 11.32 points, or 0.18 percent, at 6,164.40. United Health was down 0.23 percent at $187.51 after the President Trump's plan to replace Obamacare continued to face obstacles. Abercrombie & Fitch shares were down 20.6 percent at $9.65 after the teen apparel retailer terminated discussion on a potential deal following a review. ClubCorp shares were up 30 percent at $17.05 after the owner of private golf and country clubs got a takeover offer from private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC.

Konta had previously won only one match in five Wimbledon appearances. But after racking up her fourth in this tournament, she now finds herself facing Romanian second seed Simona Halep and, with the woman's draw looking wide open, has an outside chance of becoming the first home champion since Virginia Wade 40 years ago. The sixth seed, who spent her formative years in Australia before moving to play in Spain as a 14-year-old and then becoming British in 2012, put on an efficient display, albeit with a big wobble in the middle, to overcome a tenacious foe. Konta was always on top in the first set despite having to take it via a tie break, when one amazing reaction forehand return to a Garcia smash had the sun-baked Number One court crowd roaring their appreciation.  Konta, famously controlled on court, did not get carried away with the success, however, and seemed equally calm when she lost five games in a row en route to Garcia taking the second set. Her coach Wim Fissette has suggested she might try breaking out of her on-court  neutral zone  in a bid to take the next step in her career. But the 26-year-old Konta seemed content to stay in her bubble and showed almost no reaction to success or failure or the crowd's attempts to lift her.

Serve dominated to such an extent that the first break point did not arrive until the 10th game, but when it did, Konta took full advantage as Garcia netted.

The long awaited premiere of the ballet about Rudolf Nureyev, one of the first Soviet artists to defect to the West, was due to be held on July 11, but the Bolshoi said on its website late on Saturday it would not take place. Vladimir Urin, the theatre's director general, told a news conference on Monday it had been pulled because rehearsals had shown it was not ready. He said it would be staged in May next year instead.  We watched one run-through, and given the quality of the ballet, we realised it was bad,  Urin told reporters.  But TASS cited a spokeswoman for Vladimir Medinsky, the culture minister, as saying he had spoken to Urin beforehand, suggesting there were other concerns.  Yes there was a long conversation with Urin,  TASS cited Irina Kaznacheeva, the spokeswoman, as saying.  But a ban is the not the ministry's working style.  She said she did not know details of the conversation.  Makhar Vaziev, ballet director of the Bolshoi Theatre, and Bolshoi's Director general Vladimir Urin attend a news conference on the postponement of the world premiere of the Nureyev ballet, weeks after its director Kirill Serebrennikov was questioned as a witness in a fraud investigation, at the Bolshoi in Moscow, Russia, July 10, 2017.Maxim ShemetovHowever, TASS cited a source close to the culture ministry as saying the production had been postponed because Medinsky had been concerned it violated a law designed to prevent the promotion of homosexuality to minors. Under the legislation, which the European Court of Human Rights ruled last month breached European treaty rules, any event or act regarded by the authorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors is illegal and punishable by a fine.

Believe me, I understood well it was a specific theme that could be rejected by a number of people.  In 1958-61 Nureyev was a principal dancer of the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Ballet in St Petersburg. He asked for political asylum in France while on tour in Paris in 1961. The postponement has caused a scandal in Moscow. The Bolshoi, which was founded in 1776, was last embroiled in controversy in 2013 when its then artistic director, Sergei Filin, had acid thrown in his face in an episode which lifted the lid on poisonous rivalries over roles, money and power at one of Russia's most prominent cultural institutions.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday reiterated the central bank's pledge to keep Japanese government bond yields anchored near zero. The yen was also pressured after Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly tumbled in May on persistent weakness in the services sector.  On balance, the weak data is probably weighing on the yen and the move from the BOJ last week is probably also contributing,  said Erik Nelson, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The greenback was up 0.19 percent to 114.1 yen, after hitting 114.29 yen, its highest since May 11, earlier in the session.  At the current level we would not be chasing the move higher here, especially not before earnings,  said Alvise Marino, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.  Dollar-yen, of course, remains very sensitive on the risk front.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.14 percent at 96.143.  The dollar has been broadly supported over the past couple of days and is showing some mild signs of recovery after weakness in the prior week,  Nelson said. The greenback had gained on Friday after a strong U.S. jobs report supported the idea that the Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates at least once more this year. Investors will be focused this week on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress on Wednesday and U.S. consumer inflation data on Friday.

Tesla's shares have taken a beating in the last few weeks, as investors have become increasingly concerned that demand for the company's existing Model S sedan is weakening. Musk said in May that some  confused  Tesla buyers considered the new Model 3 as an upgrade to the Model S, hurting orders for the older car. Registrations for Tesla's vehicles in California, its largest market, fell 24 percent in April from a year ago, according to data from research firm IHS Markit. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that new registrations of Tesla cars fell to zero in Hong Kong after authorities slashed a tax break for electric vehicles in April.

Nearly 35 percent of the 1,300 heads of household included in the June poll said they were better off economically than a year go, a record in the four years the survey has been conducted. The results bolster the current Fed outlook of an economy that continues to generate jobs despite tepid overall growth and some concern about a recent dip in inflation, improving chances the central bank can follow through with plans for a further interest rate increase later this year. Though household expectations of inflation for the year ahead did dip slightly from the May survey, to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent, respondents expect strong price increases of 2.8 percent over the coming three years. That's consistent with the Fed's current outlook that the recent weakness in inflation will prove temporary. The survey also bolstered the view of continued strong consumption growth. Half of those polled said they expected to spend at least 3.3 percent more in the coming year, compared to median expected spending growth of 2.6 percent in the May survey. One-year-ahead expected earnings growth increased to 2.5 percent in the June survey from 2.2 percent in May. Respondents also showed broad faith in the strength of the labor market, with a slight dip to 13.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the perceived probability of losing a job in the next year, and a jump to 59.2 percent from 56.7 percent in the probability of finding employment. More than a fifth of respondents said they might leave a job voluntarily in the next year, up from 19.4 percent in May. Voluntarily job exits are considered a sign of a strong labor market that offers employees choices. The online poll is designed to be a representative sample of the U.S. population. The New York Fed did not provide the margin of error for the  poll.

Trading resumed fully later on Monday, with quotes for individual stocks finally restored with just over an hour of trade left after three attempts to re-open.  The disruption frustrated traders and put a spotlight on the NSE when it is facing a regulatory probe over whether some brokers were given unfair access to its servers. The glitch also coincides with a string of record highs for Indian share indexes, including on Monday, with the country's stock markets attracting billions of dollars in foreign investments. The NSE attributed the disruption to an unidentified  software problem  and said it had not been related to any cyber-attack.  NSE deeply apologises for the glitch. The matter is being examined by the internal technical team and external vendors, to analyse and identify the cause which led to the issue and to suggest solutions to prevent recurrence,  the exchange said. Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said in a statement it had asked for a detailed report on the matter and ordered NSE to review its contingency plans for dealing with trading disruptions. The Finance Ministry has also asked for a report, a senior ministry official said. This will increase scrutiny of the NSE, which submitted an application for an initial public offering in December but has yet to win regulatory approval for the listing that bankers estimate could raise as much as $1 billion. The NSE's listing plans have been delayed by a regulatory investigation due to its disclosure in December that some brokers may have been provided unfair access to its servers in recent years. The NSE has also had to cope with a management upheaval after previous chief executive Chitra Ramkrishna resigned shortly before the NSE's disclosure about the potentially unfair access provided to traders, citing personal reasons. Newly appointed CEO Vikram Limaye is due to take over later this month. Traders Fume The disruption, which affected traders from the market's open, lasted longer than a three-hour disruption at its rival exchange, the BSE Ltd, in July 2014 because of a network outage. Traders were angry about the lack of communication and questioned why NSE did not have a back-up plan.     Although the markets re-opened for trading at midday, traders were frustrated that individual stocks were not immediately updating, or had wide gaps in bid and offer prices.  NSE said in a statement it had not invoked its business continuity plan because it was reserved for natural disasters, hardware failures and connectivity-related issues and added it had expected to rectify the problem quickly. Most traders switched to the BSE, which saw a surge in trading volumes by about 50 percent from last week's average, while shares rose as much as 1.2 percent to a record high. After trading resumed, the NSE's broader index .NSEI also rose as much as 1.2 percent to a record high, but volumes were only a fraction of the average seen last week. The NSE is by far the larger index of the two, and hence any disruption is felt more widely.  Varun Khandelwal, managing director of brokerage Bullero Capital, criticized the NSE for keeping traders in the dark.  He said the exchange then compounded the confusion with failed attempts at re-starting trade and by allowing derivatives trading to continue before finally fixing the lack of stock price updates.  Such a situation is very unfortunate and reflects very poorly on the managerial oversight at the NSE presently,  he said.

CME, whose main shareholder is U.S. media group Time Warner (TWX.N), said on Monday it agreed to sell its Croatian and Slovenian operations to United Group's Slovenia Broadband for 230 million euros ($262 million) to pay down debt, boosting shares to an eight-week high.  Co-CEO Michael Del Nin said in a telephone interview that the deal would speed up reducing CME's $1 billion debt, cut interest costs and improve profit margins.  In the near term we don't have any plans to reduce or expand our geographic footprint,  he told Reuters.  We need to get to a point where we are comfortable with the balance sheet. This transaction does a lot to get us there.  He did not exclude doing smaller deals on ancillary businesses in existing markets, but  there was nothing on the horizon . CME had already secured a debt re-pricing deal in March to cut its weighted average borrowing cost by 150 basis points to 7.25 percent. The sale of its Slovenian and Croatian assets will cut that average borrowing cost further, to an expected rate of 4.5 percent, CME said. Most of CME's debt is in term loans guaranteed by Time Warner, which holds a 42.5 percent stake but has a 75 percent share on a fully diluted basis factoring in warrants it holds.  Del Nin said the sale deal, expected to be completed by the end of the year, would also help CME's free cash flow generation. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for 18 percent of CME net revenue of $638.0 million in 2016 but only 9 percent of its total operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA), with their smaller scale limiting its margins. Del Nin said CME's OIBDA margin overall was 23.5 percent in 2016, but reached 26 percent when excluding Croatia and Slovenia.  That helps understand the potential impact,  he said. He also said that while the sales brought forward the possibility of a dividend, CME had a way to go before considering payments and it was unlikely to pay one for this year or next.  We have not guided 2018 results but I would be surprised (if) there is a dividend in (that) calendar year,  Del Nin said.

The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATING AND SENIOR DEBT RATINGS Achmea Bank's IDRs, Support Rating and senior unsecured debt ratings are based on Fitch's view of the extremely high probability that the bank would receive support, in case of need, from its parent Achmea B.V. (Achmea), combined with Fitch's assessment of Achmea's creditworthiness. Achmea Bank's role in Achmea, a leading Dutch insurance group operating predominantly in the Netherlands, has a high influence on the ratings. Achmea Bank consolidates Achmea's retail banking operations, offering primarily bank savings and mortgage loans, and originates mortgage loans for its sister company in the pension and life insurance business. It is also an important cross-selling tool with Achmea Bank's products linked to the selling of the group's insurance products. Our view is further supported by the bank's deep integration with the parent, common branding and reputational risks for Achmea in case of subsidiary default. Achmea also has a record of providing Achmea Bank with capital and liquidity when required. This includes a guarantee against a portfolio of loans transferred from another part of the group and two equity injections totalling EUR204 million in July 2015 and December 2016. Fitch does not assign a Viability Rating to Achmea Bank given its close integration with the group and Fitch's opinion that the bank's franchise cannot be assessed on a standalone basis. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATING AND SENIOR DEBT RATINGS A change of Achmea's creditworthiness as assessed by Fitch could result in a change of Achmea Bank's IDRs, Support Rating and senior unsecured debt ratings. The ratings are also sensitive to perceived changes in the bank's strategic importance to its parent, or to a significant change in Achmea's ability to provide support to the bank.

Some, noting the sunny weather, even enjoyed being diverted onto a free, specially arranged ferry across the Hudson River.  The three railroads that carry tens of thousands of people each day to and from Pennsylvania Station in midtown Manhattan have canceled some trains and rerouted others for the eight weeks the work on the tracks is expected to take. Some riders from New Jersey complained about lengthened commutes, while noting they were already used to delays after a string of derailments and stalled trains at the station this year that the repairs are intended to remedy. Many riders and transit officials attributed the relatively smooth start to a successful public awareness campaign, including numerous station attendants who answered questions, handed out pamphlets and herded disoriented passengers. Related CoverageFactbox: New York City transit crises in the 21st centuryEvening rush hour a 'test' for NYC's Penn Station commuters - AmtrakNew Yorkers vent about rail disruptions on social media Tickets out!  one attendant bellowed at New Jersey's Hoboken Terminal, on the opposite side of the Hudson River from Manhattan.  This way to the 39th Street ferry!  shouted another. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had predicted a  summer of hell  for commuters as the repairs continued through to Sept. 1. Bill McLeer, who works in data analysis and was waiting in an unusually subdued Penn Station for a train home to Mount Laurel in New Jersey, called the governor's warning  completely overblown.  And some commuters relished a free ride on a ferry that normally costs $9.   People arrive to the Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey, U.S., July 10, 2017.Eduardo Munoz It's my first time,  said David Lawner, a database administrator from West Orange, New Jersey, as he marveled at the warm breezes of the ferry's open-top deck.  Isn't this relaxing?    Another ferry rider, Kathleen Lynn, was less rhapsodic.  It's going to add 20 minutes,  said Lynn, a Summit, New Jersey, resident who works in financial services.  Or an hour. Depends on whether everything hooks up.  Penn Station, an underground maze of low ceilings and mediocre dining spots built in the 1960s, serves about 95,000 New Jersey Transit customers and about 116,000 Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) customers on an average weekday, according to 2016 data. Slideshow (19 Images)Amtrak, the national passenger rail corporation and the station's owner, says an average of 28,000 rides a day on its intercity services begin or end in Penn Station. The commuter crunch highlights lagging investment in U.S. infrastructure, and especially in New York City, which is dependent on mass transit.  Even so, Amtrak reported most of its trains ran on time or close to it, and the Penn Station departures board showed no delays during the evening rush.  We've had a good commute this morning,  Amtrak's president, Charles  Wick  Moorman, said in an interview.  It's the first morning of a long process, but right now we feel good.  Joe Lhota, who oversees the LIRR as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's chairman, praised riders, saying  they did everything perfect today.   Tomorrow is another day, we start afresh,  he told reporters during the evening rush.  We're expecting thunderstorms in the morning.

U.S. long-dated yields, which move inversely to prices, fell for just the second time in nine days.  This is mostly consolidation given there's not a lot of data,  said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist, at Societe Generale in New York.  For the last couple of weeks, we have been seeing an alignment of expectations and reality and that allowed Treasuries to sell off a little bit,  he added. The robust U.S. jobs report released last Friday, even with low wage growth, affirmed expectations that the world's largest economy was steadily improving and supported the Fed's tightening path. That has pushed Treasury yields higher, which have been rising anyway the last few weeks amid a round of generally solid U.S. economic data. Braizinha believes there is still room for U.S. Treasury yields to go higher, but believes that 2.5 percent in 10-year yields would get a lot of support. U.S. Treasuries have also been moving in tandem with global markets. On Monday, euro-zone bond yields fell, with investors buying back bonds after a two-week sell-off. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, was headed for its biggest one-day fall in almost four weeks, down 4 basis points at 0.54 percent. In late morning trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell to 2.374 percent, from 2.393 percent last Friday. After Friday's jobs report, U.S. 10-year yields hit an eight-week high of 2.398 percent. U.S. 30-year yields slid to 2.927 percent, from 2.935 percent last Friday. They hit a more than six-week peak of 2.943 percent after the U.S. jobs data. On the front-end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields slipped to 1.391 percent, from Friday's 1.407 percent. The U.S. Treasury this week will auction a combined $56 billion in notes and bonds: selling $24 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday, $20 billion in reopened 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $12 billion in opened 30-year bonds on Thursday.

It has been given $509 million to distribute in the 2017-20 cycle, compared to $439 for the previous four-year period. On Monday, the Lausanne-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD) said the IOC should give   more complete and thorough information on the processes and financial flows from Olympic Solidarity . Presenting a report of the IOC's governance, the institute suggested setting up a fully-owned subsidiary to run the programme.     The review was commissioned in 2015 as part of the IOC's agenda 2020 reforms which also aimed to make the Olympics more attractive, reduce the cost of hosting them and get the IOC to become more transparent. The IOC and other sporting federations were also determined to avoid being tarred with the same brush as world soccer's ruling body FIFA, which was hit by an unprecedented corruption crisis in 2015. It also proposed that the IOC became  more directly involved in the organization of the Olympic Games  to make sure that promises of a lasting legacy would be fulfilled. Another suggestion was that the IOC's ethics commission be given  more independence to investigate cases of ethical misconduct, thus improving its efficiency  and that it be given its own budget.

Heavily-armed attackers have in the past two weeks beheaded nine civilian men and killed three police officers in coastal Lamu district, which borders Somalia. Al Shabaab Islamists claimed responsibility for the police killings. Kenyan police say the militants have used Boni forest as a base for attacks in the region. “A serious operation has started in Boni forest. We are flushing them out of the forest,  Nelson Marwa, Coast region coordinator, told journalists in the port city of Mombasa.  We will do all it takes to secure the forest and we are urging the neighboring communities to stay away to avoid any injuries.  An armed group, many of whom appeared to be ethnic Somalis, attacked two villages on Friday night, going from house to house and seizing non-Muslim men, whom they later beheaded. The government on Saturday imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew for three months in Lamu and two other neighboring counties. Al Shabaab is fighting to overthrow Somalia's western-backed government and establish its own rule, based on the group's strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law.  The Islamists frequently launch attacks on Kenyan soil which they say are intended to force the country to withdraw its troops from Somalia.

The Outlooks on the IDRs are Stable. The affirmation reflects our expectations that Lenta will maintain conservative credit metrics relative to close sector peers, while executing its growth strategy and improving its market position. We assume that the company's strict financial discipline and control over costs should help protect the balance sheet amid strengthened competition, sales cannibalisation and weak consumer spending in Russia. The ratings remain supported by Lenta's good access to local funding and strong financial flexibility. KEY RATING DRIVERS Enlarging Business Scale: The ratings factor in our expectation of improvement in Lenta's market position and further growth in its EBITDAR to levels more commensurate with the 'BB' rating category. The company intends to become the third-largest food retailer in Russia by 2020, up from fifth-largest by sales in 2016. We assume Lenta's expansion strategy will be supported by its robust business model and growth opportunities in the Russian food retail market arising from its fragmented nature and still high proportion of traditional retail relative to modern chains. Reduction in LfL Sales: Lenta's like-for-like (LfL) sales declined by 1.7% in 1Q17 and we expect overall organic sales growth to remain under pressure in 2017. This is due to sales cannibalisation by own stores as well as increased competition in the market as consumer spending in Russia remains weak. This is reflected in our expectation of weak footfall and higher operating leverage in 2017. We expect Lenta will be able to mitigate this pressure by retaining tight control over personnel and other store costs (keeping them relatively stable as a proportion of revenue). Decreasing but Strong Margins: As previously, Fitch projects Lenta's EBITDA margin will reduce gradually to 9.2% by 2020 (2016: 10.4%) but remain strong compared with Russian and European food retail peers. The major drivers of lower margins will be rising operating lease expenses and margin sacrifices to withstand competition. This is despite our expectations that the company's growing scale is likely to result in greater bargaining power with suppliers. Moderate Leverage: Fitch expects FFO adjusted leverage to reduce slightly to 3.5x in 2017 (2016: 3.7x) and remain around that level over the medium term. Deleveraging in 2017 should be supported by shifting a portion of capex to 2018. This demonstrates the company's ability to manage leverage through the timing of its store roll-out programme and could be applied further should economic or business conditions become more challenging. The ratings assume the company will maintain its conservative and consistent financial policy. Mildly Negative FCF: Fitch projects Lenta's FCF to remain negative but the proportion of capex funded with operating cash flow should increase to 65%-80% (2016: 45%). This is because we now assume slower selling space expansion and therefore lower capex. Our forecast for operating cash flows in 2017 takes into account shorter trade payable days following trade law amendments in 2016, which came into full force in 2017. Healthy Financial Flexibility: Lenta has the strongest FFO fixed charge coverage (2016: 2.7x) of its Russian peers due to high levels of store ownership. Fitch projects the fixed charge cover metric to remain relatively stable at around 2.5x over 2017-2020, solid for the rating, although we factor in a growing share of leasehold stores due to fast expansion in the supermarket format. Lenta's financial discipline, access to external funding, limited FX exposure also supports the group's financial flexibility and mitigates its relatively weak liquidity ratio for the rating. Limited Format Diversification: The ratings are constrained by Lenta's limited diversification outside its core hypermarket format. Supermarkets accounted for only 4% of the group's sales in 2016 and Fitch expects this share to only grow to around 15% by 2020, despite Lenta's accelerated expansion under the format. However, we consider the move towards accelerating format diversification as credit positive if it does not dilute profitability on a sustained basis. Average Recoveries for Unsecured Bondholders: Lenta's bonds are rated in line with its Long-Term Local-Currency IDR of 'BB' as the bonds are pari passu with unsecured bank loans and there is no prior-ranking debt. The bonds' rating reflects our view of average recovery expectations in case of default. DERIVATION SUMMARY Lenta has a stronger business profile and better credit metrics than O'Key Group SA (B+/Stable). Lenta is rated at the same level as X5 Retail Group N.V. (BB/Stable) but has less headroom under its 'BB' rating, primarily because Lenta has lower scale and format diversification despite its stronger coverage metrics. X5's rating is constrained by weak FFO fixed charge coverage. In comparison with international retail chains, Lenta has smaller business scale and diversification than Chile-based Cencosud SA (BBB-/Stable) and French and Brazilian retailer Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (BB+/Stable) but its credit metrics are substantially stronger. The weak operating environment in Russia contributes to a lower rating for Lenta relative to global peers, in line with our criteria. There is no Country Ceiling constraint on the ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - 15% revenue CAGR over 2017-2020 driven primarily by increase in selling space - EBITDA margin gradually decreasing to 9.2% - Capex at 8%-9% of revenue - No external dividends paid by Lenta Ltd funded by Lenta LLC. - No large-scale debt-funded M&A; - Maintained negative working capital position RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action Positive rating action is unlikely in the coming two years, unless there is a material improvement in Lenta's market position translating into EBITDAR of at least EUR1 billion, and subject to: - Solid execution of the company's expansion plan and good LfL sales growth relative to peers - Maintaining EBITDA margin at around 9% - FFO-adjusted gross leverage below 3.0x on a sustained basis - FFO fixed charge coverage above 2.5x on a sustained basis Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - A sharp contraction in LfL sales growth relative to close peers along with material failure in executing the company's expansion plan - EBITDA margin erosion to below 8% - FFO-adjusted gross leverage above 4.0x on a sustained basis - FFO fixed charge cover significantly below 2.5x - Deterioration of liquidity position as a result of high capex, worsened working capital turnover and weakened access to local funding LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: As at 6 June 2017, Lenta's cash of RUB5.1 billion and available undrawn committed credit lines of RUB11.5 billion were insufficient to cover expected negative FCF and RUB27.5 billion in short-term debt. Nevertheless, we believe that the company's liquidity position is supported by capex scalability and Lenta's good access to bank loans and capital markets as evidenced by recent refinancing activities. As at 6 June 2017 Lenta had RUB23.8 billion of undrawn uncommitted credit lines.

The carmaking joint venture based in the central Serbian city of Kragujevac is 67 percent owned by Fiat and 33 percent by the state, with production accounting for 3 percent of Serbia's economic output and around 8 percent of exports. The plant, which employs around 2,400 people, manufactured 100,000 cars a year in 2015. Last year, the venture cut jobs with a mix of voluntary and compulsory redundancies and reduced daily production shifts from three to two. The strike started late last month as workers demanded better wages and a reduced workload. Unions said they unsuccessfully sought negotiations with management. Brnabic told workers on Monday that Fiat does not negotiate with striking workers and that they had violated an agreement between the union and Fiat by starting the strike.  We have lost a lot, workers lost wages for days while on strike, Fiat lost production,  ... Serbia is daily losing on its economic output and exports,  Tanjug quoted Brnabic as saying. Fiat management in Serbia could not immediately be reached for comment.  It will be very difficult for us in the future to bring new investors when there is no certainty that workers will honour contracts between unions and employers,  Brnabic was quoted as saying. Serbia's economy is expected to grow around 3 percent this year. The country relies heavily on foreign investors, including Fiat which in May launched three redesigned versions of the 500L, a larger version of the Fiat 500 mini car.

It has been given $509 million to distribute in the 2017-20 cycle, compared to $439 for the previous four-year period. On Monday, the Lausanne-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD) said the IOC should give   more complete and thorough information on the processes and financial flows from Olympic Solidarity .

The IOC and other sporting federations were also determined to avoid being tarred with the same brush as world soccer's ruling body FIFA, which was hit by an unprecedented corruption crisis in 2015. It also proposed that the IOC became  more directly involved in the organization of the Olympic Games  to make sure that promises of a lasting legacy would be fulfilled. Another suggestion was that the IOC's ethics commission be given  more independence to investigate cases of ethical misconduct, thus improving its efficiency  and that it be given its own budget.

CME, whose main shareholder is U.S. media group Time Warner (TWX.N), said on Monday it agreed to sell its Croatian and Slovenian operations to United Group's Slovenia Broadband for 230 million euros ($262 million) to pay down debt, boosting shares to an eight-week high.  Co-CEO Michael Del Nin said in a telephone interview that the deal would speed up reducing CME's $1 billion debt, cut interest costs and improve profit margins.  In the near term we don't have any plans to reduce or expand our geographic footprint,  he told Reuters.  We need to get to a point where we are comfortable with the balance sheet. This transaction does a lot to get us there.  He did not exclude doing smaller deals on ancillary businesses in existing markets, but  there was nothing on the horizon . CME had already secured a debt re-pricing deal in March to cut its weighted average borrowing cost by 150 basis points to 7.25 percent. The sale of its Slovenian and Croatian assets will cut that average borrowing cost further, to an expected rate of 4.5 percent, CME said. Most of CME's debt is in term loans guaranteed by Time Warner, which holds a 42.5 percent stake but has a 75 percent share on a fully diluted basis factoring in warrants it holds.  Del Nin said the sale deal, expected to be completed by the end of the year, would also help CME's free cash flow generation. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for 18 percent of CME net revenue of $638.0 million in 2016 but only 9 percent of its total operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA), with their smaller scale limiting its margins. Del Nin said CME's OIBDA margin overall was 23.5 percent in 2016, but reached 26 percent when excluding Croatia and Slovenia.  That helps understand the potential impact,  he said. He also said that while the sales brought forward the possibility of a dividend, CME had a way to go before considering payments and it was unlikely to pay one for this year or next.  We have not guided 2018 results but I would be surprised (if) there is a dividend in (that) calendar year,  Del Nin said.

Four students from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics entered the Lunar Palace-1 on Sunday with the aim of living self-sufficiently for 200 days.

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said it wanted to reverse the changes which  have the potential to cause significant delays for patients waiting for treatment for a range of conditions, including for cancer, heart disease and diabetes . British drugmakers have criticised the government for breaking a commitment to improve access to new medicines with the changes, which increase the cost threshold for certain drugs for rare diseases from previously planned levels.  These new arrangements will delay access to cost-effective medicines and deny treatments to patients suffering from rare diseases,  ABPI Chief Executive, Mike Thompson, said in a statement. The changes which came into force in April mean that new drugs costing the National Health Service (NHS) more than 20 million pounds ($25.7 million) a year will no longer be automatically funded, even if they are cost-effective. Instead, companies will have to enter negotiations to justify their use and work out funding. Thompson said that after raising concerns and offering to work on alternative proposals, the body had  applied to formally challenge these proposals in court .  We believe this to be the right course of action due to the potential damage these changes will cause to NHS care and on our ability to research, develop and use new medicines here in the UK.

The long awaited premiere of the ballet about Rudolf Nureyev, one of the first Soviet artists to defect to the West, was due to be held on July 11, but the Bolshoi said on its website late on Saturday it would not take place. Vladimir Urin, the theatre's director general, told a news conference on Monday it had been pulled because rehearsals had shown it was not ready. He said it would be staged in May next year instead. However, TASS cited a spokeswoman for Vladimir Medinsky, the culture minister, as saying he had spoken to the theatre about Nureyev.  Yes there was a long conversation with Urin,  TASS cited Irina Kaznacheeva, the spokeswoman, as saying.  But a ban is the not the ministry's working style.  She said she did not know details of the conversation. However, TASS cited a source close to the culture ministry as saying the production had been postponed because Medinsky had been concerned it violated a law designed to prevent the promotion of homosexuality to minors. Under the legislation, which the European Court of Human Rights ruled last month breached European treaty rules, any event or act regarded by the authorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors is illegal and punishable by a fine. The law has been used to stop gay pride marches and to detain gay rights activists. The postponement has caused a scandal in Moscow. The Bolshoi, which was founded in 1776, was last embroiled in controversy in 2013 when its then artistic director, Sergei Filin, had acid thrown in his face in an episode which lifted the lid on poisonous rivalries over roles, money and power at one of Russia's most prominent cultural institutions.

The U.N.'s cultural organization UNESCO said up to 900,000  enslaved Africans are believed to have landed at Valongo Wharf, the busiest slave port in Brazil, from when the stone wharf was built in 1811 until it was landfilled in 1842. Brazil was the world's greatest importer of slaves, taking in about five million Africans, and the last country in the world to officially abolish slavery, in 1888. A UNESCO statement said warehouses built at Valongo could accommodate more than 2,000 slaves, often in toxic and suffocating conditions which fueled diseases and led to mass graves at the site with a cemetery holding up to 6,000 burials. Remnants at Valongo, including bones, implements and food, are evidence of the brutal treatment of slaves.  The presence of the sacred and the sense of ancestry found in the place has turned Valongo into a symbolic landmark for social movements promoting racial equality,  UNESCO said in statement.  From a historic point of view, this is a testimony to one of the most brutal episodes in the history of humankind.  Although Brazil abolished slavery about 130 years ago, Latin America's largest economy acknowledged in 1995 the use of slave labor in its economy. The 2016 Global Slavery Index produced by the Australia-based Walk Free Foundation estimated that there are currently about 161,000 slaves in Brazil. Brazil has been praised by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and activists for making progress on tackling slavery in the past decade. Efforts have included setting up mobile units of inspectors, prosecutors and police who raid places where slave labor is suspected, and the creation of a  dirty list  of employers investigated by labor inspectors and found to be using slaves.

In 2016, the central bank became the first and so far the only one in the euro zone to introduce a so-called counter-cyclical capital buffer. Banks must meet the initial 0.5 percent requirement starting in August this year. It hinted at an increase in the buffer in April, when it released data showing economic growth and low interest rates had led to the fastest growth among European Union states in loans to households, including mortgages and consumer loans . Slovakia is part of the euro zone, whose central bank is keeping monetary policy ultra-loose. With interest rates low, banks have tried to increase lending. In the first quarter of 2017, loans to households in Slovakia grew by 13.9 percent year on year, following an average 14-percent annual growth in 2016.  The buffer is not meant to slow down lending. We aim to improve the resilience of the banking sector,  said Marek Licak, head of the central bank's macroprudential section. The buffer, in combination with stricter rules on lending that will come into effect next year, should eventually slow lending, Slovenska Sporitelna analyst Maria Valachyova said.  Loan growth in 2017 does not seem to slow down much as compared to 2016,  Valachyova said.  In 2018, new measures by the NBS (National Bank of Slovakia) including loan-to-value limits and stricter rules for loan granting should help slow down the retail loan growth to around 10 percent.  Slovakia's banks, including Slovenska Sporitelna, VUB, Tatra Banka, CSOB and UniCredit, are largely foreign-owned and have held up well in recent years. Average capital adequacy has increased from 17.8 percent in 2015 to 18.0 percent in 2016 The counter-cyclical buffer also means they will have to reassess their dividend policy. Between 2012 and 2015, the banks paid out dividends equivalent to 65 to 75 percent of profits.

The Monetary (Policy) Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range,  Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug told reporters after the rates decision. Prices had declined for 28 months through the end of 2016, with the inflation rate moving to 0.8 percent in May - below the government's annual target range of 1 to 3 percent. Flug noted that a strong shekel, a halt in higher energy prices and Israeli government steps to reduce the cost of living are expected to push the inflation rate lower in coming months before returning to the target range. The central bank forecasts an inflation rate of 0.5 percent this year, rising to 1.5 percent in 2018. In an updated forecast on Monday, the bank's own economists projected the key interest rate would remain unchanged through the first quarter of 2018, rise to 0.25 percent in the second quarter and rise again in the fourth quarter to bring the rate to 0.5 percent. With exports expected to improve as global trade strengthens, the central bank raised its economic growth estimate for 2017 to 3.4 percent from a previous 2.8 percent and left its 2018 forecast unchanged at 3.3 percent. Growth was 4 percent in 2016. Flug reiterated her belief that the shekel was over-appreciated and said the bank would continue to intervene if necessary.  The shekel is over-valued, a result of the very accommodative policy that some central banks are adopting,  Flug said. Without the Bank of Israel's intervention, in which it bought some $3 billion the past three months, the shekel would be even more over-valued, she said. The shekel is hovering at a three-year high versus the dollar at 3.5470 and is at a 17-year high versus a basket of currencies from Israel's largest trading partners. All 10 economists polled by Reuters had forecast no change in rates by the central bank. Israel's economy grew an annualised 1.2 percent in the first quarter, its slowest pace in almost two years with changes to the way cars are taxed distorting the numbers.  After a long period in which private consumption drove growth, there are increasing signs at this time there is a return to more balanced growth in the economy, with both exports and investments contributing,  Flug said.

Both countries have boosted production since they were exempted from an OPEC-led deal to cut output, weighing on global prices LCOc1. This has prompted more talk among producers about including them in the pact.  We have spoken to (OPEC Secretary General Mohammad) Barkindo and in the next two weeks there will be conversations with them (Libya and Nigeria) and possibly we will invite them to the technical summit,  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Istanbul. Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC nations including Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Oman will meet on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss the current situation in the oil market.  Nigeria's oil minister, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, was invited to the meeting but is unable to attend due to another commitment, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters at the same Istanbul event. Instead, the group will probably ask a technical committee involving the six OPEC and non-OPEC members, which is due to convene before the ministers hold their talks, to meet Nigerian and Libyan representatives to discuss their production plans, he said.  We extended the invitation but unfortunately there is a previous commitment for the Nigerian oil minister,  the minister said.  We did not talk about capping, at least we can talk about production plans right now,  he added. The monitoring panel, called the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee which Kuwait chairs, could recommend expanding the pact to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November.  Both Nigeria and Libya were given exemptions to the supply cut, under which OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers are reducing their output by about 1.8 million barrels per day because their output has been curbed by conflict.  OPEC delegates have said bringing Nigeria or Libya into the production pact would likely focus on capping their output, rather than asking them to cut their supply so soon after it had recovered from involuntary curbs. Kachikwu has said that Nigeria was not opposed in principle to joining OPEC's production cap, but would have to wait and see if production returned to acceptable levels. OPEC has not been in touch with Libya on the issue of capping the country's output, an OPEC delegate said. The Libyan government has not received an invitation to attend the ministerial meeting in Russia, he added. In comments to Reuters on Monday, the head of Libya's National Oil Corporation did not indicate any willingness to cap output yet, saying Libya's humanitarian problems must be considered in any talks on the subject. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla added Libya could assist with efforts to stabilize the market by informing OPEC about its plans to restore production.

The acquisition was formally announced on July 6, but financial terms were not disclosed. The purchase price represents a multiple of 16.5 times Blue Man’s last 12 months’ adjusted Ebitda of around US$4m, made up mostly of cost savings the circus arts entertainment company expects to realize from the acquisition, the sources said. However, Cirque strips out from the purchase price the value of certain assets including real estate it plans on selling, which brings the multiple down to 10.9 times, one of the sources said. On that basis, the implied valuation is around US$44m. Financing was sourced from a US$85m add-on to the company’s US$635m term loan due in July 2022 that was arranged last month by RBC Capital Markets. The incremental loan was upsized from US$65m initially, with the additional proceeds earmarked for general corporate purposes, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Including the new debt, Cirque is now levered 3.8 times first lien and 4.65 times total, based on US$185m of combined pro forma last 12 months’ adjusted Ebitda, US$710m in first lien debt and US$860m in total debt. That’s up from leverage of 3.5 times first lien and 4.3 times total prior to the purchase, based on around US$181m of Ebitda, US$625m in first lien debt and US$775m in total debt. Montreal-based Cirque has been majority owned by TPG, Fosun Capital and Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec since 2015.

Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday the two leaders discussed forming  an impenetrable Cyber Security unit  when they met at the Hamburg G20 summit.  The idea was greeted with incredulity by some senior  Republicans who said Moscow could not be trusted - and the U.S. president later in the day tweeted that he did not think it could happen.  The heads of state did talk about such a possibility,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters on Monday.  Nothing was promised to each other,  he added.  What is positive, they stated their readiness to work in this direction.  The conversation had been  about the possibility of forming such a group , he said.  Whether it will be created or not, time will show.  Svetlana Lukash, a Russian official who was at the Hamburg summit, told a news conference earlier on Monday Putin and Trump's discussion of cyber security had taken up 40 minutes of their meeting, which lasted more than two hours.    Putin's Proposal  President Putin proposed creating a working group,  she said.  This does not mean it should start working immediately, virtually tomorrow.  She added:  The main thing is, this matter was discussed, the United States is ready to consider cooperation in this sphere, and then we will see. “Maybe this will be a working group, maybe this will be cooperation on the floor of the United Nations. But in any case, our two countries will need to discuss these questions. This is namely what the presidents agreed upon.” She said of the landmark talks between the two men in Hamburg:  Nobody, except the participants of that meeting, knows how that proposal was formulated and how President Trump reacted.   Some media reports may have prematurely assumed that the creation of a joint commission on cyber security was already decided, she said.  That was a proposal. Probably, he (Trump) is not ready yet for this specific initiative at this stage,  Lukash said. Trump's administration has been dogged by investigations into allegations of Russian interference in last year's U.S. election and ties with his campaign. Peskov also told reporters on Monday the Kremlin did not know the identity of the Russian lawyer who allegedly met Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., Trump's election campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, last year. The New York Times said on Sunday that Trump's associates met with the Kremlin-linked lawyer after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The newspaper identified the lawyer as Natalia Veselnitskaya. It said the meeting had taken place in Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after Trump won the Republican nomination.  No, we don't know who it is and, certainly, we cannot track down all movements of all Russian lawyers both within Russia and abroad,  Peskov said.

Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday forming  an impenetrable Cyber Security unit  to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. The idea appeared to be a political non-starter. It was immediately scorned by several of Trump's fellow Republicans, who questioned why the United States would work with Russia after Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.  It's not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but it's pretty close,  Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC's  Meet the Press  program.  Ash Carter, who was U.S. defense secretary until the end of former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration in January, told CNN flatly:  This is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary.  Trump's advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had recently sought to explain Trump's cyber push. Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump and Putin had agreed to create  a cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cyber security together.  But Trump returned to Twitter on Sunday to play down the idea, which arose at his talks with Putin at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany.   The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't,   Trump said on Twitter.

Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Trump's desire to move forward with Russia, but added:  There has to be a price to pay.   There has been no penalty,  McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS'  Face the Nation  program according to a CBS transcript.  Vladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election.  Trump argued for a rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. U.S. President Donald Trump waves as walks on the South Lawn of the White House upon his return to Washington, U.S., from the G20 Summit in Hamburg, July 8, 2017.Yuri GripasSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscow’s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trump's suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's  State of the Union  program that Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit.  If that’s our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow,  Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. 'Time to Move Forward' With Russia Trump said he  strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it.  He added:  We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!  In Trump's first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and  de-escalation agreement  for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said.     Any joint U.S.-Russia cyber initiative would have been a different matter. Depending how much it veered into military or espionage operations, it could have faced major legal hurdles. Language in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Pentagon, which includes the National Security Agency and the U.S. military's Cyber Command, from using any funds for bilateral military cooperation with Russia. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, also noted restrictions on sharing information with Russia that would clearly prohibit offering Moscow a sense of U.S. cyber capabilities. Russia would be similarly adverse to revealing its capabilities to the United States, he noted.  It just will not happen,  McFaul told Reuters.

Investors were wary of making big bets ahead of the start of the earnings season, with big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup reporting on Friday. In a significant victory for the banking industry, the Fed late last month approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes.

Unconventional shale oil and alternative energy resources are an important factor to help meet future demand but it is premature to assume that they can be developed quickly to replace oil and gas, Amin Nasser told a conference in Istanbul.  If we look at the long-term situation of oil supplies, for example, the picture is becoming increasingly worrying,  Nasser said.  Financial investors are shying away from making much needed large investments in oil exploration, long-term development and the related infrastructure.  Investments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it,  Nasser said. About $1 trillion in investments have already been lost since a decline in oil prices from 2014. Studies show that 20 million barrels per day of new production will be needed to meet demand growth and offset natural decline of developed fields over the next five years, he said.   New discoveries are also on a major downward trend. The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years has more than halved compared with the previous four,  Nasser said. Inflection Point FILE PHOTO: Logo of Saudi Aramco is seen at the 20th Middle East Oil & Gas Show and Conference (MOES 2017) in Manama, Bahrain, March 7, 2017.Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo A lack of investment is definitely not helping, so if that continues over the next couple of years there will be an inflection point where what we see today will have an impact on consumers at the end and supply will be impacted for the next couple of years,  Nasser told CNBC.  What we need to see is more investments from various sectors to make sure there is an adequate supply over the long term,  he said to CNBC. State oil giant Aramco, which is preparing to sell around 5 percent in itself next year in an initial public offering, is continuing to invest in maintaining its oil production capacity of 12 million barrels per day.  We plan to invest more than $300 billion over the coming decade to reinforce our pre-eminent position in oil, maintain our spare oil production capacity, and pursue a large exploration and production program centering on conventional and unconventional gas resources,  Nasser said. Nasser reiterated the IPO was on track for the second half of 2018. Asked by CNBC if the current oil price will possibly delay the IPO, Nasser said the company's investments are  geared towards the long term.   Even though we have the highest 260 billion of reserves we have the biggest exploration program,  he told CNBC. Nasser said in his speech that one of Aramco's priorities was  direct conversion of crude oil into petrochemicals  while adding the company was also focusing on solar and wind projects.

The offer for Orient Overseas International Ltd (OOIL) comes as China's government pushes to raise the country's profile in global shipping, which dovetails with its Belt and Road initiative aimed at increasing China's influence over distribution from Asia to Europe. Beijing merged two shippers last year to form COSCO Shipping which, after the latest deal, will rise from fourth to rank only behind Denmark's Maersk Line and Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC).  This is negative for Maersk and MSC,  said Corrine Png, chief executive of Singapore-based transport stock researcher Crucial Perspective. A deal would make the Chinese shipper a  tougher competitor to deal with on the major trade lanes.  State-backed COSCO Shipping on Sunday offered to buy each OOIL share at a 31.1 percent premium to their Friday close. A suitor's stock often falls after making a bid, but COSCO Shipping's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 6 percent on Monday to their highest price in almost two years. OOIL stock rose as per usual for a target but at 20 percent, it was short of the offer price. Png said some investors may feel OOIL would be selling too soon after the container industry began to recover from a prolonged slowdown, or that the deal may not pass anti-trust regulators.  This transaction is a sweeter deal for COSCO than for OOIL's shareholders,  she said.  OOIL could boost COSCO's recurring profit by 50 percent in the next two to three years.

Its fortunes soared with the Pearl River Delta export boom of the 1990s, but its once world-leading port now languishes in fifth place by throughput, behind the mainland ports of Shanghai and Shenzhen. COSCO said it would to keep OOIL's global headquarters in Hong Kong but analysts said the city's port would still be affected by its takeover.  COSCO also has (port) investments in Guangzhou,  said Han Ning, China director for Drewry Shipping Consultants, referring to the nearby Chinese city whose port competes with Hong Kong for Pearl River Delta traffic.  So if COSCO is looking at what should be its hub for the Pearl River Delta, it will look to strike a balance between Guangzhou and Hong Kong.  OOIL commands just under 3 percent of the global container shipping market and has significant exposure to the U.S. market. After the deal, COSCO Shipping can expect a U.S. market share of 18 percent from 11-12 percent currently, said COSCO general manager Zunwu Xu at a news conference on Monday. The acquisition would also strengthen COSCO Shipping's position in the port business, Xu said.  The merger would be complementary as OOIL is strong in Transpacific and Intra-Asia trade, and COSCO has strong China domestic trade,  said Samson Lo, head of Asia mergers-and-acquisitions at UBS, which is advising COSCO Shipping.  The terminals and logistics businesses of OOIL can bring further synergies to COSCO as well.  COSCO Shipping is making its offer with Shanghai International Port Group Co Ltd. The shipping line said it would finance the deal with a bridge loan.

For now, unease about an end to the era of ultra-cheap money has given way to optimism about global growth, with Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report bolstering risk appetite.

In Saudi Arabia, shares of United Electronics Company (Extra) surged by their 10 percent daily limit to 36.90 riyals, their highest close since January 2016. The company had earlier reported second-quarter net income of 43.4 million riyals ($11.57 million), up 287.5 percent from the prior year period. In a separate statement, the board approved a cash dividend of 0.75 riyals per share for first half of 2017, the company's first dividend distribution since 2015. The positive mood spilled into other consumer-related shares, with Extra's chief competitor Jarir gaining 2.0 percent. Analysts have been expecting improvement in the retail sector in the second quarter from a year before because of the government's decision to reinstate civil servants' allowances and because of the Muslim month of Ramadan, which typically sees a rise in sales.

Beijing is tentatively removing barriers to foreign issuers as it seeks to internationalize its renminbi or yuan currency and open up sources of finance for its planned  One Belt, One Road  trade route that stretches as far as Europe. Portugal, whose location on Europe's Atlantic coast is some 10,000 km (6,250 miles) from Beijing, further away than any of its euro zone peers, plans to sell  Panda  bonds -- debt sold by foreign entities to investors in mainland China.   In practical terms, the issue aims to diversify the sources of financing of Portugal, opening a new market for its debt, and support the internationalization of the (renminbi),  a spokesman for the office of Prime Minister Antonio Costa told Reuters. He said strengthening trade links between the two countries would benefit both populations. Just a handful of foreign entities -- including sovereigns Poland and South Korea -- have sold Panda bonds in recent years, although Hong Kong's smaller, offshore, yuan-denominated  dim sum  market is well established. Panda bond issuance increased ninefold last year to 130 billion yuan ($19 billion), and is expected to grow by another 50 percent in 2017, according to JPMorgan.   Stronger Ties Portugal's ties with China date back some 500 years to the settlement of Macau, the trading post-turned-gambling hub that was Europe's last colony in Asia until it was handed back to China in 1999, just as Portugal joined the euro. After a crippling recession that pushed the indebted country into a bailout in 2011, Chinese cash helped aid its recovery.   Portugal is currently the top destination for Chinese investment in Europe as a share of its economy, according to figures from Spain's ESADE Business & Law School, and a number of Chinese firms have taken stakes in Portuguese companies. China Three Gorges owns 21 percent of Energias de Portugal while private conglomerate Fosun (0656.HK) upped its stake in bank Millennium bcp (BCP.LS) to 24 percent in February. Last year, Costa told Chinese state television that Portugal wanted to  actively participate  in Beijing's plans to develop a maritime sea route as part of the trade route initiative, dubbed the new Silk Road. He highlighted port capacity at Sines in Portugal's south. Hong Kong-based Richard Mazzochi of law firm KWM, who has been involved in a number of Panda bond deals, said linking to a specific project could help get Portugal's planned debt sale off the ground.       Applications are easier to make where there is already an established connection and if an issuer would use the proceeds in connection with One Belt, One Road initiatives, that would be helpful,  he said.  A deal could raise eyebrows among European authorities suspicious of China's plans to spread its global influence and concerned about transparency and access for foreign firms to the scheme. Major European countries have even mooted the idea of blocking Chinese investment on the continent. The EU is assessing whether a Beijing-funded rail project in Hungary, which has issued debt in China’s offshore market and is eyeing the onshore market, complies with EU law. Financial Reasons A board announces a Chinese market in downtown Lisbon, Portugal June 30, 2017. The board reads  Welcome . Picture taken June 30, 2017.Rafael MarchanteFinance Minister Mario Centeno told Reuters in May that selling a bond in the Chinese currency would allow Portugal to take advantage of growing demand for its debt, especially as a strengthening economy raises hopes for a credit rating upgrade.   The planned end in December of the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme means diversifying into China -- the world's third-biggest debt market, behind the United States and Japan -- might appeal to other euro zone states.      Contacted by Reuters, the debt offices of Ireland, Italy and Belgium said they were open to issuing in yuan, while France, Spain and the Netherlands said they had no such plans. A German government source said such a transaction  had been on the table one or two years ago  but for  cost reasons  Berlin decided against it. Bankers at Standard Chartered and HSBC told Reuters they were working with European sovereigns on deals, but gave no details. Although China is nervous about capital outflows, a foreign government issuing there would serve as an endorsement of plans to internationalize the currency and its standing as a global economic power.      Mushtaq Kapasi, chief representative, Asia-Pacific at the International Capital Market Association, said Portugal's sovereign would also  give Chinese investors a level of trust .  In October, the yuan was added to the International Monetary Fund's small basket of reserve currencies, while the ECB added the Chinese currency to its foreign reserves this year. Barriers to Entry Spencer Maclean, a banker at Standard Chartered, said a sovereign bond sale would be a  precursor  for private firms from the country to tap Chinese markets. But barriers to entry remain. Bankers told Reuters that some countries may be nervous about the legal framework under which the bonds would be sold.  As Greece and Argentina experienced during their debt crises, it is hard to restructure bonds issued under foreign law.  The most common concern expressed by issuers is whether they  will be able to get the cash they have borrowed out of China.  The Chinese allow capital to flow in but it is still quite a challenging situation to convince the Chinese to use the proceeds abroad,  said Alexander Liebethal, head of new issues at German development bank KfW, which has issued in the Chinese offshore market.   If you look at the Panda market you will see a lot of issuers active there that have operations in China, like some German car manufacturers.   New guidelines on Panda bonds expected from Chinese regulators should add some clarity, bankers and lawyers said.  And for all that Portugal's deal is innovative, it may not be imminent.

The window, where buyers and sellers are free to agree an exchange rate, was introduced in April to try to attract foreign investors into the country and boost the supply of dollars. Traders said $407 million were traded last week compared with $354.8 million in the previous week, indicating a gradual return in investors' confidence to the West African nation's foreign exchange market.  We have seen continuous improvement in dollar inflow into the market in recent time from offshore investors and this has also reflected in the volume of transactions at the equity market,  one currency trader told Reuters. Before the window was introduced, the central bank was the main supplier of hard currency on the interbank forex market, after foreign investors fled naira assets in the wake of an oil price slump in 2014. A central bank spokesman last month said the bank was, on average, responsible for less than thirty percent of trading in the investor market. The window, however, has effectively introduced yet another exchange rate to the five already in operation. These include a retail rate set by licensed exchange bureaus, as well as official and black market rates. At the forex window, market regulator FMDQ OTC Securities Exchange quoted the naira at 364.56 to the dollar on Monday, versus 367 to the dollar on the black market. The local currency traded at about 520 to the dollar on the black market in February and at 400 in the forex window when it opened in April, with the two rates then starting to converge. Commercial lenders quoted the naira at 306 to the dollar on Monday, the level they have been quoting for around the last two weeks.

Getting existing national anti-doping agency RUSADA fully compliant with international standards is another objective.  WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, suspended RUSADA after a report published in November 2015 found evidence of state-sponsored doping and accused it of systematically violating anti-doping regulations. Russian authorities deny there was a state-backed doping programme, but have pledged to follow international recommendations to get the suspension of RUSADA, Russia's athletics federation, and the Russian Paralympic Committee lifted.  WADA last month announced it was allowing RUSADA to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts, saying the agency had met some of the requirements for its reinstatement.  WADA told Reuters last week that RUSADA still needed to do a number of things before it could regain its accreditation, including a  series of compliance audits that WADA will conduct in the coming months.  WADA said it will publish the remaining requirements for RUSADA to regain compliance later this month.

The cuts are a key plank of Macron's economy-boosting reforms, but their timing was thrown into doubt last week when Prime Minister Edouard Philippe suggested the government could not afford to launch them as soon as next year.  Confirmation they will go ahead next year came on the day the debate opened in parliament on another of his main policy measures, pro-business labor reforms.  The president and the prime minister's objective is for tax measures to be undertaken in the 2018 budget bill to trigger a supply-side shock and boost confidence,  a source in Philippe's office said.  To do this, the government is studying solutions to step up tax cuts starting from 2018, especially on property taxes and the wealth taxes,  the source said, adding the government still aimed to meet an EU deficit target. French business leaders had bridled at the proposed delay to the tax measures, warning that the country needs urgent to reduce the tax burden in order to restore competitiveness. Also facing criticism over the delay from a number of economists, Philippe made a phone call late on Saturday night to set up an emergency meeting with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and with Macron to review the tax cut timing, a finance ministry source said. Le Maire then hinted at a business conference on Sunday that the timing was once more under review. During the meeting itself, Macron insisted that the plans to rein in France's wealth tax and scrap local property taxes for 80 percent of those who pay them should after all begin to take effect in 2018, the source said. A delay was raised after the public audit office said a budget shortfall left by former president Francois Hollande's government would result in a deficit of 3.2 percent of national output this year compared with the Hollande government's forecast of 2.8 percent. Macron has promised to meet the EU's three percent target in 2017, in what would be the first time in a decade France falls in line with the European deficit ceiling. Pain Ahead To meet the deficit target this year, the government is scrambling to come up with four to five billion euros in budget savings. The situation will only get more difficult next year, and     Macron's pledges to cut local property taxes and limit the scope of the wealth tax to property could put a strain on revenues in the years ahead. Les Echos newspaper said that reining in wealth and property taxes next year would cost about six billion euros. The finance ministry declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The paper said that that would come on top of seven billion in tax cuts already budgeted by the previous government, which Philippe confirmed over the weekend would be maintained. Offering some relief to the government is the growing chance that economic growth will be stronger this year than the 1.5 percent that the budget is based on. The Bank of France raised its forecast last week to 1.6 percent from 1.4 percent after recently strong data. writing by Leigh Thomas Editing by Andrew Callus/Jeremy Gaunt.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-budget-idUSKBN19V1ME"},

The reports added to a string of lackluster economic data that has raised questions about the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates this year. Accountancy firm Deloitte said business optimism at large British companies fell sharply in the second quarter, dampened by the inconclusive outcome of last month's national election. Deloitte's survey of chief financial officers showed 72 percent thought the overall business environment would be worse once Britain leaves the European Union, the largest proportion since Deloitte started asking the question a year ago.  Only 8 percent of respondents saw an improvement after Brexit.  This underscores the importance of the Brexit negotiations producing a favorable environment for UK businesses, with access to the skills and markets they need for their future success,  said David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte North West Europe. The survey's findings have proven a good predictor for the BoE's own investment intentions survey which BoE officials watch closely as part of their monitoring of Britain's economy.  A view of the Canary Wharf district with the Shard building (R) is seen in London, Britain July 7, 2017.John SibleyBusinesses are pressing May and her government to negotiate a smooth Brexit in two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter investment. Deloitte said investment intentions among CFOs deteriorated, probably disappointing some BoE policymakers who have been pushing for the first interest rate hike in a decade. Rate-setter Michael Saunders said last week he was  reasonably confident  that an improvement in exports and investment would more or less offset the consumer slowdown. A separate survey from credit card firm Visa showed consumer spending fell in June, capping the weakest quarter in nearly four years and adding to other signs that shoppers are reining in their spending due to rising inflation and weak pay growth. Spending in the April-June period was 0.3 percent lower than in the same three months in 2016.   June data provides further evidence that an increase in the cost of living, coupled with slowing wage growth, are beginning to squeeze household disposable income,  Visa managing director Kevin Jenkins said. Survey compiler IHS Markit this year said the figures may add to calls for the BoE to keep interest rates on hold. The strength of official data on wages, due on Wednesday, is likely to be critical for BoE policymakers as they mull whether to raise interest rates from their record low 0.25 percent.

The surprisingly strong trade figures, released by the Federal Statistics Office, underline how the German economy is firing on all cylinders ahead of a Sept. 24 federal election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term. The data will also add fuel to the debate about Germany's export strength after the International Monetary Fund on Friday repeated its call for Berlin to increase investment as a way to boost imports, support the economic recovery in other countries and reduce its record trade surplus. Seasonally adjusted exports climbed 1.4 percent - their fifth consecutive monthly increase - while imports rose 1.2 percent, the data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. Both figures came in stronger than expected: A Reuters poll had pointed to exports edging up 0.3 percent and imports rising by 0.5 percent. Demand for German goods from countries outside the EU rose the most, with exports to so-called third countries, which includes China, Japan and the United States, soaring 17.3 percent, a breakdown of unadjusted trade figures showed.  The global economy is improving, which has a positive impact on the German export economy,  VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, pointing to especially strong demand for German machinery from markets overseas. FILE PHOTO: A containership at a loading terminal is seen in the port of Hamburg, Germany, February 2, 2017.Fabian Bimmer/File Photo While private consumption has been an important growth driver in the last few years, net exports are now giving additional stability,  Gitzel added. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus edged up to 20.3 billion euros from a revised 19.7 billion euros in April. The May reading was in line with the Reuters consensus forecast. Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, rose to 17.3 billion euros after a revised 14.9 billion euros in April, unadjusted data showed.  The trade balance is currently swelling, which will again lead to suspicions on the other side of the Atlantic,  Gitzel said.  U.S. President Donald Trump will therefore continue his vehement criticism of the high German trade surplus.  The trade figures come on the heels of solid manufacturing data released on Friday which showed industrial output rose more than expected in May, boosting expectations that factories will support growth in the second quarter. Analysts expect the German economy to pick up speed in the second quarter after expanding 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year. The IMF has raised its growth forecast for the German economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2017 in real terms, compared with its April forecast of 1.6 percent, citing soaring domestic demand and rebounding exports.

Hence the rise of Venmo, a digital payment service owned by PayPal that allows consumers to send and receive payments regardless of what device, bank or operating system they use. It  helps soften the oftentimes uncomfortable request by replacing the cold language of transactions with colorful visuals.  While there are other apps and payment networks that enable friends to transfer money using a phone - Facebook Messenger, Zelle and Square Cash, among them - what appears to tip the popularity scale are the small digital images, otherwise known as emojis.  Seven in ten Americans - or 71 percent - use visual expressions like emojis, stickers or GIFs when texting or using mobile messaging apps, according to a new survey from Harris Poll and commissioned by GIF platform Tenor.   People said they can better communicate their thoughts and feelings when using visual expressions rather than words alone, according to the survey. With Venmo, a reminder to pay up can come under the guise of a winged dollar bill emoji, a seemingly gentler reminder than a potentially rude in-person request. Need to split the cost with friends for beers and pizza? There is an emoji for it. In fact, the pizza slice emoji is among the most popular on Venmo, according to LendEdu research. The ability to ask people 'with a smile' appeals to 30-year-old Hilary Gish, who said she uses Venmo for anything from splitting checks to tipping her hairstylist.  It's a fun and polite way of asking for money,  said Gish, who lives in Los Angeles. For 29-year-old Ella Nuortila, part of Venmo's appeal is that the app feels almost like an extension of social media, and that transactions are turned into chats.  A lot of my contacts make (their transactions) public and it gives insight to their personal lives, much like a Facebook feed,  said Nuortila. PayPal's Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready told Reuters the social aspect of apps like Venmo can help make financial transactions less burdensome.  Because Venmo is where your friends are, it makes it less awkward to ask for payment,  said Ready. Challengers Coming A recent survey by LendEdu ranked Venmo as the most popular money exchange app among Millennials, chosen by two-thirds of the 20 to 30-something people who use mobile payment apps.  The service processed $17.6 billion in transactions in 2016, a 135-percent increase on the previous year. In the first quarter of 2017, it reported a total of $6.8 billion, up from $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. In a challenge to Venmo, a group of major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, recently launched Zelle, a network that allows customers to send money to each other instantly. Earlier this month, Apple announced that Apple Pay will soon allow users to send and receive money via iMessage, which supports emojis. The service will be available on the most recent iPhone and iPad devices, as well as Apple Watch. These challengers will have a lot of ground to make up. Venmo says its most active users check the service daily, while the average user checks it two or three times per week - not just to send or receive payments, but to see what their friends and family are doing.

Last month, Unite threatened more strikes at the firm's British plants if BMW failed to agree a deal after a previous offer was rejected in a ballot by members. Many British companies have closed their final salary schemes in recent years, arguing that they have become too expensive and unsustainable as people claim more from funds as life expectancy grows.

After announcing its decision, the central bank sold dinar  in the market, dealers said, to prevent a firming through the 120 psychological level against the euro which it has been testing since Friday when it hit 20-month highs.      The dinar was trading at 120.08 at 1317 GMT, staying near the high despite the intervention by the bank, which has purchased around 530 million euros ($604 million) so far this year.     An interest rate cut could weaken the dinar, but the bank fears a cut could hit appetite for dinar-denominated securities in a period when monetary policy tightening by the world's main central banks is a key risk.     The dinar could come under pressure soon from uncertainty over the future of Serbia's deal with the IMF, which will expire next year, and possible delays in the restructuring of state-owned firms, Raiffeisen analyst Wolfgang Ernst said in a note.      In a Reuters poll last week analysts saw the dinar retreating to 124 per euro in the next 12 months.     The Czech crown traded at 26.102 against the euro, still near Friday's 26.048 peak, its strongest level since late 2013.     It was buoyed on Friday by data showing robust growth in industrial output and retail sales in May, reflecting the region's solid economic growth.    The crown has been strengthening since early April when the  Czech central bank removed a cap which had kept it weaker than 27 for years.     Before the exit, the bank sold crowns worth tens of billions of euros in the market to defend the cap, boosting its foreign currency reserves.     Czech end-June reserve figures released on Monday showed a further rise last month, to 124.89 billion euros from a revised 124.01 billion euros in May, while the central bank said it did not sell or buy any foreign currency in the spot market in May.      Hungarian and Polish long-term government bond yields dropped by a few basis points after a sharp rise in the past two weeks due to hawkish comments from European Central Bank officials.

(IHS Markit; Nasdaq: INFO) announced today it is offering $250 million of additional notes under the indenture governing its existing $500 million 4.75% senior notes due 2025 (Fitch's 'BBB' rating is unaffected by this issuance).  IHS Markit stated it intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness or share repurchases. Fitch affirmed IHS Markit's 'BBB' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and its senior unsecured notes rating of 'BBB', with a Stable Outlook, on May 30, 2017. At that time Fitch expected IHS Markit will maintain its leverage (total debt with equity credit to operating EBITDA) at or below 3x over the ratings horizon, consistent with the company's 'BBB' IDR. Today's offering does not materially change that expectation and as a result Fitch has not taken any rating action. IHS Markit's offering underscores Fitch's stated expectation at the time of its affirmation that the company will likely continue to operate with reduced headroom due to higher share repurchases, expected acquisitions and associated future debt issuance. Insofar as the present offering's proceeds are used for paying down existing debt, Fitch continues to expect IHS Markit to maintain roughly 0.2x to 0.1x headroom to Fitch's negative rating sensitivity over the rating horizon. However, rating action could be warranted if offering proceeds are not used to pay down existing debt in conjunction with (1) operating performance weakness or (2) shareholder capital returns or leveraged acquisitions above Fitch's current expectations. KEY RATING DRIVERS Merger Benefits on Track: IHS Markit's ability to deliver on $125 million in cost synergies through the end of FY2019 is supported by progress on the merger and by management's guidance to upsize FY2017 synergies by $15 million to $50 million. Management has targeted $100 million in run-rate revenue synergies by 2019, which appears likely based on early signs of cross-selling deal wins, a steadily increasing pipeline, and plans to unify cross-customer views with a new CRM implementation. Other merger benefits include reduced legacy IHS exposure to the energy sector (26% in FY2016 from 40% in FY2015) and implementation of a leadership succession plan. Critical, Industry Embedded Datasets: Fitch believes IHS Markit's data sets are critical to its customers' workflow and difficult to replicate. The company's databases contain thousands of data points sourced from governments, customers, technical publications and other sources, in some cases dating back to the 1800s. Certain data, such as oil well data, requires synthesis by engineers and geologists to make it usable, adding an additional proprietary element to the asset. Financial indices are also embedded as critical inputs to large swaths of the capital markets and stand to benefit from ongoing shifts in passive management strategies. Relatively Stable Business Model: Subscription-based revenues accounted for about 84% of IHS Markit's pro forma combined FY2016 revenues and provide significant visibility and stability to FCF generation. The subscription-based business model capitalizes on longstanding client relationships with nominal account churn. However, recent experience in the Resources segment suggests that large, sector-wide slowdowns can and do impact recurring revenues. Recurring organic Resources revenue declined 9% in FY2016. While IHS Markit's diversification will help offset sector headwinds, ongoing challenges in the energy sector might persist for longer than expected, while challenges could mount in other sectors such as automotive, which accounted for approximately 21% of pro forma FY2016 combined revenues. Margin Expansion Potential: Fitch continues to expect EBITDA margins to expand to about 40% or a bit higher (from the low 30% range for IHS stand-alone) over the rating horizon based on the addition of Markit's higher margin business (42% EBITDA margin in FY2016), increased operating leverage at scale, and realization of $125 million in annual run-rate cost synergies. However, Fitch expects that margin expansion will also be contingent upon executing successfully on the company's strategic priority to harness new technologies, develop higher-value data analytics, and create new product offerings. Fitch believes a clearer plan of execution for these goals would increase confidence that margin expansion targets can be achieved. More Aggressive Financial Policy, Leverage: Relative to its previous review, Fitch now expects IHS Markit to operate at the higher end of its existing total leverage target of 2.0x-3.0x. IHS Markit is likely to pursue higher levels of share repurchases and begin to target meaningful acquisitions, necessitating increased issuance needs over the ratings horizon. While Fitch still expects leverage to remain below 3.0x over the rating horizon, there is less headroom for commercial challenges owing to sector headwinds, and as a result there will be increased reliance on attaining margin expansion and expected revenue uplift. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for IHS Markit include: --Low- to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, in line to a bit below the overall business information market due to continued near-term headwinds in the energy sector and expected moderation in the auto sector; --EBITDA margin expands to about 40%+ over the rating horizon based on addition of higher-margin Markit business (42% EBITDA margin in FY2016), increased operating leverage and realization of run-rate synergies; --Share repurchases of $1.2 billion in 2017 and $1 billion in each year over the rating horizon; --Likelihood of ongoing M&A;, with potential for transaction sizes up to $500 million; --Annual FCF in excess of approximately $900 million to $1 billion over the rating horizon; --Additional debt issuance to partially fund share repurchases and acquisitions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: --Implementation of a more conservative financial policy as evidenced by reduced share repurchases, acquisitions, and associated debt issuance, underscored by a leverage target of 2.5x or lower; --Strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion owing to resilience in the face of any sector headwinds, accelerating momentum in cross-selling efforts, and successful execution of strategic priorities around new product innovation and analytics. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: --Adverse operating performance, material acquisitions or shareholder-friendly actions that increase leverage over 3x without the expectation of deleveraging below that level within 18 months; --A weakening of IHS Markit's operating profile characterized by weak organic revenue growth and lack of margin expansion owing to sector headwinds, lack of traction in cross-selling efforts, and inability to drive new product innovation and analytics.

Four of the victims died at the scene and the other four succumbed to their injuries, police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye said. The assault occurred around 6:30 p.m. local time (4:30 GMT) in the village of Shinya on Sunday, Nkurikiye told reporters in the capital, Bujumbura, on Monday. He called the assault  a terrorist attack .  An unknown person threw a grenade among the population,  he said.  Nkurikiye did not say who might have carried out the assault, but police usually use the phrase  terrorist attack  to indicate armed opponents of President Pierre Nkurunziza. At least 700 people have been killed in clashes between Nkurunziza's supporters and his opponents since April 2015, when the president said he would run for a third term in office. He was re-elected in July 2015 in a vote largely boycotted by the opposition. In a tweet on Monday, Nkurunziza offered condolences   to the families who lost their next of kin in the terror attack ... The perpetrators will surely be punished.  Nkurunziza's opponents say his bid for a third term violated the country's constitution and the terms of a peace deal that ended a previous rebellion. The president cited a constitutional court ruling that his bid was legal.  Burundi's growing insecurity has spurred some alarm in the region because it has the same ethnic mix of majority Hutus and minority Tutsis as neighboring Rwanda, where 800,000 people were killed in ethnic violence in 1994. An estimated 400,000 Burundians have so far been displaced by the fighting between Nkurunziza's backers and his opponents.

Just ask Britain's Johanna Konta who held herself together under intense pressure to prevail 10-8 in the final set of an epic clash at Wimbledon last week. Or Andy Murray, who survived a scare under the weight of huge home crowd expectations. How can a top player thrive in the psychological trenches? The answer, according to sports psychiatrist Steve Peters, is by not thinking at all.  You've got to work on your instincts - tennis is a very instinctive game,  said Peters, who has worked with several tennis players as well as the likes of snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, Liverpool soccer club and the British cycling team.  You haven't got time to think, don't let thoughts interfere with your play,  he told Reuters.  Hesitation is fatal.  While  not thinking  might seem a simple task, Peters said, it could take a great deal of preparation off court to hone your mind so you will not buckle under the great expectations of a home crowd, choke on a pivotal point, or crumble when behind.  Most people would say psychology in tennis is a massive factor,  he said.  Some people are naturally gifted but the rest of us have to manage our minds.   What I do with athletes is a process of getting them prepared for what they are going to have to go through - it's a skill, mental gymnastics, something you have to practise.  Roger Federer has said that learning to control his on-court emotions helped him achieve his success. By contrast, Konta's coach Wim Fissette has suggested she should perhaps  break a racket once in a while and get the frustrations out . Peters said different players had different vulnerabilities - though a common problem is an inability to put errors out of mind without them affecting your game. He stressed there is no one right way to train mental resilience, pointing to the contrasting mindsets of arch-rivals John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg in years gone by. The Swede was at his best while sailing serenely through matches while the American used conflict and drama to bring out his best tennis.  Borg was known as the ice king while McEnroe was volatile - that was their personality and I would work with that,  Peters added.  I wouldn't try to turn McEnroe into an ice cube.

Stada said the buyout firms had sweetened their takeover offer by 25 cents per share to 66.25 euros after their previous 5.3 billion-euro ($6 billion) bid fell through. The revised offer is approximately 16 million euros above the prior offer. The private equity groups will also lower their acceptance threshold to 63 percent, Stada said, after the last offer failed to win the backing of the 67.5 percent they had targeted. The new offer is the latest twist for the takeover of one of the last remaining independent generic drugmakers in Europe. Shares in Stada, which has seen management upheaval and previous failed offers, were up 1.2 percent at 65.27 euros by 1253 GMT, outperforming the German mid-cap index .MDAXI.   Stada's chief executive and its head of finance resigned last week after the failure of the earlier bid. Stada said Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) had approved the renewed offer, waiving Bain and Cinven from a one-year ban from resubmitting a revised offer. Carl Ferdinand Oetker, Chairman of Stada's Supervisory Board said it backed the new offer as  a stable basis for developing Stada in the best interest of the company for the future .    Some shareholders including U.S. hedge fund Elliott have bought stakes, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock. The last takeover offer only won the backing of 65.52 percent of shareholders. Many buyout firms have been flush with cash after recent rounds of divestments and amid cheap borrowing costs. Sources have said that Bain and Cinven would look into buying more healthcare businesses to combine with Stada over the medium term, seeking cost cuts that would make the high investment in Stada worthwhile.

Starting Sunday, the partnerships will allow online merchants using Stripe to integrate the ability for Chinese users to pay with Alipay and WeChat Pay on their websites, the company said. Stripe hopes the integration will help boost its revenues by allowing clients to tap China's vast consumer market, where credit cards account for only a fraction of online spending, the company said. Alipay is the flagship payment service of Ant Financial, the financial affiliate of major Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA.N) and has over 520 million users. WeChat Pay has more than 600 million users and is the payment app of entertainment and social network firm Tencent Holdings (0700.HK).  If you are an internet business this unlocks a new vast customer base,  John Collison, Stripe's president and co-founder, said in an interview. In turn, Chinese consumers will have expanded choice as to which international online merchants they can purchase products and services from, he added.  Founded by brothers John and Patrick Collison in 2010, Stripe provides technology that enables merchants in 25 countries to accept payments online. It charges a fee on each payments transactions processed through its platform. A WeChat Pay system is demonstrated at a canteen  in Guangzhou, China May 9, 2017. Picture taken May 9, 2017.Bobby Yip If we can help a business double their sales, then it doubles our revenue from that business,  Collison said. The partnership coincides with the company's launch in Hong Kong. Stripe co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison (L) and brother John Collison, co-founder and president, are pictured in this December 2015 photo. Handout via ReutersOne of the most valuable venture-backed financial technology companies globally, Stripe has risen in popularity among software developers and online merchants because of its ease of use.  It is among the cohort of young fintech companies seeking to reinvent the payments landscape by taking better advantage of digital technologies to offer more user-friendly financial services and products. It had previously partnered with Alipay to enable only the U.S. merchants on its platform to integrate the Chinese payment service. The new global partnership builds on that experience.  Demand for services from Chinese consumers is at all-time high,  Souheil Badran, president of Alipay for North America, said in an interview. The new partnerships will connect them to hundreds of thousands of Stripe-powered businesses around the world, he added.

SMEs account for more than 85 percent of companies in Greece, according to some assessments, meaning they are a key driver of economic growth, but they have been starved of financing by commercial banks, which are loaded with bad loans.  Our aim is to free up the liquidity which is trapped due to the high load of non-performing loans and to boost the network of partner banks,  a senior government official told Reuters. Years of austerity have left people and businesses struggling to repay their lenders. The government council for economic affairs is expected to discuss the development bank's structure later this month, the official said, and the government aims to submit a draft law to parliament in September. Greek authorities have sought technical support from the World Bank and European institutions, two officials said. The bank is likely to be jointly managed by the finance, economy and energy ministries and the government is exploring whether funds from the public investment budget can be transferred to the new lender, one of the officials said. Foreign development banks have also shown an interest in participating in the project, one government official said. An initial plan to set up a development bank has already been approved by Greece's euro zone partners. They last month concluded a crucial review of its reform progress and outlined debt relief measures to be carried out in 2018, when its third international bailout, worth 86 billion euros, expires. The development bank, which will not take deposits, will bring together existing state bodies such as the Hellenic Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development and partner banks in different Greek regions. It will also advise potential investors in Greece, the official said.

Some 24,000 hectares (59,305 acres) were ravaged by wildfires as of midday Sunday, according to official tallies. Skrepnek said he believed the extent of the devastation was significantly higher.

Nigerian regulators intervened last week to save Etisalat Nigeria from collapse after talks with its lenders to renegotiate a $1.2 billion loan failed. Etisalat, with a 45 percent stake in the Nigerian business, said in June it had been ordered to transfer its shares to a loan trustee after the talks had failed. CEO of Etisalat International Hatem Dowidar said all UAE shareholders of Etisalat Nigeria, including state-owned investment fund Mubadala, had exited the company and left the board and management. He said in an interview with Reuters discussions were ongoing with Etisalat Nigeria to provide technical support, adding that it could continue to use the brand for another three-weeks before phasing it out.  There's a new board and we are not part of that company. We have sent our termination letter for the management agreement,  he told Reuters. Etisalat Nigeria is the biggest foreign-owned victim of dollar shortages plaguing the country due to lower oil prices and economic recession, leaving the company struggling to make repayments to lenders and suppliers. Etisalat Nigeria took-out a $1.2 billion loan with 13 local lenders in 2013 to refinance an existing loan and fund expansion, but struggled to repay four years later. Dowidar said parent Etisalat had written down the value of the Nigerian business on its books and that transferring its 45 percent stake to the lenders after loan renegotiation talks collapsed had no impact on the group. South Africa's MTN is the biggest player in Nigeria's telecoms industry, while Etisalat, with a 14 percent market share, has struggled to compete. Asked whether Etisalat would consider entering Nigeria again, Dowidar said:  The train has left the station on that one. Being in that market as an investor ... are we willing to risk more money compared to the reward for the long-term?  The CEO said Etisalat had been unsuccessful at converting some of its dollar debt to local Nigerian currency. He also said the group might exit or merge with a local rival in markets where it was not one of the top two players. He did not specify which markets. Etisalat is among the top two in markets such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistan, he said.  (Nigerian) lenders may try to continue to operate the company until they find a buyer (or) they may merge the company with the existing players in Nigeria, he said, adding that it was tough to say what lenders would do.  The brand agreement in either of these two scenarios won't be a long-term thing, so we take out the brand; in the long term Etisalat won't be in Nigeria.

Tillerson’s comments came a day after he met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan for talks on regional security issues, including U.S. backing for Kurdish Syrian YPG forces fighting to drive Islamic State from their Raqqa stronghold.  I think we're beginning to rebuild some of that trust that we lost in one another. They lost our trust to a certain extent, we lost theirs,  Tillerson, in Istanbul for an international petroleum conference, told U.S. consulate staff members.  Turkey views the YPG as a branch of the PKK, the outlawed Kurdish separatist group that has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s. It fears an effort to form a contiguous Kurdish state embracing some Turkish territory. Ankara was infuriated last month when Washington – which has designated the PKK a terrorist group - announced that it would continue the Obama administration’s policy of arming the YPG, although U.S. officials insist that the United States will retrieve the weapons once Islamic State is defeated. The Trump administration also has persisted in resisting Turkey’s demand that it extradite Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and is accused by Erdogan of masterminding a failed military coup in July 2016. A decision by U.S. prosecutors last month to charge a dozen Turkish security and police officers after an attack on protesters during Erdogan's visit to Washington also angered Ankara. Strategic Location Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan meets with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Istanbul, Turkey July 9, 2017. Kayhan Ozer/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERSTillerson made no mention of the continuing disagreements. He said that since becoming Secretary of State he had met Erdogan three times  and I think each meeting things are getting a little better in terms of the tone between us . The U.S. relationship with Turkey is  extraordinarily important from a security standpoint to the future economic opportunities,  he said, noting the country’s strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. Slideshow (3 Images) (This) is why we must put the relationship on the mend... and I think we're taking the first steps in that regard.  Muslim-majority Turkey has NATO’s second-largest standing military and its Incirlik Air Base is critical to U.S. military operations in the Middle East, serving as the base from which the U.S.-led coalition has been staging strikes in support of the offensive being waged against Islamic State in Raqqa by the YPG and Syrian Arab fighters backed by U.S. troops. “We're making some progress down in Syria. We're hopeful that we can replicate that with Turkey, on some areas in the north part of Syria. Tillerson’s comments, however, sharply contrasted with comments by Erdogan two weeks ago, when he harshly criticized the arming of the YPG by the United States. “The ones who think they are tricking Turkey by saying they are going to get back the weapons that are being given to this terrorist organization will realize that they are making a mistake eventually,  he told members of his ruling AK Party.

It's not a lucrative business, but I get enough to feed my family.         Mbiku is among dozens of food vendors trying to earn a living amid the hubbub of the Dar es Salaam bus terminal, where conductors hoot and yell to attract customers.  She works eight hours and day, earning around 45,000 shillings ($20) to supplement her husband's income as a mason. But unlike licensed hawkers who work from rows of wooden stalls, Mbiku cooks in the open air and is often harassed by the city militias for selling food without the proper papers.      They often seize my cooking pots and sometimes lock me up. I have to pay some money to be released and get my stuff back,  she said.     Mbiku and other women with unlicensed businesses finally have a glimmer of hope after the Tanzanian government last month announced it would recognize them as part of its broader policy of empowering women. Maria Ezekiel, 31, who has a stall serving chicken soup, chapati and tea along the busy Bagamoyo highway each morning, said the move to formalize micro-enterprises like hers was an  important milestone for small-scale entrepreneurs. A license would allow her to apply for credit to upgrade her business, she said.  I think it's a very good opportunity for me. As soon as the identity cards are issued I will start processing my bank loan,  Ezekiel told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  I want to borrow at least 500,000 shillings ($225) to modernize my cooking business.  The roadside chef wants to buy better equipment and switch to a gas stove to replace the smoky firewood she now cooks on. Unprotected Operating in the informal sector leaves women without protection and unable to access credit, experts say.  Urban food vending may be a good tool for creating livelihood security for the urban poor, but to achieve this there has to be better policy initiatives,  said Haji Semboja, economics professor at the University of Dar es Salaam. Presenting the annual budget in June, Tanzania's finance minister, Philip Mpango, said all food vendors - most of whom are women - would be brought into the mainstream sector.  The government would work with regional authorities to identify informal businesses and license them before 2020, he said.  We will issue identity cards and designate special premises for them,  the minister told parliament.     Margareth Chacha, a banker and former chief executive of Tanzania Women's Bank that supports small-scale women entrepreneurs, said women are held back because of strict loan conditions imposed by banks.      Most of the women can't access the loans because the conditions are too tough,  she said.  But if the government can act as a guarantor, I'm sure the banks will be willing to give loans.  The benefits of thriving women-led businesses are felt throughout the economy, she said. Back at Tegeta bus terminal, Olivia Mbiku says she is now hoping for a more stable, prosperous future.       I would very much like to get a bank loan and start a big catering business,  she said.   Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, resilience and climate change.

Outlining Pakistan's ambitious plans - which, if fully implemented, could shake up the global LNG market - Abbasi told Reuters that imports could top 30 million tonnes by 2022, up from just 4.5 million tonnes currently. Cheaper than fuel oil and cleaner burning than coal, LNG suits emerging economies seeking to bridge electricity shortfalls and support growth on tight budgets.  Within five years, I don't see any reason why we should not be beyond 30 million tonnes (in annual LNG imports). We will be one of the top five markets in the world,  Abbasi said. That kind of jump would represent one of the fastest growth stories in the energy industry, comparable to what China has done in many commodities - but there are doubts whether Pakistan can achieve its ambitions, given the complexity and cost of expansion projects.  It's always possible, but seems very difficult as they will need much more (regasification) capacity and downstream pipeline capacity,  said Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects, a London-based industry market researcher.  There are infrastructural issues and financial issues.   Still, it is one of the key LNG growth markets, and its demand will help tighten up the market that has threatened to lurch into over supply.  Abbasi said no one took Pakistan seriously after a decade of botched attempts to bring LNG to the country, but this has changed with the construction of new LNG terminals and gas plants. He said foreign suppliers are now arriving in Pakistan - where energy shortages have prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to promise he'll end the country's frequent blackouts.  Before, we used to go out to talk to LNG suppliers. Now they're coming to us,  Abbasi said.  (LNG) is really what has saved the whole energy system. It has been a huge success in Pakistan and it will continue,  he said after Sharif on Friday inaugurated a new Chinese-built LNG power plant that uses General Electric (GE.N) turbines. Getting Connected An aerial view of the Haveli Bahadur Shah LNG power plant in Jhang, Pakistan July 7, 2017. Picture taken July 7, 2017.Drazen JorgicPakistan built its first LNG terminal in 2015 and, after some delays, a second terminal is due to come online in October, doubling annual import capacity to about 9 million tonnes. A consortium of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Total (TOTF.PA), Mitsubishi (8058.T), Qatar Petroleum and Norway's Hoegh (HLNGH.OL) is expected to decide by September whether to build a third LNG terminal for about $700 million, Abbasi said. Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals, as private companies have said they would finance these themselves and use Pakistan's existing gas network to sell directly to consumers. Pakistani Petroleum Minister Shahid Abbasi poses for a photo during an interview with Reuters after the inauguration of the Haveli Bahadur Shah LNG power plant in Jhang, Pakistan July 7, 2017. Picture taken July 7, 2017.Drazen Jorgic That's been the real success and that's where the growth will come from,  Abbasi said, adding that about 10 million homes are linked to gas connections in Pakistan - a nation of around 200 million.  In the last four years, we would have added two million additional connections. We are really ramping that up.  If Pakistan achieves its ambitious development goals, it could significantly erode market oversupply, which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices LNG-AS by more than 70 percent since 2014 to around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman about government-to-government deals for up to three monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal, which can import 600 million cubic feet of gas per day, equal to six cargoes a month.  We have a basic idea of what the market is. So if we are able to better those prices through negotiated procurement, we will go with that, otherwise we might float some more tenders,  Abbasi said. Tenders for two of the terminal's six cargoes have already been won by trading house Gunvor and Italy's Eni (ENI.MI), which have signed 5-year and 15-year deals, respectively. The contracts are worth about $5 billion over their lifetime. Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan's first LNG terminal. Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting private investors to build small-scale gas power plants to add another 3,000-4,000 megawatts to the network, on top of the three new LNG plants that will contribute 3,600 MW.

Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, added to heavy losses at the end of last week amid rising drilling activity in the United States and no let-up in supply growth from exporters.                  U.S. crude        prices were down 0.81 percent at $43.87 a barrel.     The U.S. dollar        climbed against a basket of major currencies, boosted by robust jobs data on Friday, although investors were wary of adding big positions before Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's testimony this week.                  At 9:06 a.m. ET (1306 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2906 to the greenback, or 77.48 U.S. cents, down 0.2 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2876 and C$1.2932.     On Friday, the loonie touched its strongest in nearly 10 months at C$1.2860 after stronger-than-expected domestic jobs data boosted chances of a rate increase as soon as this week.     Forecasters are divided on whether the central bank will hike rates on Wednesday but data from the OIS index swaps market shows that money markets are almost fully priced for an increase, while an 80 percent chance of a second hike has been implied by December.                            After years of debt-happy Canadians being warned that borrowing costs would have to rise eventually, they may be about to face a reckoning if the Bank of Canada hikes rates this week, as many expect.                      Speculators cut bearish bets on the loonie for a sixth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 39,372 contracts as of July 3 from 49,495 a week earlier.     Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds, with the two-year            up 3.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.146 percent and the 10-year             rising 17 Canadian cents to yield 1.864 percent.     On Friday, the 10-year yield touched its highest since June 2015 at 1.894 percent.

The keenly anticipated preliminary review of the leukemia treatment, posted on the FDA's website on Monday, comes two days ahead of the advisory panel meeting, which will discuss the drug and vote on whether the benefits exceed the risks. If approved, the drug, tisagenlecleucel, would be the first gene therapy to be approved in the United States. The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its advisors but typically does so. The panel's decision could have significant implications not only for Novartis but for companies making similar drugs, including Kite Pharma Inc. Juno Therapeutics Inc and bluebird bio Inc. The drugs use a new technology known as CAR-T, or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, which harnesses the body's own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. If approved they are expected to cost up to $500,000 and generate billions of dollars for their developers. Success would also help advance a cancer-fighting technique that scientists have been trying to perfect for decades. Novartis is applying for approval in the first instance to treat B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common type of childhood cancer in the United States. A clinical trial showed that 83 percent of patients who had relapsed or failed chemotherapy achieved complete or partial remission three months post infusion. Patients with ALL who fail chemotherapy typically have only a 16 to 30 percent chance of survival. The FDA said it is not asking the panel to focus on whether the drug works, as it successfully met the main goal of the clinical trial. The panel will be asked only to focus on the short-term and long-term safety risks. About half the patients experienced a serious complication known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which occurs when the body's immune system goes into overdrive. Doctors were able to manage the condition and it caused no patient deaths. The FDA also raised concerns that the drug may cause secondary malignancies to occur and said long-term safety monitoring may be needed to address this concern. Novartis is also testing its drug in diffuse large b-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as is Kite. Part of the competitive landscape will include which company is best able to manufacture its drugs efficiently and reliably.

The keenly anticipated preliminary review of the leukemia treatment, posted on the FDA's website on Monday, comes two days ahead of the advisory panel meeting, which will discuss the drug and vote on whether the benefits exceed the risks. If approved, the drug, tisagenlecleucel, would be the first gene therapy to be approved in the United States. The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its advisors but typically does so. The panel's decision could have significant implications not only for Novartis but for companies making similar drugs, including Kite Pharma Inc. Juno Therapeutics Inc and bluebird bio Inc. The drugs use a new technology known as CAR-T, or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, which harnesses the body's own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. If approved they are expected to cost up to $500,000 and generate billions of dollars for their developers. Success would also help advance a cancer-fighting technique that scientists have been trying to perfect for decades. Novartis is applying for approval in the first instance to treat B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common type of childhood cancer in the United States. A clinical trial showed that 83 percent of patients who had relapsed or failed chemotherapy achieved complete or partial remission three months post infusion. Patients with ALL who fail chemotherapy typically have only a 16 to 30 percent chance of survival. The FDA said it is not asking the panel to focus on whether the drug works, as it successfully met the main goal of the clinical trial. The panel will be asked only to focus on the short-term and long-term safety risks. About half the patients experienced a serious complication known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which occurs when the body's immune system goes into overdrive. Doctors were able to manage the condition and it caused no patient deaths. The FDA also raised concerns that the drug may cause secondary malignancies to occur and said long-term safety monitoring may be needed to address this concern. Novartis is also testing its drug in diffuse large b-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as is Kite. Part of the competitive landscape will include which company is best able to manufacture its drugs efficiently and reliably.

The fighting began on Sunday when armed groups opposed to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli tried to approach the capital and met resistance from rival groups that have aligned themselves with the government. It is the latest in a series of attacks by armed opponents of the Government of National Accord (GNA), which have continued despite the GNA's attempts to win the cooperation of militias operating in the city and to calm bouts of violence inside or close to the capital.  At the moment we can hear heavy gunfire,  said Al-Shareef Jaballah, a spokesman for the municipality of Garabulli, about 50 km (30 miles) from Tripoli, speaking to Reuters by telephone shortly after midday. He said local officials had received reports of two people being killed by the fighting, one of them an Egyptian national.  The clashes have resulted in severe damage to houses and shops because of indiscriminate shelling, and forced a large number of residents ... to flee,  he said.  The coastal road is still closed. The residents who have fled their homes are trapped because of the closure of the road.  The GNA has struggled to impose its authority since arriving in Tripoli in March last year. It has been rejected by factions that control eastern Libya, where military commander Khalifa Haftar has been consolidating his position and installing military-appointed mayors. As temperatures have climbed this month, parts of western Libya have once again been suffering from power and water cuts that residents have criticised the GNA for failing to resolve.

Stada said the buyout firms had sweetened their takeover offer by 25 cents per share to 66.25 euros after their previous 5.3 billion-euro ($6 billion) bid fell through. The revised offer is approximately 16 million euros above the prior offer. The private equity groups will also lower their acceptance threshold to 63 percent, Stada said, after the last offer failed to win the backing of the 67.5 percent they had targeted. The new offer is the latest twist for the takeover of one of the last remaining independent generic drugmakers in Europe. Shares in Stada, which has seen management upheaval and previous failed offers, were up 1.2 percent at 65.27 euros by 1253 GMT, outperforming the German mid-cap index .MDAXI.   Stada's chief executive and its head of finance resigned last week after the failure of the earlier bid. Stada said Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) had approved the renewed offer, waiving Bain and Cinven from a one-year ban from resubmitting a revised offer. Carl Ferdinand Oetker, Chairman of Stada's Supervisory Board said it backed the new offer as  a stable basis for developing Stada in the best interest of the company for the future .    Some shareholders including U.S. hedge fund Elliott have bought stakes, speculating on securing a higher price for any remaining stock. The last takeover offer only won the backing of 65.52 percent of shareholders. Many buyout firms have been flush with cash after recent rounds of divestments and amid cheap borrowing costs. Sources have said that Bain and Cinven would look into buying more healthcare businesses to combine with Stada over the medium term, seeking cost cuts that would make the high investment in Stada worthwhile.

By chance or by strategy, Xi and his officials picked their way through unscathed. Beijing is ultra-sensitive about Xi's image and ensuring he gets the respect it sees as his due as leader of an emerging superpower, especially when traveling to Western countries where it cannot so tightly control the public narrative. Diplomatic sources in Beijing, speaking ahead of Xi's trip to the G20 gathering in the German city of Hamburg, said Chinese officials had in private expressed nervousness that he could be asked awkward questions about North Korea, or the cancer-struck Liu, jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power . In the end it was U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid accusations Russia interfered in the U.S. election, and Trump's refusal to return to the Paris climate agreement that dominated the limelight. Xi, by contrast, avoided controversy in his bilateral meetings and reaffirmed China's commitment to the Paris deal and to an open global economy, in what the official China Daily called the  burnishing of (his) reputation .  Nobody talked about the South China Sea. No one talked about trade. Everyone was happy with Xi. I think he played this well,  said Ulrich Speck, senior fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute in Brussels.      All eyes were on Trump and Putin. But the fact that there was no U.S.-China clash was at least as important. Xi stayed out of the alpha-male fight. China presented itself as a partner to Europe.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Xi  made it clear that the G20 should adhere to taking the path of open development and mutual benefit leading to all-win results, support a multilateral trade mechanism, and promote international trade and investment .  China was in a good place at G20, with reasonable policies,  said Jin Canrong of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, who has advised the government on diplomatic matters.  So President Xi was comfortable and positive there.   Don't Mention Taiwan Potentially the biggest test was Xi's meeting with Trump, who in the run-up to Hamburg had voiced frustration over China's inability to rein in its troublesome erstwhile ally, North Korea. In the event, Trump returned to the conciliatory tone struck at their first meeting in April, telling the Chinese leader it was  an honor to have you as a friend  and he appreciated actions Xi had already taken to try to dissuade North Korea from pursuing nuclear weapons. Influential Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial on Monday that the Xi-Trump meeting had defied  the naysayers in the West . U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) meet on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017.Saul Loeb, Pool Beijing and Washington saw friction on issues including Taiwan and the South China Sea ahead of the meeting, and there was speculation from Western public opinion that the China-U.S. 'honeymoon' had come to an end. But the Xi-Trump meeting repudiates such speculation,  the paper said. Speaking to reporters later on Air Force One, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump-Xi meeting lasted more than an hour-and-a-half, and would have gone on longer had they not had to leave for other engagements. Ruan Zongze, a former Chinese diplomat now with the China Institute of International Studies, a think-tank affiliated with the Foreign Ministry, said Xi was much more upbeat than when he spoke to Trump a few days ahead of G20 and mentioned certain unnamed  negative factors  in their relationship.  Even on trade Trump underscored that he wants cooperation,  Ruan said. China's biggest concern had been U.S. policy toward self-ruled Taiwan, after the Trump administration approved a $1.42 billion arms package for Taiwan, claimed by China as its own. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) meet on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017.Saul Loeb, PoolNeither government mentioned Taiwan in their respective accounts of their G20 meeting. Chinese officials were at pains to point out their good relations with the new administration in Washington. Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told reporters in Hamburg that the Chinese and U.S. teams dealing the bilateral financial relationship clearly understood that both would be hurt by fighting with each other.  Our strength is communicating every morning and every evening. This is unprecedented,  Zhu said. No Drama, for Now... On India, where China has over the past few weeks accused New Delhi of provocation by sending troops across the border in a disputed region, Xi avoided drama by not having a formal bilateral meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though India's foreign ministry said they did speak. Even on Liu Xiaobo, Xi avoided being put on the spot, with China on Saturday allowing a U.S. and German doctor to meet him at his hospital in northeastern China.         Still, the faultlines remain in the tricky China-United States relationship. China may respond more assertively if, for example, more Chinese entities are sanctioned by the United States over North Korea or Trump raises barriers to Chinese goods as he has frequently threatened, said a senior Beijing-based Western diplomat.  China has been restrained so far in reacting to Trump, but that is unlikely to last,  said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Things are gearing up to be a summer of drama between China and the United States.

Turkey's foreign ministry swiftly condemned the move, which adds to strains in relations between Ankara and Europe. Commenting on the decision to bar Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz told ORF radio:  We do not want the heated atmosphere that exists in Turkey after the coup attempt and the waves of purges that followed it to take place in Austria.  Kurz's spokesman said such a visit would represent a  danger for public order and security in Austria .  Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern told ORF radio:  The Turkish government and its president are trying to exert political influence in Austria... We will not allow it.  The decision follows a similar move by the Netherlands and echoes restrictions imposed earlier this year by several EU countries on Turkish ministers seeking to address Turks living in Europe ahead of a vote on constitutional changes in Turkey. Then as now European governments cited security concerns for the travel restrictions. Vocal Critic Austria said Zeybekci was still welcome to visit for bilateral discussions but not to attend any rally. Austria has been one of the most vocal critics in the European Union of Turkey's security crackdown since the failed coup last July. Since the coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, Turkey has jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000, including soldiers, teachers and civil servants, over alleged links with the exiled Muslim cleric Ankara blames for the coup. Turkey says the crackdown is necessary due to the security threats it faces. It has previously accused Austria of being racist over its calls to halt Ankara's EU accession talks. Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Huseyin Muftuoglu said Monday's announcement by Vienna was  telling .  The blocking of our economy minister's planned visit shows that Austria is not sincere in its approach toward defending democratic values,  he said in a written statement.  Last week the Dutch government barred a Turkish deputy prime minister from visiting the Netherlands to commemorate the anniversary of the coup.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has complained that he was not allowed to speak to Turks in Germany during his visit to Hamburg over the weekend for a summit of G20 leaders, telling a newspaper that Germany was  committing suicide . The April 16 referendum granted Erdogan sweeping new powers, drawing criticism from EU countries that Turkey is drifting toward authoritarianism.  It was not clear what kind of visit Zeybekci had planned. While Turkey's Foreign Ministry seemed to confirm he had sought to visit the anniversary event, the economy ministry said there had been no such request. It said, however, that there were plans for Zeybekci to hold talks with Austrian ministers on developing economic ties.

Eurofer said apparent EU steel demand, which includes inventory changes, will rise 1.9 percent this year to 159 million tonnes. It previously forecast demand, seen as a gauge of regional economic health, would rise 1.3 percent in 2017. Despite the raised forecast, the association issued its starkest warning yet about potential import distortions, saying regions mills could again fail to benefit from demand growth and instead lose market share to imports.   With no structural solutions for the underlying problem of global overcapacity in sight, the number of protectionist and even isolationist measures look set to increase,  Eurofer  director general Axel Eggert said in a statement.   In particular, measures potentially stemming from the U.S. section 232 investigation may lead to a proliferation of disastrous global trade flow distortions.  The United States launched a  section 232  probe in April into whether imports of steel, the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas, posed a risk to national security.  Though the move is aimed primarily at top global steel producer China, Eurofer fears EU countries will bear the brunt of the measures because Chinese steel is already largely subject to U.S. restrictions. It is also concerned that steel headed for U.S. shores will be re-routed to the EU. Invoking national security in peacetime is seen by trade experts as a move that risks undermining the global rules-based trading system by sparking retaliatory action around the world in products beyond steel. At a weekend summit in Germany, leaders from the world's 20 leading economies set an August deadline for an OECD-led global forum to compile information about steel overcapacity, with a report on potential solutions due in November. Eurofer expects apparent EU steel demand to moderate to a 1 percent growth rate next year, as the impact of economic stimulus measures fade. The association previously forecast demand would grow 1.2 percent next year. European steel prices ST-MBEUDNHRC-MB ST-MBEDSHRC-MB ST-MBEDNREB-MB ST-MBEDSREB-MB fell some 10 percent in the second quarter thanks to high inventories and increased import pressure. Prices rose some 50 percent in 2016. Although China cut some 65 million tonnes of steel capacity in 2016 and aims to cut another 50 million tonnes this year, its trading partners say much of the cuts cover already idled capacity and that the problem of unfairly traded steel remains. Chinese steel exports [MTL/CHINA3] fell 25.7 percent in the first five months of this year. However, the country still accounts for about a quarter of global steel exports and about half of the world's spare steelmaking capacity.

But the government has since rowed back after economists and some business leaders flagged concerns about the economic impact of delaying the cuts.  The president and the prime minister's objective is for tax measures to be undertaken in the 2018 budget bill to trigger a supply-side shock and boost confidence,  the source said.  To do this, the government is studying solutions to step up tax cuts starting from 2018, especially on property taxes and the wealth taxes,  the source said, adding the government still aimed to meet EU deficit target.

The week marks the beginning of the earnings season and investors will be looking at reports on Friday from big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. In a significant victory for the banking industry, the Fed late last month approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes.  I think what's happening today is the markets are in a wait-and-see approach ahead of the next big catalyst, which is earnings season,  said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at 50 Park Investments in Florida.  The way I see what's happening today is just a little bit of rotation occurring where you're selling leadership and you're buying undervalued, or you're hunting for value.  The three major indexes are trading close to record levels, boosted by strong economic data and robust corporate performance in the first quarter. Markets closed on a high on Friday after a payrolls report gave investors more confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 222,000 jobs last month, a report by the U.S. Labor Department showed on Friday. It was the second biggest increase this year and topped economists' expectations for a 179,000 gain. The dollar climbed to a two-month high against the Japanese yen on Monday as a robust jobs data propped up U.S. Treasury yields. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony is the key highlight of this week for investors looking for cues on further rate hikes. She will testify on Wednesday and Thursday. Dow e-minis were down 26 points, or 0.12 percent, with 18,594 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis remained unchanged, with 116,746 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 4.25 points, or 0.08 percent, on volume of 30,058 contracts. On the stocks, Abercrombie & Fitch shares were down 13.3 percent at $10.54 premarket after the teen apparel retailer terminated discussion on a potential deal following a review. Shares of ClubCorp were up 30.5 percent at $17.10 after the owner of private golf and country clubs got a takeover offer from private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC .

Microsoft is hoping to carve a niche among customers who cannot or do not want to have to move all their computing operations to the massive shared data centers that are collectively known as the cloud. Azure Stack could serve companies in highly regulated industries or in parts of the world where using the cloud is not yet feasible, Althoff said. “We’ve seen a lot of pent-up demand from end-user customers as well as third-party providers who are anxious to deploy this solution,” said Gartner analyst Ed Anderson. “I anticipate that this offering will provide a significant boost to Microsoft’s overall cloud business.” Dell EMC, Lenovo Group Ltd and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co will provide servers and equipment needed to run the service. Dell EMC, Lenovo and HPE will ship the first systems to customers in September. Microsoft also announced Microsoft 365, a service that allows customers to purchase the Office 365 productivity suite, Windows 10 and other services in one bundle. The product announcements, part of the company's Inspire customer conference in Washington, come just days after the layoff of thousands of sales reps. Microsoft is reorganizing to simplify its sales and marketing efforts and put more emphasis on partnerships with services companies such as KPMG.

Hence the rise of Venmo, a digital payment service owned by PayPal that allows consumers to send and receive payments regardless of what device, bank or operating system they use. It  helps soften the oftentimes uncomfortable request by replacing the cold language of transactions with colorful visuals.  While there are other apps and payment networks that enable friends to transfer money using a phone - Facebook Messenger, Zelle and Square Cash, among them - what appears to tip the popularity scale are the small digital images, otherwise known as emojis.  Seven in ten Americans - or 71 percent - use visual expressions like emojis, stickers or GIFs when texting or using mobile messaging apps, according to a new survey from Harris Poll and commissioned by GIF platform Tenor.   People said they can better communicate their thoughts and feelings when using visual expressions rather than words alone, according to the survey. With Venmo, a reminder to pay up can come under the guise of a winged dollar bill emoji, a seemingly gentler reminder than a potentially rude in-person request. Need to split the cost with friends for beers and pizza? There is an emoji for it. In fact, the pizza slice emoji is among the most popular on Venmo, according to LendEdu research. The ability to ask people 'with a smile' appeals to 30-year-old Hilary Gish, who said she uses Venmo for anything from splitting checks to tipping her hairstylist.  It's a fun and polite way of asking for money,  said Gish, who lives in Los Angeles. For 29-year-old Ella Nuortila, part of Venmo's appeal is that the app feels almost like an extension of social media, and that transactions are turned into chats.  A lot of my contacts make (their transactions) public and it gives insight to their personal lives, much like a Facebook feed,  said Nuortila. PayPal's Chief Operating Officer Bill Ready told Reuters the social aspect of apps like Venmo can help make financial transactions less burdensome.  Because Venmo is where your friends are, it makes it less awkward to ask for payment,  said Ready. Challengers Coming A recent survey by LendEdu ranked Venmo as the most popular money exchange app among Millennials, chosen by two-thirds of the 20 to 30-something people who use mobile payment apps.  The service processed $17.6 billion in transactions in 2016, a 135-percent increase on the previous year. In the first quarter of 2017, it reported a total of $6.8 billion, up from $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. In a challenge to Venmo, a group of major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, recently launched Zelle, a network that allows customers to send money to each other instantly. Earlier this month, Apple announced that Apple Pay will soon allow users to send and receive money via iMessage, which supports emojis. The service will be available on the most recent iPhone and iPad devices, as well as Apple Watch. These challengers will have a lot of ground to make up. Venmo says its most active users check the service daily, while the average user checks it two or three times per week - not just to send or receive payments, but to see what their friends and family are doing.

Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups, has repeatedly been targeted by Hungary's right-wing government, in particular over his support for more open immigration. In the latest case, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has backed a campaign in which Soros is singled out as an enemy of the state.  Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh  say billboards next to a picture of the 86-year-old investor, a campaign that Jewish groups and others say foments anti-Semitism. Soros, who rarely addresses personal attacks against him, has not commented on the billboards. But Hungarian Jewish groups and Human Rights Watch, an organization partly funded by Soros, have condemned the campaign, saying it  evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the Second World War . Many posters have been defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti, including the words  stinking Jew  written in magic marker. Israel's ambassador to Hungary issued a statement denouncing the campaign, saying it  evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear , an apparent reference to Hungary's part in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust. But hours after the ambassador made his comments over the weekend, Israel's foreign ministry issued a  clarification  saying that Soros was a legitimate target for criticism.  In no way was the statement (by the ambassador) meant to delegitimize criticism of George Soros, who continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments,  said foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon, adding that Soros funded organizations  that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself . A spokesman for Soros's Open Society Foundations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. FILE PHOTO: Hungarian government poster portraying financier George Soros and saying  Don't let George Soros have the last laugh  is seen at a tram stop in Budapest, Hungary July 6, 2017.Krisztina Than/File PhotoNetanyahu Visit The foreign ministry's unusual decision to issue a statement clarifying comments by one of its ambassadors comes days before Netanyahu, who also serves as Israel's foreign minister, is scheduled to visit Orban.  Israel is normally quick to denounce anti-Semitism or threats to Jewish communities anywhere in the world. While it made that point in the statement, it chose to focus on the threat it believes Soros poses to Israeli democracy.  Among the organizations Soros funds is Human Rights Watch, which is frequently critical of Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its policies toward the Palestinians.  Like Hungary, Israel has passed legislation that seeks to limit the influence of non-governmental organizations that receive a large portion of their funding from abroad.  Israel and Hungary were briefly at odds last month after Orban praised Hungary's World War Two leader Miklos Horthy, calling him an  exceptional statesman . Horthy was an ally of Adolf Hitler who approved anti-Jewish legislation in the 1920s and 1930s and cooperated with the Germans in deporting Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. Initially Israel expressed alarm, but then quickly accepted the Hungarian government's explanation that Orban had zero tolerance for anti-Semitism and was not suggesting everything Horthy did was positive. The strong ties between Netanyahu and Orban have raised eyebrows in the European Union, where Orban is regarded as an illiberal maverick. His party has curtailed press freedom and stymied EU efforts to tackle the migrant crisis. Hungary has held discussions with Israel about purchasing security fences to keep migrants out, while Israel has sought better ties with countries that it hopes will take its side in any EU discussions where Israel is criticized.

Deutsche Bank and Barclays are restructuring their investment banks after a series of bets that went wrong in the wake of the financial crisis left them struggling to compete with Wall Street rivals.  The temporary decrease in revenue with our two major customers is currently unavoidable due to the realignment of these financial institutions,  said GFT, which helps banks to implement regulatory requirements and digitize processes. A spokeswoman said the banks in question were the same two it had blamed for its last warning in March. Revenue from other customers is expected to grow by 13 percent this year, GFT added.  Since the realignment of the two major customers is expected to extend into 2018 and GFT is assuming that the revenue with these two financial institutions will not pick up again until 2019, management has also adjusted the medium-term forecast,  GFT added. The company pushed back to 2022 from 2020 its targets for revenue of 800 million euros ($910.7 million) and a core profit margin of 12 percent. GFT shares dropped to a two-year low and by 1145 GMT were down 10.7 percent at 16.40 euros. The Stuttgart-based group said it now expects 2017 core earnings of 42 million euros, down from a previous forecast of 48 million euros and last year's 47 million euros. Full-year revenue is expected to be flat at 425 million euros, against previous guidance of 450 million euros. GFT said that social security contributions in Brazil, restructuring costs and currency fluctuations would also weigh on this year's profit.

Import-dependent Egypt has been hit by soaring inflation since it floated its currency in November, allowing the pound to roughly halve in value. The float marked the opening of a three-year, $12 billion International Monetary Fund reform program that includes tax increases and subsidy cuts. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food, increased to 31.95 percent year on year in June from 30.57 percent in May, the central bank said on Monday. Annual urban consumer price inflation rose slightly in June to 29.8 percent from 29.7 percent in May, the official statistics agency, CAPMAS, said on Monday. Last week, the government increased electricity prices by up to 42 percent this fiscal year for households. A week earlier, it raised fuel prices by up to 50 percent to help meet the terms of its IMF loan agreement [nL8N1JQ1G5]. Rising prices present a challenge for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his government, which have pledged to push ahead with sensitive austerity measures like fuel and electricity price increases. Although the monthly inflation rate in Egyptian cities eased to 0.8 percent in June from 1.7 percent in May, government officials and analysts expect the higher fuel prices to add 3 to 4.5 percentage points to year-on-year inflation in the coming months [nL8N1JU2LP].    Based on our rough calculation, headline inflation should rise above 35 percent starting July/August. However, some of this could get offset ... if the Egyptian pound strengthens,  said Allen Sandeep, head of research at Naeem Brokerage in Cairo.  Invariably, most goods and services are impacted by energy costs ... be it in the form of energy input, transportation, feed stock ...,  Sandeep added.  Egypt's central bank, faced with accelerating inflation, raised its key interest rates by 200 basis points for the second policy meeting in a row on Thursday, surprising economists who had forecast no change.[nL8N1JX5WF} The bank raised interest rates by three percentage points after the currency flotation. The IMF has said lowering inflation is crucial to keeping the reform program on track and that raising interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so. The central bank has said it aims to cut inflation to 13 percent by the end of next year. The IMF is expected to disburse a second loan installment of $1.25 billion this month.

Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 46 million barrels in the week leading up to July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2uInAFV). Funds increased their net long position for the first time after reducing it by a cumulative 231 million barrels over the previous four weeks, according to data from regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2tzCiRh). The move had all the characteristics of a short covering rally, with crude prices rising steadily between June 21 and July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2t4K7ek). The commencement of short-covering was widely anticipated after hedge funds established a record number of short positions in crude, gasoline and heating oil by June 27. The total number of short positions held by hedge fund managers in the five major crude and products contracts declined from a record 510 million barrels on June 27 to 463 million barrels on July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2u9sW00). Fund managers cut short positions in WTI by 14 million barrels, Brent by 13 million, U.S. gasoline by 8 million and U.S. heating oil by 13 million in the week running up to Independence Day. Even so, only a small number of short positions had been closed out by July 4. But then something very unexpected happened. Instead of prices continuing to climb as more short positions were closed, prices began to sink in the second half of last week. From a positioning perspective, the balance of risks remained tilted to the upside, with a small number of long positions left to liquidate and a large number of shorts still needing to be closed out. So the renewed decline in oil prices therefore marked an unusual and aggressive move, with extra selling from unknown traders pushing prices lower. Oil prices continued to slide despite an unusually large drawdown in U.S. commercial crude stocks reported on July 6. From a positioning perspective, positions still appear very stretched on the downside. There is still a very high risk of the trade becoming crowded. But sentiment in the oil market has become exceptionally bearish, with most traders concluding OPEC won't, or can't, do anything to support prices, and U.S. shale producers can't, or won't, moderate the drilling boom. Prices may therefore have to continue falling low enough for long enough to enforce a strategy correction from the shale drillers or OPEC. The result is an unresolved tension between positioning risks (which remain biased to the upside) and fundamental risks (which are increasingly tilted to the downside).

Erdogan also stressed that hydrocarbon sources in waters around Cyprus should belong to all sides on the island.  What we expect from anyone who takes sides in the developments in Cyprus is that they should refrain from steps that might pave the way for new tensions in the region,  he said.

Deutsche Bank and Barclays are restructuring their investment banks after a series of bets that went wrong in the wake of the financial crisis left them struggling to compete with Wall Street rivals.  The temporary decrease in revenue with our two major customers is currently unavoidable due to the realignment of these financial institutions,  said GFT, which helps banks to implement regulatory requirements and digitize processes. A spokeswoman said the banks in question were the same two it had blamed for its last warning in March. Revenue from other customers is expected to grow by 13 percent this year, GFT added.  Since the realignment of the two major customers is expected to extend into 2018 and GFT is assuming that the revenue with these two financial institutions will not pick up again until 2019, management has also adjusted the medium-term forecast,  GFT added. The company pushed back to 2022 from 2020 its targets for revenue of 800 million euros ($910.7 million) and a core profit margin of 12 percent. GFT shares dropped to a two-year low and by 1145 GMT were down 10.7 percent at 16.40 euros. The Stuttgart-based group said it now expects 2017 core earnings of 42 million euros, down from a previous forecast of 48 million euros and last year's 47 million euros. Full-year revenue is expected to be flat at 425 million euros, against previous guidance of 450 million euros.

Import-dependent Egypt has been hit by soaring inflation since it floated its currency in November, allowing the pound to roughly halve in value. The float marked the opening of a three-year, $12 billion International Monetary Fund reform program that includes tax increases and subsidy cuts. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food, increased to 31.95 percent year on year in June from 30.57 percent in May, the central bank said on Monday. Annual urban consumer price inflation rose slightly in June to 29.8 percent from 29.7 percent in May, the official statistics agency, CAPMAS, said on Monday. Last week, the government increased electricity prices by up to 42 percent this fiscal year for households. A week earlier, it raised fuel prices by up to 50 percent to help meet the terms of its IMF loan agreement [nL8N1JQ1G5]. Rising prices present a challenge for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his government, which have pledged to push ahead with sensitive austerity measures like fuel and electricity price increases. Although the monthly inflation rate in Egyptian cities eased to 0.8 percent in June from 1.7 percent in May, government officials and analysts expect the higher fuel prices to add 3 to 4.5 percentage points to year-on-year inflation in the coming months [nL8N1JU2LP].    Based on our rough calculation, headline inflation should rise above 35 percent starting July/August. However, some of this could get offset ... if the Egyptian pound strengthens,  said Allen Sandeep, head of research at Naeem Brokerage in Cairo.  Invariably, most goods and services are impacted by energy costs ... be it in the form of energy input, transportation, feed stock ...,  Sandeep added.  Egypt's central bank, faced with accelerating inflation, raised its key interest rates by 200 basis points for the second policy meeting in a row on Thursday, surprising economists who had forecast no change.[nL8N1JX5WF} The bank raised interest rates by three percentage points after the currency flotation. The IMF has said lowering inflation is crucial to keeping the reform program on track and that raising interest rates could be an appropriate tool for doing so. The central bank has said it aims to cut inflation to 13 percent by the end of next year. The IMF is expected to disburse a second loan installment of $1.25 billion this month.

As part of the programme, dubbed Project Next, Bharti Airtel will redesign its 2,500 retail stores, revamp its mobile application, and allow its contract mobile phone subscribers consume unused data in the next billing month.  Over the course of the next 18-24 months you will see a lot more initiatives under Project Next as we transform ourselves into being a fully digital service provider,  Gopal Vittal, Bharti Airtel's Chief Executive for India and South Asia, told a news conference. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the telecom startup backed by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, disrupted the country's highly-competitive telecoms sector as it launched late last year with cut-price data and free voice plans. That has hurt revenue and profits at the incumbent carriers led by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group Plc's Indian unit who have responded with a string of price cuts to retain customers. The industry saw its revenue for the January-March quarter falling more than 15 percent from a year earlier to 408.31 billion rupees hurt by intense competition and price cuts, local ratings agency CARE estimated based on data from the sector regulator. More than 95 percent of India's billion-plus mobile phone subscribers use so-called pre-paid connections, where customers pay upfront for services and tend to switch carriers. Postpaid, or contract, customers are stickier, and the average revenue per user for the carriers is also higher.

It is impossible to appreciate that some energy companies are acting with, and becoming part of some irresponsible measures taken by, Greek Cypriots. I want to remind them that they could lose a friend like Turkey,  Erdogan told a petroleum  conference in Istanbul. Erdogan did not name the companies. Last month, Cyprus issued a maritime advisory for a natural gas drill from July to October in a step opposed by Turkey, which challenges the divided island's jurisdiction to search for hydrocarbons. Erdogan also stressed that hydrocarbon sources in waters around Cyprus should belong to all sides on the island.  What we expect from anyone who takes sides in the developments in Cyprus is that they should refrain from steps that might pave the way for new tensions in the region,  he said. Total won an offshore exploration license from Cyprus for drilling this year. When asked by Reuters at a petroleum conference in Istanbul whether drilling by the company could alienate Turkey, Arnaud Breuillac, president of exploration and production at Total said the company had  no concerns .

International sanctions on Iran were lifted in January 2016 and NITC is looking to come in from the cold after years of isolation.  Mohammad Reza Shams Dolatabadi, NITC's head of international affairs, told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy industry conference in Istanbul that the company aimed to replace some of its older tankers with new vessels.  We have a plan for the renovation of our fleet and to buy new vessels. We’ll scrap some of our old vessels but we will not change our capacity,  he said.   We have a (renovation) plan for five years, but (we are) still working to finalize that.  NITC's own operations were also hampered previously due to their difficulty in securing international insurance cover for their fleet and getting certification, a key requirement for access to many ports around the world, which tests the sea worthiness of ships. Iran has steadily reconnected with buyers across Europe since sanctions were lifted and NITC expects to play a bigger role.   We were active during the sanctions era in the Asian market, but we have started since last year to return to the European market as well,  Dolatabadi said.  Our ships are calling at many European ports, and the number of these shipments is increasing day by day.  He added that the company also planned to acquire liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, marking a new direction for the company.   We are thinking of an LNG fleet in the future,  he said.   Iran has the largest gas reserves in the world. There are plans for production for liquefied gas, LNG, in the future. So due to that we are thinking about playing a part in the shipment of this product in the future. (It will come along) in the mid-term, three to five years,  he said.

Foreign ministers and deputy foreign ministers of the four Visegrad Group countries -- Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, and the Czech Republic -- as well as Austria, Slovenia and Croatia met in Budapest to discuss issues including migration and the situation in the western Balkans and Ukraine.  If we cannot speed up the European integration process (in the western Balkans) ... we will have to face serious security challenges in the entire Central European region,  Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a news conference. Szijjarto said the EU should accelerate its ongoing accession talks with Montenegro and Serbia and should open membership negotiations with the other countries in the western Balkans as well.  Albania and Macedonia are EU candidate nations but have yet to start their accession talks, while Bosnia and Kosovo have yet to be granted candidacy status, though both hope to join the EU. Slovenian Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec said the countries of the western Balkans should receive help in implementing the reforms needed to qualify for EU membership.  The situation in the western Balkans is rather obscure, not stable, and... it will be necessary to ensure that there is dialogue to strengthen stability in this region,  he said. Tensions remain high between Serbia and Kosovo, its former province whose independence is not recognized by Belgrade or by some other countries, while Macedonia and Bosnia are riven by ethnic divisions.   The prospect of EU membership has for years been the main driver of reform in the Balkans after a decade of war and upheaval in the 1990s. But with Britain's vote last year to leave the bloc, the rise of right-wing populism in many EU countries and debate over the future shape of the bloc, further enlargement has been placed firmly on the backburner. Political analysts and diplomats say this has severely diminished the EU's leverage in the western Balkans, which also remain dogged by poverty and corruption in addition to the ethnic and political divisions. Russia, which is trying to exploit its historic links in the region to challenge EU and U.S. involvement, opposes the accession of Balkan states to the EU and NATO. Last month Montenegro became NATO's 29th member, angering Moscow. At a summit earlier this year EU leaders said more Balkan states could still join the bloc if they stuck to a path of economic and democratic reforms.

ADNOC said on Monday it has already begun talks about the planned partnerships and expects to announce them this year. Plans to list some of ADNOC's services businesses come as other Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, have also embarked on floating energy assets in an era of cheap crude.  Saudi oil company Aramco (IPO-ARMO.SE) is planning a listing next year to raise as much as $100 billion to invest in new industries, as the kingdom seeks to diversify beyond oil exports as part of its  Vision 2030  plan. However, ADNOC only plans to list minority stakes in some of its services businesses on local equity markets, rather than an initial public offering (IPO) of the holding company, its chief executive Sultan al-Jaber told The National newspaper.  ADNOC will remain fully owned by the government of Abu Dhabi,  he said in an interview whose contents were later confirmed by the company in a statement.  This is very much in line with what other Middle East or oil producing countries are looking into due to the low oil price environment,  Abishek Deshpande, chief energy analyst at Natixis, said of the ADNOC plans.     Oman said earlier this year it planned to offer shares in some state-owned downstream energy companies to the public.

ADNOC is seeking  large trading houses, international pension funds, private equity investors and global infrastructure specialists rather than just national oil companies and international oil companies,  the National, an Abu Dhabi-based newspaper, reported.  It is looking to the new investors to support it in securing market access for its products, especially in Asia and a new co-investment approach would lead to a  more open partnership model , Jaber said.  The company would remain the major shareholder but would offer  strategic partnerships and co-investments across our service and refining businesses and select infrastructure assets, such as ADNOC pipelines and storage facilities  he said.  Potential areas for partnership include the development and expansion of a leading, regional drilling company and a new energy infrastructure venture as well as downstream ventures, The National reported.

International sanctions on Iran were lifted in January 2016 and NITC is looking to come in from the cold after years of isolation.  Mohammad Reza Shams Dolatabadi, NITC's head of international affairs, told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy industry conference in Istanbul that the company aimed to replace some of its older tankers with new vessels.  We have a plan for the renovation of our fleet and to buy new vessels. We’ll scrap some of our old vessels but we will not change our capacity,  he said.   We have a (renovation) plan for five years, but (we are) still working to finalize that.  NITC's own operations were also hampered previously due to their difficulty in securing international insurance cover for their fleet and getting certification, a key requirement for access to many ports around the world, which tests the sea worthiness of ships. Iran has steadily reconnected with buyers across Europe since sanctions were lifted and NITC expects to play a bigger role.   We were active during the sanctions era in the Asian market, but we have started since last year to return to the European market as well,  Dolatabadi said.  Our ships are calling at many European ports, and the number of these shipments is increasing day by day.  He added that the company also planned to acquire liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, marking a new direction for the company.   We are thinking of an LNG fleet in the future,  he said.   Iran has the largest gas reserves in the world. There are plans for production for liquefied gas, LNG, in the future. So due to that we are thinking about playing a part in the shipment of this product in the future. (It will come along) in the mid-term, three to five years,  he said.

Eurofer said apparent EU steel demand, which includes inventory changes, will rise 1.9 percent this year to 159 million tonnes. It previously forecast demand, seen as a gauge of regional economic health, would rise 1.3 percent in 2017. Despite the raised forecast, the association issued its starkest warning yet about potential import distortions, saying regions mills could again fail to benefit from demand growth and instead lose market share to imports.   With no structural solutions for the underlying problem of global overcapacity in sight, the number of protectionist and even isolationist measures look set to increase,  Eurofer  director general Axel Eggert said in a statement.   In particular, measures potentially stemming from the U.S. section 232 investigation may lead to a proliferation of disastrous global trade flow distortions.  The United States launched a  section 232  probe in April into whether imports of steel, the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas, posed a risk to national security.  Though the move is aimed primarily at top global steel producer China, Eurofer fears EU countries will bear the brunt of the measures because Chinese steel is already largely subject to U.S. restrictions. It is also concerned that steel headed for U.S. shores will be re-routed to the EU. Invoking national security in peacetime is seen by trade experts as a move that risks undermining the global rules-based trading system by sparking retaliatory action around the world in products beyond steel. At a weekend summit in Germany, leaders from the world's 20 leading economies set an August deadline for an OECD-led global forum to compile information about steel overcapacity, with a report on potential solutions due in November. Eurofer expects apparent EU steel demand to moderate to a 1 percent growth rate next year, as the impact of economic stimulus measures fade. The association previously forecast demand would grow 1.2 percent next year. European steel prices ST-MBEUDNHRC-MB ST-MBEDSHRC-MB ST-MBEDNREB-MB ST-MBEDSREB-MB fell some 10 percent in the second quarter thanks to high inventories and increased import pressure. Prices rose some 50 percent in 2016. Although China cut some 65 million tonnes of steel capacity in 2016 and aims to cut another 50 million tonnes this year, its trading partners say much of the cuts cover already idled capacity and that the problem of unfairly traded steel remains. Chinese steel exports [MTL/CHINA3] fell 25.7 percent in the first five months of this year. However, the country still accounts for about a quarter of global steel exports and about half of the world's spare steelmaking capacity.

White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told  Fox News Sunday  that Trump still expected the Senate to pass a healthcare bill either before the start of Congress' August recess  or maybe a little bit into  the recess. Trump made the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, a central plank of his 2016 campaign.  I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!  Trump said early Monday in a post on Twitter. Other Republicans were more pessimistic.  My view is that it's probably going to be dead,  Senator John McCain of Arizona said of the healthcare legislation on the CBS program  Face the Nation.  Some conservative senators, such as Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, have said they cannot support the proposal unless it goes further to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the signature legislation of President Barack Obama. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is weighing how to shore up support for the healthcare bill, which would repeal parts of Obamacare and eliminate the tax increases that fund it. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives in May passed its own version of a bill overhauling healthcare. Protests McConnell warned at a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky last week that if Republicans were unable to pass their own replacement bill, they might need to work with Democrats to bolster the insurance markets created under Obamacare, according to the Associated Press. During a week-long recess last week that coincided with the Fourth of July holiday, liberal groups organized town halls and protests and ran advertisements criticizing the proposal. Most Republican senators kept a low profile on the issue, including McCain, who traveled to Afghanistan to visit troops, and Senator Jeff Flake, a fellow Arizonan who faces a tough re-election fight next year. Last week, groups such as the state chapter of Planned Parenthood and Ability 360, an advocacy organization for disabled people, participated in events that spotlighted the Senate bill, including a town hall in Phoenix. At the Phoenix event, there were empty chairs on a stage with placards for McCain and Flake, who were invited but did not attend. Arizonans such as Rosemary Dixon, who had a kidney transplant in 2015 and worries about how she will pay for her medication, spoke about the potential impact of the legislation. Medicaid Cuts Republicans have long criticized Obamacare as ineffective and a government intrusion into a key sector of the economy. But opponents deride the Republican healthcare bill as a giveaway to wealthy Americans who would see some tax increases rolled back. Critics also warn the legislation would cause millions of poor and sick Americans to lose healthcare coverage. The Obamacare law expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, largely through an expansion of Medicaid, a government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Senators from states such as Ohio, Nevada and Arizona that expanded the Medicaid program under Obamacare are taking heat from Republican governors over the Senate bill’s proposal to phase out the expansion. In Arizona, for example, more than 400,000 have signed up for Medicaid since its expansion there and 1.9 million are now insured by the program. The Senate legislation would also drastically cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which assesses the impact of legislation, estimated 22 million people would lose health insurance over the next decade under the Senate bill. In a separate report, it found the proposal would cut government spending on Medicaid by 35 percent come 2036. The Senate bill is unpopular with voters. Just 24 percent of adults approved of the proposal, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll of 1,554 adults taken from July 2 to 6. McConnell can only lose two Republican votes on the bill, relying on Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tiebreaking vote. But McConnell must do so with an eye on the 2018 congressional elections, ensuring he does not imperil the party's narrow majority in the 100-seat Senate.

The asset manager also said it would vote against the re-election of Chairman John Peace and of the remuneration committee chair Fabiola Arredondo at Burberry's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday.  While the board has made some improvements since the last shareholder rebellion three years ago, the chaotic response to several remuneration issues this year has heightened our concerns about poor corporate governance at Burberry,  Ashley Hamilton Claxton, Royal London's corporate governance manager, said in a statement on Monday. Back in 2014 nearly 53 percent of votes cast at its annual shareholder meeting opposed the board's remuneration report. Hamilton Claxton criticized only a slim reduction in the bonus of former chief executive Christopher Bailey despite a 21 percent fall in 2016-17 profit, as well as awards to new finance chief Julie Brown, poor board oversight and the firm's new reporting structure. Marco Gobbetti succeeded Bailey as CEO on July 5, but Bailey remains president and chief creative officer. Shareholder bodies have also been critical of Burberry's remuneration policies. Burberry declined to comment. The firm said last month that it wanted to announce a successor to Peace by the end of 2018. It is due to give a trading update on Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's meeting.

The FDA had imposed a hold on the mid-stage study in May and asked for more data before Concert could proceed with dosing patients. The regulator had not raised any concerns about the drug's safety, the drug developer had said. Concert said on Monday it would modify the design of the study evaluating its drug, CTP-543, as a treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe alopecia areata.  About 90 patients will be enrolled in the trial and will be randomized to receive either one of two doses of the twice-daily drug - 4 mg and 8 mg - or a placebo. The company, which said it would resume enrollment later this month, expects to complete the study in the second half of 2018. The primary outcome of the trial will be measured after 24 weeks of dosing. Concert also said it might explore higher doses of the treatment. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks hair follicles, resulting in patchy or complete hair loss on the scalp and body. The disease affects about 4.6 million people in the United States, according to the North American Hair Research Society.

Sloan,Vince Chhabria,WELLS FARGO,LAWSUIT/ (UPDATE 2),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - A California judge has granted a preliminary approval for Wells Fargo & Co's agreement to pay $142 million, and perhaps more, to customers whose credit scores were harmed by its employees creating fake accounts in their names, the bank said on Sunday. Wells Fargo has set aside that money to compensate customers who are part of a class-action lawsuit involving claims regarding consumer or small business bank accounts, credit cards or loans, as well as identity theft protection, between May 2002 and April of this year. It plans to begin reaching out to those affected customers soon. In the  unlikely event  that there are so many claims, and there is not $25 million left over to distribute across all customers involved in the lawsuit, Wells Fargo said it will pay more. The bank reached the settlement in April, according to a regulatory filing, but the judge's preliminary approval moves the deal to the next step. Wells Fargo has previously said thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million bank and credit card accounts in individuals' names without their permission to artificially hit sales goals. Lawyers representing the claimants said 3.5 million accounts were created, according to a May 12 story by the Los Angeles Times. If U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria grants final approval to  the deal, it could help Wells Fargo chip away at a bevy of legal and regulatory issues stemming from the scandal, which erupted in September after it reached a $185 million settlement with a Los Angeles prosecutor and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells still faces probes from federal, state and local government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as a number of private lawsuits, according to its quarterly securities filing in May. In a statement, the bank's chief executive, Tim Sloan, said he was  pleased  that the court approved the preliminary settlement and considered it  a major milestone in our efforts to make things right for our customers.  If the agreement receives final approval the bank expects it will close out the vast majority of claims in 10 class action lawsuits related to the one it is trying to settle.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-lawsuit-idUSL1N1K10BP"},

Investors were told about VW's systematic emissions test cheating using illegal software on Sept. 18 2015, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) informed markets. The Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that Oliver Schmidt, a VW executive who was arrested in Miami in January this year, told the then CEO Martin Winterkorn about possible financial implications at an Aug. 25, 2015 presentation. German securities law requires firms publish any market sensitive news in a timely fashion. A probe by German prosecutors includes investigating whether VW disclosed details promptly. The newspaper said Schmidt informed Winterkorn about the maximum possible penalty at the meeting that was also attended by Heinz-Jakob Neusser, VW's development chief at the time, and Herbert Diess, who still works as VW's brand chief. Bild am Sonntag cited U.S. investigation documents. A VW spokesman said the firm would not comment on the report because of ongoing legal and regulatory investigations. It has previously said it did not violate disclosure rules. The VW spokesman also said Diess had no comment. Lawyers for Winterkorn, who stepped down as VW CEO in September 2015, could not immediately be reached for comment. Annette Voges, the lawyer for Neusser who also left his position in September 2015, declined to comment on behalf of her client saying she had not seen the statements by Schmidt. A lawyer for Schmidt declined to comment. VW admitted using a  defeat device , the name used to describe software to deceive regulators about the real extent of diesel pollution, to the U.S. EPA and California's Air Resources Board on Sept. 3 2015, according to VW's annual report for 2016. In the annual report, VW said its management did not make details of the scandal public before Sept. 18, 2015 because board members considered costs would be  controllable overall with a view to the business activities of Volkswagen Group.  German prosecutors are investigating Diess, Winterkorn and VW's current chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, as part of a wider probe into market manipulation. The executives have denied wrongdoing. German prosecutors conducting the investigation into market manipulation declined to comment on Sunday. Bild am Sonntag also reported that Winterkorn and Diess were informed VW had used a  defeat device  at a meeting on July 27, 2015. Diess had joined VW just weeks earlier.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-penalty-idUSL1N1K10BM"},

The recall includes Mazda 6 vehicles manufactured in China between September 2008 and January 2016, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said in a statement on its website on Friday. The watchdog said the issue was related to dangerous defects in the airbag inflator on the passenger side, and follows an earlier recall of 280,000 Mazda 6 models manufactured between 2003 and 2008 for a similar issue. Takata filed for bankruptcy in Japan and the United States last month, burdened with tens of billions in liabilities related to a decade of recalls and lawsuits over faulty airbags supplied to some of the world's biggest auto brands. The airbags have been linked to at least 16 deaths and 180 injuries. The firm will be largely acquired for $1.6 billion by Chinese-owned, U.S.-based firm Key Safety Systems as part of its financial restructuring. On Friday the Chinese watchdog said in a statement that it has asked foreign firms General Motors, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen to fulfil their obligations to recall vehicles in China affected by faulty Takata air bags.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/faw-china-recall-idUSL1N1K10BG"},

Trump's then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also attended the meeting at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after Trump won the Republican nomination, the Times reported.   In a statement quoted by the Times and later made available to Reuters and other media outlets, Donald Trump Jr.  acknowledged meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.        After pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,  the statement said. Clinton was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.   Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.  Trump Jr. said Veselnitskaya then turned the conversation to the adoption of Russian children and a U.S. law blackisting Russians linked to alleged human-rights abuses. President Trump was  not aware of and did not attend  the meeting, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's legal team, said in an emailed statement. Trump Jr. said he was asked to attend the meeting  with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign  at the request of an acquaintance he knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.   I asked Jared and Paul to attend, but told them nothing of the substance,  he said.  U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks with his son Donald Trump Jr. during a news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., January 11, 2017.Lucas Jackson The meeting lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes,  he said.  As it ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. That was the end of it and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind. My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events.   The New York Times report said Trump Jr. was promised damaging information about Clinton before agreeing to meet with the lawyer. It cited three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it. The Times first reported on the meeting on Saturday, after which Trump Jr. issued a statement confirming that it took place, but made no mention of the Clinton aspect. Slideshow (2 Images)Representatives for Manafort and Kushner did not respond to requests for comment. Allegations of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia have cast a shadow over Donald Trump's first five months in office. A federal special counsel and several congressional committees are investigating possible contacts between the campaign and Russian representatives as part of a larger probe into allegations that Moscow meddled in the election. The June meeting was the first confirmed private meeting between members of the president's inner circle and a Russian national, the Times reported, citing confidential government records and interviews with people familiar with the documents. The revelations come after President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the allegations of election meddling during the summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Hamburg, Germany. The Kremlin has denied U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trump's favor, using such means as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats.  Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion.

Carillion shares plunged 35 percent to trade at 124 pence by 1200 GMT, having earlier hit their lowest level since April 2003. The firm, which helps maintain British railways and roads, said payment problems on four construction contracts nearing or reaching completion had forced it take a provision of 845 million pounds ($1.1 billion). Carillion had also seen costs escalate on other projects, sometimes due to design changes, taking a particular hit on public partnership contracts with governments where prices are set ahead of time.  It has been a perfect storm that these contracts have gone wrong at the same time and because they were all large contracts the compounding effect becomes very material,  Keith Cochrane, who was appointed as interim CEO, told analysts. Announcing that Chief Executive Richard Howson was stepping down, Carillion asked non-executive director Cochrane to take charge while it seeks a permanent successor. Cochrane is a former boss of Scottish engineering company Weir Group. The firm said to conserve cash it would suspend dividends for 2017 -- saving it 80 million pounds -- and would exit its UK partnership contracts as well as construction work in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. However, average net borrowing in the first half of the year has risen to 695 million pounds from 586.5 million over 2016. The company plans to update investors in September on a review of its business and capital structure. Shorted Shares The British government has been seeking to support companies such as Carillion to help them to win overseas international contracts. Last week, the government announced that UK Export Finance (UKEF) would provide $180 million to Carillion to design and build the latest phase of  One Central , Dubai World Trade Centre's new development in Dubai's central business district. The UK government remained  committed to supporting Carillion and other firms in the UK's world-leading construction sector as they trade abroad,  a spokeswoman said. Carillion shares were among the most heavily shorted across the British market with hedge funds including Marshall Wace and Naya Capital reporting sizeable bets on them falling, according to FCA disclosure data. Analysts said the company might have to ask investors to contribute to a capital raising.  Carillion looks like it's trying to bail out a supertanker with a soup spoon,  said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown.  ...Talk of a review of capital structure, and the ongoing debt problem, will leave investors worried that a significant rights issue could be on the horizon,  he added. The problems at Carillion have echoes of those at Balfour Beatty, the UK construction peer that Carillion had previously tried to take over. Balfour spent two years overhauling its operations after work undertaken at lower margins led to multiple profit warnings that forced it to scrap its 2015 dividend, among other measures. Winning new contracts has become harder for Carillion as spending in the Middle East adjusts to lower oil prices, and the firm has also experienced some delays in UK public spending decisions since Britain voted to leave the European Union. Three partnership projects in Britain accounted for 375 million pounds of the provision, but the bulk related to markets in the Middle East and Canada, the company said, forecasting future cash outflows of 100-150 million pounds for the contracts.  The challenges of doing business in the Middle East is not just in terms of (cash) collections... but also that customer dialogue has very much come to the fore,  Cochrane said. Carillion said on Monday it had decided to not pursue any more partnership construction contracts. For other types of work, it said it would only take on future construction work on a highly selective basis and via lower-risk procurement routes. The firm now expects revenue of 4.8 billion to 5 billion pounds for 2017, it said, down from 5.2 billion pounds in 2016. Its overall performance was expected to be below management's previous expectations.

Royal London holds a 0.5 percent stake in Burberry, whose executive pay policies have faced persistent investor criticism.  The asset manager also said it would vote against the re-election of Chairman John Peace and of the remuneration committee chair Fabiola Arredondo at Burberry's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday.  While the board has made some improvements since the last shareholder rebellion three years ago, the chaotic response to several remuneration issues this year has heightened our concerns about poor corporate governance at Burberry,  Ashley Hamilton Claxton, Royal London's corporate governance manager, said in a statement on Monday. Back in 2014 nearly 53 percent of votes cast at its annual shareholder meeting opposed the board's remuneration report. Hamilton Claxton criticized only a slim reduction in the bonus of former chief executive Christopher Bailey despite a 21 percent fall in 2016-17 profit, as well as awards to new finance chief Julie Brown, poor board oversight and the firm's new reporting structure. Marco Gobbetti succeeded Bailey as CEO on July 5, but Bailey remains president and chief creative officer. Shareholder bodies have also been critical of Burberry's remuneration policies. Burberry declined to comment. The firm said last month that it wanted to announce a successor to Peace by the end of 2018. It is due to give a trading update on Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's meeting. Shares in Burberry, up 8 percent this year, were 0.2 percent higher at 1,614 pence at 1110 GMT, valuing the business at 7 billion pounds ($9 billion).

The Briton survived a day in hell in Sunday's ninth stage as big rival and long-time friend Richie Porte crashed out, but he lost his lieutenant Geraint Thomas, who also exited the race after a fall.     Froome is now without his key support, he could not drop his main rivals in the last climb to the Mont du Chat, and was also distanced by last year's runner-up Romain Bardet in the treacherous final descent. In addition, Froome had to deal with controversy. Fabio Aru attacked him just as he was requesting assistance because of a mechanical problem on the Mont du Chat.  Later Froome appeared to lean onto the Italian, who then almost crashed into the spectators lined up along the route.  I lost my balance a little bit and swerved to the right.  Aru happened to be on my right and he had to swerve as well.  Any suggestion that it was on purpose is just crazy,  said Froome.     Both Froome and Aru played down the incidents - the attack and the alleged retribution. To add to the off-bike worries, Sky found itself in the center of a row over their time-trial skin suits at the Grand Depart in Germany, while team principal Dave Brailsford has been snubbing the media since his opening news conference, though Froome and his teammates have been cooperative.    Cycling - The 104th Tour de France cycling race - The 181.5-km Stage 9 from Nantua to Chambery, France - July 9, 2017 - Team Sky rider and yellow jersey Chris Froome of Britain and Direct Energie rider and polka-dot jersey Lilian Calmejane at the start.Benoit TessierThe Welshman, who was more than willing to discuss team tactics and all things cycling when Sky arrived in the peloton, now declines to chat with reporters most of the time. For the first time in years, the yellow jersey will not be holding his traditional rest-day news conference.     Though Froome picked up a four-second time bonus by finishing third on Sunday, he has not yet hammered the opposition.     He leads Aru by 18 seconds and Bardet by 51 going into the second week with the GC battle set to resume in the Pyrenees and the Frenchman, a runner-up last year, promising  more battles will be fought .  But Froome has so far fought off his rivals.      You need somebody on par with him and I don't know if that's the case. It's a race that could be Chris Froome's race,  three-time champion Greg LeMond told Reuters.     Aru beat Froome in the first summit finish last Wednesday but was at some point dropped in the ascent to the Mont du Chat. Bardet was eventually reined in during the run-in to Chambery after dropping the main overall contenders in the descent One of Froome's main challengers, Colombian Nairo Quintana, is now 2:13 off the pace after failing to sustain the pace in the climb up the Mont du Chat.  Even a podium finish, let alone overall victory, seems unlikely for the Movistar rider.      With a 22-km time trial favoring the Briton on the penultimate day, the race is still Froome's to lose.

Paper profits for short sellers on Monday were nearly $90 million after Carillion shares fell by more than 35 percent, Reuters calculations show. Carillion was the most heavily shorted stock on the London market according to disclosures from Britain's Finiancial Conduct Authority, with  significant  shorts -- bets amounting to 0.5 percent or more of outstanding shares -- accounting for more than a quarter of its shares at Friday's close. Short-sellers, who sell borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference, have long targeted Carillion and Britain's outsourcing sector because of escalating costs on long-running contracts and a tough economic backdrop for several of the firm's customers. At the end of last week, some 17 funds had short positions on Carillion, totalling more than $270 million. A build-up in accounts receivables - or money owed to the company by clients - along with a burgeoning pension deficit and a bloated balance sheet have soured sentiment on Carillion.  They have been expanding regularly over time beyond levels that are normal for the industry and there was the major red flag that got us excited about this short two years ago,  Adrien Brus, an investment analyst at Naya Capital said.  This is a sign that they are recognising revenue in excess of the cash that they are collecting,  Brus, whose hedge fund was short Carillion shares, added. As of the end of last year, Carillion's accounts receivables stood at $1.6 billion, more than double its market value on Monday, according to Thomson Reuters data “Short interest itself remains very high so the sceptics are strong, and that is borne out in the profit warning,” said David Lewis, an analyst at Markit, which tracks short-selling. Some of the bearish bets on Carillion are long-standing. Marshall Wace first disclosed a 0.51 percent short position in May 2013 and has the largest short bet against Carillion's peer Mitie, which issued three profit warnings in four months in late 2016 and early 2017. Marshall Wace did not respond to calls for comment. Carillion's peers also suffered losses, with Balfour Beatty shares more than 3 percent lower, while Serco slipped by 2 percent. Muddying the outlook for Carillion, a slide in oil prices this year has worsened the operating environment for many of its clients, making cash recovery harder still. And with an already stretched balance sheet, any equity capital raising is likely to dilute existing shareholders.

Yang Xiaochao, secretary general of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), is the leading candidate to head the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The top CIRC job has been vacant since April, when former chairman Xiang Junbo was put under investigation for suspected  serious disciplinary violations,  a phrase that usually refers to graft. Yang, 58, is an associate of Wang Qishan, the current head of the Communist Party's CCDI, the country's main anti-graft body. Wang is also a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the country's top leadership body. Yang, a native of the eastern city of Nanjing, headed the Beijing financial affairs bureau from 2008 to 2013, and was the city's top auditor when Wang was mayor of Beijing. Yang was named the city's vice mayor in 2013.  Two of the sources described Yang as the  front runner  to head the insurance regulator. The CCDI did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Neither the CIRC nor the State Council Information Office, which doubles as the spokesman's office for the cabinet and the party, replied to faxed requests for comment.     Yang's appointment is not yet guaranteed. Senior leadership appointments in China can be subject to last-minute change. It was not immediately clear when an announcement would be made. FILE PHOTO: Xiang Junbo, chairman of China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), attends a news conference on the sidelines of the National People's Congress (NPC) in China's parliament, in Beijing, China March 12, 2016.Jason Lee/File PhotoNone of the sources was willing to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.     Slew of Arrests President Xi Jinping has undertaken a sweeping campaign against graft since assuming power in 2012. In recent months, officials have sharpened their focus on risky business practices in the banking and insurance sectors, announcing a slew of arrests, sanctions and new regulations.  Corruption in the financial sector should be resolutely investigated and punished,  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in a speech dated March 21 that was published in April, hours after Xiang's detention was announced. Those caught in the anti-graft net include Yang Jiacai, who was removed from his position as assistant chairman of the country's banking regulator, and Wang Yincheng, former vice chairman and president of state-controlled People's Insurance Co (Group) of China (1339.HK), whose case was referred for prosecution, according to the CCDI. Last month, Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group Co [ANBANG.UL], which has made a series of headline-grabbing acquisitions, including the 2015 purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, was detained by authorities. China's next insurance regulator will face the thorny task of clamping down on risk in a sector that has seen its assets nearly double to 15.1 trillion yuan ($2.22 trillion) in the three years ended in 2016. If it doesn't tread carefully it could destabilize the industry. In recent months, CIRC has issued new regulations and sanctioned a handful of insurers for issuing short-term, high-yield products after they used the proceeds to finance long-term investments, including taking sizable stakes in listed companies. Sales of so-called universal life insurance products dropped 59 percent year-on-year during the first five months of 2017, the CIRC reported in June. Others who have been under consideration for the top CIRC post include Zhou Mubing, chairman of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd (601288.SS)(1288.HK) and a former vice chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, financial industry sources said earlier this year.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 10 (Reuters) - There is a lot more riding on Tesla Inc's deal to install the world's largest grid-scale electric battery in Australia than whether Elon Musk can meet his bold commitment to finish within the 100-day deadline. Under an agreement made public on July 7, Tesla must deliver the 100 megawatt (MW) battery within 100 days of the contract being signed, or the government of South Australia state won't have to pay the electric car, clean energy and space exploration company. On the surface, this is a deal aimed at providing back-up electricity to South Australia, a state that has been plagued by blackouts since it closed coal-fired power plants and moved to being powered mainly by renewables such as wind, and to a grid connection to neighbouring Victoria state. Certainly, if successful, the 100 MW of Tesla lithium-ion batteries will be able to provide power to some 30,000 homes in South Australia, which is home to about 1.7 million people and ranks fifth by population of Australia's six states. But the significance of the deal goes way beyond the mere provision of emergency power, and it is likely to become a political football in Australia's wider energy debate. Broadly speaking, Australia's energy debate is becoming polarised into two factions, one in favour of using the nation's abundant coal as the main fuel, and the other committed to switching to mainly renewable sources of power as part of efforts to limit global climate change. While there are moderate voices in both camps urging a gradual and planned switch from the current situation where about 80 percent of the nation's power comes from ageing, polluting coal-fired plants, the more radical voices tend to grab the media headlines. Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister and leader of the National Party, poured scorn on the Tesla battery plan, saying it wouldn't make much difference.  You know, a grain of sugar is an advantage to a teaspoon, but it doesn't make a hell of a lot of difference,  Joyce, whose party is the junior partner in the ruling Liberal-led federal government, said in a television interview on Sunday. The problem for the federal government, and indeed the state governments as well, is that electricity prices, and public anger, are soaring. Consumers in the main population states of New South Wales and Victoria face increases of as much as 20 percent this year in electricity bills, caused by rising generation costs amid the closure of several old coal-fired power plants. The question is what will replace these polluting plants as they reach the end of their useful lifespans. Misleading Claims The mining lobby, and elements within the ruling coalition, want to build new generation coal-fired plants, claiming these will be cheaper and less polluting. The so-called high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) coal plants would be less polluting than Australia's current fleet, but even these are still far more carbon-intensive than natural-gas plants, not to mention renewables. The Minerals Council of Australia released a report on July 3 in which it claimed a  clean coal  HELE plant would provide cheaper electricity than renewables. While the costings in the report are open to challenge, what was potentially misleading was the claim that HELE plants are  clean coal . They are about 14 percent more efficient than older technology coal plants, but aren't clean insofar as they don't capture and store carbon emissions. This sort of claim certainly undermines the mining sector's credibility and helps boost the cause of the environmentalists. Sitting somewhere in the middle of the debate is Australia's petroleum industry, which has the dual aim of protecting its $200 billion of investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants and promoting the use of the cleaner-burning fuel domestically. The industry wants both federal and state governments to facilitate more onshore gas exploration and production, arguing that this will boost supply and lower costs. The environmental lobby, ignoring peer-reviewed science that fracking is largely safe if well regulated, wants an end to all unconventional and conventional natural gas exploration and production. At the very least, the environmentalists want restrictions on LNG exports in order to make natural gas cheaper and more available to the domestic market. Again, there is possibly misleading information and claims on both sides, with the industry stating that Australia's wholesale natural gas price is competitive in Asia (it is), but ignoring that retail prices have surged. For its part the environmental lobby, with the support of farming groups, is running a scare campaign on natural gas, using the typical bogeyman of greedy corporations sucking up and exporting resources, but ignoring that only one of the seven LNG plants actually buys gas that could be supplied domestically instead. Into this situation comes Tesla and its battery farm for South Australia. If the project does work, and more importantly is viewed by politicians and the public as a cost-effective success, then Barnaby Joyce may find that his one grain of sugar rapidly becomes many more. However, if the batteries don't prove effective in smoothing out South Australia's intermittent wind-powered electricity, then the move toward more renewables will take a blow, perhaps even big enough to allow the promoters of new coal plants an opportunity.

Loeb's Third Point hedge fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake in Nestle on June 25, making it the eighth-largest shareholder, urging the world's largest packaged food maker to more aggressively improve returns. Three days later, Nestle addressed some of the New York-based fund's points with a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritise acquisitions in some high-growth areas. Loeb met Nestle CEO Mark Schneider on June 2, the source said on Monday, adding that no other meetings were currently planned before a Sept. 26 investor seminar by the Swiss maker of Nescafe, Perrier and Gerber baby food. Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under Schneider, the first outside CEO in nearly a century, said the source, who declined to be identified. But it wants to see the company act with greater urgency, including by setting a margin growth target like peers including Unilever and Danone have recently done. Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, is doing well this year. It gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source. Nestle has not publicly addressed Loeb's call for it to sell its 23 percent stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal , which is worth about 23 billion euros ($26 billion). But behind closed doors, Nestle's board does not seem keen to divest the stake, which it has owned for more than four decades, the source said, confirming what other sources have previously told Reuters. Third Point, which has not yet commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter to shareholders due later this month, the source said, adding that its current plan of campaign was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company. Last month, Third Point said that it owned roughly 40 million Nestle shares in its funds and a special purpose vehicle raised especially for the move on the company. It started buying Nestle shares earlier this year when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said. The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed, but have since pared much of those gains. The stock was trading at 83.05 francs per share at 1012 GMT on Monday, up 1.5 percent.

A spokesman for BC Partners declined to disclose the price paid or the exact stake size taken in Pronovias. The company was founded in 1964 by Palatchi and its bridal and cocktail dresses are sold through nearly 4,000 retailers worldwide and its own 45 stores.

In separate revaluation statements, Harvest Fund Management Co Ltd, China Post & Capital Fund Management Co Ltd and E Fund Management Co Ltd said they expect shares of Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing to fall nearly 30 percent once investors get the chance to react to latest developments. Leshi could not be reached for comment. LeEco founder Jia Yueting resigned as chairman of Leshi on Thursday, hours after making a public plea for patience. He had previously said LeEco had grown too quickly from video streaming into consumer electronics and electric vehicles, leading to a cash crunch that has seen a court freeze some assets. Jia also resigned as Leshi's chief executive during the trading suspension, which Leshi requested from April 17 due to possible restructuring. On Friday, the firm said it would extend the suspension for as long as another three months. The revaluation illustrates the impact on investors of China's lengthy trading suspensions - a major concern of foreign investors.  One thing portfolio managers hate is suspension of trade,  Anthony Cragg, senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management and China veteran, told Reuters on Wednesday.  You can tolerate losing money, but you cannot tolerate not being able to trade. Suspending a stock is a big no-no.  Harvest Fund and China Post, both with heavy exposure to Leshi, in separate statements on Friday said they would adjust their valuation of Leshi shares to 22.37 yuan, 27 percent lower than their last pre-halt closing price of 30.68 yuan. E Fund on Friday said it would revalue Leshi shares at 22.05 yuan, or 28 percent lower. Other major investors included Dacheng Fund Management Co Ltd, Penghua Fund Management Co Ltd and Guangfa Fund Management Co, as per Leshi's first-quarter earnings report released at the end of April. In August, Harvest Fund, China Post and Caitong Fund Management Co Ltd bought 81.8 billion privately placed Leshi shares for 45.01 yuan apiece.

Worshipped by a billion Hindus and a water source for 400 million,  Mother Ganga  is dying, despite decades of government efforts to save it. Lokesh Sharma, a 19-year-old priest in Devprayag, a small hill town where two rivers converge to form the Ganges, is his family's fourth generation to lead riverbank prayers.  I never thought of going somewhere else and settling. Devprayag is a heaven for me. I feel blessed to be born next to Mother Ganges,  Sharma said, as chanting priests and devotees, some bottling the water, dunk themselves in the fast-flowing river. Thousands of Indians immerse themselves and idols of their gods every day, believing a dip in the Ganges absolves a lifetime of sins. People drink the water and use it for crops. But the pristine waters soon becomes a distant memory as the 2,525 km-long (1,570 mile) Ganges snakes its way down to the densely populated plains of north India, where too much water is sucked out to maintain a healthy flow.  Sliding under bridges in the industrial city of Kanpur, the water's color turns dark gray.  Industrial waste and sewage pour in from open drains, as clouds of foam float on its surface. At one stretch, the river turns red. Nearby, tannery workers haul chemical-soaked buffalo hides into huge drums. The filthy run-off is dumped in the river. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has pledged to build more treatment plants and move more than 400 tanneries away from the river, but his $3 billion clean-up plan is badly behind schedule.  A Hindu devotee holds up his clothes after taking a dip in the river Ganges in Devprayag, India, March 29, 2017.Danish SiddiquiLess than a quarter of an estimated 4,800 million liters of sewage that flow daily into the river from main towns and cities is treated. Pollution-Free Prayers  The sorry state of the Ganges is most keenly felt in Varanasi, the ancient and most holy of cities for Hindus.  Religious students practise yoga, pilgrims seek spiritual purification and families cremate their dead by the water's edge, scattering ashes so that souls go to heaven and escape the cycle of rebirth.  Slideshow (13 Images)Along the bathing ghats, prayers invoking followers to keep the Ganges clean fill the hot evening air.  I remember earlier the water was very clean and we could drink it,  said 58-year-old boatman Anil Sahni.  Now you can't even bathe in it.  As the river widens it curves southwards, towards the Bay of Bengal, passing thousands more villages and swelling cities. In the 14-million strong metropolis of Kolkata, people bathe and brush their teeth next to towering mounds of rubbish. On the outskirts, brick kilns and factories line the river banks. Downstream, a packed ferry sets off for Sagar Island, or Ganga Sagar, a magnet for Hindu pilgrims that marks the point where the Ganges meets the sea.  I feel sad about what's happening around us. The Ganges is getting dirty day by day but nobody cares. Not even its children,  said 66-year-old priest Ashok Kumar in Mirzapur, a riverside carpet and brass ware hub.    The Ganges is our mother. There won't be any future if she dies.  Click here for a photo essay reut.rs/2tYBlCR that depicts the pollution that has affected the holy Ganges river.

The sources acknowledged that European infrastructure data networks face regular attacks similar to those which the Washington Post newspaper said on Sunday had been launched by Russian government hackers against business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other companies involved in energy production. One former senior British security official said it was an  article of faith  that Russian government hackers were seeking to penetrate UK critical infrastructure though the official said he could not cite public case studies. A European security source acknowledged that UK authorities were aware of the latest reports about infrastructure hacking attempts and that British authorities were in regular contact with other governments over the attacks. UK authorities declined to comment on the extent of any such attempted or successful attacks in Britain or elsewhere in Europe or to discuss what possible security measures governments and infrastructure operators might be taking.  The Washington Post said recent attempted Russian hacking attacks on infrastructure related systems in the United States appeared to be an effort to  assess  such networks. But there was no evidence that hackers had actually penetrated or disrupted key systems controlling operations at nuclear plants. The Post cited several U.S. and industry officials saying that this was the first time hackers associated with the Russian government are known to have tried to get into US nuclear power companies.  The newspaper said that in late June the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the U.S. Homeland Security Department warned energy companies that unnamed foreign hackers were trying to steal login and password information so they could hack into networks. U.S. officials have acknowledged that many key computer systems which run critical infrastructure ranging from power grids to transportation networks originally were not built with strong security protection against outside hackers.  Security experts in the U.S. and Europe acknowledge that the development and evolution of security measures to protect critical infrastructure system against outside intruders has often run behind the ability of hackers to invent tools to get inside such systems.

White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told  Fox News Sunday  that Trump still expected the Senate to pass a healthcare bill either before the start of Congress' August recess  or maybe a little bit into  the recess. Trump made the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, a central plank of his 2016 campaign.  I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!  Trump said early Monday in a post on Twitter. Other Republicans were more pessimistic.  My view is that it's probably going to be dead,  Senator John McCain of Arizona said of the healthcare legislation on the CBS program  Face the Nation.  Some conservative senators, such as Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, have said they cannot support the proposal unless it goes further to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the signature legislation of President Barack Obama. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is weighing how to shore up support for the healthcare bill, which would repeal parts of Obamacare and eliminate the tax increases that fund it. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives in May passed its own version of a bill overhauling healthcare. Protests McConnell warned at a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky last week that if Republicans were unable to pass their own replacement bill, they might need to work with Democrats to bolster the insurance markets created under Obamacare, according to the Associated Press. During a week-long recess last week that coincided with the Fourth of July holiday, liberal groups organized town halls and protests and ran advertisements criticizing the proposal. Most Republican senators kept a low profile on the issue, including McCain, who traveled to Afghanistan to visit troops, and Senator Jeff Flake, a fellow Arizonan who faces a tough re-election fight next year. Last week, groups such as the state chapter of Planned Parenthood and Ability 360, an advocacy organization for disabled people, participated in events that spotlighted the Senate bill, including a town hall in Phoenix. At the Phoenix event, there were empty chairs on a stage with placards for McCain and Flake, who were invited but did not attend. Arizonans such as Rosemary Dixon, who had a kidney transplant in 2015 and worries about how she will pay for her medication, spoke about the potential impact of the legislation. Medicaid Cuts Republicans have long criticized Obamacare as ineffective and a government intrusion into a key sector of the economy. But opponents deride the Republican healthcare bill as a giveaway to wealthy Americans who would see some tax increases rolled back. Critics also warn the legislation would cause millions of poor and sick Americans to lose healthcare coverage. The Obamacare law expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, largely through an expansion of Medicaid, a government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Senators from states such as Ohio, Nevada and Arizona that expanded the Medicaid program under Obamacare are taking heat from Republican governors over the Senate bill’s proposal to phase out the expansion. In Arizona, for example, more than 400,000 have signed up for Medicaid since its expansion there and 1.9 million are now insured by the program. The Senate legislation would also drastically cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which assesses the impact of legislation, estimated 22 million people would lose health insurance over the next decade under the Senate bill. In a separate report, it found the proposal would cut government spending on Medicaid by 35 percent come 2036. The Senate bill is unpopular with voters. Just 24 percent of adults approved of the proposal, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll of 1,554 adults taken from July 2 to 6. McConnell can only lose two Republican votes on the bill, relying on Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tiebreaking vote. But McConnell must do so with an eye on the 2018 congressional elections, ensuring he does not imperil the party's narrow majority in the 100-seat Senate.

One of the world's biggest investors, Temasek [TEM.UL] is reshaping its strategy to focus on fast growing emerging sectors, while also beefing up its investment teams. It is the biggest investor in a third of companies in Singapore's benchmark index .STI. But its long-held investments in financials, such as China Construction Bank (0939.HK), DBS Group (DBSM.SI) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L), paid off last year as equity markets rebounded.  The most important listed equity markets for Temasek grew a lot last year,  said Javier Capapé, director at the Sovereign Wealth Lab research center at the IE Business School in Madrid. Temasek said it will share its performance next week for the year ended March 31, and offer views about the outlook. Analysts estimate its assets rose to a record last year after it fell by a fifth a year ago to S$242 billion ($175 billion), its first drop since 2009. Singapore and China represent the largest share in its portfolio by underlying exposure. Unlike many state investors, the majority of Temasek's investments are in equities. And while MSCI's Asia shares ex-Japan index .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 17 percent last year, DBS and StanChart soared 28 percent and 68 percent, respectively.  Markets have been kind to everybody last year, but are the gains sustainable?  asked Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking, who estimated Temasek's portfolio value rose between 12 percent and 15 percent last year. Despite a strong year, global sovereign investors face a challenge to boost long-term returns amid rich equity valuations and still low-yielding bonds.  In a low-growth, low-yield environment, long-term investors like sovereign wealth funds face greater challenges to make high enough returns to meet their mandates,  the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds' (IFSWF) investment practice committee said in a research note prepared with State Street Corp late last year. It said that many investors, including IFSWF members, were looking to private markets to generate higher long-term returns in the backdrop of low bond yields and as global equities look increasingly volatile or overvalued. GIC, Singapore's bigger state fund, which has warned of low returns over the next decade, reports results this month. Temasek's net portfolio value has nearly doubled over the last decade. It has been pouring more money into healthcare and life sciences and expanded its footprint in North America last year by opening its San Francisco office. The telecom, media and technology sector emerged as its biggest investment cluster in the year to March 2016 at 25 percent, overtaking financials for the first time in a decade.  The big news is the rebalancing in the long-run on tech and startups,  said Capapé, who highlighted Temasek's $800 million funding in Verily Life Sciences and investments in Innovent Biologics and Iora Health last year. Temasek also invested in Mexican tequila maker Jose Cuervo, paid S$1.2 billion to take full control of Singapore rail operator SMRT and raised its stake in Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (STEL.SI), its biggest stock holding. Divestments are picking up too. Temasek sold its S$2.3 billion stake in shipper Neptune Orient Lines. It pared its stakes in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) and China Construction Bank but is optimistic on the sector. Beyond investments, analysts highlight leadership succession as a near term challenge for Temasek, whose CEO Ho Ching has been at the helm for more than a decade. Ho, the wife of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, has recently come under criticism from Lee's younger siblings in a family feud that has gone public. [nL3N1JD2GK] The government has said Temasek's board looks at succession on an annual basis. Temasek has hired and promoted many finance and market professionals in recent years to build its leadership.

In separate revaluation statements, Harvest Fund Management Co Ltd, China Post & Capital Fund Management Co Ltd and E Fund Management Co Ltd said they expect shares of Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing to fall nearly 30 percent once investors get the chance to react to latest developments. Leshi could not be reached for comment. LeEco founder Jia Yueting resigned as chairman of Leshi on Thursday, hours after making a public plea for patience. He had previously said LeEco had grown too quickly from video streaming into consumer electronics and electric vehicles, leading to a cash crunch that has seen a court freeze some assets. Jia also resigned as Leshi's chief executive during the trading suspension, which Leshi requested from April 17 due to possible restructuring. On Friday, the firm said it would extend the suspension for as long as another three months. The revaluation illustrates the impact on investors of China's lengthy trading suspensions - a major concern of foreign investors.  One thing portfolio managers hate is suspension of trade,  Anthony Cragg, senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management and China veteran, told Reuters on Wednesday.  You can tolerate losing money, but you cannot tolerate not being able to trade. Suspending a stock is a big no-no.  Harvest Fund and China Post, both with heavy exposure to Leshi, in separate statements on Friday said they would adjust their valuation of Leshi shares to 22.37 yuan, 27 percent lower than their last pre-halt closing price of 30.68 yuan. E Fund on Friday said it would revalue Leshi shares at 22.05 yuan, or 28 percent lower. Other major investors included Dacheng Fund Management Co Ltd, Penghua Fund Management Co Ltd and Guangfa Fund Management Co, as per Leshi's first-quarter earnings report released at the end of April. In August, Harvest Fund, China Post and Caitong Fund Management Co Ltd bought 81.8 billion privately placed Leshi shares for 45.01 yuan apiece.

For now, unease about an end to an era of ultra-cheap money has given way to optimism about global growth, with Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report bolstering risk appetite. Data on Monday showed exports from Germany, Europe's biggest economy, rose more than expected in May . The pan-European STOXX 600 rallied 0.4 percent, with banks and utilities the strongest sectors. Blue-chip stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt climbed 0.2 to 0.5 percent. They followed gains in Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent and Japan's Nikkei gained 0.8 percent to a one-week high, helped by weakness in the Japanese currency. MSCI's emerging markets benchmark posted its best day in two weeks. U.S. stock futures  were largely flat after strong gains on Wall Street on Friday.  Stocks have opened higher at the start of this week, the dollar continues to bask in the glory of the stronger-than- expected non-farm payrolls data, and U.S. bond yields are approaching the key 2.4 percent level,  said Kathleen Brooks, research director with City Index in London.  This week is shaping up to be a critical one for data releases, central bank speak and earnings releases, and it could all add up to an important director of asset prices throughout the summer months.  The dollar rose almost 0.4 percent to 114.29 yen, a two-month peak, while the dollar index - which measures the dollar's value against a basket of other major currencies - was a touch firmer at 96.142. The euro was softer at $1.1388 . Oil prices declined, extending losses at the end of last week on the back of high drilling activity in the United States and ample supplies from OPEC and non-OPEC nations. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $46.27 per barrel, down 50 cents, or around 1 percent, from their last close. Central Banks in Spotlight A generally more hawkish tone from the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Canada in the past two weeks have boosted market expectations that central bank policy is at a turning point. The U.S. Federal Reserve has lifted rates twice this year and is seen tightening again by the end of the year. The Bank of Japan on Monday offered its most optimistic view of the country's regional economies in more than a decade on solid exports and private consumption, underscoring its conviction a steady recovery is gathering momentum. But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated his resolve to maintain ultra-loose monetary policy until inflation is stably above its 2 percent target.  Unlike in recent years, where there was very patchy growth across the world, we are seeing a synchronized upswing in the global economy,  said Alex Dryden, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  So while it may not be coordinated communication, I do think there's been a change in rhetoric from central banks across the world -- though the ECB is the central bank to watch in the second half of the year.  The brighter economic outlook and expectations for tighter monetary policies pushed gold prices to their lowest since mid-March at $1,204.45 an ounce. Markets expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates on Wednesday. Such a move would be its first increase in nearly seven years. The Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg over the weekend did not have much impact on markets on Monday .

Greece, under pressure by EU lenders to conclude the sale as it has earmarked about 180 million euros of the proceeds in this year's budget, relaunched the tender in June after a 400 million euro deal with Azerbaijan state oil company SOCAR fell through over gas tariffs among other issues.  We anticipate that the price will be the same or even bigger (compared with the previous tender),  Stathakis said in the interview published on Monday. It has set a July 24 deadline for potential investors to submit initial expressions of interest. Greece's privatisation agency HRADF owns 65 percent of DESFA and the country's biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum the rest. The country wants to promote itself as a European hub for the transit of gas from Asia and the eastern Mediterranean to Europe. It has launched a plan to find more oil and gas, spurred on by its protracted financial crisis and encouraged by recent large gas finds offshore Israel and Cyprus. Stathakis said Greece could start earning the proceeds from offshore exploration around 2025. Hellenic Petroleum and the country's sole oil producer, Energean, have secured licences to look for hydrocarbons in western Greece. Oil majors Total and ExxonMobil have also applied for oil and gas exploration licences off the island of Crete.

The automaker said it was  inconceivable  that mid-size sedans would disappear from the market, and that any move by its rivals to stop selling what was once among the most popular vehicles would allow Toyota to boost its presence. Slideshow (6 Images)Cheap U.S. gasoline prices have prompted drivers to opt for larger SUVs and pick-up trucks. Automakers have been scrambling to meet this growing demand and, as a result, sedans have been losing their share of the U.S. market for new car sales - at 38 percent now versus around 44 percent in 2015.  If other automakers left the sedan market to focus more on SUVs, that would be an opportunity to expand our market share of the segment,  Camry's chief engineer, Masato Katsumata, said at the launch of the latest Camry model in Japan. Sedans and smaller models are a key U.S. sales segment for Toyota. In the first half of 2017, they accounted for about 43.5 percent of Toyota's total sales, versus 48.6 percent a year ago.  Toyota is targeting monthly U.S. sales of 30,000 Camrys after the new model goes on sale in August.  In June, it sold 29,463 units of the current Camry model in the United States, down 9.5 percent from a year ago.  Sedans are not a growth segment these days, but we want the new Camry to rehabilitate the segment,  said Moritaka Yoshida, president of Toyota's in-house mid-size vehicle company.

One of the world's biggest investors, Temasek [TEM.UL] is reshaping its strategy to focus on fast growing emerging sectors, while also beefing up its investment teams. It is the biggest investor in a third of companies in Singapore's benchmark index .STI. But its long-held investments in financials, such as China Construction Bank (0939.HK), DBS Group (DBSM.SI) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L), paid off last year as equity markets rebounded.  The most important listed equity markets for Temasek grew a lot last year,  said Javier Capapé, director at the Sovereign Wealth Lab research center at the IE Business School in Madrid. Temasek said it will share its performance next week for the year ended March 31, and offer views about the outlook. Analysts estimate its assets rose to a record last year after it fell by a fifth a year ago to S$242 billion ($175 billion), its first drop since 2009. Singapore and China represent the largest share in its portfolio by underlying exposure. Unlike many state investors, the majority of Temasek's investments are in equities. And while MSCI's Asia shares ex-Japan index .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 17 percent last year, DBS and StanChart soared 28 percent and 68 percent, respectively.  Markets have been kind to everybody last year, but are the gains sustainable?  asked Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking, who estimated Temasek's portfolio value rose between 12 percent and 15 percent last year. Despite a strong year, global sovereign investors face a challenge to boost long-term returns amid rich equity valuations and still low-yielding bonds.  In a low-growth, low-yield environment, long-term investors like sovereign wealth funds face greater challenges to make high enough returns to meet their mandates,  the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds' (IFSWF) investment practice committee said in a research note prepared with State Street Corp late last year. It said that many investors, including IFSWF members, were looking to private markets to generate higher long-term returns in the backdrop of low bond yields and as global equities look increasingly volatile or overvalued. GIC, Singapore's bigger state fund, which has warned of low returns over the next decade, reports results this month. Temasek's net portfolio value has nearly doubled over the last decade. It has been pouring more money into healthcare and life sciences and expanded its footprint in North America last year by opening its San Francisco office. The telecom, media and technology sector emerged as its biggest investment cluster in the year to March 2016 at 25 percent, overtaking financials for the first time in a decade.  The big news is the rebalancing in the long-run on tech and startups,  said Capapé, who highlighted Temasek's $800 million funding in Verily Life Sciences and investments in Innovent Biologics and Iora Health last year. Temasek also invested in Mexican tequila maker Jose Cuervo, paid S$1.2 billion to take full control of Singapore rail operator SMRT and raised its stake in Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (STEL.SI), its biggest stock holding. Divestments are picking up too. Temasek sold its S$2.3 billion stake in shipper Neptune Orient Lines. It pared its stakes in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1398.HK) and China Construction Bank but is optimistic on the sector. Beyond investments, analysts highlight leadership succession as a near term challenge for Temasek, whose CEO Ho Ching has been at the helm for more than a decade. Ho, the wife of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, has recently come under criticism from Lee's younger siblings in a family feud that has gone public. [nL3N1JD2GK] The government has said Temasek's board looks at succession on an annual basis. Temasek has hired and promoted many finance and market professionals in recent years to build its leadership.

Kashkari said the recent rescue of three Italian banks showed that bondholders are often not called on to rescue banks, despite rules put in place for that to happen.  There’s no need for more evidence: 'bail-in debt' doesn’t prevent bailouts. It’s time to admit this and move to a simpler solution that will work: more common equity,  Kashkari said in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal. Being able to bail-in debt was seen as the solution to  too big to fail . The plan is that when a bank runs into trouble, regulators trigger a conversion of debt to equity and bondholders would take the losses. The bank would be recapitalised and taxpayers would be spared. But Kashkari said the bailouts of Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca in recent weeks proved it doesn't work. The only recent case in which taxpayers were spared was the failure last month of Banco Popular in Spain. Kashkari, who has previously worked at Goldman Sachs, Pimco and held senior positions in the US Treasury, has for some time called for banks to hold more capital. He said bailing in bondholders rarely works in real life. In Italy, that was because bondholders were retail investors.  Regulators claimed that this was a unique circumstance, but there always seem to be unique circumstances when bailouts are concerned,  Kashkari said. He added:  If bail-in debt couldn’t protect taxpayers from a midsize bank failure when the global economy is stable, what are the odds it will work if a Wall Street giant runs into trouble when the economy looks shaky?  This is one more reminder that only equity can be counted on to protect taxpayers - and it needs to be raised in advance of economic distress.  He said large banks need to be able to withstand losses of around 20%, according to a 2015 analysis by the Federal Reserve. Although banks have increased capital buffers, they still only have about half that amount in equity because regulators assume bondholders will take losses.  Italy demonstrates that this is wishful thinking. Too big to fail is alive and well, and taxpayers are on the hook,  Kashkari said.

Connie Yates, whose 11-month-old son Charlie Gard suffers from a form of mitochondrial disease, a rare genetic condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage, wants him to be sent to the United States for experimental therapy. After losing an earlier ruling, her son's case will return to the High Court on Monday, which Yates said was thanks to the high-profile support of Trump and the Pope. Asked about the impact of their support , Yates said:  It's saved his life so far.   It turned it into an international issue, a lot of people are outraged by what's going on. You know we've got new evidence now so I hope that the judge changes his mind,  Yates told BBC radio. Yates and her husband, Chris Gard, lost a legal battle to take their son to the United States for the experimental therapy at the end of last month when the European Court of Human Rights upheld the British court's decision that the trip would cause him unnecessary suffering. It ruled the children's hospital could turn off his life support. On Friday, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, where Charlie is being cared for, said it wanted the court to hear new evidence relating to the case,  in light of fresh evidence concerning potential treatment.  Charlie's parents want their son to be allowed to try a new treatment called nucleoside therapy which they believe has helped others with similar problems.  There's 18 children currently on the medication, they all have mitochondrial syndrome as well as Charlie. Theirs is caused by a slightly different gene. They're all getting stronger,  Yates said. While fresh evidence was due to be heard on Monday a decision is not expected until Thursday.

The automaker said it was  inconceivable  that mid-size sedans would disappear from the market, and that any move by its rivals to stop selling what was once among the most popular vehicles would allow Toyota to boost its presence. Slideshow (6 Images)Cheap U.S. gasoline prices have prompted drivers to opt for larger SUVs and pick-up trucks. Automakers have been scrambling to meet this growing demand and, as a result, sedans have been losing their share of the U.S. market for new car sales - at 38 percent now versus around 44 percent in 2015.  If other automakers left the sedan market to focus more on SUVs, that would be an opportunity to expand our market share of the segment,  Camry's chief engineer, Masato Katsumata, said at the launch of the latest Camry model in Japan. Sedans and smaller models are a key U.S. sales segment for Toyota. In the first half of 2017, they accounted for about 43.5 percent of Toyota's total sales, versus 48.6 percent a year ago.  Toyota is targeting monthly U.S. sales of 30,000 Camrys after the new model goes on sale in August.  In June, it sold 29,463 units of the current Camry model in the United States, down 9.5 percent from a year ago.  Sedans are not a growth segment these days, but we want the new Camry to rehabilitate the segment,  said Moritaka Yoshida, president of Toyota's in-house mid-size vehicle company.

São Paulo state Governor Geraldo Alckmin, a senior PSDB leader and a presidential hopeful, told Estado that there was no reason to participate in the government after reforms are voted through. Temer is spearheading a series of deficit-cutting reforms such as an overhaul of Brazil's labor and pension codes. Slideshow (4 Images)His remarks come as other PSDB leaders meet later in the day to discuss the party's stance on the Temer government, Estado said. Senators are expected to cast ballots on the labor code reform at a plenary vote on Tuesday. Support for Temer has dwindled after Prosecutor-general Rodrigo Janot charged him late last month in connection to a massive corruption scandal. Temer has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Efforts to contact Alckmin's and Temer's a media offices before working hours were unsucessful.  The labor reform bill, the first major overhaul of labor rules in seven decades, has already been approved by the lower house. Trade unions say Temer's plan calls for more temporary work contracts and outsourcing, while weakening their power by eliminating mandatory union dues and other measures.

Sam Woods, who is in charge of the BoE's day-to-day regulation of banks and insurers, said fixed rules could never keep up with financial market innovation, and that the central bank also expected firms to respect broader principles designed to reduce risk.  Some innovation is pure regulatory arbitrage - that is, action taken by firms to reduce specific regulatory requirements without any commensurate reduction in their risk,  Woods said. His remarks were originally intended for a conference of Britain's Building Society Association in May, but the BoE delayed publication until Monday to avoid clashing with campaigning for June's parliamentary election. Last week the BoE said it would take a tougher approach towards banks over their booming lending to consumers, ordering them to apply credit rules prudently and prove by September they are not being too complacent about risks. Woods said there were several areas where he had particular concerns that financial firms were trying to get around rules. These included borrowing that did not appear on firms' balance sheets, the accounting treatment of liquid assets, and insurers' sales of certain savings products. Shrinking net interest margins at building societies in the face of greater competition were also a worry, Woods said, as they could spur lenders to take on too much risk. Something similar took place in the run-up to the 2007-09 financial crisis, Woods said. One concerning trend was the increased number of mortgages issued for 35 years, not 25, he added.  As survivors, (building) societies here today ought to be well aware of the warning signs, but I'm conscious that corporate memories can be shed surprisingly fast,  Woods said.

Russia denies allegations from governments and intelligence services that it is behind a growing number of cyber attacks on commercial and political targets around the world, including the hackings of recent U.S. and French presidential election campaigns. Asked if the Russian authorities were a threat to the democratic process, Robert Hannigan, who stepped down as head of the UK's intelligence service in March, said:  Yes ... There is a disproportionate amount of mayhem in cyberspace coming from Russia from state activity.  In his first interview since leaving GCHQ, Hannigan told BBC radio that it was positive that French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had publicly  called this out recently . Standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin in May, Macron said state-funded Russian news outlets had sought to destabilize his campaign while the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency said last week it was expecting Russia to try to influence the German election in September.  Ultimately people will have to push back against Russian state activity and show that it's unacceptable,  he said.  It doesn't have to be by cyber retaliation, but it may be that is necessary at some time in the future. It may be  sanctions and other measures, just to put down some red lines and say that this behavior is unacceptable.  Hannigan also said it would be a mistake  to force social media companies to allow intelligence agencies to access services protected by encryption through so-called  back door  access.  The best you can do with end-to-end encryption is work with companies in a cooperative way to find ways around it frankly,  he said. He said such  back doors  would weaken systems. Hannigan also said governments should wait to see how a global working group on tackling online extremism established by Facebook (FB.O), Google's YouTube (GOOGL.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) performed before seeking new laws.  Legislation is a blunt last resort because frankly extremism is very difficult to define in law and you could spend all your time in court arguing about whether a particular video crosses the line or not,  he said. Last month, Germany approved a plan to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($57 million) if they failed to remove hateful postings promptly. Britain has also mooted bringing in possible sanctions for tech firms that failed to remove extremist content.

Sam Woods, who is in charge of the BoE's day-to-day regulation of banks and insurers, said fixed rules could never keep up with financial market innovation, and that the central bank also expected firms to respect broader principles designed to reduce risk.  Some innovation is pure regulatory arbitrage - that is, action taken by firms to reduce specific regulatory requirements without any commensurate reduction in their risk,  Woods said. His remarks were originally intended for a conference of Britain's Building Society Association in May, but the BoE delayed publication until Monday to avoid clashing with campaigning for June's parliamentary election. Last week the BoE said it would take a tougher approach towards banks over their booming lending to consumers, ordering them to apply credit rules prudently and prove by September they are not being too complacent about risks. Woods said there were several areas where he had particular concerns that financial firms were trying to get around rules. These included borrowing that did not appear on firms' balance sheets, the accounting treatment of liquid assets, and insurers' sales of certain savings products. Shrinking net interest margins at building societies in the face of greater competition were also a worry, Woods said, as they could spur lenders to take on too much risk. Something similar took place in the run-up to the 2007-09 financial crisis, Woods said. One concerning trend was the increased number of mortgages issued for 35 years, not 25, he added.  As survivors, (building) societies here today ought to be well aware of the warning signs, but I'm conscious that corporate memories can be shed surprisingly fast,  Woods said.

Amnesty Secretary General Salil Shetty was in Hamburg to lobby G20 leaders to help secure the release of the pair, who are among thousands detained in a crackdown that followed a failed coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last year.  The country is in a serious human rights crisis,  Shetty said.  It is impossible for the G20 on the one hand to say it upholds values of democracy and free speech and on the other ignore blatant violations of human rights.  Shetty said Erdogan, who is attending the summit of the world's 20 largest economies, was one of a new breed of  hyper-nationalist  democratically elected authoritarians who use repressive measures to boost their popularity at home.  We've had dictatorships before, but in the case of Turkey, (Prime Minister Viktor) Orban in Hungary or (President Rodrigo) Duterte in the Philippines, these are legitimately elected leaders, so we are in a different space now.  All three leaders, who have won national elections in polls that independent observers have judged as flawed but broadly fair, have vehemently denied widespread accusations of authoritarianism.  There are hyper-nationalist countries where they take measures and the domestic support increases,  he said.  The global system is challenged by this: free press, rule of law, the things we've taken for granted for 50 years.  Idil Eser, Amnesty's Turkey director, was arrested on Wednesday along with several other activists.  Her detention came less than a month after a court ordered the arrest of the chairman of the branch, Taner Kilic. They are accused of links to the  terrorist organization  on which Ankara blames the July 2016 coup attempt. Most western countries have criticized Turkey's crackdown, with many saying Erdogan is using it as an excuse to rid himself of domestic opponents wholesale. But responses have been muted, since Turkey plays a crucial buffer role preventing a destabilizing flood of Syrian refugees from reaching Europe.  The Syrian refugee situation has really compromised EU leaders,  Shetty said.  He's getting away with it.  Erdogan was himself the subject of an Amnesty human rights campaign when, as mayor of Istanbul in 1998, he upset authorities by publicly reading a poem and was detained. Amnesty campaigned for his release. Reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Helen Popper","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-germany-rights-turkey-idUSKBN19T0UM"},

A senior official of the air traffic control department and an airline duty manager have been arrested in connection with the matter, Xinhua said. Chinese-born Guo, now based in New York, has unleashed a torrent of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials and is facing multiple lawsuits in a number of different jurisdictions. Chinese authorities have retaliated with stepped up attempts over the past few months to discredit Guo. Following a request from Beijing, Interpol issued a  red notice  for Guo in April. A red notice is an international alert for a wanted person. Xinhua said Guo had, through a senior civil aviation official, Song Jun, obtained the private information on 146 clients of the HNA group, including flight times, destinations and flight numbers in order to spread and fabricate what it called  corruption  and  sexual  stories. Song, a senior staff member of the civil aviation air traffic control department, had now been arrested by authorities on alleged private data violations, along with an airline duty manager, Xinhua cited the police as saying. It wasn't clear in the article if Song had received payment from Guo, though it claimed Guo had offered benefits to Song including the use of a rental apartment in Hong Kong, as well as a high credit limit payment card for purchases. The HNA Group declined to comment. An assistant of Guo did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.      Writing in his Twitter account, Guo didn't appear to specifically address the allegations in the Xinhua article, but he said the news agency had  helped ... a lot .   I really hope Xinhua will disclose more information . Guo has previously denounced Chinese authorities for attempting to smear him as a criminal and to silence him. In New York, Guo faces a defamation lawsuit from the HNA Group, which said Guo had injured HNA's  business reputation arising from repeated false and defamatory statements . The summons, seen by Reuters, cites allegations made by Guo that  officials in China's Communist Party and their relatives are undisclosed shareholders  in the group, and that subsidiary Hainan Airlines had allowed government officials and their relatives to use its aircraft  for purely personal reasons . Guo has mainly lived in the United States since leaving China two years ago after what he says was a business dispute with relatives of a retired top Communist Party official.

The Export Promotion Bureau said on Monday total exports in the 12 months ended June 30 were $34.8 billion, or 5.85 percent below the target of $37 billion. The annual percentage gain was the smallest since 2001/2002 financial year, when exports contracted as there was a downturn in the global economy. Readymade garments, comprising knitwear and woven items, earned $28.15 billion in the year ended June 30. That was 7.34 percent below the target. Garments are a key foreign-exchange earner for the South Asian nation, whose low wages and duty-free access to Western markets have helped make it the world's second largest apparel exporter after China. But the industry, which supplies many Western brands, came under scrutiny after a string of fatal factory accidents, including a 2013 building collapse that killed more than 1,130 people. Exporters blamed the lacklustre growth on a number of factors, including sluggish demand in the key markets, structural reforms in the garment sector, a weak euro and appreciation of local currency against the U.S. dollar.

With around 5,000 employees based in London, UBS is reviewing where it might move jobs which require access to the EU.  I think Frankfurt is a location of choice. There are different, other locations that could come into consideration,  Ermotti said in the interview broadcast on Monday, according to a transcript.    I think about Amsterdam, I think about Madrid ... As we speak, we are narrowing down really the options.  UBS will make a decision by the end of the summer or the early part of the fourth quarter, Ermotti said. Financial services firms need a regulated subsidiary in an EU country to offer products across the bloc which means some are looking to move jobs out of Britain if it loses access to the European single market.  Frankfurt has been mooted as a possible destination for UBS jobs that move from London because last year it set up a bank there to consolidate most of its European wealth management operations. FILE PHOTO - The offices of Swiss bank UBS are seen in the financial district of the City of London October 31, 2012.Chris HelgrenBut other European cities, including Madrid and Amsterdam, are competing to attract bankers if they move from London.   Ermotti also said clients at UBS's flagship wealth management division have shown a greater willingness to invest more of their money in the last five months.  It's clear if I look at the cash balances as a percentage of wealth we manage, they have been coming down from the high-20s to around the mid-20s,  he said.  So this is clearly a sign that people are willing to invest more, but still very cautious.  In the United States, Ermotti said optimism surrounding the Trump administration had diminished since the start of the year.   People do still believe that we will see some positive news from the new administration,  he said.  But the goodwill is eroding very fast and people want to see concrete actions before engaging in M&A;, before engaging into major discussions in respect of strategic moves.

The UK broadband provider’s founder and largest shareholder Charles Dunstone wants to grow the business by focusing on value for money. That’s risky in a competitive market, and endangers profitability. The alternative – finding a buyer – could be tricky given the company’s rich valuation. Dunstone’s growth-at-all-costs plan is bold but is arguably the only option for the 1.8 billion pound telecoms operator after losing a net 49,000 broadband customers in the full year ending March 31 2017. Low margins, intense competition and a recent dividend cut mean there’s little else to tempt investors. Markets are giving Dunstone some credit for this, with TalkTalk’s forward price-earnings ratio rising from around 13 at the start of May to more than 15 now.  Growing amid increasing competitive pressures, however, could prove an impossible task. Peers such as BT offer their own low-cost brands like Plusnet, and TalkTalk’s price-sensitive customers could be lured away if rivals offer similarly pitched packages. A recent survey of broadband customers by Berenberg analysts ranked TalkTalk ninth out of nine providers, scoring it poorly for risk of subscriber loss, network quality, customer service and endorsements. Dunstone has so far opted for greater pricing certainty for customers rather than an outright cut, but even on this strategy the EBITDA margin looks set to suffer. Analysts polled by Reuters expect it to fall to 15.4 percent next year from 17 percent, partly because of a step-up in efforts to win subscribers. As a backup plan, TalkTalk could seek a buyer, although that looks difficult at the current price. Add in TalkTalk’s 782 million pounds of net debt and the purchase price would be 2.6 billion pounds. Even without a takeover premium, that values each TalkTalk customer at 660 pounds, which seems hard to justify given high churn rates.  Even if a buyer found cost savings equal to half of TalkTalk’s forecast 2018 operating profit, the return on investment would be below 7 percent, according to Breakingviews calculations assuming a 20 percent tax rate. Dunstone’s broadband may be good value for money; his company currently isn’t.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The reason, she explained, was that no one could tolerate the terrible smell and leakages of urine and faeces caused by obstetric fistula, an agonizing childbirth injury which Amina, now aged 20, developed when she had her baby in her early teens.  But not going to the mosque was the least of her problems.  A refugee from Central African Republic who fled marauding gangs and highway henchmen as a 10-year-old with her nomad parents, Amina was married off by her family aged just 13. “It was a forced marriage. They wanted me to marry quickly, though I didn’t want to,” she said quietly. After her fistula developed, her husband told her to go and live with her aunt, as her parents were on the move.  “He did not visit me even once,” she said.   After a few months, her aunt also kicked Amina out of her home, leaving her to fend for herself in the refugee camp. Suicide by Starving Obstetric fistula is a hole that develops between the birth canal and bladder or rectum, caused by prolonged, obstructed labor, leaving women leaking urine, faeces or both.  Girls who fall pregnant at a young age are particularly susceptible, as their bodies may not be mature enough to cope with the physical strain of bearing a child. The social consequences are often severe. Girls and women are unable to work, becoming isolated and abandoned by their husbands, relatives and children, publicly shamed and even driven from their homes.  Instead of getting support and medical help - which is often too far away, too expensive or simply unavailable - many are dubbed witches and shunned.  Some commit suicide. Others do it slowly, starving themselves to death in a desperate bid to stop the leaking. In Cameroon, every year around 2,000 women develop fistula, an average rate of more than 5 new cases each day, said Jean Pierre Tsafack, a health expert with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). But a new program launched this week in eastern Cameroon, funded by the UNFPA and Fondation Orange, the philanthropic arm of the telecoms firm Orange, is offering free surgery to heal fistula victims and help them rebuild their lives. The program in Batouri is the second such initiative in the country’s East Region, and aims to provide operations for 120 women over two years. In addition, more than 600 women have been successfully treated at the fistula repair center in Ngaoundéré, the capital of Cameroon's Adamawa region, set up in 2013 with UNFPA support. “After the operation, the women are completely transformed,” said Joseph Réné Boum, head of the UNFPA office in Bertoua in east Cameroon. “They become beautiful, smiling - they start their lives again.” Business Training Yet the fistula surgery is only the first step to recovery. The UNFPA also runs reintegration programs for survivors, said Angelique Dikoume, a gender specialist with the agency. First a series of conversations is held with the woman's family and heath workers who explain exactly what fistula is, how it happened - and how it may be prevented from reoccurring.  “We can advise families on contraceptive methods, and we also explain to the husband that after the operation, the woman shouldn’t have sex for six months, in order to allow the healing to take place,” said Dikoume. On Tuesday, policymakers, donors and advocates will gather in London for a family planning summit that will discuss ways to reach an international goal to provide 120 million more women and girls with access to modern contraception by 2020. The second part of the Cameroon program is economic support for women and girls to identify business opportunities and provide vocational training. “Re-integration is very difficult as it often means starting again from zero,” said community health worker Marie Sebo. “Many women start by doing some farming, to keep malnutrition at bay.” Fifty-year-old widow Sophie Makoro suffered with fistula for a decade - which not only isolated her socially, but also cut off her only source of income selling vegetables at the market.   “People refused to buy anything off me. They were scared of me because of the smell,” she said. To make ends meet, she would sell her crops to neighbors. “That was the only way people would buy my goods,” she said. Now, after surgery, she plans to expand her farm. But she is also anxious about the challenges ahead as she gets older.  “I don’t have anyone to support me - no husband, no children. I rely only on myself,” she said. Hospital Ship More free fistula operations are planned for Cameroon.  In September, the world's largest civilian floating hospital, run by international faith-based group Mercy Ships, is due to arrive in the port city of Douala to carry out thousands of critical treatments, including 500 fistula operations. But UNFPA Cameroon head Barbara Sow is also seeking longer-term solutions, such as establishing a foundation for the treatment of obstetric fistula nationwide.  It's so easy to do - to change the life of a woman.  After Amina was abandoned by her husband and her aunt, Aya, a woman in her 60s and a fellow refugee from Central African Republic, met the teenager wandering alone in a camp and took her in to live with her and her daughter. “Why? Because I’m a mother,” she shrugged, holding Amina's hand. Until now, Amina has been home-bound, cooking, while Aya's daughter sells water in plastic bottles collected by her mother. “That’s how we get by,” Aya explained, clutching a bag of empty bottles she had just gathered at the hospital.  Now that she is recovering, Amina hopes to start her own business. “I want to sell clothes,” she said. Asked if she would go back to her husband, Amina laughed, shaking her finger. “No way,” she exclaimed. “Never! Never!” “I will make new friends and start again,” she said.

At least 15 House and Senate Republicans broke with first-term Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on Thursday and joined with Democrats to override Rauner's vetoes of the state's first budget package in more than two years. The $36 billion spending plan relies on a $5 billion tax increase that permanently hikes the flat personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent, up 32 percent from its prior 3.75 percent rate. To address the state's nearly $15 billion in unpaid bills, Illinois depends heavily on borrowing. Lawmakers approved $6 billion of 12-year bonds to raise money for repayments. But State Representative Greg Harris, the House Democrats' point person on the budget, has acknowledged there is only enough revenue to support half of that borrowing amount. Illinois will also borrow up to $1.2 billion from various state accounts that have accumulated cash for specific purposes, while  sweeping  cash from other accounts --a government version of looking under couch cushions that is expected to yield $300 million. Illinois' $130 billion pension liability is one of the largest in the nation, and the new budget takes only small steps to address the structural underfunding of Illinois' five retirement systems. The new law gives the state five years to phase in changes retroactive to fiscal 2014 in actuarial or investment return assumptions made by the pension systems for an estimated savings of $892.1 million. Seemingly small changes in projected investment results can have significant impact on a pension fund's actuarial calculations. Last year, when the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System reduced its earnings assumption to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, the change caused a $660 million spike in the state's fiscal 2018 contribution. The new budget attributes $500 million in savings to the creation of a new tier of pension beneficiaries. But that tier applies largely to newly hired employees, raising questions about how the state expects to book that savings in the current fiscal year. That estimate was lifted straight from the proposed budget presented by Rauner earlier this year. The projection has not been independently verified by legislative leaders, and Rauner's office has not responded to requests for an explanation of how the estimate was calculated. The Illinois Education Association, one of the state's largest unions, said it has no evidence that its pensioners would be harmed by the new budget's pension provisions. But the union questioned why lawmakers approved structural changes to pensions without an independent financial analysis.  It's a little bit of a shot in the dark. For something this major, you'd think the legislators who are voting on this would want to know this information,  said Jim Reed, the union's government relations director. A budget was welcomed as a positive step for Illinois, which still faces fiscal and pension crises.  The pension pressures will continue, and Illinois' financial challenges will continue, but at least there will be a framework to recognize there's a limit to the liability growth to this state,  said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a budget watchdog group. Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank, said the fixes in the new budget do not match up to the challenges faced by Illinois.  This is the kind of budget you would pass if you were a state that hit a bump in the road and had a deficit you needed to get rid of over the next two or three years,  he said.  It's not the kind of budget you'd pass if you have $14 billion in unpaid bills and a $130 billion unfunded (pension) liability.  The Democrats and Republicans who voted for the budget did so at least in part to prevent Illinois from becoming the first U.S. state in history to see its credit rating fall to  junk  status. Moody's on Wednesday put Illinois on review for a possible downgrade, but some of the state's bonds traded higher on Friday, an apparent sign of optimism about the budget.

A senior official of the air traffic control department and an airline duty manager have been arrested in connection with the matter, Xinhua said. Chinese-born Guo, now based in New York, has unleashed a torrent of corruption allegations against high-level Communist Party officials and is facing multiple lawsuits in a number of different jurisdictions. Chinese authorities have retaliated with stepped up attempts over the past few months to discredit Guo. Following a request from Beijing, Interpol issued a  red notice  for Guo in April. A red notice is an international alert for a wanted person. Xinhua said Guo had, through a senior civil aviation official, Song Jun, obtained the private information on 146 clients of the HNA group, including flight times, destinations and flight numbers in order to spread and fabricate what it called  corruption  and  sexual  stories. Song, a senior staff member of the civil aviation air traffic control department, had now been arrested by authorities on alleged private data violations, along with an airline duty manager, Xinhua cited the police as saying. It wasn't clear in the article if Song had received payment from Guo, though it claimed Guo had offered benefits to Song including the use of a rental apartment in Hong Kong, as well as a high credit limit payment card for purchases. The HNA Group declined to comment. An assistant of Guo did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.      Writing in his Twitter account, Guo didn't appear to specifically address the allegations in the Xinhua article, but he said the news agency had  helped ... a lot .   I really hope Xinhua will disclose more information . Guo has previously denounced Chinese authorities for attempting to smear him as a criminal and to silence him. In New York, Guo faces a defamation lawsuit from the HNA Group, which said Guo had injured HNA's  business reputation arising from repeated false and defamatory statements . The summons, seen by Reuters, cites allegations made by Guo that  officials in China's Communist Party and their relatives are undisclosed shareholders  in the group, and that subsidiary Hainan Airlines had allowed government officials and their relatives to use its aircraft  for purely personal reasons . Guo has mainly lived in the United States since leaving China two years ago after what he says was a business dispute with relatives of a retired top Communist Party official.

Three weeks after the June 14 fire, neither the two companies involved in the cladding on the Grenfell Tower nor the local authority which enforces the building codes have addressed questions from Reuters about whether that test was ever conducted and its outcome. The test is required to show whether both materials when used together were sufficiently resistant to combustion. Without proof that it had been carried out, the cladding system would not have met building regulations. The cladding work carried about by Rydon Group Ltd, the main contractor on the 2014-2016 refurbishment of the building, and its subcontractor Harley Facades involved attaching insulation boards to the tower's concrete facade and covering them with aluminum composite panels. France's Saint Gobain said the insulation used was its brand of polyisocyanurate (PIR) called Celotex RS5000. The aluminum panels, which had a polyethylene plastic core were called Reynobond PE, and made by New York-based Arconic Inc, previously known as Alcoa Inc. If all the elements of the insulation system had achieved a separate and demanding government standard called  limited combustibility , in separate tests, then a combined test would not have been necessary, according to the building regulations. But Reynobond PE and Celotex did not meet the combustibility test by themselves, according to safety experts and product specifications published by the manufacturers. This meant that the two materials combined would need to pass another test known as the BS 8414 test, according to the building regulations. This involves setting a fire under a three-storey mock-up of the proposed wall construction. Both standards, set out in the guidelines to the building code, aim to prevent a fire spreading quickly from inside and up the exterior walls, something that happened at Grenfell Tower. In a June 29 email, a spokeswoman for Rydon Group Ltd says it “met all building regulations” but did not say if the BS 8414 test stipulated in the building codes had been conducted. The building control department of the local Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council (RBKC), which is responsible for checking that the building and plans are consistent with regulations, declined to say if it had checked the tests had been carried out. Police think the cladding system at Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of last month's fatal fire. They have said they are investigating possible criminal behavior and the role of all the companies involved in the building. The Department for Communities and Local Government, the government department which is responsible for setting the regulations enforced by building control, has said the cladding system used at Grenfell did not comply with the building rules it oversees. It has not said why and declined to answer detailed questions on its legal reasoning. Link to graphic of Grenfell Tower cladding system: tmsnrt.rs/2t97Ugs Combustibility The test used to assess combined materials must be commissioned from a government approved independent testing agency. Reuters was unable to determine which, if any lab was used. Rydon, which had a turnover of 249 million pounds last year, told Reuters the materials it used were suitable for use in tall buildings. “Laboratory testing of the fire resistance of the cladding system used at Grenfell Tower was carried out prior to installation. Please see attached BBA certificate,” the spokeswoman said in the June 29 email. The certificate Rydon provided showed the panels met a separate standard on the surface spread of fire. Asked specifically about the BS 8414 test, the Rydon spokeswoman said: “More technical questions would be better directed at Harley as it’s their area of expertise.” Executives and a spokesman at Harley, a small company with few assets, declined to comment for this story. It said in a statement on its website last month it was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower. An official at RBKC, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, declined to provide details of the specification it approved or what checks it conducted to ensure the actual construction met the approved plan, citing the ongoing police investigation into the fire. A spokeswoman for Saint Gobain said its BR 135 combustibility certification of Celotex was based on tests conducted with a non-combustible cement façade panel. She declined to say if Celotex had ever passed the BS 8414 test with a flammable façade panel such as Reynobond PE.

With around 5,000 employees based in London, UBS is reviewing where it might move jobs which require access to the EU.  I think Frankfurt is a location of choice. There are different, other locations that could come into consideration,  Ermotti said in the interview broadcast on Monday, according to a transcript.    I think about Amsterdam, I think about Madrid ... As we speak, we are narrowing down really the options.  UBS will make a decision by the end of the summer or the early part of the fourth quarter, Ermotti said. Financial services firms need a regulated subsidiary in an EU country to offer products across the bloc which means some are looking to move jobs out of Britain if it loses access to the European single market.  Frankfurt has been mooted as a possible destination for UBS jobs that move from London because last year it set up a bank there to consolidate most of its European wealth management operations. FILE PHOTO - The offices of Swiss bank UBS are seen in the financial district of the City of London October 31, 2012.Chris HelgrenBut other European cities, including Madrid and Amsterdam, are competing to attract bankers if they move from London.   Ermotti also said clients at UBS's flagship wealth management division have shown a greater willingness to invest more of their money in the last five months.  It's clear if I look at the cash balances as a percentage of wealth we manage, they have been coming down from the high-20s to around the mid-20s,  he said.  So this is clearly a sign that people are willing to invest more, but still very cautious.  In the United States, Ermotti said optimism surrounding the Trump administration had diminished since the start of the year.   People do still believe that we will see some positive news from the new administration,  he said.  But the goodwill is eroding very fast and people want to see concrete actions before engaging in M&A;, before engaging into major discussions in respect of strategic moves.

The 2014 attack was one of many carried out by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) on state security targets in the period preceding Yemen's descent into full blown war involving Saudi Arabia. The conflict has killed around 10,000 people and displaced another 3 million.  The criminal court in charge of terrorism cases in Sanaa on Sunday sentenced four Saudi nationals to death for belonging to al Qaeda and killing and beheading 14 soldiers of the 134th Brigade,  al-Masirah television reported. The Houthis seized control of Sanaa in September 2014, forcing the then government into exile. In March the following year, a Saudi-led coalition launched a campaign to try to restore the ousted government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, carrying out thousands of air raids. But despite more than two years of heavy fighting, the Houthis, close to Saudi Arabia's arch-enemy Iran, have maintained control over the most populated provinces including the capital Sanaa. The court ordered for the men to be executed in public and in the presence of the families of those killed, the channel reported. AQAP was formed by the merger of the Saudi and Yemeni wings of Al Qaeda in 2009.

Libya is exempt from production cuts decided by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The nation's oil output has more than tripled over the past year as shuttered ports, pipelines and fields have reopened.  Over the past two weeks, output has increased to more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time since 2013. The NOC has previously said it can bring output to 1.2 million bpd this year.  Libya can play a constructive role in stabilizing oil markets by informing OPEC and markets about its plans to restore production,  NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in comments emailed to Reuters.   Accurate information will remove uncertainty and help the market understand and respond to future supply levels.   Libya's political, humanitarian and economic situation needs to be taken into account if we are going to talk about production caps.  In light of disrupted production in both countries, OPEC exempted Libya and Nigeria from a campaign that began on Jan. 1 to curb output by 1.2 million bpd aimed at supporting crude prices. But rising output from the two countries and the United States is undermining the impact OPEC and non-OPEC producers had hoped to make by removing a combined 1.8 million bpd from the market, with Brent prices down since the cuts began. Despite the recovery in Libya's production, output has been fluctuating due to power generation problems and leaks in pipelines that have corroded after long shutdowns. Gains are also fragile because of Libya's continuing political divisions, an economic crisis and conflict in parts of the vast North African country.  Armed groups have in the past shut oil facilities to demand money, including for wage payments and local development projects. The NOC says it has not so far received the necessary budget for sustaining production or expanding it to the 1.6 million bpd that Libya was producing before the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi. Libya is almost entirely dependent on income from oil sales. Its economy has been contracting rapidly and its foreign reserves are depleted due to sharp drops in oil production and prices over the past four years.  Inflation and a liquidity crisis have contributed to falling living standards across the country.

Jio, India's newest telecoms entrant, said that the data on the website,  Magicapk.com , appeared to be  unauthentic  and that its subscriber data was safe and maintained with the highest security. But people complained on Twitter about personal information of Jio users being publicly available on Magicapk.com, and some Indian media said that their checks had led them to believe the leak was real. Jio declined to comment on the Indian media reports.   We have informed law enforcement agencies about the claims of the website and will follow through to ensure strict action is taken,  a Jio spokeswoman said. Newspaper Indian Express said it was able to cross-verify details on a number of Jio customers known to them.  Indianexpress.com checked with some Jio numbers and found that details of numbers bought as late as last week are up on the site. However, it was not clear if all the numbers are available on the site, as a lot of queries were throwing a blank,  the newspaper reported. Magicapk.com is showing as  suspended  since late on Sunday. Rony Das, a security analyst with Defencely, an online security firm, described the likely data breach as  dangerous .  FILE PHOTO: A general view of Reliance Jio headquarters is seen on the outskirts of Mumbai, India, June 1, 2016.Clara Ferreira Marques/File PhotoAadhaar at Risk Many users had been registered for Reliance Jio services by  using a 12-digit Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) provided number, commonly known as the 'Aadhaar' number. The Indian government has begun mandating the use of Aadhaar for everything from opening a bank account to filing tax returns.  The 'Aadhaar' number, which works on similar lines as U.S. Social Security numbers, is unique to every Indian citizen and it stores biometric data of users in a centralized database. FILE PHOTO: Commuters are reflected on an advertisement of Reliance Industries' Jio telecoms unit, at a bus stop in Mumbai, India, February 21, 2017.Shailesh Andrade/File PhotoLocal tech website MediaNama said that Aadhaar information on the website had been redacted. It also said it had independently  verified data on the website for multiple Jio numbers, and that the data was accurate for those numbers. Srinivas Kodali, an independent security researcher, said it was tough to assess the scale of the alleged breach until  Jio releases a statement saying what went wrong, and how they're fixing it.   He said that while the alleged breach was only reported by media late Sunday, data from the potential breach was shared on a messageboard forum in June and screenshots of it were also available on the  dark web . Jio declined to comment.    Jio, run by Reliance Industries Ltd, launched last September and has already added over 100 million subscribers.  If the claims of the data breach are true, it would be a big setback for the Indian telecom entrant's aggressive push led by Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani. Ambani, India's richest man, through months of free and cut-price deals has propelled Jio into the nation's fastest growing wireless operator. It added 3.9 million subscribers to its network in April. Shares in Reliance were up slightly in afternoon trading in India on Monday.

Last year, Prime Minister Theresa May set up a review into modern employment practices after an outcry over the increasing use of zero-hour contracts and the rising number of self-employed people working for apps such Uber and food courier Deliveroo. Firms say the burgeoning  gig economy , in which people can work simultaneously for different companies without fixed contracts, gives greater flexibility to both them and their staff but such practices have been criticized as exploitative by unions.  In Britain, the self-employed have no entitlement to employment rights beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination laws. Regular workers receive entitlements such as annual leave, rest breaks and the minimum wage.

Libya is exempt from production cuts decided by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The nation's oil output has more than tripled over the past year as shuttered ports, pipelines and fields have reopened.  Over the past two weeks, output has increased to more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time since 2013. The NOC has previously said it can bring output to 1.2 million bpd this year.  Libya can play a constructive role in stabilizing oil markets by informing OPEC and markets about its plans to restore production,  NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in comments emailed to Reuters.   Accurate information will remove uncertainty and help the market understand and respond to future supply levels.   Libya's political, humanitarian and economic situation needs to be taken into account if we are going to talk about production caps.  In light of disrupted production in both countries, OPEC exempted Libya and Nigeria from a campaign that began on Jan. 1 to curb output by 1.2 million bpd aimed at supporting crude prices. But rising output from the two countries and the United States is undermining the impact OPEC and non-OPEC producers had hoped to make by removing a combined 1.8 million bpd from the market, with Brent prices down since the cuts began. Despite the recovery in Libya's production, output has been fluctuating due to power generation problems and leaks in pipelines that have corroded after long shutdowns. Gains are also fragile because of Libya's continuing political divisions, an economic crisis and conflict in parts of the vast North African country.  Armed groups have in the past shut oil facilities to demand money, including for wage payments and local development projects. The NOC says it has not so far received the necessary budget for sustaining production or expanding it to the 1.6 million bpd that Libya was producing before the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi. Libya is almost entirely dependent on income from oil sales. Its economy has been contracting rapidly and its foreign reserves are depleted due to sharp drops in oil production and prices over the past four years.  Inflation and a liquidity crisis have contributed to falling living standards across the country.

Higher productivity will cover the lower pace of consumption growth, curtailing prices of staple food commodities that are mostly expected to show a slight decline in real terms, said the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation. An easing in Chinese growth coupled with smaller worldwide population increases and less vigorous expansion of crop-based biofuels should all restrain agricultural markets, the OECD and FAO said in the report covering 2017-2026.  The last decade has seen unprecedented growth in the demand for agricultural products,  they said.  For most commodity groups, including cereals, meat, fish and vegetable oil, growth rates (in the next decade) will be cut by around half.  While during the previous 10 years, population increases and rising per capita consumption contributed about equally to overall food commodity demand growth, only dairy, sugar and vegetable oils were expected to see significant gains in per capita consumption in the decade ahead, the organizations said. The projections may offer little comfort to farmers and trading companies, who have been grappling with lower farmgate prices and smaller margins along the supply chain. [nL1N1JW1Q8] India's Thirst for Milk India and also Pakistan were fuelling a surge in fresh dairy supply and demand, which was expected to turn India into the world's biggest milk producer ahead of the European Union.  The growth in fresh dairy consumption is exceptional, with the result that fresh dairy shows the highest consumption growth rate among the key commodities,  the report said. India's thirst for milk illustrates an increasing impact it is anticipated to have on global markets, as it overtakes China as the world's most populous country in the coming decade. The jump in Indian milk production, forecast to almost triple over the first quarter of this century, also shows how dietary patterns continue to contrast, according to the report. Fresh dairy demand represents the main source of additional protein in India, whereas in Southeast Asia fish intake is more important and in sub-Saharan Africa, access to protein remains limited by income and distribution constraints. China would continue to support global food demand growth but at much lower levels, notably in pigmeat, where household consumption was expected to level off, the OECD and FAO said. Exports would remain concentrated among a small group of countries, particularly soybeans. In dairy, India was not anticipated to be a significant exporter given huge domestic demand to cater for, with the EU seen posting the biggest increase in dairy export market share.

Jio, India's newest telecoms entrant, said that the data on the website,  Magicapk.com , appeared to be  unauthentic  and that its subscriber data was safe and maintained with the highest security. But people complained on Twitter about personal information of Jio users being publicly available on Magicapk.com, and some Indian media said that their checks had led them to believe the leak was real. Jio declined to comment on the Indian media reports.   We have informed law enforcement agencies about the claims of the website and will follow through to ensure strict action is taken,  a Jio spokeswoman said. Newspaper Indian Express said it was able to cross-verify details on a number of Jio customers known to them.  Indianexpress.com checked with some Jio numbers and found that details of numbers bought as late as last week are up on the site. However, it was not clear if all the numbers are available on the site, as a lot of queries were throwing a blank,  the newspaper reported. Magicapk.com is showing as  suspended  since late on Sunday. Rony Das, a security analyst with Defencely, an online security firm, described the likely data breach as  dangerous .  FILE PHOTO: A general view of Reliance Jio headquarters is seen on the outskirts of Mumbai, India, June 1, 2016.Clara Ferreira Marques/File PhotoAadhaar at Risk Many users had been registered for Reliance Jio services by  using a 12-digit Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) provided number, commonly known as the 'Aadhaar' number. The Indian government has begun mandating the use of Aadhaar for everything from opening a bank account to filing tax returns.  The 'Aadhaar' number, which works on similar lines as U.S. Social Security numbers, is unique to every Indian citizen and it stores biometric data of users in a centralized database. FILE PHOTO: Commuters are reflected on an advertisement of Reliance Industries' Jio telecoms unit, at a bus stop in Mumbai, India, February 21, 2017.Shailesh Andrade/File PhotoLocal tech website MediaNama said that Aadhaar information on the website had been redacted. It also said it had independently  verified data on the website for multiple Jio numbers, and that the data was accurate for those numbers. Srinivas Kodali, an independent security researcher, said it was tough to assess the scale of the alleged breach until  Jio releases a statement saying what went wrong, and how they're fixing it.   He said that while the alleged breach was only reported by media late Sunday, data from the potential breach was shared on a messageboard forum in June and screenshots of it were also available on the  dark web . Jio declined to comment.    Jio, run by Reliance Industries Ltd, launched last September and has already added over 100 million subscribers.  If the claims of the data breach are true, it would be a big setback for the Indian telecom entrant's aggressive push led by Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani. Ambani, India's richest man, through months of free and cut-price deals has propelled Jio into the nation's fastest growing wireless operator. It added 3.9 million subscribers to its network in April. Shares in Reliance were up slightly in afternoon trading in India on Monday.

Cumulative monsoon rains have been 2 percent below average since the beginning of the rainy season in June until July 9, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. However, recent rains have been heavier, as in the week to July 5, the seasonal showers were 21 percent above average, the IMD said.  The distribution of rainfall has been good and it has followed the classical pattern, as we had predicted,  K.J. Ramesh, Director General of Meteorology at the IMD, told Reuters in an interview on Monday. The monsoon delivers about 70 percent of India's annual rainfall, critical for the farm sector that accounts for about 15 percent of India's $2 trillion economy and employs more than half of the country's 1.3 billion people. India's farmers depend on the monsoon since half their lands lack irrigation. In June, the IMD raised its monsoon forecast by 2 percentage points to 98 percent of the long-term average. The IMD defines average rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season. Rains between 90 percent to 96 percent are considered below average. Rainfall below 90 percent of the average is considered a drought. The monsoon begins at the southern tip of the Kerala coast in the south around June 1 and start ebbing from the desert state of Rajasthan in northern India in September. While most of the country has received average rainfall, rains have been deficient over Kerala, a major producer of plantation crops such as tea and rubber, and Jharkhand in eastern India, a key rice producing state. Even if rains are average, some areas could still have dry spells. Farmers plant rice and soybean crops in June and July and harvest in October.  The area planted with the rice crop has gone up by 8 percent this season, while that of soybean is up 10.3 percent, data from the Ministry of Agriculture showed last week. Higher rice output will help the world's biggest exporter maintain its edge, while any jump in soybean production will alleviate vegetable oil imports by the world's biggest buyer.

Firms say the burgeoning  gig economy , in which people can work simultaneously for different companies without fixed contracts, gives greater flexibility to both them and their staff but such practices have been criticized as exploitative by unions.  In Britain, the self-employed have no entitlement to employment rights beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination laws.

U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June, signalling that the Fed could be on course for a third interest rate hike this year despite sluggish wage gains.

Higher productivity will cover the lower pace of consumption growth, curtailing prices of staple food commodities that are mostly expected to show a slight decline in real terms, said the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation. An easing in Chinese growth coupled with smaller worldwide population increases and less vigorous expansion of crop-based biofuels should all restrain agricultural markets, the OECD and FAO said in the report covering 2017-2026.  The last decade has seen unprecedented growth in the demand for agricultural products,  they said.  For most commodity groups, including cereals, meat, fish and vegetable oil, growth rates (in the next decade) will be cut by around half.  While during the previous 10 years, population increases and rising per capita consumption contributed about equally to overall food commodity demand growth, only dairy, sugar and vegetable oils were expected to see significant gains in per capita consumption in the decade ahead, the organizations said. The projections may offer little comfort to farmers and trading companies, who have been grappling with lower farmgate prices and smaller margins along the supply chain. [nL1N1JW1Q8] India's Thirst for Milk India and also Pakistan were fuelling a surge in fresh dairy supply and demand, which was expected to turn India into the world's biggest milk producer ahead of the European Union.  The growth in fresh dairy consumption is exceptional, with the result that fresh dairy shows the highest consumption growth rate among the key commodities,  the report said. India's thirst for milk illustrates an increasing impact it is anticipated to have on global markets, as it overtakes China as the world's most populous country in the coming decade. The jump in Indian milk production, forecast to almost triple over the first quarter of this century, also shows how dietary patterns continue to contrast, according to the report. Fresh dairy demand represents the main source of additional protein in India, whereas in Southeast Asia fish intake is more important and in sub-Saharan Africa, access to protein remains limited by income and distribution constraints. China would continue to support global food demand growth but at much lower levels, notably in pigmeat, where household consumption was expected to level off, the OECD and FAO said. Exports would remain concentrated among a small group of countries, particularly soybeans. In dairy, India was not anticipated to be a significant exporter given huge domestic demand to cater for, with the EU seen posting the biggest increase in dairy export market share.

The exchange has made major reforms aimed at boosting trade, including taking the exchange private, loosening regulation for companies looking to list and removing hurdles for new trading members.  A few years ago our bourse was like a ship on a collision course with an iceberg,  said Shmuel Hauser, chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, at a capital markets conference.  Open-heart surgery was needed, and that's what we did.  Average daily trade volume of 2.1 billion shekels in 2010 had halved by 2012, in part because Israel lost out on passive inflows following a market upgrade by MSCI. Only three new companies joined the exchange in 2012, compared with 22 in 2010, with many local firms preferring to list abroad. But volumes have steadily recovered, reaching an average of 1.5 billion shekels a day in 2017, up 20 percent from 2016. And while the total number of companies on the exchange fell to 452 in 2016 from 600 in 2010, more new companies are looking to join.  I hope trade volumes will grow to 2 billion shekels a day, and more, within about a year. I expect the number of new companies on the bourse to grow by more than 30 companies,  Hauser said. Hauser is also pushing the government to approve tax breaks for stock market investors and wants a foreign partnership.  I look forward to cooperating with a foreign exchange. If not Nasdaq, it will be the exchange in London. If not London, the Deutsche-Bourse exchange, and if not that, the Toronto exchange,  he said, without elaborating.

The sale - the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data - will help strengthen Wanda's case for a mainland listing after its property unit delisted from Hong Kong last year. For Sunac, it would mean ownership of a wide portfolio of tourism developments at a time when it is  spending billions on property and technology assets. Wanda said it would offload 91 percent of thirteen cultural tourism projects, which usually include theme parks and leisure complexes, and 76 hotels to the acquisitive Tianjin-based developer Sunac for 63.18 billion yuan. After the sale, Wanda will, however, continue to play a role in operating and managing the projects. Wanda, which also has interests in films and sports, had plans to build at least 20 cultural projects around China. Its billionaire owner Wang Jianlin had last year said his  wolf pack  of parks would beat U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).  This (deal) signifies a retreat from Wanda's previous strategy in cultural tourism, and marks a pivot to an asset-light strategy,  said Qin Gang, senior researcher at State Information Center, a government-linked think tank. Beijing has been encouraging development of cultural theme parks as part of a local tourism drive, tapping consumers' growing budget for entertainment. There are over 300 such facilities in China, with most struggling to turn a profit. Wanda's parks are still under construction, except three that have been completed. Two that opened in Nanchang and Hefei last year do not rank in the top 20 by attendance for Asia Pacific, consultancy AECOM's 2016 theme park index shows.  The firm, which had earmarked a more than 300 billion yuan ($44 billion) investment for its cultural and tourism projects, did not give a reason for the sale to Sunac, but local business magazine Caixin quoted Wang as saying the deal would ease the debt burden on Wanda's property unit.  Through this asset transfer, Wanda Commercial's debt ratio will be greatly reduced, all the proceeds will be used to repay loans. Wanda Commercial plans to repay most of the bank loans this year,  Wang told Caixin. Analysts said the lower debt load could help Wanda's plans to list the unit in Shanghai and to attract a higher valuation. S&P; downgraded Wanda Commercial in December citing rising financial leverage and slower-than-expected asset disposal at China's largest commercial developer. Another downgrade would push the rating into  junk  category. FILE PHOTO: A sign of Dalian Wanda Group in China glows during an event announcing strategic partnership between Wanda Group and FIFA in Beijing, China March 21, 2016.Damir Sagolj/File PhotoThe group has been investing heavily in entertainment, leisure and financial businesses and the buying spree has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators, who ordered lenders last month to assess exposure to overseas deals by Wanda, HNA Group, Anbang Insurance [ANBANG.UL] and Fosun (0656.HK). Wanda has been very active globally, with deals for U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N), Hollywood film studio Legendary Entertainment, Infront Sports & Media AG and Spanish soccer team Atletico Madrid.  Sunac Drive Sunac too has been shopping. Slideshow (2 Images)In the past year, boss Sun Hongbin has led the group on an acquisition spree, including $2.1 billion for the real-estate assets of Legend Holdings, parent of PC-maker Lenovo, and $2.2 billion for a stake in Leshi Internet (300104.SZ), a unit of LeEco - a Chinese Netflix-to-Tesla-like conglomerate.  The stake in Wanda cultural and tourism projects will cost Sunac 29.58 billion yuan. The price tag for the hotels is 33.6 billion yuan. The firms are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month.  Sunac will pay for this from its cashpile that stood at over 90 billion yuan at the end of June, Caixin quoted Sun as saying.  It had total liabilities of 168.6 billion yuan at the end of 2016, versus 64.5 billion yuan the year before.  Shares in Wanda Hotel Development (0169.HK) surged more than 150 percent after news of the deal, though none of the hotels being sold are included under this entity. Wanda said Sunac will be responsible for all the loans for the projects, but the brand name and design will be unchanged. Sunac, whose shares in Hong Kong were suspended from trading ahead of what it said would be a  very substantial acquisition  announcement, declined to comment further. Shares in the developer have more than doubled in value this year, but analysts worry Sunac could have bitten off too much. It has a negative outlook rating from Moody's, which said in April Sunac's leverage had deteriorated significantly due to large amounts of debt it had raised to support acquisitions.

It has also raised concerns of a growing domestic glut in oil products, especially in eastern China where diesel and gasoline demand eased.  Textile maker Rongsheng Holding Group, petrochemical maker Juhua Group and Tongkun Group, are the main financiers of the 173 billion yuan ($25.44 billion) project, the environmental document showed. The investors will borrow more than 120 billion yuan in bank loans to finance the project, the document said.

What has shifted in recent months is an acceptance that fiscal policy, touted around the turn of the year as the essential comeback kid after the shock election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, has not yet come back. Much of this is because of a lack of progress on Trump's tax cut agenda, dimming down what was called the  Trumpflation  trade in financial markets and now even calling into question a multi-year rally in the U.S. dollar. But what this does is thrust central bankers -- who only six months ago were said to be waning in influence -- back into the spotlight. Many seasoned central bank watchers say past experience shows that until inflation really accelerates convincingly, and for a sustained period for reasons other than a rise in the price of oil, the best monetary policy is to be doing nothing. The latest minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's policy discussions show a split over inflation, which is sure to cast unusually sharp focus on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to both houses of Congress in the coming week. Indeed, with the exception of persistent four-decade-low first-time claims for jobless benefits, U.S. economic data has been undercutting relatively modest expectations for the past several months, particularly on measures of inflation. Wage inflation across most of the developed world, widely viewed by economists as the most compelling and potent driver of sustained overall price inflation, hasn't picked up the way central bankers have predicted it would either. The Fed, however, remains set on further interest rate rises, and is now contemplating how and when to start reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, bloated by years of mass asset purchases as stimulus once it had no interest rate left to cut.  Of course the evolution of the economic data over the next few months remains of critical importance,  notes Investec's chief economist Philip Shaw.  In particular, will the momentum of the economy be maintained and is the recent run of soft inflation idiosyncratic, as most senior Fed officials seem to believe?  Worthwhile Canadian Initiative? It's not only Yellen who might set the mood in the coming week. The Bank of Canada meets to set policy on July 12 following a run-up in the Canadian dollar, with markets leaning toward expecting the first rate rise in nearly seven years. The domestic debate is partly over whether a rate rise is now warranted in part to tamp down rampant urban housing markets -- particularly in Vancouver and Toronto -- as soaring real estate prices have pushed Canada's household debt to income ratio to near the highest in the world. Like in other similar economies, Canada's consumer price inflation on its own does not point convincingly to a need for the Bank of Canada to deliver higher interest rates.  Its decision one way or the other could have an effect on markets beyond its shores as it will be seen as a proxy for policy normalisation over a wider jurisdiction,  notes Shaw. For some, discussion of  normalisation  appears eerily similar to 2011, when the European Central Bank, faced with a similarly shaky-looking inflation outlook, raised interest rates in what is now regarded as a mistake, arguing higher rates would be supportive of business confidence. A punishing sovereign debt crisis followed and a period of eye-wateringly high unemployment, ushering in an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet by well over a trillion euros and counting, along with negative interest rate policy. For now, the ECB appears to be moving very gingerly toward unveiling how and when it will trim back its tens of billions worth of monthly bond purchases, but that date is approaching. Some of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee also now think that now is the time to raise rates -- despite the uncertainty of Britain starting to negotiate its way out of the European Union. They are prompted by a surge in inflation caused in large part from a plunge in sterling after the Brexit vote. For now, they remain in a minority, but the possibility has supported the pound and markets have been put on notice. But a change of mood appears to have taken place at the Bank of Japan, however, which is backing off initial attempts to signal an imminent shift away from its ultra-easy monetary policy. On Friday it launched a bond-buying bonanza, offering to snap up unlimited quantities in order to calm markets.

Russian hackers leaked documents last week showing Farah was suspected of doping in 2015 before being cleared by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in 2016, British media reported.  I am sick of repeating myself and you guys just making something out of nothing,  Farah told reporters on Sunday.   I work hard at what I do and I just carry on enjoying what I do, and it comes as a little distraction...   I said I will never fail a drugs test. That is who I am. I believe in clean sports and I just have to enjoy what I do, keep smiling. And let you guys do what you do.  There's no secrets to what I do. My life is not as easy as people think, it is hard work. I wish you guys would understand it a bit more and write down the facts. I do what I do, keep smiling. I love you all.  Farah has fielded doping allegations repeatedly and the issue re-appeared in April after a doctor said that he injected a legal dose of a controversial substance prior to the 2014 London Marathon but it was not adequately recorded. The long-distance runner said he would not be racing in the 1,500m event in Monaco and will instead go to an altitude training camp in Font Romeu, France to prepare for next month's world championships.  The preparation is going well – I'm grafting and continuing to tick boxes,  Farah said.   Initially I was going to try and fit a 1500m race in between now and the World Championships, but this is my last race now.  I'm going to Font Romeu tomorrow. I'll just knuckle down.  Farah had previously announced his plans of retiring from track events and focusing on marathons after the World Championships.

That puts the French oil major ahead of rivals like Exxon and Shell in the early running for developing the expansion, which the tiny Gulf state announced as it seeks to counter growing isolation caused by a regional diplomatic rift. Total boss Patrick Pouyanne signed a deal this month to develop the South Pars field, as Iran's part of the shared reserves are known, becoming the first oil major to return to the country since the lifting of sanctions. As he was ironing out details of that agreement, he was careful to keep Qatar in the loop.  Of course, I won't go to the same field in Iran without telling Qatar,  Pouyanne told Reuters.  The Iranian block where we are supposed to produce is next to the border with Qatar. When I traveled to Doha I discussed it with the (Qatari) authorities and they told us: 'It is ok - we know you'.  Pouyanne says Total strictly respects confidentiality of data vis-à-vis each country. The executive's cross-border strategy, however, appears to be paying early dividends.  I would expect Total to be in the strongest position for the new (Qatari) project, because of the political issues at play and their recent deals in (Iran's) South Pars,  one senior Gulf energy source said. On one level, working with both countries who share a prized gas asset seems obvious. But it is not without risks for Total. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt  have imposed political and economic sanctions on Qatar, demanding that it stops fostering terrorism and courting Iran, Riyadh's main rival. Qatar denies the accusations. Besides Iran and Qatar, Total also has large projects in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, highlighting the complexity of investing in the Middle East. Cost Savings Possible FILE PHOTO: The logo of French oil giant Total is seen in front of the oil refinery of Donges, near Nantes, France, December 20, 2013.Stephane Mahe/File PhotoQatar, already the world's largest liquefied gas exporter, lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field in April and last week it said it would raise gas output capacity by around 30 percent to 100 billion cubic meters. The move was widely seen as a show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbors and Egypt. Qatar has built its gas export power over the past decade with support from global oil majors including ExxonMobil, Total, and Royal Dutch Shell. The projects have generated billions of dollars for Qatar and its Western partners and the planned expansion to its gas capacity would make Qatar even more dominant in the gas market, accounting for a third of current global LNG output. Cars are parked outside the headquartes of Qatar Petroleum in Doha, Qatar, July 8, 2017.StringerSources told Reuters earlier this month that Exxon, Shell and Total have all expressed interest in helping Qatar expand its gas facilities, with top executives traveling to Doha in recent weeks even after a spike in political tensions. Exxon, Shell and Total declined to comment on plans to participate in Qatar's tenders to expand gas capacity, which are yet to be announced and will take several years to complete. Even without those tenders, Total's role in Qatar is set to grow significantly after it won a 30 percent stake in 2016 in a new 25-year contract to operate its largest offshore Al-Shaheen oilfield.  Total, which will take over the field operation from Maersk Oil on July 14, plans to invest $2 billion in expanding the field over the next five years. With Qatar's gas production costs among the lowest in the world, being a part of any expansion would give Total a strategic advantage over rivals in the fast-growing global LNG market. Total's involvement in fields on both sides of the Qatari-Iranian border may also help save on costs and service contracts as well as better understand the fields' geology, although Pouyanne said there was no mechanism to coordinate production jointly by the countries. The development of the new capacity over the next 5-7 years could cost between $14-$18 billion, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie.  Qatar may also be keen to show it is still open for business despite the current diplomatic disputes with some of its Gulf neighbors,  it said.

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus told  Fox News Sunday  that Trump, who made repeal and replacement of Obamacare a central plank of his 2016 campaign, still expected the Senate to pass a healthcare bill either before the scheduled start of Congress' August recess  or maybe a little bit into  the recess. Other Republicans voiced pessimism.  My view is that it's probably going to be dead,  Senator John McCain of Arizona said of the healthcare legislation on the CBS program  Face the Nation.  Some conservative senators, such as Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, have said they cannot support the proposal unless it goes further to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is weighing how to shore up support for the healthcare bill, which would repeal parts of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation, and get rid of tax increases that fund it. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives in May passed its own version of a bill overhauling healthcare. McConnell warned at a luncheon in his home state of Kentucky last week that if Republicans were unable to pass their own replacement bill, they might need to work with Democrats to bolster the insurance markets created under Obamacare, according to the Associated Press. During a week-long recess last week that coincided with the Fourth of July holiday, liberal groups organized town halls and protests and ran ads criticizing the proposal. Most Republican senators kept a low profile on the issue, including McCain, who traveled to Afghanistan to visit troops, and Senator Jeff Flake, a fellow Arizonan who faces a tough re-election fight next year. Last week, groups such as the state chapter of Planned Parenthood and Ability 360, an advocacy organization for disabled people, participated in events that spotlighted the Senate bill, including a town hall in Phoenix. At the Phoenix event, there were empty chairs on a stage with placards for McCain and Flake, who were invited but did not attend. Arizonans such as Rosemary Dixon, who had a kidney transplant in 2015 and worries about how she will pay for her medication, spoke about the potential impact of the legislation. Medicaid Cuts Republicans have long criticized Obamacare as ineffective and a government intrusion in a key sector of the economy. But opponents deride the Republican healthcare bill as a giveaway to wealthy Americans who would see some tax increases rolled back. Critics also warn the legislation would cause millions of poor and sick Americans to lose healthcare coverage. The Obamacare law expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, in large part through an expansion of Medicaid, a government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Senators from states such as Ohio, Nevada and Arizona that expanded the Medicaid program under Obamacare are taking heat from Republican governors over the Senate bill’s proposal to phase out the expansion. In Arizona, for example, more than 400,000 have signed up for Medicaid since its expansion there and 1.9 million are now insured by the program. The Senate legislation would also drastically cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which assesses the impact of legislation, estimated 22 million people would lose health insurance over the next decade under the Senate bill. In a separate report, it found the proposal would cut government spending on Medicaid by 35 percent come 2036. The Senate bill is unpopular with voters. Just 24 percent of adults approved of the proposal, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll of 1,554 adults taken from July 2 to 6. McConnell can only lose two Republican votes on the bill, relying on Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tiebreaking vote. But McConnell must do so with an eye on the 2018 congressional elections, ensuring he does not imperil the party's narrow majority in the 100-seat Senate.

The companies plan to disclose the investment on Monday, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Trumid, which is backed by venture capitalist Peter Thiel and investor George Soros, will also announce that it will collaborate with Deutsche Boerse to develop products and services for the European market, the sources said. Deutsche Boerse's investment is an add-on to $28 million raised by Trumid earlier this year from investors including Chinese financial firm CreditEase. Founded in 2014, Trumid is one of a spate of electronic bond trading platforms set up in recent years to help ease the liquidity crunch in fixed income markets. Stricter capital requirements imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis have made it more expensive for banks to act as market makers in corporate bonds, making it harder for asset managers to trade. Trumid, which acquired competitor Electronifie earlier this year, hopes to facilitate trading by enabling asset managers and brokers to transact directly and anonymously with one another on its platform. The company plans to expand into Europe to extend its offering to its 350 institutional clients, many of which operate globally, one of the sources said. This is not the first time that Deutsche Boerse has taken an equity stake in a fixed income trading startup, having backed London-based Bondcube in 2014. Bondcube, however, filed for liquidation in July 2015, three months after its launch. Many of the bond trading platforms launched in recent years have struggled to gain significant traction, in part because of their inability to persuade buyside traders to negotiate prices with each other, in a marketplace where they were traditionally used to letting brokers negotiate prices on their behalf. As many of the platforms make money by charging fees on executed trades, their revenues rely on engaged traders and successful negotiations. Roughly $1 billion worth bonds were traded on Trumid in the month of June.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has predicted a  summer of hell  for commuters as scheduled repairs force a partial shutdown of the busiest passenger train hub in the country from July 10 through Sept. 1, or longer if work falls behind schedule. Track closures mean some people find other ways into the city, including ferries, buses and PATH trains, a subway line running between lower Manhattan and New Jersey. One harried New Jersey commuter suggested that finding a way to work every day was a task best suited for members of a club for geniuses.  It's like some Mensa test, just trying to figure out how to get there,  David Weinstock, 51, said, referring to the Mensa International, a club for people with high IQ's. Weinstock, a public relations executive, moved to Maplewood, New Jersey, five years ago, lured by the convenient 35-minute commute by rail directly into Penn Station. But with nearly all trains on his line rerouted to Hoboken, New Jersey, he has had to piece together a makeshift plan to cross the Hudson River to Manhattan.  It's going to become an almost two-hour commute each way, on top of 10-hour work days,  said Weinstock, a married father of two young children. With fewer platforms available, the repair work will complicate schedules for the three rail operators that use Penn Station: the national rail corporation Amtrak and the regional commuter train operators New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road. All three have canceled some routes into Penn, rerouted others and warned commuters to expect delays on remaining trains until all tracks are up and running again. The terminal serves 600,000 riders a day. Deb Wilson, 53, a human resources executive from Montclair, New Jersey, 15 miles west of Penn Station, said she is worried about the overflow of rerouted commuters in the small Hoboken terminal during the evening commute home from New York.  It's going to be mass pandemonium in Hoboken,  Wilson said.  They should have planned better. This is pretty dramatic.  Recent Derailments Delays at Penn Station have become routine after a series of derailments, highlighting the urgency of the track repairs. The most recent incident occurred on Thursday evening when 180 people had to be rescued from a NJ Transit train that derailed as it emerged on the New York side of a tunnel under the Hudson River. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday demanded a  full investigation into all potential causes  of the derailment. Deteriorating transit conditions have led to renewed criticism of Christie for canceling a new Hudson River rail tunnel project soon after taking office in 2010, saying the cost to his state was too high. Cuomo, touted as a potential Democratic challenger to President Donald Trump in 2020, has also come under pressure to fix New York's problem-plagued subways. As governor, he controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway system as well as LIRR and Metro-North, a commuter rail line serving the city's northern suburbs that use Grand Central Terminal. Still, the New York governor has no direct oversight over repairs at Penn Station, which is owned and operated by Amtrak. The national rail corporation is undertaking the massive repair program and rents track and station space to NJ Transit and the MTA's LIRR. Each railroad has devised separate contingency plans to work around the repairs, including reduced fares and alternate routes into New York.

Russia denies allegations from governments and intelligence services that it is behind a growing number of cyber attacks on commercial and political targets around the world, including the hackings of recent U.S. and French presidential election campaigns. Asked if the Russian authorities were a threat to the democratic process, Robert Hannigan, who stepped down as head of the UK's intelligence service in March, said:  Yes ... There is a disproportionate amount of mayhem in cyberspace coming from Russia from state activity.  In his first interview since leaving GCHQ, Hannigan told BBC radio that it was positive that French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had publicly  called this out recently . Standing alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin in May, Macron said state-funded Russian news outlets had sought to destabilize his campaign while the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency said last week it was expecting Russia to try to influence the German election in September.  Ultimately people will have to push back against Russian state activity and show that it's unacceptable,  he said.  It doesn't have to be by cyber retaliation, but it may be that is necessary at some time in the future. It may be  sanctions and other measures, just to put down some red lines and say that this behavior is unacceptable.  Hannigan also said it would be a mistake  to force social media companies to allow intelligence agencies to access services protected by encryption through so-called  back door  access.  The best you can do with end-to-end encryption is work with companies in a cooperative way to find ways around it frankly,  he said. He said such  back doors  would weaken systems. Hannigan also said governments should wait to see how a global working group on tackling online extremism established by Facebook (FB.O), Google's YouTube (GOOGL.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) performed before seeking new laws.  Legislation is a blunt last resort because frankly extremism is very difficult to define in law and you could spend all your time in court arguing about whether a particular video crosses the line or not,  he said. Last month, Germany approved a plan to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($57 million) if they failed to remove hateful postings promptly. Britain has also mooted bringing in possible sanctions for tech firms that failed to remove extremist content.

This is the credibility of our system, we have enough cash to preserve any... kind of shock,  he told the CNBC news channel in an interview published early on Monday on its website. Al-Thani said the central bank has $40 billion in reserves plus gold, while the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund has $300 billion in reserves that it could liquidate. Qatari stocks have weakened and the riyal QAR= has been volatile in the spot market since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism. Doha has denied these allegations.  Qatar has already had a good and unique system. We have laws established against all these kinds of terrorists ,  al Thani told CNBC.  We work with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and other institutions to establish our laws and audits and reviews.   We have no challenges, we welcome those to review all our books, they are open,  he added. Al-Thani said while the central bank has noticed fund  outflows from some non-residents, the amounts weren't particularly significant. An amount of less than $6 billion left Qatar over the last month, he said.  There is more [money] coming in,  he said, confirming that inflows are exceeding outflows. FILE PHOTO - Qatar's central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saoud al-Thani claps during the 58th Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Central Bank Governors' annual meeting in Manama September 18, 2013.Hamad I Mohammed/File PhotoAl-Thani said there had been an increase of up to $15 billion in the first week in the usage of central bank's repo facility by the commercial banks.  We have enough CDs (certificate of deposits) and Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds in the hand - in the asset side of the banking sector, that provide them with the liquidity,  he said. He also said the stability of the Qatari riyal, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, will  continue for the future.  Al-Thani said long-term contracts in the gas and oil sectors were not seeing any disruptions. Rating agency Moody's Investors Service earlier this month changed the outlook on Qatar's credit rating to negative from stable, citing economic and financial risks arising from the ongoing dispute between Qatar and the Saudi-led alliance. Despite the market ructions, economists say Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter, has taken a number of measures such as a planned boost in gas output and new transport routes to weather the crisis. Qatar's banking sector still has significant dependence on foreign funding. Thirty-six percent of commercial banks' total liabilities in May were to foreigners, including others in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Saudi, UAE and Bahraini banks have already largely frozen new business with Qatar because of guidance from their central banks; some jittery foreign banks have followed suit.  Should the rift escalate and more money flows out, the country's banking system has enough buffers to  meet all the requirements,  according to al-Thani.  We find our banking sector well-capitalized, meeting Basel III as they have high liquid assets, plus they have very good inter-banking activity inside and outside, and they are very stable at this moment. So we don't believe there is anything to worry about at this moment.

Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Guy Verhofstadt said the differences between proposals made by the European Union and Britain to guarantee the rights of people living away from their home countries were striking, the latest sign that what should be a relatively easy part of Brexit talks is far from agreed. The EU and Britain have agreed they must first deal with the rights of citizens and a financial settlement before discussing a future trade deal after Britain leaves the European Union - something Prime Minister Theresa May wants to happen quickly. Verhofstadt said while he accepted Britain's vote to leave the EU, the European Parliament was not convinced that Brexit would help either the European economy or its citizens.  The UK proposal only confirms this belief – falling short of its own ambitions to 'put citizens first'. If implemented, it would cast a dark cloud of vagueness and uncertainty over the lives of millions of Europeans,  he wrote.  It was a damp squib, proposing that Europeans obtain the status of 'third-country nationals' in the UK, with fewer rights than British citizens are offered throughout the EU.  May's deputy, Damian Green, told BBC radio the government would preserve the basic rights of EU citizens in Britain, but reiterated that those rights could not be guarded by the European Court of Justice - a sticking point for the two sides. Verhofstadt also said the parliament, which has the right to veto any Brexit deal, wanted the negotiations to be completed by March 30, 2019, adding that it would not support any extension to this deadline because European parliamentary elections were due to take place in May of that year.

This is the credibility of our system, we have enough cash to preserve any... kind of shock,  he told the CNBC news channel in an interview published early on Monday on its website. Al-Thani said the central bank has $40 billion in reserves plus gold, while the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund has $300 billion in reserves that it could liquidate. Qatari stocks have weakened and the riyal QAR= has been volatile in the spot market since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism. Doha has denied these allegations.  Qatar has already had a good and unique system. We have laws established against all these kinds of terrorists ,  al Thani told CNBC.  We work with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and other institutions to establish our laws and audits and reviews.   We have no challenges, we welcome those to review all our books, they are open,  he added. Al-Thani said while the central bank has noticed fund  outflows from some non-residents, the amounts weren't particularly significant. An amount of less than $6 billion left Qatar over the last month, he said.  There is more [money] coming in,  he said, confirming that inflows are exceeding outflows. FILE PHOTO - Qatar's central bank governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saoud al-Thani claps during the 58th Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Central Bank Governors' annual meeting in Manama September 18, 2013.Hamad I Mohammed/File PhotoAl-Thani said there had been an increase of up to $15 billion in the first week in the usage of central bank's repo facility by the commercial banks.  We have enough CDs (certificate of deposits) and Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds in the hand - in the asset side of the banking sector, that provide them with the liquidity,  he said. He also said the stability of the Qatari riyal, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, will  continue for the future.  Al-Thani said long-term contracts in the gas and oil sectors were not seeing any disruptions. Rating agency Moody's Investors Service earlier this month changed the outlook on Qatar's credit rating to negative from stable, citing economic and financial risks arising from the ongoing dispute between Qatar and the Saudi-led alliance. Despite the market ructions, economists say Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter, has taken a number of measures such as a planned boost in gas output and new transport routes to weather the crisis. Qatar's banking sector still has significant dependence on foreign funding. Thirty-six percent of commercial banks' total liabilities in May were to foreigners, including others in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Saudi, UAE and Bahraini banks have already largely frozen new business with Qatar because of guidance from their central banks; some jittery foreign banks have followed suit.  Should the rift escalate and more money flows out, the country's banking system has enough buffers to  meet all the requirements,  according to al-Thani.  We find our banking sector well-capitalized, meeting Basel III as they have high liquid assets, plus they have very good inter-banking activity inside and outside, and they are very stable at this moment. So we don't believe there is anything to worry about at this moment.

Although it aims to bring the budget deficit toward zero in the next few years, the finance ministry nearly doubled borrowing this year to compensate for shortfall in incomes from oil exports and a stalled sale of state stakes in Russia's major companies. In an interview with Reuters, Siluanov said it would be difficult to expand its borrowing plan from the 1 trillion rubles ($16.55 billion) approved for this year. The finance ministry had enjoyed strong demand for its treasury bonds, known as OFZs, as foreign investors piled into Russian debt for carry trades - borrowing dollars cheaply, converting them into the firming rouble, and then buying high-yielding Russian bonds. But as the Bank of Russia started cutting rates this year, while the U.S. Fed increased its own rate, returns from OFZ ownership became less lucrative, especially after the rouble pared gains and risks of new western sanctions increased. Siluanov acknowledged foreign appetite for OFZ bonds had faded recently. But even if new U.S. sanctions are imposed on Moscow, a  large exodus  of non-residents from state bonds is unlikely, Siluanov said, as the OFZs were mainly purchased by major investors and pensions funds that do not use these instruments for short-term market speculation. Related CoverageRussia finance ministry planning $4 billion Eurobond swap no earlier than SeptemberThe U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly in June for new sanctions on Russia to punish it for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, an allegation that Russia dismisses. The new sanctions have not yet been passed by the House of Representatives, but analysts have expressed concerns that it could include restrictions on buying OFZs.     While the finance ministry may struggle to sell more OFZs to foreigners, who owned 30 percent of such bonds in early June, the finance ministry can not count on domestic money either.  It would be difficult to rely solely on internal investors without raising borrowing costs,  Siluanov said. The finance ministry is also struggling to plug holes in the budget by selling state companies to private investors. Moscow is not willing to sell such stakes cheaply, blaming Western sanctions for adverse market conditions.  If there were no such limitations, sanctions, if companies' valuation were not clearly underrated, then the privatization would go on more actively,  Siluanov said.      That is why we need a lower budget deficit: no wide-scale privatization is planned, we won't borrow much on external market, and moreover an extra inflow of foreign currency could lead to the rouble firming,  he said. A weaker rouble would help the finance ministry, which receives around half of its budget revenues from selling oil and gas abroad for dollars, to fund social liabilities ahead of 2018 presidential elections. Tax Collection While seeing a need to adjust taxation in the oil-dependent economy, the finance ministry does not support an idea of tax breaks for oil companies that run mature oil fields, producing less and less crude, Siluanov said. Siluanov said tax breaks on most depleted fields may deprive the budget of 130 billion rubles ($2.17 billion) a year. Rosneft, Russia's influential oil giant, had earlier asked to lift taxes on Samotlor, a field that was responsible for over a quarter of the Soviet Union's production but later became depleted with extraction affected by heavy water levels. For now, the finance ministry will put an emphasis on better tax collection, as it does not expect prices for oil, Russia's key exports, to rise above $60 per barrel in the foreseeable future, Siluanov said.  We would use all our arsenal to fight against those who evade taxes this and next year,  Siluanov said. Stronger tax collection and a prudent fiscal policy are tactics designed to shield Russia from external shocks that in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea, battered the rouble and paved the road for two years of economic recession.  If we want to secure our liabilities from external factors, we need to be realistic in assessing macroparameters, including prices for our export goods,  Siluanov said, referring to uncertainty around the OPEC oil-cut production agreement and prospects of shale extraction in the United States.

Stock STAFFORD, England (Reuters) - Researchers at a British University have embarked on a decade-long experiment that will pump a forest full of carbon dioxide to measure how it copes with rising levels of the gas - a key driver of climate change.  The Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment at the University of Birmingham's Institute of Forest Research (BIFoR) will expose a fenced-off section of mature woodland - in Norbury Park in Staffordshire, West Midlands - to levels of CO2 that experts predict will be prevalent in 2050. Scientists aim to measure the forest's capacity to capture carbon released by fossil fuel burning, and answer questions about their capacity to absorb carbon pollution long-term.  (Forests) happily take a bit more CO2 because that's their main nutrient. But we don't know how much more and whether they can do that indefinitely , BIFoR co-director Michael Tausz told Reuters. The apparatus for the experiment consists a series of masts built into six 30-metre wide sections of woodland, reaching up about 25 meters into the forest canopy.  Concentrated CO2 is fed through pipes to the top of the masts where it is pumped into the foliage. Last year the U.N World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the global average of carbon dioxide, the main man-made greenhouse gas, reached 400 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere for the first time on record.  The forest here sees nearly 40 percent more CO2 than it sees normally, because that's what it will be globally in about 2050; a value of 550 parts per million, compared to 400 parts per million now,  Tausz said. With deforestation shrinking the carbon storage capacity of the world's forests, researchers hope that a greater understanding of their role in climate change mitigation could help policy makers make informed decisions.  We could get a clear idea of whether they can keep helping us into the future by sucking up more CO2,  said Tausz.

The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is Positive. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. BOIG is the newly established holding company and ultimate parent of the Bank of Ireland group and its ratings are equalised with those of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank of Ireland (BOI; BBB-/Positive/bbb-), the group's main operating subsidiary. The establishment of BOIG as a holding company is part of a reorganisation aimed at improving the ability to resolve the group in line with the Single Resolution Board and Bank of England's preference for a single point of entry approach to bank resolution once there is sufficient bail-in debt issued by the holding company. The single point of entry approach should allow for a bail-in of holding company debt without causing a default of the main operating subsidiaries. KEY RATING DRIVERS VR AND IDRS The ratings reflect the role of BOIG as the holding company of the Bank of Ireland group and are aligned with those of its main operating subsidiary, BOI. As a result, BOIG's ratings are driven by the same considerations that affect BOI's ratings. BOI's VR and IDRs' are primarily based on the bank's strong domestic franchise, strengthened capitalisation, normalised funding profile, sound liquidity, diversified revenue streams, and improving, albeit still weak, asset quality. (see 'Fitch Affirms Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks; Outlooks Positive', dated 5 December 2016 and available on www.fitchratings.com). We expect BOIG to become the main debt-issuing entity of the group, issuing an increasing proportion of debt, including additional Tier 1 (AT1) and other hybrid instruments and senior debt. Fitch believes that double leverage is unlikely to increase above 120%, a level at which we would consider notching the holding company's VR and Long-Term IDR below the bank's ratings. This is based on our expectation that the proceeds of any future debt issued at the holding company level will be down-streamed to its operating subsidiaries in the form of internal notes with identical subordination and maturity, therefore avoiding the build-up of additional double leverage at the holding company level. The equalisation of BOIG's VR and IDRs with BOI's also reflects our expectation of no material restrictions to the transfer of capital and liquidity across the group subject to the operating companies meeting regulatory capital and liquidity requirements. SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) BOIG's Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on extraordinary support from the Irish authorities in the event that the group becomes non-viable. In our opinion, the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) provide a framework that is likely to require senior creditors to participate in losses for resolving the group. RATING SENSITIVITIES VR AND IDRS As BOIG's VR and IDRs are equalised with BOI's, they are sensitive to the same factors as BOI's. The Positive Outlook mirrors that on BOI's Long-Term IDR and reflects the potential for upgrading BOI's VRs and IDRs, should the bank continue to further improve its asset quality and strengthen its capitalisation, while continuing to generate satisfactory profits and maintain its sound funding and liquidity. BOIG's VR and IDRs could be notched down from BOI's ratings if double leverage at the holding company increases above 120% or if changing regulatory requirements materially restrict the ability to transfer capital across the group. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upgrade to the SR and upward revision to the SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, this is highly unlikely in Fitch's view.

The United States, Russia and Jordan announced a ceasefire and  de-escalation agreement  for the southwest on Friday and starting on Sunday after a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.  The agreement can be fruitful if it is expanded to all of Syria and includes all the area that we discussed in Astana talks for de-escalating the tension,  Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. In Astana peace talks, Russia, Turkey and Iran tried to finalize an agreement on creating four de-escalation zones in Syria but failed to reach an agreement. Russia and Iran are the main international backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while Washington supports some of the rebel groups fighting to topple him.  Iran is seeking Syria's sovereignty and security so a ceasefire cannot be limited to a certain location...No agreement would be successful without taking the realities on the ground into account,  Qasemi added. Previous similar ceasefires have failed to hold for long and it was not clear how much the actual combatants -- Assad's government forces and the main Syrian rebel armies in the southwest -- are committed to this latest effort. Qasemi said Iran has been fully informed by the Russians on the ceasefire agreement but added that they see some  ambiguities in the deal mainly related to the American recent measures in Syria .

Disturbing. We're at 300k+ suspected cases with ~7k new cases/day,  ICRC regional director Robert Mardini said in a tweet.  The World Health Organization has said there were 297,438 suspected cases and 1,706 deaths by July 7, but it did not publish a daily update on Sunday, when the 300,000 mark looked set to be reached. A WHO spokesman said the figures were still being analyzed by Yemen's health ministry. Although the daily growth rate in the overall number of cases has halved to just over 2 percent in recent weeks and the spread of the disease has slowed in the worst-hit regions, outbreaks in other areas have grown rapidly. The most intense impact has been in areas in the west of the country which have been fiercely contested in the two-year war between a Saudi-led coalition and armed Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. The war has been a breeding ground for the disease, which spreads by faeces getting into food or water and thrives in places with poor sanitation. In the past week a first few cases have appeared in Sayun city and Mukalla port in Hadramawt region in the east. Yemen's economic collapse means 30,000 healthworkers have not been paid for more than 10 months, so the U.N. has stepped in with  incentive  payments to get them involved in an emergency campaign to fight the disease. The WHO has said its response, based on a network of rehydration points and the remnants of Yemen's shattered health system, has succeeded in catching the disease early and keeping the death rate from the disease low, at 0.6 percent of cases. The spread of the disease is also being limited by  herd immunity  - the natural protection afforded by a large proportion of the population contracting and then surviving the disease. It is not yet clear how people could be affected in total. Early in the outbreak, the WHO said there could be 300,000 cases within six months, but on June 27 it said the epidemic may have reached the halfway mark at 218,800 cases. However, since then, the daily number of new cases has risen from an average of about 6,500 to about 7,200, according to a Reuters analysis of WHO data.

Paul Szyarto, head of the Big Data program at the U.S.'s Rutgers University, said many developing nations are attempting to collect, organize and analyze large, varied data sets to uncover patterns and trends to help address poverty. For example, countries like Kenya and India are gathering data related to weather patterns and using models to forecast climate variations, which can help farmers adapt agricultural practices, boost crop yields and tackle hunger. While in West Africa, nations are trying to capture data on previous disease outbreaks, such as Ebola, to predict where an infection may begin, what may cause its spread and identify high risk zones which can be targeted with prevention programs. But Szyarto told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday that developing nations were not utilizing big data analytics to its full potential, largely due to low investment in infrastructure such as hardware, servers and computers.  Thanks to technologically advanced countries, there are several models which could be leveraged to analyze data, but most developing countries lack the infrastructure to capture, gather, store and analyze the data being created,  said Szyarto in an interview via email.  Many of these countries lack the technical devices internally and externally to collect unstructured data due to corruption, low operational cash, and plagued poverty.  Szyarto said there were some efforts by Western governments and tech firms such as Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, to support the development of data capture and analytics programs in poor nations. To deal with increasing populations and build smarter infrastructures and cities, China is, for example, leveraging big data to understand how to best provide solutions for water shortages, housing needs, and employment. While in countries such as Tanzania, Nepal and the Philippines, big data is being used to understand weather and geographical challenges - from analyzing flood and earthquake and tsunami risks - to strengthen disaster preparedness.  But Szyarto - who is a global expert on business transformation and advises firms on making fundamental changes in order to cope with shifts in the market environment - said much more needed to be done.

The offer for Orient Overseas International Ltd (OOIL) comes as China's government pushes to raise the country's profile in global shipping, which dovetails with its Belt and Road initiative aimed at increasing China's influence over distribution from Asia to Europe. Beijing merged two shippers last year to form COSCO Shipping which, after the latest deal, will rise from fourth to rank only behind Denmark's Maersk Line and Switzerland's Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC).  This is negative for Maersk and MSC,  said Corrine Png, chief executive of Singapore-based transport stock researcher Crucial Perspective. A deal would make the Chinese shipper a  tougher competitor to deal with on the major trade lanes.  State-backed COSCO Shipping on Sunday offered to buy each OOIL share at a 31.1 percent premium to their Friday close. A suitor's stock often falls after making a bid, but COSCO Shipping's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 6 percent on Monday to their highest price in almost two years. OOIL stock rose as per usual for a target but at 20 percent, it was short of the offer price. Png said some investors may feel OOIL would be selling too soon after the container industry began to recover from a prolonged slowdown, or that the deal may not pass anti-trust regulators.  This transaction is a sweeter deal for COSCO than for OOIL's shareholders,  she said.  OOIL could boost COSCO's recurring profit by 50 percent in the next two to three years.

Its fortunes soared with the Pearl River Delta export boom of the 1990s, but its once world-leading port now languishes in fifth place by throughput, behind the mainland ports of Shanghai and Shenzhen. COSCO said it would to keep OOIL's global headquarters in Hong Kong but analysts said the city's port would still be affected by its takeover.  COSCO also has (port) investments in Guangzhou,  said Han Ning, China director for Drewry Shipping Consultants, referring to the nearby Chinese city whose port competes with Hong Kong for Pearl River Delta traffic.  So if COSCO is looking at what should be its hub for the Pearl River Delta, it will look to strike a balance between Guangzhou and Hong Kong.  OOIL commands just under 3 percent of the global container shipping market and has significant exposure to the U.S. market. After the deal, COSCO Shipping can expect a U.S. market share of 18 percent from 11-12 percent currently, said COSCO general manager Zunwu Xu at a news conference on Monday. The acquisition would also strengthen COSCO Shipping's position in the port business, Xu said.  The merger would be complementary as OOIL is strong in Transpacific and Intra-Asia trade, and COSCO has strong China domestic trade,  said Samson Lo, head of Asia mergers-and-acquisitions at UBS, which is advising COSCO Shipping.  The terminals and logistics businesses of OOIL can bring further synergies to COSCO as well.  COSCO Shipping is making its offer with Shanghai International Port Group Co Ltd. The shipping line said it would finance the deal with a bridge loan.

CME, whose main shareholder is Time Warner, expects the sale to close by the end of the year and proceeds will go to repay a 250.8 million euro loan due in 2018, it said in a statement on Monday.  That repayment will lower CME's $1 billion debt load and cut its average borrowing cost by 275 basis points to 4.5 percent. Most of the debt is in term loans guaranteed by Time Warner.

Warsaw led equities gains, with its blue-chip index rising by two-thirds of a percent by 0826 GMT, driven by an 1.8 percent rise in oil group PKN Orlen.     The dinar was flat ahead of a meeting of Serbian monetary policy makers who are expected to keep the region's highest key central bank interest rate on hold at 4 percent.      Trading at 120.11 against the euro, the dinar was a shade off Friday's 20-month highs a tick above the key psychological line at 120.     Serbia's central bank has often bought euros in the market this year to stem dinar gains. But it is unlikely to cut rates as it wants to maintain investors' interest in dinar-denominated securities.     While inflation is stable, it observes risks from an increasingly hawkish tone from the main global central banks, also underpinned by Friday's robust U.S. employment data, analysts said.      We would project rising resistance for the dinar,  Raiffeisen analyst Wolfgang Ernst said in a note.       Setbacks could come from domestic topics, such as uncertainties over the renewal of (Serbia's) IMF deal (which will expire in early 2018), possible delays in the privatisation/restructuring of state-owned enterprises, but also from external side,  Ernst added.      A Reuters poll showed last week that analysts see the dinar retreating to 124 against the euro in the next 12 months.      Elsewhere, the Czech crown traded at 26.065 against the euro, approaching Friday's peak of 26.048, which was its strongest level since late 2013.     Its rise has been fuelled by Friday's data which showed  robust growth in industrial output and retail sales in May, reflecting the region's robust economic growth.     The currency has been strengthening since in early April the  Czech central bank removed a cap which had kept the crown weaker than 27 for years.     Before the exit, the bank sold crowns worth tens of billions of euros in the market to defend the cap, boosting its foreign currency reserves     End-June reserve figures released on Monday showed further rise last month, to 124.89 billion euros from a revised 124.01 billion euros in May, while the bank said it did not sell or buy any foreign currency in the spot market in May.

But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated his resolve to maintain ultra-loose monetary policy until inflation is stably above its 2 percent target, a sign the Japanese central bank will not join its U.S. and European counterparts in dialing back stimulus any time soon.  Japan's economy is expected to continue expanding moderately ahead,  Kuroda told a quarterly meeting of the central bank's regional branch managers on Monday. In a quarterly report on regional areas of Japan, the BOJ revised up its assessment for five of nine regions and maintained its upbeat view for the remaining four areas. The report described six regional economies as  expanding moderately  or  moving toward a moderate expansion.  It was the first time the BOJ used such strong language for so many regions since it began compiling the report in April 2005. The upbeat assessment came despite data released earlier on Monday that showed core machinery orders unexpectedly tumbled in May, raising doubts about the economy's strength.  Capital expenditure continues to increase steadily as a trend,  Kimihiro Eto, the BOJ's Osaka branch manager overseeing the western Japan region that is home to big electronics makers, told a news conference. The report will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinize at next week's rate review, when it will release fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections. Taking Some Time In the past two weeks, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada have all switched gears to a more hawkish policy stance, suggesting the era of cheap money is nearing an end. The U.S. Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates twice this year and is seen tightening again before year-end. For Japan, an exit from stimulus is far off the radar. All the same, with the economy gaining momentum, Kuroda has a communication challenge on his hands as he tries to convince markets the BOJ has a credible plan to exit ultra-loose policy - without spooking investors that such a move is imminent. The BOJ will cut its inflation forecasts but hold off expanding stimulus at the July 19-20 meeting, people familiar with the matter say, in another sign the bank is retreating from Kuroda's initial pledge to do whatever it takes to achieve his ambitious inflation target. Shinichi Uchida, head of the BOJ's Nagoya central Japan branch, said improvements in the economy were gradually prompting companies in the region to raise wages and prices.  The economy is clearly doing well and there's a shortage of labor but prices aren't rising much. That's because of Japan's sticky deflationary mindset,  said Uchida.  It's taking some time but prices will eventually start rising.

ADNOC said on Monday it has already begun talks about the planned partnerships and expects to announce them this year. Plans to list some of ADNOC's services businesses come as other Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, have also embarked on floating energy assets in an era of cheap crude.  Saudi oil company Aramco (IPO-ARMO.SE) is planning a listing next year to raise as much as $100 billion to invest in new industries, as the kingdom seeks to diversify beyond oil exports as part of its  Vision 2030  plan. However, ADNOC only plans to list minority stakes in some of its services businesses on local equity markets, rather than an initial public offering (IPO) of the holding company, its chief executive Sultan al-Jaber told The National newspaper.  ADNOC will remain fully owned by the government of Abu Dhabi,  he said in an interview whose contents were later confirmed by the company in a statement.  This is very much in line with what other Middle East or oil producing countries are looking into due to the low oil price environment,  Abishek Deshpande, chief energy analyst at Natixis, said of the ADNOC plans.     Oman said earlier this year it planned to offer shares in some state-owned downstream energy companies to the public.

New Partners ADNOC has been talking to banks about the listings, with the company's profitable businesses likely to be floated, a source familiar with the deal said.   FILE PHOTO: Logos of ADNOC are seen at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan, April 4, 2017.Toru Hanai/File PhotoThe group has already begun to rationalize its businesses and a merger of three of its shipping and marine services businesses is expected to be completed by the end of the year. It also has another services business called ADNOC Distribution which operates service stations across the United Arab Emirates and supplies aviation fuels.  ADNOC is seeking  large trading houses, international pension funds, private equity investors and global infrastructure specialists rather than just national oil companies and international oil companies,  the National, an Abu Dhabi-based newspaper, reported.  It is looking to the new investors to support it in securing market access for its products, especially in Asia and a new co-investment approach would lead to a  more open partnership model , Jaber said.  The company would remain the major shareholder but would offer  strategic partnerships and co-investments across our service and refining businesses and select infrastructure assets, such as ADNOC pipelines and storage facilities  he said.  Potential areas for partnership include the development and expansion of a leading, regional drilling company and a new energy infrastructure venture as well as downstream ventures, The National reported.

MSCI's emerging markets benchmark posted its best day in two weeks, helped by gains of more than 1 percent in Hong Kong and Russian dollar-stocks. Poland and Turkey also rose 0.6-0.8 percent. Last week a rout spread across emerging assets as investors took fright at the prospect of higher interest rates and less stimulus from developed market central banks. Emerging stocks, which have jumped some 16 percent since the start of the year and top performance league tables, look vulnerable to the expected dollar appreciation, Credit Suisse said in a note. reut.rs/2ne9sjH  While long-term fundamentals remain relatively supportive, the short-term picture is more challenging,  Credit Suisse said.  High earnings expectations provide room for disappointment and the relative earnings revisions have been the weakest of all the main regions.  For the time being though, the dollar remains tepid, supporting emerging currencies. South Africa's rand snapped a three-day losing streak and strengthened 0.6 percent, helped also by parliament challenging a proposal from the anti-graft watchdog to change the central bank's mandate. Questions over the central bank's mandate and its independence have weighed on assets of Africa's most industrialised nation in recent weeks. Turkey's lira strengthened 0.4 percent, while Russia's rouble traded flat, giving away earlier gains after oil prices lost steam again. In Serbia, tame inflation is expected to persuade central bank policy makers to keep the benchmark rate unchanged at 4 percent - the highest interest rate in the region.  The decision to keep rates unchanged is also supported by the stronger dinar that has led to tighter monetary conditions,  Raiffeisen Bank International analysts told clients. They also noted the dinar had outperformed other central European currencies over the past three months, firming 3 percent against the euro in this period.

The producer price index (PPI) rose 5.5 percent in June from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday. This was in line with analyst forecasts and unchanged from the previous month.  Prices of raw materials are making a modest recovery, helped by stronger futures prices in China over the past few weeks, after an earlier hit taken from a broader cooling in economic activity since March. China's June consumer prices rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier, in line with market expectations and May's reading, the NBS said, with food prices continuing their declines albeit at a slower pace. There are some concerns among analysts that price pressures could weaken throughout the rest of the year as economic fundamentals soften.  The upshot is that, having eased in previous months, price pressures appear to have stabilized in June,  Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a note.  Nonetheless, with slowing credit growth likely to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters we think that, volatility in food prices aside, inflation still has further to fall. This will disappoint those hoping for a sustained period of reflation that could help to erode corporate debt burdens.  Food prices, the biggest component of the consumer price index, fell at a slower 1.2 percent from the previous year, after sliding 1.6 percent in May and 3.5 percent in April.   Falling food prices can be attributed to a high build-up of food reserves and seasonal factors,  Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Center (SIC), said, according to a story published on Monday in China's Financial News newspaper, affiliated with the People's Bank of China (PBOC). Tepid inflation comes despite signs of a pickup in factory activity. China's manufacturing sector expanded at the quickest pace in three months in June, buoyed by strong production and new orders. Meanwhile, spot iron ore and construction steel prices have risen as investors continued to focus on China's capacity cutbacks and industrial upgrade in the steel sector.  High margins after the government's effort to eliminate low-grade steel are enticing mills to produce more steel, which increases the need for iron ore,  said Zou Mingdong, Shanghai-based steel manager at Zhongcai Merchants Investment Group.  However, the rising price doesn't change the fundamental situation of oversupply and weak demand.  China's biggest steel maker, Baoshan Iron & Steel (600019.SS), cut its main steel products prices for May and June after a long series of increases. On a month-on-month basis, the PPI fell 0.2 percent in June. China is targeting economic growth of around 6.5 percent this year and inflation of 3 percent. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in a speech at the World Economic Forum that China is capable of achieving its full-year growth target and controlling systemic risks despite challenges.

The yen came within touching distance of a four-month low against the dollar in early London trade, with investors adding to bets that play on the divergence between rising Western government bond yields and low Japanese equivalents.  Dovish expectations regarding the BoJ's policy, combined with the U.S. yields are supportive of a further yen depreciation against the U.S. dollar,  said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior market analyst at London Capital Group who expects dollar bulls to target 115 yen in the weeks to come. U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, signs of labor market strength that could keep the Fed on course for a third interest rate hike this year despite sluggish wage gains. Bond yields have also diverged in recent weeks, helping  carry trades  that borrow cheaply in one currency to buy in another with higher interest rates. The spread between 10-year U.S. Treasury yields and its Japanese counterpart traded at its widest in two months.  Carry trades are back in vogue and that can be seen in the yen's price action this morning but we should see some consolidation before Yellen's testimony this week,  said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony is the key highlight of this week for market watchers where she may hold out the possibility of another Fed rate hike before the end of the year. Against the dollar, the yen traded at a two-month low of 114.30 in early trades. The yen's weakness was also noticeable on the crosses as the the Bank of Japan reiterated its stimulus plans on Monday after the central bank showed its determination last week to defend its commitment to keep the 10-year yield around zero percent. On Monday, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated the central bank's resolve to maintain its massive stimulus programme until inflation is stably above its 2 percent target. Against the euro, the yen was trading at 130.33 its weakest since Feb. 8, 2016. The Australian dollar was also strong against the yen.

As her minority government prepares to start the difficult task of passing Brexit through parliament, May will remind Britons of her promise to build a fairer society, seeking to repair a reputation damaged by an ill-judged snap election. Almost one year on from her first day as prime minister -- a job she took on after Britain's shock referendum vote to leave the European Union -- May will urge voters and political opponents to help her  tackle the injustice and vested interests that threaten to hold us back .  My commitment to change in Britain is undimmed,  May will say on Tuesday, according to advanced extracts from her speech.  May called the election on June 8 in an attempt to cash in on high poll ratings and win support for her plan to make a clean break with the EU in 2019. Related Coverage'A damp squib': EU parliament reacts to UK proposal on citizensBut the gamble backfired when voters stripped her of a majority in parliament and forced her party into a deal with a small Northern Irish party to prop up a minority government.  In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in parliament as well as in the country,  May will say. Confidence Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May  in Henley-on-Thames, Britain, June 30, 2017.Toby MelvilleMay's ability to carry on as prime minister and drive Brexit legislation through parliament with only a fragile majority behind her has been persistently questioned since the election.  But May's position seems secure for now, with colleagues preferring to see her start Brexit talks rather than topple her and risk the government collapsing -- a scenario that could let a resurgent opposition Labour Party into power.    The first stage of the Brexit process will come later this week when a key piece of legislation, which translates EU law into British law, is presented to parliament. Damian Green, who as First Secretary of State is effectively May's deputy, told Sky News he was confident the government could get the legislation through . Asked about media reports of plots to oust her, Green said it was simply  gossip and chatter  at summer parties.  There is no credible plot going on,  he said.  The prime minister is determined to carry on, to lead the party and the country for many years to come and the overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs (lawmakers) are behind her in that.  May will make the appeal for national backing at the launch of a report into how the government should protect workers affected by a shift to different employment models, including the 'gig economy' championed by the likes of Uber and Deliveroo. The report is a key element of May's plan to address dissatisfaction expressed at the referendum by working class Britons who felt left behind by globalization.  At this critical time in our history, we can either be timid or we can be bold,  May will say.  We will act with an unshakeable sense of purpose to build the better, fairer Britain which we all want to see.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.4 percent at 7,377.92  points by 0848 GMT, whereas the mid caps were down 0.1 percent, held back by a 32 percent fall in Carillion's shares. The construction and support services group plunged nearly 40 percent after its CEO stepped down as it issued a full-year profit warning, citing difficult markets and deterioration in some contracts. Carillion is one of the most-shorted UK firms, according to FCA disclosure data.  (Carillion's) issued a profit warning, saying that profits are going to be lower ...  also they've got a big debt pile, which isn't getting any smaller, and that all raises the prospect that they might have to raise more capital, perhaps through a rights issue at some stage,  said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  Put all these things together, add on top of that the CEO stepping down and you've got a pretty grisly statement and consequently a very negative reaction from the market.  Peer Balfour Beatty also fell almost 5 percent. While moves among blue chips were fairly muted, financials added the most points to the index, with lenders HSBC and Standard Chartered making gains. A firmer energy sector also helped lift the FTSE, with heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell and BP both up around 0.3 percent. Precious metals miner Fresnillo was the biggest laggard, down 1.1 percent as the price of gold dropped to its lowest level in nearly four months, while peer Randgold Resources was also down 0.2 percent. Basic resources firms Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Glencore helped bring up the rear, down between 0.7 percent to 1.1 percent on the back of a weaker copper price.

Liberty are making very clear indications of where they want to take the sport and that could well lead to either long-term licences or franchises,  deputy principal Bob Fernley told Reuters at the Austrian Grand Prix.  That to me is where it should be going because that then locks in the teams,  he added. Formula One's current commercial agreements with teams run to 2020 and Liberty, who took over the sport in January, are drawing up a road map for the future without divulging much detail. A spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Management have already said they want a fairer distribution of revenues to help smaller teams become more competitive and prevent them from folding for financial reasons, as many have in the past. McLaren's executive director Zak Brown spoke of the  franchise value  of teams when he discussed a range of issues at the weekend and pointed out that he could not recall the last time an NFL team went bust. Fernley said such a U.S.-style system would also lock in the value of  tradeable assets , with 10 teams the ideal number and any would-be new entrants having to buy into the existing franchises. With that in mind, Force India were mulling removing  India  from the team name to make it less geographically specific and appeal to global sponsors. A range of companies using the name  Force One  were recently registered in Britain using the London address of co-owner Vijay Mallya. Mallya is currently fighting an extradition battle with India over unpaid loans tied to his defunct Kingfisher Airlines. The businessman, who has not left Britain since March last year, has repeatedly dismissed the charges against him. He has said his current legal situation has nothing to do with any team name change.  What we are looking at is positioning the team...in order to be able to make sure they (the shareholders) are in line with where the future of Formula One is going,  said Fernley.  Obviously India limits where we go.  The value is in the name, like LA Lakers or New York Yankees. They become tradeable programmes.  All we're trying to do as a  team is anticipate. And part of Formula One is about being ahead of the game.  (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-forceindia-idUSL4N1K12TD"},

Hidetomo Kimura's traveling 'Art Aquarium' exhibition puts on display around 5,000 goldfish and 3,000 other maritime creatures, such as seahorses, in 130 LED-lit tanks of various shapes, colors and sizes.    Slideshow (13 Images)The LED displays provide a colorful variety of moving images, such as one of sakura blossoms falling serenely from the sky, to the accompaniment of music.   I wanted to create an artistic installation which is alive by using real fish, rather than materials or pictures,  Kimura said on the sidelines of the exhibition. Kimura creates similar installations several times a year to show all over Japan. This year's 'Art Aquarium', which marks a decade since Kimura's first such display, is also set to show in the western city of Kyoto in the fall.     This year's exhibition features hundreds of varieties of goldfish, including several cross-bred species. The fish swim in bubbling fishbowls made of magnifying glass, draped with lace or shaped like Japanese lanterns, among others. One of the new works this year, in which Black Moor goldfish swirl about as their shadows are projected onto a white LED screen, creates an illusion of a Japanese ink-and-wash painting.   The exhibition is on show at the Nihonbashi Mitsui Hall till Sept 24.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.4 percent by 0720 GMT, rising in concert with euro zone stocks and blue-chips. Strong gains in banks led by Bank of Ireland boosted the benchmarks, while basic resources were weak. Outside the main bluechips, UK midcap construction support services company Carillion grabbed traders' attention after a profit warning and CEO exit sent its shares tumbling nearly 40 percent in heavy volumes. Carillion shares are among the most heavily shorted across the UK market with hedge funds including Marshall Wace and Naya Capital reporting sizeable bearish bets according to FCA disclosure data. The worst-performing European stock was infrastructure company Balfour Beatty, down 3.7 percent as traders read across from Carillion. In broader markets, Germany's DAX rose 0.6 percent, maintaining an edge over peers after export and import figures came in stronger than expected, with a wider increase in exports adding to the trade surplus of Europe’s biggest economy. Shipping company Moeller-Maersk jumped 3.1 percent to a 14-month high and top STOXX gainer after Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for it and peer Hapag, on an analysis of shipping rates. The broker however estimated a recent cyber-attack could take a $150-200 million chunk out of Maersk's revenue in the third quarter, leaving its overall profit forecast for the firm unchanged at $1.5 billion. Shares in Norwegian conglomerate Orkla were among the strongest performers, up 2.4 percent after Norsk Hydro clinched a $3.2 billion deal to buy aluminum products maker Sapa by purchasing a 50 percent stake from Orkla. The acquirer itself only rose 1 percent. CHR Hansen gained 1.8 percent after a raise to 'buy' from Goldman Sachs, which said the company had strong pricing power. The broker found input costs for European consumer staples increased 13 percent year-to-date versus 2016, suggesting 2017 would be the first year of input cost inflation since 2011, helping drive firmer pricing.  As input costs rise, we prefer companies with pricing power (from high gross margins or concentrated market structure) and/or self-help opportunities,  analysts at Goldman said. Food and beverage companies were the best-performing sector, up 0.7 percent, with Unilever leading the FTSE 100. German utility E.ON rose 2.5 percent, leading the buoyant utilities sector after HSBC said recent weakness offered an  excellent buying opportunity , raising the stock to a 'buy' from 'reduce'. Analysts at UBS said although relative outperformance of European versus U.S. equities has slowed recently, they saw the region regaining momentum as monetary policy began to tighten.  Europe craves higher rates and U.S. bond yields,  they wrote, pointing to the region's higher weighting in materials, industrials, financials and energy, against U.S. equities' concentration in technology and consumer discretionary sectors more suited to lower rates.

The warrants were issued under an investigation into the movement of the U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of orchestrating the attempted coup on July 15, state-run Anadolu news agency reported. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the secularist CHP, told a huge crowd on Sunday Turkey was living under dictatorship and pledged to keep challenging the government after completing a 25-day protest march from Ankara to Istanbul. Police have so far detained 42 of the staff from Istanbul's prestigious Bogazici University and Medeniyet University, which is based on the Asian side of the country's largest city, Anadolu said. It said eight of the 72 were from Bogazici, including well-known academic Koray Caliskan, who worked in the past as a voluntary adviser to Kilicdaroglu, according to a CHP official. The other 64 people being detained were from Medeniyet University, 19 of whom were medical faculty professors, Anadolu said. All were suspected users of ByLock, an encrypted messaging app the government says was used by Gulen's followers. About 50,000 people have been arrested and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers, have been suspended in the crackdown under emergency rule which was imposed soon after the attempted military takeover. Kilicdaroglu launched his 450 km (280 mile) march after fellow MP Enis Berberoglu became the first CHP lawmaker jailed in the purge, sentenced to 25 years in jail on spying charges. Rights groups and government critics say Turkey has been drifting toward authoritarianism for years, a process they say accelerated since the coup bid and a referendum in April granting President Tayyip Erdogan sweeping new powers. The government says the crackdown and constitutional changes are necessary to address security threats. More than 240 people were killed in the coup attempt.

The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) announced late on Friday it would cut its refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent and several other policy rates by the same amount. Changes that took effect from Monday also included a 50 basis point cut to some local lending rates for priority sectors. The announcement came days after the International Monetary Fund said in a report that monetary policy should remain on hold in Vietnam, still suffering fallout from a 2011 banking crisis. But the central bank said the rate-cuts would boost economic growth, which is lagging the communist state's 6.7 percent target for 2017. The economy grew at an annualised 5.73 percent in the first half. In 2016, Vietnam reported 6.21 percent growth, below the revised target of 6.3-6.5 percent. Monday's central bank statement said the rate move was made  on the basis of having assessed slow inflation . Annual consumer price inflation in June was just over 2.5 percent, the slowest pace since July 2016. Banking expert Nguyen Tri Hieu said the rate-cuts could help spur growth, but could also push credit into sectors such as real estate, in which excess lending helped cause the last financial crisis. At the end of March, only 2.35 percent of Vietnam's bank loans were bad debts, according to the SBV. In 2012, the percentage got as high as 17.2 percent But the IMF noted that the ratio of private sector credit to gross domestic product of 124 percent was significantly higher than in comparable Southeast Asian countries and in others at a similar levels of development. Capital Economics said Vietnam's rate cut could fuel a further surge in credit growth - which is targeted at 18 percent this year.  A sharp rise in non-performing loans is likely unless the central bank is prepared to reverse course soon,  the consultancy said. Nguyen Duc Thanh, head of the Vietnam Institute for Economic and Policy Research, said Vietnam must be very cautious in the next six to nine months. The cost of seeking higher GDP growth  could be rising inflation at year-end or the beginning of next year,  Thanh said. Still, banking analyst and government advisor Can Van Luc said higher credit growth was reasonable in Vietnam because other sources of business funding such as stocks and bonds were undeveloped.  The cut is quite nominal, which shows the central bank's caution over rising inflation and potential interest rate pressure if the Fed increases rates further,  Luc said.  If we keep rates high amid such low inflation, it will create an unsympathetic mentality among both businesses and citizens,  he added.

Hidetomo Kimura's traveling 'Art Aquarium' exhibition puts on display around 5,000 goldfish and 3,000 other maritime creatures, such as seahorses, in 130 LED-lit tanks of various shapes, colors and sizes.    Slideshow (13 Images)The LED displays provide a colorful variety of moving images, such as one of sakura blossoms falling serenely from the sky, to the accompaniment of music.   I wanted to create an artistic installation which is alive by using real fish, rather than materials or pictures,  Kimura said on the sidelines of the exhibition. Kimura creates similar installations several times a year to show all over Japan. This year's 'Art Aquarium', which marks a decade since Kimura's first such display, is also set to show in the western city of Kyoto in the fall.     This year's exhibition features hundreds of varieties of goldfish, including several cross-bred species. The fish swim in bubbling fishbowls made of magnifying glass, draped with lace or shaped like Japanese lanterns, among others. One of the new works this year, in which Black Moor goldfish swirl about as their shadows are projected onto a white LED screen, creates an illusion of a Japanese ink-and-wash painting.   The exhibition is on show at the Nihonbashi Mitsui Hall till Sept 24.

With years of massive debt purchases and negative ECB interest rates apparently coming to an end, the monthly survey, conducted on July 6-8, showed investors were more pessimistic than ever before about the impact of central bank policy on the European bond market.   For a few months now, it has been clear to investors that the ECB must leave its expansive course,  Sentix, a research institute that specializes in market sentiment and behavioral finance, said in a statement.   This expectation has intensified for investors over the past few weeks.  Sentix's Central Bank Policy index fell to -26 in July, the lowest level since the gauge was launched in 2005, from -11.5 in June, the survey of 1,022 investors showed. Yields on euro zone government bonds have already started rising after ECB President Mario Draghi hinted last month at possible policy changes to reflect the euro zone's economic recovery. Separately, Sentix's gauge of economic sentiment in the euro zone showed some signs of plateauing. It came in at 28.3 points in July after hitting a 10-year high at 28.4 last month, due mainly to a worsening in investor expectations for the currency bloc's economy. That sub-index fell to 19.8 from 21. Investors' assessment of current conditions improved further, however, hitting a new 10-year high of 37.3, up from 36 in June.

In the bond market, payrolls have been a non-event,  said a credit trader. The Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment-grade index was unchanged at 88bp/89bp, while Korean sovereign 5-year CDS widened 2bp to 60bp/62bp. In investment-grade corporate credit, Adani Ports' 2027 bonds tightened 1bp to Treasuries plus 175bp, while Korea East-West Power's 2022s tightened by the same amount to 95bp over. Baidu's 2022 notes tightened 6bp to a Treasury spread of 103bp. Dalian Wanda's 2024 bonds gained half a point to a cash price of 106, after it said it had agreed to sell 76 hotels and majority stakes in 13 culture and tourism projects to Sunac China Holdings for Rmb63.2bn (US$9.3bn). In response, Sunac's 2019 bonds fell half a point to a cash price of 104.5.  This will take a while for investors to digest,  said the trader.  It's a big deal and a lot of money.  Chong Hing Bank's 2020 bonds widened 10bp to Treasuries plus 210bp after it warned on Friday that it expected first-half profits to be down 16% from a year ago, due partly to an increase in impairments.

Parliament said the affidavit by Speaker Baleka Mbete was in support of the South African Reserve Bank's legal bid to quash the recommendation, which was made by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, the head of the powerful anti-graft unit. The proposal is also being challenged by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. Mbete said Mkhwebane's bid to force the central bank to target growth rather than inflation was unconstitutional as it was beyond the scope of the her mandate and encroached on Parliament's domain of enacting legislation. Mkhwebane made the proposal to change the bank's mandate when she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of a bank that was subsequently bought by Absa, now a unit of Barclays Africa Group.  Nobody can rationally suggest that the failure by the South African government and the Reserve Bank to recover money from a bank is appropriately remedied by stripping the bank of its primary object of protecting the value of the currency,  speaker Mbete said in an affidavit published on the Parliament website. Mkhwebane is opposing the challenges to her recommendation. It is unclear what prompted Mkhwebane's recommendation and analysts say it would be up to the courts to decide whether her mandate extends to the central bank.

Gavan, a Romanian climber, had abandoned his own efforts to scale the world's ninth-tallest mountain a week earlier to lead the search for Alberto Zerain from Spain and Mariano Galvan from Argentina. Detailing the desperate search for Zerain and Galvan for the first time to Reuters, Gavan said he had even spoken to them over a satellite phone just a day before they went missing on June 24, when they stopped responding to calls. The two experienced climbers had chosen a daring route to ascend the 8,126 meter (26,660 feet) Nanga Parbat via the treacherous 13 km (8 miles) Mazeno Ridge, which had been scaled successfully only once before. However, Gavan became desperate after June 24 when Zerain and Galvan lost radio contact near the ridge, realizing that the two men had run out of food. Rescue efforts were called off after a final helicopter flight over the ridge on July 1. Photographic evidence suggests an avalanche had struck some time in the preceding eight days.     Just where the avalanche debris is was their last GPS location,  Gavan told Reuters, speaking of their last known signal on Mazeno Ridge.  In the photos you see the tracks of the climbers ... suddenly end at the avalanche fracture line and do not appear anywhere after the fracture line,  he said. Geographically, Pakistan is a hot destination for climbers, but climbing deaths are also common. A drawing of details of the disaster and terrain made by the photographer at the Base Camp at Nanga Parbat, Pakistan June 28, 2017. Picture taken June 28, 2017.  Alex Gavan/Handout via REUTERSIt rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (22,966 feet) and is home to the world's second-tallest mountain, K2. In all, it has five of the world's 14 summits higher than 8,000 meters (26,247 feet). However, Pakistan offers other challenges for climbers. In 2012, Islamist gunmen dressed as policemen stormed the 4,200-metre (13,780-foot) Nanga Parbat base camp, killing 10 foreign climbers and a Pakistani guide. Elite Club Slideshow (4 Images)Galvan and Zerain both loved climbing. The Spaniard was part of an elite club of climbers who have scaled the world's two tallest mountains, Everest and K2. Galvan climbed Everest in 2012 but an attempt to climb K2 alone and without oxygen ended at 7,300 meters (23,950 feet). Romania's Gavan said the search for Zerain and Galvan was delayed by a day because they did not have insurance, which meant he had to find the collateral for a rescue mission. Gavan, who wrote a report on the failed search, said the pictures taken during a second helicopter search on July 1 were conclusive proof that the two men died in an avalanche.   We looked down the ridge, we looked in the valleys, we looked everywhere, we triple checked,  he said. An eight-member team from the Pakistani mountaineering company Karakorum Expeditions began a new ground search on Friday despite Gavan's evidence.  The team will search on the Mazeno Ridge of the Nanga Parbat, where the missing climbers are believed to be buried under an avalanche,  company spokesman Mehboob Ali said.

Parliament said the affidavit by Speaker Baleka Mbete was in support of the South African Reserve Bank's legal bid to quash the recommendation, which was made by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, the head of the powerful anti-graft unit. The proposal is also being challenged by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. Mbete said Mkhwebane's bid to force the central bank to target growth rather than inflation was unconstitutional as it was beyond the scope of the her mandate and encroached on Parliament's domain of enacting legislation. Mkhwebane made the proposal to change the bank's mandate when she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of a bank that was subsequently bought by Absa, now a unit of Barclays Africa Group.  Nobody can rationally suggest that the failure by the South African government and the Reserve Bank to recover money from a bank is appropriately remedied by stripping the bank of its primary object of protecting the value of the currency,  speaker Mbete said in an affidavit published on the Parliament website. Mkhwebane is opposing the challenges to her recommendation. It is unclear what prompted Mkhwebane's recommendation and analysts say it would be up to the courts to decide whether her mandate extends to the central bank.

A strong U.S. payrolls report on Friday afternoon added to the pain for the pound after unexpected falls in already very slow UK construction, manufacturing and industrial output. That raises the stakes around UK wage and unemployment numbers this week; poor readings could further undermine the credibility of BoE officials' statements around possible rate hikes in the coming months.  Little sign of wage growth could trigger a BoE reality check,  said ING analyst Viraj Patel, also pointing to a speech by Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent on Tuesday as a potential mover for the pound.  With markets still pricing in around a 45 percent chance of a rate hike later this year, we continue to believe that a dovish re-pricing – and a move lower in short-term UK rates – remains the key downside risk to sterling in the near-term,  he said. The pound was virtually unchanged from closing levels in New York on Friday at $1.2890. It dipped by less than 0.1 percent to 88.52 pence per euro. The outlook for the economy and BoE rates have dominated the month trade since a shocking electoral setback for Prime Minister Theresa May on June 8. Many companies and investors had begun to believe the worst of the pound's post-Brexit referendum sell-off was now behind them. But there are also nerves that a weak government and the impact of a slow departure from Europe on growth and investment leaves the currency exposed over the coming years. Surveys on Monday showed major companies have curtailed their investment plans and that consumers spent less on their credit cards.

Hingis became world number one in 1997, at the age of 16, and won her first Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S Open singles titles that year.  She won 40 singles trophies before her initial retirement at 22 and returned for a year in 2006, making a full return in 2013.  The education, in tennis terms, was better,  Hingis told the Times.  The age rule was different then, now it's stricter (the WTA limits the number of tournaments a player under 18 can compete in). Today, everyone just hits hard, harder and hardest.   There are a lot of players who don't really strike me. They have a good match or two but I'm like 'OK, is there something more in this player that I could see is going to be a future champion?'  The WTA introduced age eligibility rules in the 90s, which have since been updated and enforced more strictly to prevent players from burning out and retiring early. Youngsters rarely make an impact in the latter stages of big events these days, with Latvian Jelena Ostapenko being the exception, winning the French Open two days after her 20th birthday and progressing to the fourth round at Wimbledon. Ostapenko will face Elina Svitolina in the fourth round on Monday while Hingis, who has won 59 doubles titles, and partner Chan Yung-jan will face India's Sania Mirza and Belgian Kirsten Flipkens in the third round of the women's doubles tournament.

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Diversified Business, Stable Cash Flow: CKHH's ratings reflect its strong business profile, geographical diversification and stable cash flow generation from its high-quality ports, retail, infrastructure, energy and telecommunications businesses. No single business division accounts for more than 40% of EBITDA. The infrastructure and ports businesses provide visible, recurring cash flows. Capital Intensive Business: CKHH's ports, infrastructure and telecommunications businesses are capital intensive and push up leverage, which constrains the overall ratings. There is also an element of structural subordination of cash flows, especially in the utilities and infrastructure assets, given the level of debt at the asset-owning level and that the operating cash flows of these businesses can only be accessed via dividends. European Telecoms' Positive FCF: We expect CKHH's European telecom operations to remain FCF-positive in the medium term. 3 Group Europe has posted positive FCF (EBITDA after capex and licence fees) since 2014, after a number of years of cash drain. We expect a reversal in 3 Italia's negative FCF position, as it realises significant synergies from the 2016 merger between 3 Italia and VEON Ltd.'s (formerly VimpelCom Ltd, BB+/Stable) Italian operations, Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA (Wind, B+/Stable). The 50/50 venture, Wind Tre SpA, is one of Italy's largest mobile operators by subscribers, with a market share of over 35%, up from 3 Italia's 12% market share pre-merger, improving its competitiveness and profitability in a highly competitive market. Results in Line with Expectations: CKHH's financial and operating results for the year ended 2016 were broadly in line with Fitch's expectations, despite being affected by foreign-exchange movements against its reporting Hong Kong dollar currency. Reported EBITDA, stripping out currency effects, increased by 6%, with solid contributions from all businesses. Ports registered lower throughput of 3% from weaker trading volume and competition, but EBITDA margins were stable, supported by cost-efficiency measures. Retail continued to perform well, with earnings supported by organic growth in Asia, despite a fall in same-store sales, and Europe. Reported EBITDA benefitted from the performance of CKHH's infrastructure investments, led by its subsidiary, CK Infrastructure Holdings Limited (CKI, A-/Stable), although this was partly offset by weakness in the energy segment, from its associated company, Husky Energy, due to low oil prices. Stable Financial Profile: We expect FFO-adjusted net leverage to remain at or below 4.0x in 2017-2019 (2016: 3.9x), barring significant debt-funded acquisitions or a rise in the dividend pay-out ratio. Reported financial performance is exposed to currency-volatility effects, as seen in 2015 and 2016. CKHH mitigates such risks by broadly matching the denomination of debt with the currency of underlying assets. Zero dividends from Husky Energy have been factored into our 2017-2018 forecasts, given cash-flow management initiatives in a low oil and gas price environment. Strong Liquidity, Access to Funding: CKHH's ratings are supported by its robust liquidity profile and ease of access to capital. Fitch-adjusted cash and cash equivalents, which exclude other reported liquid assets of HKD6 billion, amounted to HKD156 billion at end-2016, and debt maturities are well-laddered. CKHH has strong access to capital markets. DERIVATION SUMMARY CKHH's ratings are supported by its diversified business - by geography and segment - providing it with stable cash flows and supporting its strong business profile. There are few peers with similar business models as CKHH is a conglomerate with infrastructure, ports, retail and telecoms segments.  However, CKHH is somewhat comparable to CLP Holdings Limited (CLPH, A/Stable) although CLPH - an integrated and largely regulated utility (through its key Hong Kong business CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (A/Stable) - has a stronger business profile, and historically a more robust financial profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - Moderate Fitch-adjusted revenue growth in 2017-2018 - Fitch-adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%-25% in 2017-2018 (2016: 24%) - No dividends from Husky Energy or Wind Tre in 2017-2018 - Dividend pay-out ratio of around 30% in 2017-2018 - Acquisitions in 2017 include investment in Duet (via CKI) and acquisition of UK Broadband. No major acquisitions or disposals in 2018 RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - FFO-adjusted net leverage exceeding 4.0x on a sustained basis; - Substantially negative free cash flow after acquisitions and disposals; - Significant changes in business mix and capital structure management adverse to its credit risk profile; - A weakening quality or decreased quantity of recurring cash flows. Positive: Developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive ration action include: Provided the business profile of CKHH remains unchanged: - FFO-adjusted net leverage of 3.0x or less on a sustained basis; and - Positive free cash flow after acquisitions and dividends on a sustained basis FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS CK Hutchison Holdings Limited Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'A-'; Outlook Stable Senior unsecured rating affirmed at 'A-' CK Hutchison Capital Securities (17) Limited Ratings on subordinated bonds affirmed at 'BBB' CK Hutchison International (17) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' CK Hutchison International (16) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' CK Hutchison Finance (16) (II) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' CK Hutchison Finance (16) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa Europe Finance (12) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa Finance (CI) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa Finance UK PLC Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa International (03/33) Limited Ratings on senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa International (09) Limited Ratings on senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa International (09/19) Limited Ratings on senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa International (11) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa International (12) (II) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa International (14) Limited Ratings on all senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Hutchison Whampoa Europe Finance (13) Limited Ratings on subordinated bonds affirmed at 'BBB' Hutchison Whampoa Finance (14) Limited Ratings on senior unsecured bonds affirmed at 'A-' Contact: Primary Analyst Isabelle Katsumata Senior Director +65 6796 7226 Fitch Ratings Singapore Pte Ltd One Raffles Quay South Tower #22-11 Singapore 048583 Secondary Analyst Renee Lam Director +852 2263 9971 Committee Chairperson Jeong Min Pak Senior Director +82 2 3278 8360 Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Fitch adjustments include Fitch-adjusted EBITDA, which is reported EBITDA, less EBITDA contribution from associates and JVs, plus dividends from associates and JVs.

The bidding process for offshore blocks 1, 4, 8, 9 and 10, three of which border Israeli waters, was postponed for years because of political paralysis in Lebanon until the formation of a new government late last year. Lebanon, along with Cyprus, Israel and Egypt, sits on the Levant basin in the Mediterranean where gas fields have been discovered since 2009.

The 86-year-old did the original deal with the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) that runs until 2026 and includes a break clause from 2019 that has to be exercised two years in advance.  I would be surprised if eventually we lose Silverstone,  he told Reuters at the Austrian Grand Prix.  It's a good event. And it probably falls into line much more with the way Liberty want to see Formula One go, in that direction.  An announcement by the BRDC is expected on Tuesday or Wednesday, ahead of Sunday's British Grand Prix at the former World War Two airfield.  U.S.-based Liberty Media, who took over the sport in January and moved Ecclestone aside into an undefined 'chairman emeritus' role, have said that they want to protect Formula One's traditional European races. Silverstone hosted the first world championship grand prix in 1950 and Britain, home to a majority of the 10 teams as well as triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, has been on the calendar every year since then. Sean Bratches, the sport's new commercial managing director, last week described Silverstone as 'one of the jewels in the crown of Grand Prix racing'. The BRDC has indicated that activating the break clause would allow them to negotiate a better deal than the current one and steer clear of the 'potentially ruinous risk' of hosting fees that rise every year. Ecclestone said Silverstone, who pay less than most other circuits on the calendar, had got  a very good deal .  I'm surprised they can't make it work, that's all,  he added.  At the moment there isn't anywhere else. There may well be in a couple of years' time. But if they are losing all the money, which is what they say they are doing, they can't continue can they? Because somebody has to pay.  McLaren's executive director Zak Brown suggested at the weekend that Liberty should buy Silverstone but Ecclestone smiled at that suggestion.  It's like all these people with ideas who don't really know what they are talking about,  he said, adding that he had made an offer in the past.  The BRDC. Just too much confusion,  he said when asked what had stopped him.  They wanted all sorts of things. Anyway, it couldn't happen.

The sovereign wealth fund, which manages an estimated $343 billion of assets, has delivered its worst annual performance since 2001 barring the financial crisis. The outlook is depressing too. The challenges of investing overseas compound the mood at home as the city's first family feud in an ugly public squabble.  Stripping out inflation, the wealth fund reported a 20-year annualised real return of 3.7 percent, compared to a rolling return of 4 percent last year. Including inflation does not improve the picture. Average nominal returns also underperformed GIC's own reference portfolio, which comprises 65 percent global equities and 35 percent global bonds. The fund uses the reference portfolio to measure its risk tolerance, rather than as a performance benchmark. GIC has been increasing its exposure to bonds and cash for the past two years. That has come at the expense of equities, on the back of concerns that stock market valuations had overrun. But in a world of still-low interest rates and abundant liquidity, bond yields have remained depressed and equities have continued to rise. GIC now warns it is prepared for a protracted period of low returns. One issue is that it has always had a lower risk appetite than smaller cross-town state investor Temasek, which is expected to report strong results later this week.  Singapore could do without such sombre predictions from one of its most prominent entities. For several weeks, the financial centre has been grappling with an ugly spat between Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his siblings. The family feud, partly over whether to demolish an old family home or let it become a heritage site, threatens to upend the city's image as a beacon of stability. GIC’s performance simply reinforces the impression that Singapore is facing hard times. BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Macron insisted at a meeting on Sunday that plans to rein in France's wealth tax and scrap local property taxes for 80 percent of those currently paying them begin to take effect in 2018, the ministry source said, confirming earlier French media reports. The president's intervention comes just days after his Prime Minister Edouard Philippe had suggested the cuts would be postponed into 2019 as France struggles to contain its public deficit. In an alarming report last month, the Court of Auditors said a budget shortfall left by former president Francois Hollande's government would result in a deficit of 3.2 percent of national output this year compared with the Hollande government's forecast of 2.8 percent. Macron has promised to meet the EU's 3 percent target in 2017. His pledges to cut local property taxes and limit the scope of the wealth tax to property could put a strain on revenues in the years ahead. French business leaders have bridled at the proposed delay, warning that the country needs urgent action on tax reform to restore competitiveness.

No change to text.) By Paul Carsten and Tife Owolabi KINGDOM OF GBARAMATU, Nigeria, July 10 (Reuters) - The Nigerian government's efforts to secure peace in the oil heartlands of the Niger Delta are empty promises, community leaders say, threatening a return to violence that would derail any broader recovery in the crude-dependent economy. With Africa's biggest economy mired in recession, delegations including Acting President Yemi Osinbajo have held talks since February with community leaders in the restive oil-producing states in Nigeria's southeast. Oil exports are now set to exceed 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, the highest in 17 months, from as little as just over 1 million bpd at certain points last year. That is due to a steady decline in attacks on pipelines, providing a much-needed injection of cash into Nigerian government coffers. But ex-militants and local chieftains say that since those  town hall  discussions, little has been done - the government has not followed up on issues raised, is stalling on key demands and has not even appointed a full-time negotiating team. If the Niger Delta people continue to feel Abuja is ignoring their needs, leaders say they will resort to the only tactic that has ever yielded results: attacks on oil facilities.  The people of the Niger Delta can hold this government or any government to ransom because we are the people feeding the nation,  said Godspower Gbenekama, a chief in the Kingdom of Gbaramatu.  This peace is a graveyard peace,  he said.  Nobody can assure anybody that nothing will happen in the Delta.  A spokesman for the acting president rejected suggestions the government was not doing enough.  The government has not reneged and will never renege on any agreement,  he said, pointing to more spending on an amnesty programme for ex-militants and progress on a clean-up project. He added it was just a matter of time for other agreements to come to fruition, such as the planned opening of a flagship university in October and of small-scale refineries with community ownership in the fourth quarter. An inter-ministerial group met regularly with Osinbajo to discuss the Niger Delta and a  technical committee  liaised between the government and affected communities, he also said. Some locals, however, are in no mood to wait. In a sign of their mounting frustration, groups such as the New Delta Avengers and the Niger Delta Marine Force have formed in recent months.  Call for resuming attacks when the government is diligent in actualising the terms of the agreements and requests made will not help matters,  said the acting president's spokesman.  All About Revenue  That the Delta needs help is not in dispute. Roads are pitted and scarred. Holes gape in the walls of school buildings and playing fields are flooded. Ramshackle stalls crowd the streets, standing in pools of muddy water and blocking traffic. Every ten metres are signs offering hope of a different nature: Communion with God; Redemption Ministries; Hope Centre Parish; Success Education Centre; High Flyers House of Bliss Ministries. But the communities of the Niger Delta also have more earthly demands. Some want environmental clean-ups from oil spills that have devastated swathes of forest and waterways; others want roads and better power supply; others jobs and the regional university. Many in the Delta are cynical about the government's stated desire to improve the region's lot. The peace talks are  lies and deceit,  said Annkio Briggs, a leading activist in the southeastern oil city of Port Harcourt.  This latest Osinbajo move ... is all about revenue. How do we get the Niger Delta calm enough that we can continue to derive revenue to sustain our budgets?  Others are also bitter that the government only appears to respond to violent action, while peaceful activism and protests have historically achieved little. The government  is treading on a path that is disastrous... setting a precedent that they will only negotiate with the Delta when they start blowing stuff up,  said Richard Akinaka, who represented the youth in Rivers state for a meeting with Osinbajo. He dismissed the meeting with one word -  bogus . The communities have also asked for ownership of oil blocks, and for all states in Nigeria to become fiscally independent - a move that would see oil revenues pooled in the southeast. The problems of the Delta may not be easily solved: enmity runs deep between locals and the federal government, violence is often the answer and some of the demands may not be as attainable as community leaders hope.  We don't have a very big agenda,  said Gbenekama, the Gbaramatu kingdom chief.  The general agenda of the Niger Delta people is the political and fiscal restructuring of this nation.

Thousands of Indians immerse themselves and idols of their gods every day, believing a dip in the Ganges absolves a lifetime of sins. People drink the water and use it for crops. But the pristine waters soon becomes a distant memory as the 2,525 km-long (1,570 mile) Ganges snakes its way down to the densely populated plains of north India, where too much water is sucked out to maintain a healthy flow.  Sliding under bridges in the industrial city of Kanpur, the water's color turns dark gray.  Industrial waste and sewage pour in from open drains, as clouds of foam float on its surface. At one stretch, the river turns red. Nearby, tannery workers haul chemical-soaked buffalo hides into huge drums. The filthy run-off is dumped in the river. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has pledged to build more treatment plants and move more than 400 tanneries away from the river, but his $3 billion clean-up plan is badly behind schedule.

Pollution-Free Prayers  The sorry state of the Ganges is most keenly felt in Varanasi, the ancient and most holy of cities for Hindus.  Religious students practise yoga, pilgrims seek spiritual purification and families cremate their dead by the water's edge, scattering ashes so that souls go to heaven and escape the cycle of rebirth.  Slideshow (13 Images)Along the bathing ghats, prayers invoking followers to keep the Ganges clean fill the hot evening air.  I remember earlier the water was very clean and we could drink it,  said 58-year-old boatman Anil Sahni.  Now you can't even bathe in it.  As the river widens it curves southwards, towards the Bay of Bengal, passing thousands more villages and swelling cities. In the 14-million strong metropolis of Kolkata, people bathe and brush their teeth next to towering mounds of rubbish. On the outskirts, brick kilns and factories line the river banks. Downstream, a packed ferry sets off for Sagar Island, or Ganga Sagar, a magnet for Hindu pilgrims that marks the point where the Ganges meets the sea.  I feel sad about what's happening around us. The Ganges is getting dirty day by day but nobody cares. Not even its children,  said 66-year-old priest Ashok Kumar in Mirzapur, a riverside carpet and brass ware hub.    The Ganges is our mother. There won't be any future if she dies.  Click here for a photo essay reut.rs/2tYBlCR that depicts the pollution that has affected the holy Ganges river.

Focus was already turning to Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony on monetary policy and a meeting of Canada's central bank on Wednesday for the latest policy signals from the world's major central banks. For now, unease about an end to an era of ultra-cheap money gave way to optimism about the global growth outlook, with Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report helping to bolster risk appetite. Data on Monday showed exports from Germany, Europe's biggest economy, rose more strongly than expected in May. European stock markets followed Asia higher, with blue-chip stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt up 0.2 to 0.5 percent in early Monday trade. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.4 percent while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.8 percent to a one-week high helped by weakness in the Japanese currency. U.S. stock futures also firmed , suggesting Wall Street shares could extend gains made after the U.S. jobs data.  Unlike in recent years, where there was very patchy growth across the world, we are seeing a synchronized upswing in the global economy,  said Alex Dryden, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  So while it may not be coordinated communication, I do think there's been a change in rhetoric from central banks across the world -- though the ECB is the central bank to watch in the second half of the year.  Over the past two weeks, markets have reassessed the outlook for tighter monetary policies from major central banks following a string of hawkish remarks.  We'll see just how much substance there is to these comments on Wednesday, when the Bank of Canada announces its latest decision, with investors now expecting a 25 basis point increase,  said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. A rate rise from Canada's central would be its first interest rate rise in nearly seven years. Diverging The dollar rose almost 0.4 percent to 114.29 yen, a two-month peak, while the dollar index -- which measures the dollar's value against a basket of other major currencies -- was a touch firmer at 96.071.  The solid jobs report gives us more reason to expect the Fed to announce that it's prepared to start trimming its balance sheet,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.  By contrast, the Bank of Japan is nowhere near a policy exit, and it's taking steps that weaken the yen,  he said. The euro was largely steady at $1.1404. The Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg over the weekend did not have much impact on markets on Monday. Oil crept up after sliding on Friday on a report showing U.S. crude production rose last week, just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high, rekindling concerns about a supply glut. Global benchmark Brent was up 0.2 percent at $46.76, following Friday's 2.9 percent slide. Bond markets, hit hard by jitters about tighter central bank policies in the past two weeks, were stable on Monday. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was steady near a two-month high of 2.398 percent hit on Friday. In Europe, Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield was flat at 0.56 percent but within sight of 18-month highs.

The transaction values Sapa, at 27 billion Norwegian crowns ($3.24 billion) on a debt-free basis.  Sapa will enable us to assume global leadership, establish a platform for growth, and provide responsible operations and sustainable solutions for the future low-carbon economy,  Hydro Chief Executive Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said. While Hydro itself produces primary aluminum from scratch, Sapa cuts, presses and shapes the metal, making it a key supplier to aircraft makers, automotive firms and the construction industry.  The combination will make Hydro the only global company in the aluminum industry that is fully integrated across the value chain and markets,  Hydro said. Hydro predicted it would see annual synergies of 200 million crowns, and that the deal would immediately be accretive to earnings and secure strong cash generation. Jointly owned by Orkla and Hydro since 2013, Sapa has 22,400 employees and in 2016 recorded sales of 53 billion crowns.  Orkla had previously said it would eventually sell its stake, either directly to Hydro or through an initial public offering.  For Norsk Hydro, we consider the transaction to be consistent with the strategy to be an integrated aluminum player,  Pareto Securities wrote in a note to clients, adding the transaction valued Sapa 3.6 percent below its own forecast. Completion of the transaction is subject to approval from competition authorities in Brazil, Canada, China, Turkey and the European Union, and is expected in the second half of 2017, Hydro and Orkla said. Danske Bank wrote in a note to clients that the regulatory risk to the deal was low.  For Orkla, the sale is a natural consequence of our strategy of becoming a focused branded consumer goods company,  Orkla Chief Executive Peter Ruzicka said in a statement. Hydro said it was committed to retain its investment grade rating after the purchase, and that its dividend policy would be unchanged.  The transaction will be financed through cash positions and issuance of bonds in Norwegian and international markets,  it said.  Hydro will maintain its dividend policy of returning 40 percent of net income over the (business) cycle, with NOK 1.25 per share seen as a floor in 2017,  it said. Orkla separately said it would pay a special dividend of 5 Norwegian crowns per share when the deal closes. The firm has shed several large businesses in recent years, including breweries and chemicals making, but will continue to build up its remaining operations through acquisitions and investments.  We find it positive that Orkla is finally selling,  Danske Bank analyst Martin Stenshall wrote in a note to clients, adding the price Hydro would pay was 1.9 percent above his estimated valuation of Sapa. Danske Bank reiterated a  hold  recommendation on Orkla's shares. Hydro shares traded 1.4 percent higher for the day at 0726 GMT, while Orkla rose 1.8 percent.

Canada's likely  lift off  on Wednesday - which would bring the country's first interest rate increase in nearly seven years - comes at a time when the economy still faces a number of headwinds, including weak inflation and the expected renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). But with the economy and labor markets growing, the Bank of Canada began laying the groundwork for hikes with a sharp shift in tone last month. Markets are pricing in more than 90 percent odds of a quarter-percentage point increase on July 12, while a second hike is expected by the end of the year.  Economists in a Reuters poll were more divided on whether the bank would move next week, with the median forecast pointing to a hike in the fourth quarter. [CA/POLL]  Cindy Fuailefau is six months into a debt repayment plan after she accumulated more than C$41,000 ($31,847) in debt and was unable to keep up the payments after her husband stopped working due to a back injury.  That was all just trying to live, not vacations or anything,  the 56-year-old said.  Canadians as a whole owe C$1.67 for every dollar of income, a near record high. TransUnion said in a report last year that more than 700,000 consumers would struggle with even a quarter-point hike in interest rates. Where the average person seeking help 20 years ago owed about C$12,000, now it is not uncommon to see people with C$100,000 in unsecured debt, said Scott Hannah, president of the Credit Counseling Society.  We've just become very comfortable over the past decade carrying debt,  Hannah said.  No one is paying attention because ... rates have remained low.  Already Feeling the Pain Canadians may already be feeling a squeeze. Canada's 5-year yield has soared more than 50 basis points to 1.47 percent since hawkish comments from top Bank of Canada officials last month. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest bank, has already raised rates on fixed-term mortgages ahead of the central bank announcement. Mortgage rates are typically based on 5-year bonds. That is an important signal to Canadian households that their situation may be about to change, said Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management.   It also, critically, implies that the economy is already going to feel higher interest rates, even if the Bank of Canada holds (on) Wednesday,  Donald said. While a 50-basis point increase would still leave rates at a relatively low 1 percent, it could be enough to prolong the recent cooling in the Vancouver and Toronto housing markets. It could also slow demand in cities that have not seen the same rapid price increases and are therefore more interest rate sensitive, such as Ottawa and Montreal.   On the lower end of the market, entry level product may be impacted a little bit more because they're a bit more sensitive to those rate hikes,  said Adil Dinani, Royal LePage realtor in Vancouver. The biggest question of all remains whether the Bank of Canada plans to stop after two rate hikes, thereby removing the stimulus it added in 2015, or whether it is embarking on a longer tightening cycle.  If this is the beginning of a tightening cycle that will persist for several years, that will have a pronounced impact on homebuyers, business investors and general households,  said Donald. But for those who were able to get ahead of the curve and pay down debts, the potential higher interest rates will be more bearable. Over four years ago, Charis Sweet-Speiss found herself laden with C$67,000 in debt across 13 credit cards as she struggled to meet mortgage payments on her British Columbia's Okanagan Valley house despite the low rates. Now, Sweet-Speiss, who is on a repayment plan, plans to finish paying the last of her credit card debt in August, and hopes to have her house, and the line of credit she borrowed against it, paid off in three years so she can retire.  The rates now, I've heard they're going up, and I am so grateful I'm not in that situation any more.

The transaction values Sapa, at 27 billion Norwegian crowns ($3.24 billion) on a debt-free basis.  Sapa will enable us to assume global leadership, establish a platform for growth, and provide responsible operations and sustainable solutions for the future low-carbon economy,  Hydro Chief Executive Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said. While Hydro itself produces primary aluminum from scratch, Sapa cuts, presses and shapes the metal, making it a key supplier to aircraft makers, automotive firms and the construction industry.  The combination will make Hydro the only global company in the aluminum industry that is fully integrated across the value chain and markets,  Hydro said. Hydro predicted it would see annual synergies of 200 million crowns, and that the deal would immediately be accretive to earnings and secure strong cash generation. Jointly owned by Orkla and Hydro since 2013, Sapa has 22,400 employees and in 2016 recorded sales of 53 billion crowns.  Orkla had previously said it would eventually sell its stake, either directly to Hydro or through an initial public offering.  For Norsk Hydro, we consider the transaction to be consistent with the strategy to be an integrated aluminum player,  Pareto Securities wrote in a note to clients, adding the transaction valued Sapa 3.6 percent below its own forecast. Completion of the transaction is subject to approval from competition authorities in Brazil, Canada, China, Turkey and the European Union, and is expected in the second half of 2017, Hydro and Orkla said. Danske Bank wrote in a note to clients that the regulatory risk to the deal was low.  For Orkla, the sale is a natural consequence of our strategy of becoming a focused branded consumer goods company,  Orkla Chief Executive Peter Ruzicka said in a statement. Hydro said it was committed to retain its investment grade rating after the purchase, and that its dividend policy would be unchanged.  The transaction will be financed through cash positions and issuance of bonds in Norwegian and international markets,  it said.  Hydro will maintain its dividend policy of returning 40 percent of net income over the (business) cycle, with NOK 1.25 per share seen as a floor in 2017,  it said. Orkla separately said it would pay a special dividend of 5 Norwegian crowns per share when the deal closes. The firm has shed several large businesses in recent years, including breweries and chemicals making, but will continue to build up its remaining operations through acquisitions and investments.  We find it positive that Orkla is finally selling,  Danske Bank analyst Martin Stenshall wrote in a note to clients, adding the price Hydro would pay was 1.9 percent above his estimated valuation of Sapa. Danske Bank reiterated a  hold  recommendation on Orkla's shares. Hydro shares traded 1.4 percent higher for the day at 0726 GMT, while Orkla rose 1.8 percent.

That may have ended up being its biggest problem. Top-tier venture capital firms Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and then a sovereign wealth fund, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Jawbone, lifting its valuation to $3.2 billion in 2014. Ultimately, all that money couldn't save San Francisco-based Jawbone, which began liquidating proceedings in June after its fitness-tracker product failed to take off. It now ranks as the second largest failure among venture-backed companies, based on total funding raised, according to the research firm CB Insights. Jawbone's fall after raising more than $900 million provides a stark example of how the flood of cash pouring into Silicon Valley can have the perverse effect of sustaining companies that have no future, technology executives and financiers say. The irony is Jawbone could have been a suitable acquisition target some years ago, these people say, had it just kept its valuation lower by raising less money from venture capital and sovereign wealth funds.   They are basically force-feeding capital into these companies,  said Sramana Mitra, a tech entrepreneur and consultant, and founder and CEO of startup accelerator One Million by One Million.  I expect there will be a lot more deaths by overfunding.  The Jawbone case also underscores the risks that non-traditional startup investors such as sovereign wealth funds face as they ramp up investments in Silicon Valley. The Kuwait Investment Authority led a $165 million investment in Jawbone just last year, when its prospects had already dimmed to the point that most of its original investors were unwilling to put up new funding. These funds, which mange funds of hundreds of billions of dollars, invested $12.7 billion in private tech companies last year, up from $2.2 billion the year before, according to CB Insights. Startup failures are not uncommon, but a billion-dollar company that has raised huge pools of money going belly up remains a rarity. Jawbone ranks behind the solar technology company Solyndra, which became the largest failure among venture-backed companies when it filed for bankruptcy in 2011.  Other recent big-dollar failures include used car marketplace Beepi, which closed after raising about $150 million.  Some investors say failures like Jawbone won't seriously dent startup funding in the near term. Venture capitalists last year raised $41 billion, a record.   Everyone is trying to find a way to play in the tech economy,  said Rich Wong, a partner with Accel venture firm.  It's inevitable  that there will be big-ticket failures. But the Jawbone situation could give pause to investors considering nine-figure investments in unproven firms, say venture capitalists.  Since Jawbone’s “downround” last year, a number of other startups - including human resources software firm Zenefits, food subscription company HelloFresh and ride service Ola - have had their valuations slashed because of poor performance and waning investor enthusiasm, contributing to heightened caution in the startup industry over the last several months.  The quarterly number of startup financing deals continues to drop from its high in 2015, although with so much cash, investors aren’t shy to write large checks for the select companies they believe will succeed. Ride-services firm Lyft, for instance, raised $600 million in April. Jawbone's liquidation was first reported last week by technology news site The Information and independently confirmed by Reuters. A spokesman for Jawbone declined to comment. Co-founder and chief executive Hosain Rahman did not respond to email from Reuters, and its VC investors declined to comment.  Alex Asseily, Jawbone's co-founder who resigned as board chairman and director in January 2015, told Reuters  it's saddening to see Jawbone end this way.          Loans from Blackrock     Jawbone launched in 1999 under the name AliphCom. It cycled through several products, including Bluetooth headsets and speakers, and in 2011 landed on stylish wearable devices to track exercise, sleep and other health data. Along the way, Jawbone burned through more than $500 million in equity and raised more than $400 million in debt, the lion's share from BlackRock, according data provider PitchBook Inc. But the company barely made a dent in the wearables market, with well below five percent market share, and was vastly outperformed by Fitbit, Samsung and others, according to analyst Jitesh Ubrani of International Data Corp.  Still, Jawbone raised $147 million in September 2014, bumping its valuation $3.2 billion, according to Pitchbook. In November of the following year, Jawbone laid off 15 percent of its staff amid financial troubles. By December 2015, BlackRock had marked down the company's shares by 69 percent, according to Pitchbook.  Then, in 2016, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) invested in Jawbone for the first time, leading a $165 million round that halved Jawbone's valuation to $1.5 billion. The KIA did not respond to requests for comment. Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East and Asia have in recent years become far more active in investing directly in start-ups, rather than simply investing in venture capital funds.  Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the Qatar Investment Authority, for instance, both have big stakes in Uber.  Because they have so much more money than traditional venture firms and are less experienced as tech investors, sovereign wealth funds are often called upon to co-invest or lead a risky funding round, say people who invest alongside these foreign funds. Such large fundraising rounds can  create this artificially bloated valuation that doesn't compute with the revenue,  Mitra said. They can also be a false signal to investors, who often look at how much money a company has raised as a signal of its success, when  in fact, it's the opposite,  said Rebecca Lynn, a partner at Canvas Ventures. Jawbone tried to sell itself in 2016, but was unable to find a buyer, according to investors with knowledge of the matter. It has been sued by vendors who allege the company owes them hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Leaders from the world's leading economies broke with U.S. President Donald Trump on climate policy at a G20 summit on Saturday, in a rare public admission of disagreement and blow to multilateral cooperation. However, a strong set of U.S. employment data on Friday has added to a feeling that central banks across the world have more reason then ever to continue to unwind the loose policy stance of the post-crisis era. In Europe, a recent speech by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi led investors to believe that the bank will reduce extraordinary stimulus sooner rather than later and saw Germany's 10-year borrowing costs double in little over a week. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan offered its most optimistic view of the country's regional economies in more than a decade on solid exports and private consumption, underscoring its conviction a steady recovery is gathering momentum.  To me this G20 summit will pass unnoticed by the rates market as it continues to be very much focused on what central banks say and do,  said BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche. A number of policymakers are due to speak through the course of the week, but Costero Denche believes Fed Chair Janet Yellen's hearing before Congress on Wednesday will be key. Euro zone bond yields were flat to a touch higher in early trades on Monday. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond , the benchmark for the region, was unchanged at 0.57 percent. At that level it is more than double the 0.25 percent level at which it began on June 27, the day when Draghi opened the door to tweaks in the ECB's aggressive stimulus policy in a speech in Sintra, Portugal. Investors are now beginning to believe that policymakers around the world are starting to favour tighter monetary policy.  Unlike in recent years, where there was very patchy growth across the world, we are seeing a synchronized upswing in the global economy,  said Alex Dryden, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.  So while it may not be coordinated communication, I do think there's been a change in rhetoric from central banks across the world - though the ECB is the central bank to watch in the second half of the year.

Inpex and South Korea's Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering denied reports of technical problems in the floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit.  Inpex, Japan's biggest energy explorer, said there was no change in the latest plans to begin the first gas production and shipments from the Ichthys development by the end of next March.  The project, the first LNG development managed by a Japanese company, has been hit with delays and contract disputes. In April, Inpex said the project's start would be delayed by up to six months to the end of March next year, citing issues in the installation of offshore production facilities. Inpex and Daewoo Shipbuilding said the construction of the FPSO unit was complete, after CNBC reported on the existence of a possible crack in the massive piece of equipment that processes output from the project, which includes liquid petroleum gas and condensate, an ultra-light crude oil. CNBC cited unnamed sources. A Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering spokesman said he was not aware of any crack, adding that the FPSO unit was set to sail away this month, although the exact timetable was yet to be set. The FPSO unit was originally scheduled to sail from South Korea by the end of last year. An Inpex spokesman said there were no technical issues at the moment.  We think there's no impact from FPSO on the overall schedule of the project,  said the Inpex spokesman, who declined to be named.  All construction work on the FPSO is complete and final preparatory work and checks before departure are being carried out.  The Inpex spokesman repeated the company's belief that any cost overruns could be up to a few percent of the previous estimate for the project of around $37 billion. The central processing facility (CPF), which was shipped from South Korea on April 26, was safely moored in the Ichthys field on June 22, the Inpex spokesman added.

Shares of United Electronics Company (Extra) surged by their 10 percent daily limit in the first 10 minutes of trade after reporting a second quarter net income of 43.4 million riyals ($11.57 million), up 287.5 percent from the prior year period. In a separate statement, the board approved a cash dividend of 0.75 riyal per share for first half of 2017, the company's first dividend distribution since 2015. The positive mood spilled into other consumer related shares with electronics and bookstore operator Jarir adding 0.6 percent. Analysts have been anticipating the retail sector to show signs of improvement in the second quarter from the previous year period because of the government's decision to reinstate civil servants' allowances and because of the Muslim month of Ramadan, which typically sees a rise in sales.

The Formula One team's executive director Zak Brown told reporters at the weekend's Austrian Grand Prix that there were signs of improvement but time was pushing on.  It's still very much a work in progress,  said the American.  We need to figure out our relationship with them moving forward, soon. You start getting in to next year's car (design) in the next few months and what we have to have is a competitive engine for next year.  They're working hard on it and doing some things that are for them to speak about to make those improvements. So we want to give them as much runway as possible to get there.  McLaren, the second most successful team after Ferrari in terms of race wins, are bottom of the standings as they approach the midpoint of the season at their home British Grand Prix next weekend. Neither two times world champion Fernando Alonso nor Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne was able to add to the meager tally of two points, despite qualifying a more encouraging 12th and 13th at Spielberg. While Alonso was punted out at the start in a three-car crunch, Vandoorne finished 12th and collected a late drive-through penalty for ignoring blue warning flags. Brown warned last month that McLaren and Honda were reaching a 'fork in the road' with the Japanese manufacturer looking  a bit lost .  As far as their enthusiasm to address the issue, that's been there from day one but it's a results-oriented business,  he said in Austria.  We do like what we're seeing and what they are telling us about how they are going about addressing some of the issues.  Asked directly whether the threat of a parting of the ways had receded somewhat, he added:  I would say our position hasn't changed on our requirement to have a competitive situation next year.  Honda brought an upgraded 'Spec Three' power unit to Austria, although Alonso reverted to the previous specification when a problem with a motor generator unit was detected.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.4 percent by 0720 GMT, rising in concert with euro zone stocks and blue-chips. Strong gains in banks boosted the benchmarks, while basic resources were weak. Outside the main bluechips, UK midcap construction support services company Carillion grabbed traders' attention after a profit warning and CEO exit sent its shares tumbling nearly 40 percent in heavy volumes. Carillion shares are among the most heavily shorted across the UK market with hedge funds including Marshall Wace and Naya Capital reporting sizeable bearish bets according to FCA disclosure data. In broader markets, Germany's DAX rose 0.6 percent, maintaining an edge over peers after both export and import figures came in stronger than expected, with a wider increase in exports adding to the trade surplus of Europe’s biggest economy. Shares in Norwegian conglomerate Orkla were among the strongest performers, up 2.4 percent after Norsk Hydro clinched a $3.2 billion deal to buy aluminum products maker Sapa by purchasing a 50 percent stake from Orkla. CHR Hansen jumped 3.3 percent, benefiting from a raise to 'buy' from Goldman Sachs, which said the company had strong pricing power. And German utility E.ON rose 2.5 percent, leading the buoyant utilities sector after HSBC said recent weakness offered an  excellent buying opportunity , raising the stock to a 'buy' from 'reduce'.

The data followed news of an expansion in China's manufacturing sector in June, which also underpinned demand for metals.  Although (China's) domestic market is weakening because of seasonality, it has not shown a very strong weakness, and also because of the improving macro sentiment ... people have seen some signs from the central bank trying to (increase) liquidity,  said analyst Chris Wu of CRU in Beijing.  So that's why people are more bullish than expected ... for all metals, not just for copper.  * LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper was little changed at $5,819 a tonne by 0705 GMT, down 0.1 percent, following small losses in the previous session.

Unconventional shale oil and alternative energy resources are an important factor to help meet future demand but it is premature to assume that they can be developed quickly to replace oil and gas, Amin Nasser told a conference in Istanbul.  If we look at the long-term situation of oil supplies, for example, the picture is becoming increasingly worrying,  Nasser said.  Financial investors are shying away from making much needed large investments in oil exploration, long-term development and the related infrastructure.  Investments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it,  Nasser said. About $1 trillion in investments have already been lost since a decline in oil prices from 2014. Studies show that 20 million barrels per day of new production will be needed to meet demand growth and offset natural decline of developed fields over the next five years, he said.  New discoveries are also on a major downward trend. The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years has more than halved compared with the previous four,  Nasser said. State oil giant Aramco, which is preparing to sell around 5 percent in itself next year in an initial public offering, is continuing to invest in maintaining its oil production capacity of 12 million barrels per day.  We plan to invest more than $300 billion over the coming decade to reinforce our pre-eminent position in oil, maintain our spare oil production capacity, and pursue a large exploration and production program centering on conventional and unconventional gas resources,  Nasser said. Nasser said that one of Aramco's priorities was  direct conversion of crude oil into petrochemicals  while adding the company was also focusing on solar and wind projects.

The Formula One team's executive director Zak Brown told reporters at the weekend's Austrian Grand Prix that there were signs of improvement but time was pushing on.  It's still very much a work in progress,  said the American.  We need to figure out our relationship with them moving forward, soon. You start getting in to next year's car (design) in the next few months and what we have to have is a competitive engine for next year.  They're working hard on it and doing some things that are for them to speak about to make those improvements. So we want to give them as much runway as possible to get there.  McLaren, the second most successful team after Ferrari in terms of race wins, are bottom of the standings as they approach the midpoint of the season at their home British Grand Prix next weekend. Neither two times world champion Fernando Alonso nor Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne was able to add to the meager tally of two points, despite qualifying a more encouraging 12th and 13th at Spielberg. While Alonso was punted out at the start in a three-car crunch, Vandoorne finished 12th and collected a late drive-through penalty for ignoring blue warning flags. Brown warned last month that McLaren and Honda were reaching a 'fork in the road' with the Japanese manufacturer looking  a bit lost .  As far as their enthusiasm to address the issue, that's been there from day one but it's a results-oriented business,  he said in Austria.  We do like what we're seeing and what they are telling us about how they are going about addressing some of the issues.  Asked directly whether the threat of a parting of the ways had receded somewhat, he added:  I would say our position hasn't changed on our requirement to have a competitive situation next year.  Honda brought an upgraded 'Spec Three' power unit to Austria, although Alonso reverted to the previous specification when a problem with a motor generator unit was detected.

The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.1 percent, to 3,653.69 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2 percent to 3,212.63 points. Small-caps far underperformed, with the start-up board ChiNext sliding 1.8 percent, after the securities regulator approved more initial public offerings (IPOs) over the weekend, raising fears the pace of listings could accelerate. Eight newly-listed stock tumbled the maximum allowed 10 percent. Markets shrugged off China's June inflation data, which met expectations and did little to alter the view that economic growth is cooling after a solid first quarter. June consumer prices rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said that  with slowing credit growth likely to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters... inflation will start falling again before long . In comments on Friday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was sanguine about the outlook even as he acknowledged the economy still faced many difficulties. Most economists expect growth to cool in the next few quarters as the key real estate sector slows, while Beijing's crack down on debt risks raises financing costs in a generally tighter funding environment. On July 17, China will release second-quarter gross domestic product(GDP), along with June industrial output, retail sales and January-June fixed asset investment. UBS Securities analyst Gao Ting said that after stellar gains in certain sectors such as consumer, investor views have started to diverge. Some investors see  limited upside for quality consumer stocks as valuations touch five-year highs after substantial YTD gains, while others remain upbeat on the re-rating potential of leading players,  he said.

Lendl, who coaches world number one Andy Murray, said that the Briton, Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic have been able to stay at the top of men's tennis due to their mental strength.  The top guys are top guys because they do things a little bit better than the other guys,  Lendl told British media.  Whether it's problem solving, whether it's lack of matches for a while, dealing with distractions off the court – these guys are used to it ...   Yes, they can get upset, or the others can upset them, but if they play 100 times they are going to win more than half.  They are better in stroke production, movement, physically. You put all that into a package and the package is slightly better than the guys below.  Lendl also said Murray, who is on the mend from a hip injury and just scraped past Italian Fabio Fognini in the third round at Wimbledon, had the character to dig deep when things were not going according to plan.  That's how people win tournaments – they fight. It doesn't come easy. You don't always play your best and you have to get through that and fighting is part of it,  Lendl said.  When you play, sometimes you feel tired and you have to push through that pain barrier as well. Rhythm was very difficult last week, especially with the first two guys...   But Andy is hitting it better and cleaner every practice now and getting his timing and rhythm back. He's in the second week so he is in with a chance.  Murray faces Benoit Paire in the fourth round later on Monday, with Federer playing Grigor Dimitrov, Nadal up against Gilles Muller and Djokovic taking on Adrian Mannarino.

Oculus is cutting the combined price of its Rift headset and Touch controllers to $399 for six weeks beginning on Monday, said Jason Rubin, Oculus vice president for content. That matches the price of another virtual reality set, PlayStation VR, made by Sony Corp.  Vive, a virtual reality set developed by HTC Corp, is listed for sale at $799 on its website, and it has not recently cut the price.  Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees in 2014.  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the medium, which offers a 360-degree panoramic view through headsets, would  become a part of daily life for billions of people.   A virtual reality head set is on display following an Oculus event in San Francisco, California June 11, 2015.Robert GalbraithThat has not happened, although it is unclear if that is because of high prices, something inherent in the technology or some other reason.  Pricing discounts are sometimes a sign of weak product sales. Rubin, though, said in an interview that was not the case with Oculus, which he said could have cut the price sooner but wanted to wait until there were enough games, movies and other entertainment to keep a broad audience busy.  The pace of game releases has quickened, making a wider appeal possible, Rubin said:  We're now in a space where the mass market can be much happier.   Oculus cut its price once before this year, dropping it from $798 to $598 in March.  In May, Oculus shut the doors of its Story Studio, two years after it launched at the Sundance Film Festival, to focus on external content makers.  Another setback was a $500 million legal judgment against Oculus in February, when a jury found in favor of video game publisher ZeniMax Media Inc in a lawsuit accusing Facebook and Oculus of copyright infringement. Oculus has asked for a new trial.  Reporting by David Ingram","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-oculus-idUSL1N1JY1XQ"},

That puts the French oil major ahead of rivals like Exxon and Shell in the early running for developing the expansion, which the tiny Gulf state announced as it seeks to counter growing isolation caused by a regional diplomatic rift. Total boss Patrick Pouyanne signed a deal this month to develop the South Pars field, as Iran's part of the shared reserves are known, becoming the first oil major to return to the country since the lifting of sanctions. As he was ironing out details of that agreement, he was careful to keep Qatar in the loop.  Of course, I won't go to the same field in Iran without telling Qatar,  Pouyanne told Reuters.  The Iranian block where we are supposed to produce is next to the border with Qatar. When I traveled to Doha I discussed it with the (Qatari) authorities and they told us: 'It is ok - we know you'.  Pouyanne says Total strictly respects confidentiality of data vis-à-vis each country. The executive's cross-border strategy, however, appears to be paying early dividends.  I would expect Total to be in the strongest position for the new (Qatari) project, because of the political issues at play and their recent deals in (Iran's) South Pars,  one senior Gulf energy source said. On one level, working with both countries who share a prized gas asset seems obvious. But it is not without risks for Total. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt  have imposed political and economic sanctions on Qatar, demanding that it stops fostering terrorism and courting Iran, Riyadh's main rival. Qatar denies the accusations. Besides Iran and Qatar, Total also has large projects in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, highlighting the complexity of investing in the Middle East. Cost Savings Possible FILE PHOTO: The logo of French oil giant Total is seen in front of the oil refinery of Donges, near Nantes, France, December 20, 2013.Stephane Mahe/File PhotoQatar, already the world's largest liquefied gas exporter, lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field in April and last week it said it would raise gas output capacity by around 30 percent to 100 billion cubic meters. The move was widely seen as a show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbors and Egypt. Qatar has built its gas export power over the past decade with support from global oil majors including ExxonMobil, Total, and Royal Dutch Shell. The projects have generated billions of dollars for Qatar and its Western partners and the planned expansion to its gas capacity would make Qatar even more dominant in the gas market, accounting for a third of current global LNG output. Cars are parked outside the headquartes of Qatar Petroleum in Doha, Qatar, July 8, 2017.StringerSources told Reuters earlier this month that Exxon, Shell and Total have all expressed interest in helping Qatar expand its gas facilities, with top executives traveling to Doha in recent weeks even after a spike in political tensions. Exxon, Shell and Total declined to comment on plans to participate in Qatar's tenders to expand gas capacity, which are yet to be announced and will take several years to complete. Even without those tenders, Total's role in Qatar is set to grow significantly after it won a 30 percent stake in 2016 in a new 25-year contract to operate its largest offshore Al-Shaheen oilfield.  Total, which will take over the field operation from Maersk Oil on July 14, plans to invest $2 billion in expanding the field over the next five years. With Qatar's gas production costs among the lowest in the world, being a part of any expansion would give Total a strategic advantage over rivals in the fast-growing global LNG market. Total's involvement in fields on both sides of the Qatari-Iranian border may also help save on costs and service contracts as well as better understand the fields' geology, although Pouyanne said there was no mechanism to coordinate production jointly by the countries. The development of the new capacity over the next 5-7 years could cost between $14-$18 billion, according to consultant Wood Mackenzie.  Qatar may also be keen to show it is still open for business despite the current diplomatic disputes with some of its Gulf neighbors,  it said.

The surprisingly strong trade figures, released by the Federal Statistics Office, underline how the German economy is firing on all cylinders ahead of a Sept. 24 federal election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term. The data will also add fuel to the debate about Germany's export strength after the International Monetary Fund on Friday repeated its call for Berlin to increase investment as a way to boost imports, support the economic recovery in other countries and reduce its record trade surplus. Seasonally adjusted exports climbed 1.4 percent - their fifth consecutive monthly increase - while imports rose 1.2 percent, the data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. Both figures came in stronger than expected: A Reuters poll had pointed to exports edging up 0.3 percent and imports rising by 0.5 percent. Demand for German goods from countries outside the EU rose the most, with exports to so-called third countries, which includes China, Japan and the United States, soaring 17.3 percent, a breakdown of unadjusted trade figures showed.  The global economy is improving, which has a positive impact on the German export economy,  VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, pointing to especially strong demand for German machinery from markets overseas. FILE PHOTO: A containership at a loading terminal is seen in the port of Hamburg, Germany, February 2, 2017.Fabian Bimmer/File Photo While private consumption has been an important growth driver in the last few years, net exports are now giving additional stability,  Gitzel added. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus edged up to 20.3 billion euros from a revised 19.7 billion euros in April. The May reading was in line with the Reuters consensus forecast. Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, rose to 17.3 billion euros after a revised 14.9 billion euros in April, unadjusted data showed.  The trade balance is currently swelling, which will again lead to suspicions on the other side of the Atlantic,  Gitzel said.  U.S. President Donald Trump will therefore continue his vehement criticism of the high German trade surplus.  The trade figures come on the heels of solid manufacturing data released on Friday which showed industrial output rose more than expected in May, boosting expectations that factories will support growth in the second quarter. Analysts expect the German economy to pick up speed in the second quarter after expanding 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year. The IMF has raised its growth forecast for the German economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2017 in real terms, compared with its April forecast of 1.6 percent, citing soaring domestic demand and rebounding exports.

Shire's injunction on Sunday in a Hamburg, Germany, court alleges incomplete and misleading statements by Roche about its investigational emicizumab. The Swiss company is due to release its latest data on the medicine at a conference in Berlin on Monday at around 0930 GMT. The court case underscores just how much is at stake with emicizumab's impending arrival on the market, with Roche due to file for approval with regulators later this year. Some analysts estimate $5 billion in peak annual sales from emicizumab, a development that would likely poach sales from older drugs made by companies such as Shire. Analysts at Bernstein say Shire's share in haemophilia A is expected to decline to 29 percent from 49 percent by 2021 on the combined effect of Roche's drug as well as new long-acting products from Novo Nordisk and Bayer. Shire, which could not be reached for immediate comment, said in a statement the injunction  seeks to prevent further dissemination of the inaccurate and misleading characterisation of the serious adverse events  that occurred in a Roche trial of emicizumab, also known as ACE910. In Roche's trial, patients who experienced bleeding despite getting emicizumab were treated with so-called bypassing agents. Roche has blamed several instances of thromboembolic events -- including damage to blood vessels in vital organs -- on the bypassing agents, and recommended that doctors avoid using one specific bypassing agent as they treat the bleeds. If that is not possible, Roche said, doctors should use the lowest dose possible. 'Unlawfully Disparaged' With Roche's guidance, Shire contends its rival  has unlawfully disparaged Shire’s proven bypassing agent , known as FEIBA.  Shire's goal with this action is to ensure the haemophilia community receives sufficient, accurate information,  the British company said. A Roche spokeswoman said Monday it had not yet been served with Shire's injunction, so it could not comment on its contents. But the Basel-based drugmaker stands by  100 percent  behind its statements about emicizumab as well as its guidance for doctors on how to respond to bleeds. Roche will release data on emicizumab on Monday in Berlin at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Annual Meeting.

(BOC, A/Stable) Hong Kong branch's USD550 million floating-rate senior unsecured notes due 2019 and USD500 million floating-rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 to be issued under its USD30 billion medium-term note (MTN) programme. The notes will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The final ratings on the notes are in line with the expected ratings assigned on 2 July 2017 and follow the receipt of documents conforming to information previously received. Fitch first rated BOC's MTN programme at 'A'/'F1' on 9 December 2013, which was subsequently affirmed on 23 May 2017. The programme's size was increased from USD20 billion to USD30 billion on 7 April 2017 to meet the bank's funding needs. KEY RATING DRIVERS BOC's Hong Kong branch is part of the same legal entity as BOC. Therefore, the notes issued under the MTN programme represent BOC's direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and are rated in line with its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A'/Stable. The bank's IDR is underpinned by the agency's expectations of an extremely high probability of support from the Chinese government in the event of stress. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any change to the notes' ratings will be correlated directly with changes in BOC's IDR, which will in turn reflect any shift in the perceived willingness or ability of the government to support the bank in a full and timely manner.

The benchmark Australian index finished up 0.4 percent, or 20.83 points, at 5,724.4. On Friday, the index shed nearly 1 percent, producing a loss of 0.3 percent for the week. Wall Street stocks ended higher on Friday after U.S. Labour Department data showed the world's biggest economy added 222,000 jobs last month, exceeding expectations for 179,000. While the robust job data puts the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates once more this year, subdued wage growth may give the central bank room to pause if needed. Australian financial stocks, tracking profits in U.S. peers, were the biggest gainers on the benchmark. Shares of the 'Big Four' banks, rose between 0.4 percent and 0.9 percent, contributing to the index's advance. Telecom firms were lifted by a near 1 percent rise in Telstra Corp shares, the biggest in the sector by market value. However, basic materials and energy shares fell. While base metals prices recovered from earlier losses, oil prices remained under pressure, and iron ore gained. The most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange gained on Friday after data from Australia showed iron ore shipments to China from Australia's Port Hedland terminal dropped to 36.6 million tonnes in June from 38 million tonnes the previous month. Port Hedland is used by three of Australia's top four iron ore miners, BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group and Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting. BHP lost about 0.3 percent and Fortescue shed almost 2 percent. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index finished 0.5 percent lower at 7,583.95 as industrials and consumer cyclicals stocks slipped. Auckland International Airport and Fletcher Building Ltd were the biggest losers on the benchmark by weight, down about 2.3 percent each.

The spot rupee was at 153.70/75 per dollar at 0616 GMT, compared with Friday's close of 153.60/70. Dollar conversions by banks and exporters are not enough to meet the demand from importers, said a currency dealer, requesting anonymity.  The market has priced in further depreciation of the rupee because of the central bank's no-intervention policy. We also see some inflows time to time, which prevents a sharp depreciation of the currency,  said the dealer. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5, when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50. Dealers said they expected seasonal demand for dollars to pick up from August. The rupee has been under pressure since early this year after the central bank stopped defending the currency at a time when the island nation faces a balance of payments crisis. The central bank is also compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet the reserve target set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme.

The greenback climbed on Monday lifted by June jobs growth surging more than expected. However, Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Banking Group in Singapore said  the wage numbers were not strong enough for the U.S. dollar to make more meaningful gains , adding Asian currencies are treading water for the day.     The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against a currency basket, was steady at 95.988 at 0609 GMT.     Average hourly earnings in the United States increased 0.2 percent in June, lifting the year-on-year wage increase to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in May, suggesting some slack still remains in the labour market.     The gains in the region were led by the South Korean won , up 0.4 percent.      The Taiwan Dollar was up 0.2 percent, snapping two losing sessions, while the Indian rupee eked out marginal gains, up 0.1 percent.     A Reuters poll on Friday found the outlook for emerging Asian currencies has improved compared with the beginning of the year, driven largely by a weaker dollar as expectations for major U.S. tax cuts faded.     For the rest of the week, the focus will be on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to the congress, which is expected to cover recent policy decisions and the state of the economy.      Ahead of Yellen's speech,  there is probably going to some degree of concern with regards to rising advanced economy yields led by European bond yields,  said Wei Liang Chang, FX strategist at Mizuho Bank.          CHINESE YUAN     The yuan inched higher on Monday, up 0.08 percent after China's June consumer price index number came in line with expectations.     Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent in June from a year earlier, while the producer price index climbed 5.5 percent, also in line with expectations.      The main focus will be on the Q2 GDP numbers that will be coming out next week, so we didn't get much reaction to the CPI numbers today,  said Goh.     China's second quarter gross domestic product is scheduled for release on July 17.          SOUTH KOREAN WON     The South Korean won gained as much as 0.5 percent in its second straight session of gains.      To some extent the market could be cautious that Bank of Korea would be coming into the market.

The Nikkei gained 0.8 percent to 20,080.98, the highest closing level since June 29.  It's a straightforward market today. There is demand in cyclical stocks such as automakers and tech stocks taking cues from U.S. shares,  said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. The marine transport sector was the best sectoral performer after the three major shippers established a holding company and an operating company to integrate their container shipping businesses. Nippon Yusen KK gained 1.4 percent, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha surged 2.9 percent and Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd jumped 5.0 percent. Overall sentiment was positive after U.S. jobs growth beat forecasts, lifting the dollar against the yen. The dollar was 0.2 percent higher at 114.16, after notching a high of 114.21, its loftiest level since May 11. Tech shares were in demand. Advantest Corp rose 1.9 percent, Tokyo Electron climbed 2.3 percent and Panasonic Corp added 1.8 percent. U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, suggesting the Federal Reserve could stick to its plan for its third interest rate hike this year and begin to reduce its balance sheet despite sluggish wage gains and tepid inflation. Japanese banking shares languished, with Mitsubishi UFG Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group both dropping 0.6 percent. The broader Topix gained 0.5 percent to 1,615.48, with 1.54 billion shares changing hands, the lowest level in two weeks.

The championship leader is out of contract at the end of the year but Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne set out his team's position at the Austrian Grand Prix.  I made it very clear that if he wants to stay then we’ll just renew it. It’s up to him,  Marchionne told reporters before Sunday's race. Vettel has delayed contract talks to focus on the championship battle, saying there will be plenty of time over the summer, and any haggling is likely to be about money and the number of years. The German, a four times world champion, moved 20 points clear of closest rival Lewis Hamilton after finishing runner-up to the Briton's Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas at the Red Bull Ring. With the 20 round season approaching the halfway point at Silverstone next weekend, Vettel has won three races and it would probably have been four had he been given one more lap on Sunday. As it was, he missed out by a mere 0.6 of a second. Speaking to the Italian media afterwards, Marchionne said there was plenty to be happy about however.  It was very close. We are there and our German friends know it,  he said.  They can feel us breathing down their necks but we will cut this little gap. I am much happier than I was in the past. The boys know we have started the job and we must carry it through to the end.  While Vettel leads the standings, champions Mercedes stretched their lead in the constructors' standings to 33 points and are 5-3 to Ferrari on wins. But while Hamilton and Bottas have shared the spoils of victory, Vettel has been leading the charge for Ferrari with more than twice as many points as his Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen. Vettel's only obvious alternative to the most successful team in Formula One history would be Mercedes, but the German has already laughed off rumors of that happening.  I think the way we are set up right now, we find ourselves very happy and the focus is on this year despite the fact for next year there is nothing on paper,  he said in May. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda has also dismissed a move.  A Ferrari driver, his head is for Ferrari, and the money in the end is also there,  he said.

China's quality watchdog said late last week it would ask local authorities to form inspection teams, which would randomly choose a total of 100 steel mills to check the quality of their products. Mills caught churning out low-quality steel could face losing their production licenses if they do not improve quality within a certain timeframe, said the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ). The country has said it shut 600 steel mills producing low-grade construction steel during the first half of the year, cutting capacity by about 120 million tonnes. The announcement follows a June report in the state-backed China Metallurgical News that said inspection teams would be sent out in August to check the results of the crackdown on low-grade steel products.

Addressing hundreds of thousands of people waving Turkish flags and banners demanding justice, Kemal Kilicdaroglu said his 25-day march from Ankara to Istanbul - culminating in Sunday's rally in Istanbul - was the first stage of a long campaign.  We will be breaking down the walls of fear,  he told the crowd who gathered to welcome him at the end of his 425 km (265 mile) trek from the Turkish capital. Kilicdaroglu's protest march drew only modest support in its early days, but as more people joined him it grew into the biggest protest yet against the year-long, post-coup crackdown launched by President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party.  The last day of our Justice March is a new beginning, a new step,  said Kilicdaroglu, a bespectacled, 68-year-old veteran politician.  Rights, law, justice,  the crowd chanted back. He called on the government to lift a state of emergency enforced after the abortive July 2016 coup, release scores of journalists from prison and restore the independence of Turkey's courts. Kilicdaroglu, head of the secularist Republican People's Party (CHP), launched his protest last month after the jailing of a fellow parliamentarian for 25 years on spying charges. Enis Berberoglu was the first CHP lawmaker to be imprisoned in the purge. About 50,000 people have been arrested and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers, have been suspended.  The era we live in is a dictatorship,  Kilicdaroglu said.  Against One-Man Rule  People shout slogans as Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu (not pictured) walks on the final stage of his 25-day long protest, dubbed “Justice March”, against the detention of the party’s lawmaker Enis Berberoglu, in Istanbul, Turkey, July 9, 2017.Osman OrsalRights groups and government critics say Turkey has been drifting toward authoritarianism for years, a process they say accelerated since the coup bid and a referendum in April which granted Erdogan stronger powers. The government says the crackdown and constitutional changes are necessary to address challenges and security threats. Erdogan criticized Kilicdaroglu when he launched his protest, saying justice should be sought in parliament, not on the street. He likened the protesters to those who carried out the attempted coup, saying they could face charges. But Kilicdaroglu said the opposition had no alternative because Turkey's courts had been politicized,  the powers of parliament have been seized  and the media had been muzzled. Slideshow (18 Images) There is only a single place for our demand for justice and that is the streets,  he said. People in the crowd said they were heartened by the turnout.  This is now our future at stake,  said Beyhan, a 50-year-old civil servant who declined to give her full name.  Seeing this crowd has made my hopes blossom.    We are here for justice and democracy. We are here because we are against one-man rule,  she said.  There is no democracy, there is no freedom, even thinking is a crime.  Samet Burak Sari, 21, a student at Marmara University, said he spent four weeks in prison because he described Erdogan as a terrorist on Twitter. He was released but his trial continues. He said Sunday's Istanbul rally was the third time the opposition had come together in large numbers - firstly in the 2013 protests in Istanbul's Gezi Park, then in April over the referendum which narrowly approved Erdogan's new powers.  Through this march again, people with varying opinions have come together for the third time. Things like this keep the public opposition alive,  he said.

The championship leader is out of contract at the end of the year but Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne set out his team's position at the Austrian Grand Prix.  I made it very clear that if he wants to stay then we’ll just renew it. It’s up to him,  Marchionne told reporters before Sunday's race. Vettel has delayed contract talks to focus on the championship battle, saying there will be plenty of time over the summer, and any haggling is likely to be about money and the number of years. The German, a four times world champion, moved 20 points clear of closest rival Lewis Hamilton after finishing runner-up to the Briton's Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas at the Red Bull Ring. With the 20 round season approaching the halfway point at Silverstone next weekend, Vettel has won three races and it would probably have been four had he been given one more lap on Sunday. As it was, he missed out by a mere 0.6 of a second. Speaking to the Italian media afterwards, Marchionne said there was plenty to be happy about however.  It was very close. We are there and our German friends know it,  he said.  They can feel us breathing down their necks but we will cut this little gap. I am much happier than I was in the past. The boys know we have started the job and we must carry it through to the end.  While Vettel leads the standings, champions Mercedes stretched their lead in the constructors' standings to 33 points and are 5-3 to Ferrari on wins. But while Hamilton and Bottas have shared the spoils of victory, Vettel has been leading the charge for Ferrari with more than twice as many points as his Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen. Vettel's only obvious alternative to the most successful team in Formula One history would be Mercedes, but the German has already laughed off rumors of that happening.  I think the way we are set up right now, we find ourselves very happy and the focus is on this year despite the fact for next year there is nothing on paper,  he said in May. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda has also dismissed a move.  A Ferrari driver, his head is for Ferrari, and the money in the end is also there,  he said.

Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) voted to change the election law to ban political parties from engaging with such individuals, who also face bans on participating in politics through images, audio recordings and writing. Political parties which violate the law face a five-year suspension or could be dissolved. The amendment effectively bans former opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who lives in exile in France to avoid arrest in a number of convictions, from campaigning from abroad for the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).  The opposition CNRP boycotted Monday's National Assembly vote, calling the changes illegal.  The proposed law is politically motivated and is a political pressure on individual rights, the party and on rivals,  the CNRP said in a statement. The ruling CPP denied the changes were a bid to rein in the opposition.  These amendments are aimed at promoting the rule of law ... and strongly respect multi-party democracy,  CPP lawmaker Cheam Yeap told parliament before all 66 lawmakers present voted to back the changes.

His party won local elections last month.  The opposition CNRP did not fare badly in the vote, which many saw as a litmus test of its position ahead of the all-important national poll, winning about 43 percent of the vote. A man prepares at the National Assembly of Cambodia before a plenary session, in central Phnom Penh, Cambodia, July 10, 2017.Samrang PringCommenting on the change to the law, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights said the CPP was expanding its harassment of the opposition. Hun Sen proposed the amendments last month with the aim of removing Sam Rainsy from the political equation, one analyst said.  This is the CPP's way of consigning Rainsy to an early retirement, but expect him to continue his campaign against Hun Sen from abroad,  said Sebastian Strangio, author of the book  Hun Sen's Cambodia.  Strangio said the impact on the CNRP remains to be seen as current opposition leader Kem Sokha has shown that he is able to lead the party on his own. Sam Rainsy resigned from the CNRP in February before a law was adopted to bar those convicted of an offense from seeking office. He continues to be an active voice in Cambodia's politics, however, posting comments on social media platforms.

Seasonally adjusted exports climbed 1.4 percent - their fifth consecutive monthly increase - while imports were up 1.2 percent, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. Both figures came in stronger than expected: A Reuters poll had pointed to exports edging up 0.3 percent and imports rising by 0.5 percent. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus edged up to 20.3 billion euros from a revised 19.7 billion euros in April. The May reading was in line with the Reuters consensus forecast of 20.3 billion euros. Germany's wider current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, rose to 17.3 billion euros after a revised 14.9 billion euros in April, unadjusted data showed. The figures are likely to add fuel to the debate about Germany's export strength after the International Monetary Fund on Friday repeated its call for Berlin to increase investment as a way to reduce its current account surplus, increase imports and hence support the economic recovery in other countries.

Three weeks after the June 14 fire, neither the two companies involved in the cladding on the Grenfell Tower nor the local authority which enforces the building codes have addressed questions from Reuters about whether that test was ever conducted and its outcome. The test is required to show whether both materials when used together were sufficiently resistant to combustion. Without proof that it had been carried out, the cladding system would not have met building regulations. The cladding work carried about by Rydon Group Ltd, the main contractor on the 2014-2016 refurbishment of the building, and its subcontractor Harley Facades involved attaching insulation boards to the tower's concrete facade and covering them with aluminum composite panels. France's Saint Gobain said the insulation used was its brand of polyisocyanurate (PIR) called Celotex RS5000. The aluminum panels, which had a polyethylene plastic core were called Reynobond PE, and made by New York-based Arconic Inc, previously known as Alcoa Inc. If all the elements of the insulation system had achieved a separate and demanding government standard called  limited combustibility , in separate tests, then a combined test would not have been necessary, according to the building regulations. But Reynobond PE and Celotex did not meet the combustibility test by themselves, according to safety experts and product specifications published by the manufacturers. This meant that the two materials combined would need to pass another test known as the BS 8414 test, according to the building regulations. This involves setting a fire under a three-storey mock-up of the proposed wall construction. Both standards, set out in the guidelines to the building code, aim to prevent a fire spreading quickly from inside and up the exterior walls, something that happened at Grenfell Tower. In a June 29 email, a spokeswoman for Rydon Group Ltd says it “met all building regulations” but did not say if the BS 8414 test stipulated in the building codes had been conducted. The building control department of the local Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council (RBKC), which is responsible for checking that the building and plans are consistent with regulations, declined to say if it had checked the tests had been carried out. Police think the cladding system at Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of last month's fatal fire. They have said they are investigating possible criminal behavior and the role of all the companies involved in the building. The Department for Communities and Local Government, the government department which is responsible for setting the regulations enforced by building control, has said the cladding system used at Grenfell did not comply with the building rules it oversees. It has not said why and declined to answer detailed questions on its legal reasoning. Link to graphic of Grenfell Tower cladding system: tmsnrt.rs/2t97Ugs Combustibility The test used to assess combined materials must be commissioned from a government approved independent testing agency. Reuters was unable to determine which, if any lab was used. Rydon, which had a turnover of 249 million pounds last year, told Reuters the materials it used were suitable for use in tall buildings. “Laboratory testing of the fire resistance of the cladding system used at Grenfell Tower was carried out prior to installation. Please see attached BBA certificate,” the spokeswoman said in the June 29 email. The certificate Rydon provided showed the panels met a separate standard on the surface spread of fire. Asked specifically about the BS 8414 test, the Rydon spokeswoman said: “More technical questions would be better directed at Harley as it’s their area of expertise.” Executives and a spokesman at Harley, a small company with few assets, declined to comment for this story. It said in a statement on its website last month it was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower. An official at RBKC, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, declined to provide details of the specification it approved or what checks it conducted to ensure the actual construction met the approved plan, citing the ongoing police investigation into the fire. A spokeswoman for Saint Gobain said its BR 135 combustibility certification of Celotex was based on tests conducted with a non-combustible cement façade panel. She declined to say if Celotex had ever passed the BS 8414 test with a flammable façade panel such as Reynobond PE.

There is a lot more riding on Tesla Inc's deal to install the world's largest grid-scale electric battery in Australia than whether Elon Musk can meet his bold commitment to finish within the 100-day deadline. Under an agreement made public on July 7, Tesla must deliver the 100 megawatt (MW) battery within 100 days of the contract being signed, or the government of South Australia state won't have to pay the electric car, clean energy and space exploration company. On the surface, this is a deal aimed at providing back-up electricity to South Australia, a state that has been plagued by blackouts since it closed coal-fired power plants and moved to being powered mainly by renewables such as wind, and to a grid connection to neighboring Victoria state. Certainly, if successful, the 100 MW of Tesla lithium-ion batteries will be able to provide power to some 30,000 homes in South Australia, which is home to about 1.7 million people and ranks fifth by population of Australia's six states. But the significance of the deal goes way beyond the mere provision of emergency power, and it is likely to become a political football in Australia's wider energy debate. Broadly speaking, Australia's energy debate is becoming polarized into two factions, one in favor of using the nation's abundant coal as the main fuel, and the other committed to switching to mainly renewable sources of power as part of efforts to limit global climate change. While there are moderate voices in both camps urging a gradual and planned switch from the current situation where about 80 percent of the nation's power comes from ageing, polluting coal-fired plants, the more radical voices tend to grab the media headlines. Barnaby Joyce, the deputy prime minister and leader of the National Party, poured scorn on the Tesla battery plan, saying it wouldn't make much difference.  You know, a grain of sugar is an advantage to a teaspoon, but it doesn't make a hell of a lot of difference,  Joyce, whose party is the junior partner in the ruling Liberal-led federal government, said in a television interview on Sunday. The problem for the federal government, and indeed the state governments as well, is that electricity prices, and public anger, are soaring. Consumers in the main population states of New South Wales and Victoria face increases of as much as 20 percent this year in electricity bills, caused by rising generation costs amid the closure of several old coal-fired power plants. The question is what will replace these polluting plants as they reach the end of their useful lifespans. Misleading Claims The mining lobby, and elements within the ruling coalition, want to build new generation coal-fired plants, claiming these will be cheaper and less polluting. The so-called high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) coal plants would be less polluting than Australia's current fleet, but even these are still far more carbon-intensive than natural-gas plants, not to mention renewables. The Minerals Council of Australia released a report on July 3 in which it claimed a  clean coal  HELE plant would provide cheaper electricity than renewables. While the costings in the report are open to challenge, what was potentially misleading was the claim that HELE plants are  clean coal .  They are about 14 percent more efficient than older technology coal plants, but aren't clean insofar as they don't capture and store carbon emissions. This sort of claim certainly undermines the mining sector's credibility and helps boost the cause of the environmentalists. Sitting somewhere in the middle of the debate is Australia's petroleum industry, which has the dual aim of protecting its $200 billion of investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants and promoting the use of the cleaner-burning fuel domestically. The industry wants both federal and state governments to facilitate more onshore gas exploration and production, arguing that this will boost supply and lower costs. The environmental lobby, ignoring peer-reviewed science that fracking is largely safe if well regulated, wants an end to all unconventional and conventional natural gas exploration and production. At the very least, the environmentalists want restrictions on LNG exports in order to make natural gas cheaper and more available to the domestic market. Again, there is possibly misleading information and claims on both sides, with the industry stating that Australia's wholesale natural gas price is competitive in Asia (it is), but ignoring that retail prices have surged. For its part the environmental lobby, with the support of farming groups, is running a scare campaign on natural gas, using the typical bogeyman of greedy corporations sucking up and exporting resources, but ignoring that only one of the seven LNG plants actually buys gas that could be supplied domestically instead. Into this situation comes Tesla and its battery farm for South Australia. If the project does work, and more importantly is viewed by politicians and the public as a cost-effective success, then Barnaby Joyce may find that his one grain of sugar rapidly becomes many more. However, if the batteries don't prove effective in smoothing out South Australia's intermittent wind-powered electricity, then the move toward more renewables will take a blow, perhaps even big enough to allow the promoters of new coal plants an opportunity.

Last week's loss, delivered by a novice political group, spotlights Abe's potential vulnerability after nearly five years in power, with many blaming voter perceptions of arrogance on his part and that of his powerful Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga. Opinion polls on Monday showed Abe's popularity at its lowest since he returned to power late in 2012, with support of 36 percent in one conducted by the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper - tumbling from 49 percent a month earlier. Another, in the liberal Asahi, found support of 33 percent, a slide from 38 percent from a week earlier, with 60 percent of independent voters not supporting Abe's cabinet - numbers Suga said the premier was aware of.   I believe he wants to sincerely accept this as the voice of the people,  Suga told a news conference, adding that the administration needed to  be even more earnest  about tasks such as rebuilding the economy. Abe, in Europe for a summit of leaders of the G20 grouping of nations, told traveling media he would retain core officials in the reshuffle of the cabinet and ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) officials planned for August.  I will reshuffle the LDP leadership and the Cabinet members early next month, aiming to renew peoples' feelings,  Jiji news agency quoted Abe as saying in Stockholm.  Stability is extremely important to deliver results. The core structure of the Cabinet should not be changed so often.  Japanese media said the remarks mean he will retain Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, who also serves as finance minister, along with Suga and LDP number two Toshihiro Nikai, while ditching gaffe-prone Defence Minister Tomomi Inada. He also said he would skip a planned visit to Estonia and would arrive back in Japan a day early to visit the flood-devastated southwest. Reshuffling the cabinet is a step often taken by beleaguered leaders to repair popularity, but Suga denied that was the case.  The prime minister is himself selecting the best person for each job in order to achieve what we have to do,  he said. Exactly a year ago, Abe's ruling bloc stormed to a landslide victory in an election for parliament's upper house, despite concerns over his economic policies and plans to revise the nation's postwar constitution. His administration has since been battered by a scandal over suspicions of favoritism to a friend's business, verbal gaffes by cabinet ministers and concerns about Abe's intentions to revise the constitution.  He faced another challenge on Monday, when former vice education minister Kihei Maekawa testified to parliamentary panels on concerns Abe may have intervened to help win approval for a veterinary school run by an education group whose director, Kotaro Kake, is a friend. Abe has repeatedly denied doing Kake any favors. On July 2, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike's novice Tokyo Citizens First party and its allies - including the LDP's national coalition partner - won a landslide victory in the assembly election, taking 79 of the 127 seats up for grabs. The LDP got 23 seats, its worst ever result in the capital and less than half its pre-vote tally.

For 8 1/3 innings, the rookie held the White Sox hitless -- the most no-hit innings by a Rockies pitcher at Coors Field. Freeland was tantalizingly close to pitching the second no-hitter in franchise history and the first by a Colorado pitcher at Coors Field when Melky Cabrera lined a single over the head of third baseman Nolan Arenado that finished Freeland's workday after 126 pitches -- 80 for strikes.  Cabrera was able to muscle that fastball inside over Nolan's head,  Freeland said.  I tip my cap to him. I made my pitch, and he put a good enough swing on it to get a hit.  Freeland, who was replaced by Jordan Lyles after giving up the base hit, was bidding to become the second pitcher to throw a no-hitter at Coors Field. Hideo Nomo accomplished the feat for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1996. The left-hander hit one batter and walked three in his 18th career start. He had a career-high nine strikeouts, all swinging. Freeland, who was born 39 days after the first game in franchise history in 1993, had to summon his days pitching for Thomas Jefferson High School in Denver to remember the only no-hitter he has thrown -- a game ended by the mercy rule. Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at RockiesChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch I threw a no-hitter against George Washington High School,  Freeland said.  We 10-runned them, so it was a five-inning no-hitter.  Cabrera, who singled on a 2-2 fastball clocked at 93 mph, said,  I just went to the plate and was looking for a good pitch to hit. I wasn't thinking about anything else, just a good pitch to hit.  The win in the rubber game of the series was just the fifth victory in 17 games for the Rockies, whose 52-39 record is a franchise best at the All-Star break. Freeland's no-hit bid was the second longest by a Rockies pitcher and second longest at Coors Field. Ubaldo Jimenez threw the only no-hitter in team history -- a 4-0 victory at Atlanta on April 17, 2010. Nomo tossed the only no-hitter at Coors Field on Sept. 17, 1996. In Los Angeles' 9-0 victory, he walked four and struck out eight while throwing 66 of 110 pitches for strikes. The Rockies scored two runs in the second inning and put the focus squarely on Freeland rather than the outcome with a five-run sixth. The latter rally began with Charlie Blackmon's home run that soared an estimated 477 feet, striking the back wall of the Chicago bullpen. Pat Valaika's three-run shot made it 7-0. In Colorado's three-run seventh, Valaika had a two-run single, giving him a career-high five RBIs. Freeland singled home a run in that inning. White Sox starter Carlos Rodon (1-2) gave up six runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings. Freeland was 0-3 with a 7.27 ERA in his previous three starts. In his last outing Tuesday against Cincinnati, Freeland received a lengthy fourth-inning lecture on the mound from Rockies manager Bud Black, who shooed away the infielders and held a stern one-on-one meeting with Freeland. The rookie then retired the next eight batters he faced.  I knew I was in a rut, and he knew I was in a rut,  Freeland said.  And it just motivated me. I said, 'You got the manager on you right now, so it's time to really grind and make a change.'  On Sunday, Freeland (9-7) retired the first 11 Chicago batters he faced before nicking Jose Abreu with a pitch. He walked Omar Narvaez to open the sixth. Narvaez moved to second on a sacrifice by Rodon, took third on Adam Engel's grounder to shortstop. However, Freeland retired Cabrera on a fly to short center. Freeland walked Abreu and Todd Frazier to start the seventh. Chris Rusin began loosening up in the Colorado bullpen, but Freeland got Avisail Garcia to ground into a double play and retired Tim Anderson on a fly to right.  I thought he pitched inside extremely well, both in off the plate and for strikes,  Black said.  I thought his slider-cutter was much better than it's been the last four starts. I thought the fastball away had great action.  Freeland said  it was a ton of fun to battle out there  and that he was in synch with catcher Ryan Hanigan, who caught both no-hitters thrown by Cincinnati's Homer Bailey.  I liked that he used his emotion but didn't let it mess up his mechanics,  Hanigan said.  He still kept really executing pitches, but he was pumped. He was real aggressive, just letting it loose and (had) really good fastball command. It was a consistent, solid day all the way through.  Lyles retired the two batters he faced to complete the shutout. NOTES: Colorado LHP Kyle Freeland, who has pitched 107 1/3 innings in his first 18 career starts, is scheduled to begin the second half in the bullpen to limit his innings but likely will return to the rotation around July 25. ... Rockies RHP Jon Gray will start the first game in New York against the Mets on Friday after the All-Star break, followed by RHP Tyler Chatwood and RHP Jeff Hoffman. RHP Antonio Senzatela will start on July 18 against San Diego. RHP German Marquez will oppose the Padres on July 17. ... Rockies RF Carlos Gonzalez, who wasn't in the lineup the past two games, started and batted seventh for the first time since Aug. 1, 2009. ... White Sox RF Avisail Garcia returned to the lineup after missing two games with a sprained right middle finger. ... White Sox RHP Nate Jones (right elbow neuritis) will be re-evaluated during the All-Star break. He felt uncomfortable throwing on flat ground Friday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-whitesox-rockies-writethru-idUSMTZED79UIGV4M"},

European stock markets were also poised for a more positive start, with financial spreadbetter CMC Markets expecting Britain's FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX to open up 0.4 percent each, and France's CAC 40 to start the day 0.3 percent higher. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.4 percent while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent. Australian stocks were up 0.3 percent and South Korea's KOSPI added 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1 percent, though China's bluechip shares were flat. On Friday, Wall Street closed higher after U.S. jobs growth beat forecasts. However, a lag in wage increases led investors to bet wage data would limit the extent of the Federal Reserve's hawkishness. The Nasdaq led gains with a 1 percent jump, while the S&P; 500 added 0.6 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent.  Strong headline growth, amid poor wage growth, is seemingly a perfect storm for equities,  Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note.  Looking ahead, traders will continue to watch fixed income like a hawk for further knock-on effects into foreign exchange and equities,  particularly with speeches by Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Governor Lael Brainard due this week, Weston added. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a two-month high of 2.398 percent on Friday. It was at 2.3909 on Monday. The dollar inched up 0.2 percent to 114.135 yen early on Monday, extending Friday's 0.6 percent jump on the jobs data.  The solid jobs report gives us more reason to expect the Fed to announce that it's prepared to start trimming its balance sheet,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.  By contrast, the Bank of Japan is nowhere near a policy exit, and it's taking steps that weaken the yen,  he said. The dollar index, which climbed 0.2 percent on Friday, was little changed at 96.028 on Monday. The euro was fractionally lower at $1.1402 on Monday, extending Friday's 0.1 percent decline. The Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg over the weekend did not have much impact on markets on Monday. At the meeting, the world's leading economies broke with the U.S. on climate policy and U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to work together on North Korea's nuclear threat and bilateral trade. Trump also discussed forming a cyber security unit to guard against election hacking with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though he later backtracked from that position. In commodities markets, oil crept higher on Monday after sliding on Friday on a report showing U.S. crude production rose last week, just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high, rekindling concerns about a supply glut. U.S. oil rose 0.8 percent to $44.59 a barrel on Monday, making up some of Friday's 2.8 percent loss. Global benchmark Brent also advanced 0.8 percent to $47.10, following Friday's 2.9 percent slide. Gold inched down 0.2 percent to $1,210.92, close to the four-month low touched on Friday as the dollar surged and demand for risk assets rose.

Michael Fulmer pitched into the seventh inning, and Jose Iglesias had three hits as the Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 5-3 on Sunday night at Progressive Field. Fulmer (9-6) gave up three runs, two earned, on seven hits with one strikeout and one walk in six-plus innings. Justin Wilson got the last five outs to pick up his 10th save. Cleveland's Nick Goody (1-1), in relief of starter Corey Kluber, gave up three runs in one-third of an inning to take the loss. The Tigers were outscored 15-2 while losing the first two games of the series.  We salvaged a win, and now we can go into the break not feeling sour about the way the games have gone,  Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said.  We'll have a nice four days off and be ready to go for the second half.  For that, they can thank Fulmer, who outpitched Kluber in a battle of aces.  I knew I had to put up zeros, and the offense did a great job of getting Kluber out after the fifth inning,  Fulmer said. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at IndiansDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchKluber was removed after five mostly because his pitch count was at 101. He gave up one run on three hits with eight strikeouts and three walks.  He had to work so hard in the top of the fifth,  Cleveland acting manager Brad Mills said.  He threw like 30 pitches and had traffic all over the place.  Kluber added,  They put together some good at-bats, and I didn't have my best command.  Goody came in to start the sixth inning with the score tied at 1-1. Miguel Cabrera led off with a walk and was forced out at second on a groundball hit by J.D. Martinez. Victor Martinez singled, moving the runner to second, and Nicholas Castellanos walked to load the bases. Dan Otero relieved Goody, and Alex Presley greeted Otero with a double to left field, scoring J.D. Martinez and Victor Martinez, giving Detroit a 3-1 lead. Castellanos went to third on Presley's hit, then scored on an infield single by Iglesias to make it 4-1. An RBI single by Castellanos in the seventh stretched the lead to 5-1. Fulmer held Cleveland to one run on three hits through six innings before struggling in the seventh. Edwin Encarnacion led off with a single, and he rode home on Jose Ramirez's 17th home run, a shot into the right field seats on a 3-2 pitch that cut Cleveland's deficit to 5-3.  I don't think I could have thrown a better pitch in that situation,  Fulmer said.  A front-door sinker, down and in. There's a reason Jose Ramirez is starting in the All-Star Game.  Fulmer gave up singles to the next two batters and was removed from the game.  I think the last two innings, there was a lot of down time (while the Tigers were hitting), and I think that got to him,  Ausmus said. Shane Greene escaped the inning, then got the first out in the eighth before Wilson entered. Wilson pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, and then with a runner at first and two outs in the ninth, he struck out Francisco Lindor to end the game.  It was certainly a well-earned save,  Ausmus said. Kluber retired the first eight batters he faced before giving up a two-out double to Iglesias in the third inning. Ian Kinsler followed with a soft single to center field on an 0-2 pitch to score Iglesias with the first run of the game. The Indians scored an unearned run in the fourth inning to tie it. Bradley Zimmer led off with a single. Fulmer threw wildly to first on a pickoff attempt, allowing Zimmer to advance to second. Fulmer retired Lindor on a flyout and Michael Brantley on a groundout, but Encarnacion doubled down the left field line, scoring Zimmer. NOTES: Indians OF Lonnie Chisenhall left in the fourth inning due to a right calf strain. ... Cleveland 2B Jason Kipnis was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right hamstring strain. To replace Kipnis on the roster, the Indians recalled 3B Giovanny Urshela from Triple-A Columbus. ... Tigers 1B Miguel Cabrera was 0-for-1 against RHP Corey Kluber, but Cabrera's career batting average against Kluber is still .434 (23-for-53) with three doubles, six home runs and 12 RBIs. ... Detroit RHP Shane Greene has inherited 34 baserunners, and only four have scored. He entered with two on and no outs in the seventh inning Sunday and didn't let a runner come home. Greene's 12.5 percent inherited-runners-scored percentage leads the American League. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-indians-recap-idUSMTZED7AUXAAW3"},

At least 15 House and Senate Republicans broke with first-term Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on Thursday and joined with Democrats to override Rauner's vetoes of the state's first budget package in more than two years.  The $36 billion spending plan relies on a $5 billion tax increase that permanently hikes the flat personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent, up 32 percent from its prior 3.75 percent rate. To address the state's nearly $15 billion in unpaid bills, Illinois depends heavily on borrowing. Lawmakers approved $6 billion of 12-year bonds to raise money for repayments. But State Representative Greg Harris, the House Democrats' point person on the budget, has acknowledged there is only enough revenue to support half of that borrowing amount.  Illinois will also borrow up to $1.2 billion from various state accounts that have accumulated cash for specific purposes, while  sweeping  cash from other accounts --a government version of looking under couch cushions that is expected to yield $300 million.  Illinois' $130 billion pension liability is one of the largest in the nation, and the new budget takes only small steps to address the structural underfunding of Illinois' five retirement systems.  The new law gives the state five years to phase in changes retroactive to fiscal 2014 in actuarial or investment return assumptions made by the pension systems for an estimated savings of $892.1 million.  Seemingly small changes in projected investment results can have significant impact on a pension fund's actuarial calculations. Last year, when the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System reduced its earnings assumption to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, the change caused a $660 million spike in the state's fiscal 2018 contribution. FILE PHOTO: Illinois Governor Pat Quinn delivers his State of the State address to the joint session of the General Assembly in the House Chambers of the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois February 1, 2012.Sarah ConardThe new budget attributes $500 million in savings to the creation of a new tier of pension beneficiaries. But that tier applies largely to newly hired employees, raising questions about how the state expects to book that savings in the current fiscal year. That estimate was lifted straight from the proposed budget presented by Rauner earlier this year. The projection has not been independently verified by legislative leaders, and Rauner's office has not responded to requests for an explanation of how the estimate was calculated.  The Illinois Education Association, one of the state's largest unions, said it has no evidence that its pensioners would be harmed by the new budget's pension provisions. But the union questioned why lawmakers approved structural changes to pensions without an independent financial analysis.   It's a little bit of a shot in the dark. For something this major, you'd think the legislators who are voting on this would want to know this information,  said Jim Reed, the union's government relations director. A budget was welcomed as a positive step for Illinois, which still faces fiscal and pension crises.  The pension pressures will continue, and Illinois' financial challenges will continue, but at least there will be a framework to recognize there's a limit to the liability growth to this state,  said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a budget watchdog group. Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank, said the fixes in the new budget do not match up to the challenges faced by Illinois.  This is the kind of budget you would pass if you were a state that hit a bump in the road and had a deficit you needed to get rid of over the next two or three years,  he said.  It's not the kind of budget you'd pass if you have $14 billion in unpaid bills and a $130 billion unfunded (pension) liability.  The Democrats and Republicans who voted for the budget did so at least in part to prevent Illinois from becoming the first U.S. state in history to see its credit rating fall to  junk  status. Moody's on Wednesday put Illinois on review for a possible downgrade, but some of the state's bonds traded higher on Friday, an apparent sign of optimism about the budget.       Additional reporting by Julia Jacobs; Editing by David Greising and Sandra Maler","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-illinois-budget-idUSKBN19V0BQ"},

Hong Kong shares gained over 1 percent, as a jump in financials offset a tumble in raw material stocks. China's blue-chip CSI300 index was unchanged at 3,655.38 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, to 3,211.31 points. Small-caps underperformed, with the start-up board ChiNext losing over 1 percent. Markets shrugged off China's inflation data, which met expectations and did little to alter the view that economic growth is cooling after a solid first quarter. Producer price inflation was unchanged in June at 5.5 percent and remained well off highs seen earlier this year, while June consumer prices rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said that  with slowing credit growth likely to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters ... inflation will start falling again before long.  This will disappoint those hopping for a sustained period of reflation that could help to erode corporate debt burdens.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was sanguine about the outlook even as he acknowledged that the economy still faced many difficulties. Most economists expect growth to cool off in the next few quarters as the key real estate sector slows, while Beijing's crack down on debt risks raises financing costs in a generally tighter funding environment. China will release second-quarter gross domestic product(GDP) on July 17, along with June industrial output, retail sales and January-June fixed asset investment. Sector performance was mixed on Monday, with energy and coal shares dropping, while consumer shares rose following last week's correction. UBS Securities analyst Gao Ting said that after stellar gains in certain sectors such as consumer, investor views are to diverge.  Expectations for these stocks have begun to diverge, with some investors seeing limited upside for quality consumer stocks as valuations touch five-year highs after substantial YTD gains, while others remain upbeat on the re-rating potential of leading players.  Hong Kong Hong Kong stocks were firm, with the Hang Seng index adding 1.1 percent, to 25,608.16 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index rising 0.6 percent, to 10,314.86. Sentiment was aided by a surge in COSCO Shipping's and Hong Kong's Orient Overseas International Ltd's (OOIL) shares after the Chinese shipping giant made a $6.3 billion offer for its smaller rival on Sunday. Index heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd rose over 1 percent, on news that the Chinese gaming giant will launch its mega-hit smartphone game  Honour of Kings  in the EU and United States this year.

At least 15 House and Senate Republicans broke with first-term Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on Thursday and joined with Democrats to override Rauner's vetoes of the state's first budget package in more than two years.  The $36 billion spending plan relies on a $5 billion tax increase that permanently hikes the flat personal income tax rate to 4.95 percent, up 32 percent from its prior 3.75 percent rate. To address the state's nearly $15 billion in unpaid bills, Illinois depends heavily on borrowing. Lawmakers approved $6 billion of 12-year bonds to raise money for repayments. But State Representative Greg Harris, the House Democrats' point person on the budget, has acknowledged there is only enough revenue to support half of that borrowing amount.  Illinois will also borrow up to $1.2 billion from various state accounts that have accumulated cash for specific purposes, while  sweeping  cash from other accounts --a government version of looking under couch cushions that is expected to yield $300 million.  Illinois' $130 billion pension liability is one of the largest in the nation, and the new budget takes only small steps to address the structural underfunding of Illinois' five retirement systems.  The new law gives the state five years to phase in changes retroactive to fiscal 2014 in actuarial or investment return assumptions made by the pension systems for an estimated savings of $892.1 million.  Seemingly small changes in projected investment results can have significant impact on a pension fund's actuarial calculations. Last year, when the Illinois Teachers' Retirement System reduced its earnings assumption to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, the change caused a $660 million spike in the state's fiscal 2018 contribution. FILE PHOTO: Illinois Governor Pat Quinn delivers his State of the State address to the joint session of the General Assembly in the House Chambers of the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois February 1, 2012.Sarah ConardThe new budget attributes $500 million in savings to the creation of a new tier of pension beneficiaries. But that tier applies largely to newly hired employees, raising questions about how the state expects to book that savings in the current fiscal year. That estimate was lifted straight from the proposed budget presented by Rauner earlier this year. The projection has not been independently verified by legislative leaders, and Rauner's office has not responded to requests for an explanation of how the estimate was calculated.  The Illinois Education Association, one of the state's largest unions, said it has no evidence that its pensioners would be harmed by the new budget's pension provisions. But the union questioned why lawmakers approved structural changes to pensions without an independent financial analysis.   It's a little bit of a shot in the dark. For something this major, you'd think the legislators who are voting on this would want to know this information,  said Jim Reed, the union's government relations director. A budget was welcomed as a positive step for Illinois, which still faces fiscal and pension crises.  The pension pressures will continue, and Illinois' financial challenges will continue, but at least there will be a framework to recognize there's a limit to the liability growth to this state,  said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a budget watchdog group. Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank, said the fixes in the new budget do not match up to the challenges faced by Illinois.  This is the kind of budget you would pass if you were a state that hit a bump in the road and had a deficit you needed to get rid of over the next two or three years,  he said.  It's not the kind of budget you'd pass if you have $14 billion in unpaid bills and a $130 billion unfunded (pension) liability.  The Democrats and Republicans who voted for the budget did so at least in part to prevent Illinois from becoming the first U.S. state in history to see its credit rating fall to  junk  status. Moody's on Wednesday put Illinois on review for a possible downgrade, but some of the state's bonds traded higher on Friday, an apparent sign of optimism about the budget.       Additional reporting by Julia Jacobs; Editing by David Greising and Sandra Maler","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-budget-idUSL1N1JY1DZ"},

U.S. job growth surged more than expected in June and employers increased hours for workers, suggesting the Fed could stick to its plan for its third interest rate hike this year and begin to reduce its balance sheet despite sluggish wage gains and tepid inflation. Against the yen, the dollar was 0.2 percent higher at 114.16 , after notching a high of 114.21, its loftiest level since May 11. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against a currency basket, was steady at 96.012.  The solid jobs report gives us more reason to expect the Fed to announce that it's prepared to start trimming its balance sheet,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.  By contrast, the Bank of Japan is nowhere near a policy exit, and it's taking steps that weaken the yen,  he said. On Friday, the BOJ sought to keep Japanese government bond yields near its policy target, embarking on a special market operation as well as increasing the size of its regular JGB purchase operations. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday reiterated in a speech at a quarterly meeting of the central bank's regional branch managers that the central bank is resolved to maintain its massive stimulus programme until inflation is stably above its 2 percent target. Data released on Monday showed Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly tumbled in May and the government downgraded the outlook for orders for the first time in eight months, raising doubts about the strength of the country's economic recovery. Recent positioning data showed that some investors pared their long dollar positions ahead of the jobs report, amid concerns that a spate of lacklustre data would prompt the Fed to alter its hawkish plans. Speculators this week slashed net long bets on the U.S. dollar to their lowest since mid-May 2016 in the week ended July 4, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the dollar's net long positions dropped to $135 million, from net longs of $4.5 billion the previous week. The latest week marked the first time since mid-April 2016 that net long dollar positioning fell to under $1 billion. A majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters were less bullish on the dollar than at the start of the year and more optimistic about the euro. Still, higher U.S. Treasury yields underpinned the dollar. The benchmark 10-year U.S. yield stood at 2.389 percent in Asian trading, not far from its U.S. close of 2.393 percent on Friday, when it touched a more than eight-week high of 2.398 percent after the jobs report.  Ultimately, the broader theme remains in play, and that is volatility remains really low,  said Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong. In such a climate, investors are more apt to do carry trades, in which they borrow lower-yielding currencies such as the yen to buy higher-yielding ones. The euro edged down slightly on the day to $1.1404 but gained against its Japanese counterpart. The euro was 0.3 percent higher at 130.20 yen, after rising as high as 130.275 yen, its highest since February 2016.

The purchase comes after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the U.S. in June when President Donald Trump said his country looked forward to exporting more energy products to India. IOC bought 1.6 million barrels of U.S. Mars crude, a heavy, high-sulfur grade, and 400,000 barrels of Western Canadian Select that will be delivered onboard a Very Large Crude Carrier, IOC's head of finance, A.K. Sharma, told Reuters. PetroChina was awarded the tender to sell the cargoes and is expected to load the oil off the U.S. Gulf Coast, said a trading source with direct knowledge of the sale. The cargo was priced on a delivered ex-ship basis, which is  very competitive  to that of Basra Light, Sharma said.  So long as the prices remain competitive, we will buy more of the U.S. crude,  he said. IOC had to obtain special permission from the shipping ministry to buy the cargo on a delivered basis as local regulations favor the use of Indian flagged carriers for imports, Sharma said. India is the latest Asian country to buy U.S. crude after South Korea, Japan, China, Thailand, Australia and Taiwan as the countries seek to diversify oil imports from other regions after the OPEC cuts drove up prices of Middle East heavy-sour crude, or grades with a high sulfur content. Indian refiners are seeking these heavy, high-sulfur grades as feedstocks after modifications at their plants make it easier to process these types of crudes, which typically sell at a lower cost relative to other oil types. The U.S. could become an alternative source for the Indian companies for these grades. A second Indian refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd also planned to buy its first ever U.S. crude oil cargo and has issued a purchase tender.
