An annual report released by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Shanghai found that 73.5 percent of the 426 companies surveyed reported revenue growth in 2016, up from the 61 percent recorded in 2015.  The U.S. business lobby, which conducted the survey between April 11 and May 7, said this reflected improved economic stability last year.  These increases reflect a return to previous trends after a particularly poor 2015, not a meaningful improvement in business conditions,  AmCham said.   China remains a difficult market and more efforts are necessary to create a truly level playing field for foreign companies.  Concerns over the health of the Chinese economy have eased this year after higher government infrastructure spending and a property boom helped it to post better-than-expected growth figures starting from the second-half of 2016. But Beijing has also pushed forward with policies such as  Made in China 2025,  which aims to upgrade the country's domestic manufacturing base, and has undertaken a series of state-driven company mergers aimed at creating national champions.  These moves were among the U.S. companies' top concerns, AmCham said. More than half of respondents, especially in healthcare, said Chinese policy favored local firms over foreign ones, and 33 percent said policies towards foreign firms had worsened.  China's new cybersecurity law, which took effect on June 1 and mandates companies store all data within China and pass security reviews, was one example of unfair treatment as it restricted participation by foreign firms in China's cloud market, the business lobby said.   There is a growing asymmetry between the access that Chinese companies enjoy in other markets and the access foreign companies have in China,  it said.  U.S. companies were also worried about a lack of regulatory transparency, including inadequate protections for intellectual property. Forty percent of respondents believed that the U.S. government should use investment reciprocity to help firms gain better access to China, it said.  Respondents reported lower long-term optimism levels for a second year, with 80.2 percent of firms expressing optimism over the next five years, down from a few years prior when the metric consistently was above 90 percent.  Still, most companies were bullish for 2017, with 82 percent forecasting revenue increases, up from 76 percent last year, AmCham said.

The dollar fell to a more than one-week low against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump's eldest son released an email chain citing Russian support for his father before last year's U.S. election.     Meanwhile, workers voted to approve a strike at a mine in Chile, following industrial disputes in Indonesia and at the world's biggest copper mine, also in Chile, earlier in the year, that whittled into copper supply.      The short term fundamentals look supportive on the price where it is, but the more we move into the fall and the winter, we just don't think that the pace of the Chinese economy can sustain,  said analyst Dane Davis at Barclays in New York.        With the Chinese engaging in the policy of credit tightening and the real-estate sector starting to cool off, the evidence suggests you have a weakening in the market. Not a collapse, because the supply side is too tight, but a return to price around $2.50 (per pound, $5,500/tonne).       A weaker dollar typically draws interest for U.S. dollar-denominated commodities such as copper from investors outside the United States using other currencies.          FUNDAMENTALS     * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the LME was up 0.5 percent at $5,902 a tonne by 0316 GMT, building on overnight gains in the more active London sessions.     * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was 1.1 percent higher at 47,350 yuan ($6,962.21) a tonne.     * STEEL: SHFE zinc and nickel rallied more than 2 percent, tracking an uplift in steel amid higher profits at China's steel makers following closures of outdated capacity.      * STRIKE:  Workers at the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile, owned by Antofagasta and Barrick Gold Corp, voted to approve a strike on Monday after talks with the company failed, a union leader told Reuters.     * FREEPORT: Indonesia says it will invite the head of mining giant Freeport McMoRan Inc to Jakarta this month to try to settle a long-running dispute over a new deal to operate the world's second-largest copper mine.      * CHINA CAR SALES: Vehicle sales rebounded in June, shaking off weakness in the previous two months.

The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans comes more than two years after the judges halted the execution of convicted murderer Scott Panetti to consider his appeal over being denied an appointed counsel and funding for a mental health expert and investigator. Panetti, in his late 50s, was convicted of fatally shooting his wife's parents in the central Texas town of Fredericksburg in 1992.  Tuesday's decision reverses a 2014 order by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin, Texas. It sends Panetti's case back to the U.S. District Court, telling the judge to appoint a lawyer for Panetti, authorize federal funds for a mental health expert and investigator to aid him in his defense, and  conduct any further proceedings to determine afresh Panetti's competency to be executed.   Delivery of the process due protects the prisoner and in doing so protects us all,  Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote in a 19-page opinion and order.     Texas prosecutors said Panetti shaved his head and armed himself with a sawed-off shotgun and broke into the home of Joe and Amanda Alvarado, killing the two with his wife and daughter witnessing him shoot dead his mother-in-law. Panetti represented himself at his 1995 trial, often speaking incoherently and seeking to call Jesus Christ and President John F. Kennedy as defense witnesses. He was sentenced to death in 1995. The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires a criminal defendant to have a rational understanding of why he is being put to death and the effect of the death penalty. A representative for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Paxton's office has said a number of courts have ruled Panetti competent to stand trial and to be executed. Greg Wiercioch and Kathryn Kase, attorneys for Panetti, said in an e-mailed statement they were grateful the court found Panetti's decades of documented schizophrenia sufficient to obtain experts and resources to pursue the claim that he is currently incompetent for execution.

But despite decades of power shortages, companies are only starting to catch on. Old Mutual Zimbabwe Ltd, the countryâ€™s biggest insurance and property firm, now plans to install up to 20 megawatts of rooftop solar panels on all its commercial buildings over the next two years to help ease a countrywide power crisis that has begun to drag profits down, company officials said. As state power utility ZESA Holdings struggles to generate enough electricity to meet demand, power outages have hurt businesses in recent years, according to the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI). During 2015-2016, as drought hit hydropower production in much of southern Africa, industrial production fell by more than 50 percent, confederation officials said. Now a growing share of companies are looking to solar power not just as an alternative to the grid but as a way to cut costs and keep businesses going in a country where energy costs can be a substantial drain on businesses.  But progress is so far slow, though picking up speed, officials said. â€œBy securing clean reliable power in its (Old Mutual) buildings, this will benefit its commercial tenants who rely on consistent availability of power,â€� said Simba Mhuriro, chief executive of Oxygen Africa Ltd, an independent energy producer that won the contract to put in place Old Mutualâ€™s $38 million solar project. The company has begun a technical study to establish how power consumption operates at the Old Mutual properties in question, using a $1 million grant from the African Development Bank. Mhuriro said the project will provide power for lighting and heating, and for operating office equipment and small machinery, such as sewing machines, for over 8,000 small businesses renting space from Old Mutualâ€™s $500 million property portfolio, which spans offices, homes and shopping malls. â€œThe systems will be grid-tied systems that integrate both solar and grid power. The solar will primarily displace grid power during the day,â€� Mhuriro told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email. Cash to Switch Zimbabweâ€™s government has said it needs $3 billion in aid to meet its goals to expand off-grid solar power laid out in a government plan drawn up as part of the Paris Agreement on climate change. That plan aims to reduce carbon emissions by measures such as requiring that solar water heaters be installed in all new homes and in commercial and industrial buildings. The southern African country aims to cut its total emissions by about a third by 2030, mostly by increasing investment in hydropower and solar power and improving energy efficiency. At the end of June, nearly 28 percent of Zimbabweâ€™s electricity supply came from fossil fuel power plants, and about half from hydropower. The remainder is imported, according to ZESA Holdings, the national utility. Businesses so far havenâ€™t played a significant part in transitioning to cleaner energy, even though they have been one of the biggest sources of emissions, said Tendai Marowa, a director with the Business Council for Sustainable Development Zimbabwe. Thatâ€™s in part due to a lack of clear-cut national policies for driving renewable energy use in industry, which consumes 64 percent of the national power supply, he said. According to a CZI survey, only 2 percent of company spending on energy alternatives to the national grid in 2016 went to solar power. Another 10 percent went to liquefied petroleum gas. The majority â€“ 60 percent â€“ went to diesel generators, the survey said. But Old Mutual expects that installing solar panels will help it save $16 million it spends each year buying 12 million liters of diesel to supplement grid power, company spokesperson Tendayi Mutseyekwa said. â€œMore than 33,000 tonnes of emissions will be avoided each year,â€� he said. At Mimosa Platinum, a company in the countryâ€™s Midlands province, 360 solar water heaters installed in staff houses three years ago generate 1.5 MW of power. That's been helpful - but very small in terms of the company's overall power bills, given the huge amount of power required by the mine itself, officials said. â€œThe financial impact in the context of Mimosaâ€™s overall costs has not been ... significant,â€� said Winston Chitando, Mimosa Platinumâ€™s executive chairman. But the company is now awaiting the results of a feasibility study into using solar power for the mine itself, he said. Altogether, CZI data show that a quarter of companies in Zimbabwe remain completely dependent on grid electricity supplies. But Tawanda Muzamwese, a Zimbabwean independent energy expert, believes many more companies eventually will make the switch to solar power â€“ a potentially abundant source of energy in a largely sunny country. â€œCompanies are beginning to realize that sustainable energy can improve their competitiveness (and) profitability as well as improve access to foreign markets that are increasingly demanding products produced sustainably,â€� Muzamwese said.

Takata air bag inflators are already linked to 17 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide, and the recalls will eventually cover about 125 million inflators. The auto safety agency said new testing is prompting the recall of some driver-side air bags built from 2015 through 2012. Nissan said it will recall 627,000 Versa cars from 2007-2012 model years, including 515,000 in the United States  out of an abundance of caution.  It will notify owners within 60 days with additional instructions.     Ford spokesman John Cangany said the issue covers about 2.2 million Ford vehicles, and the company has five days to respond to the Takata filing. The automaker is  aware of Takataâ€™s submission, and we have been in regular contact with the agency on the issue. Importantly, we arenâ€™t aware of any incidents, and test data doesnâ€™t suggest any issues,  he said.  Mazda said the new recall impacts just 6,000 B-series trucks. FILE PHOTO: A woman stands next to a logo of Takata Corp at a showroom for vehicles in Tokyo, Japan,  November 6, 2015.Toru Hanai/File PhotoMore than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. The issue is the largest ever auto safety recall covering 17 automakers. Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in June. Takata inflator ruptures occur after long-term exposure to high humidity, NHTSA has said. Prior Takata recalls have involved air bag inflators without a drying agent. The new 2.7 million air bag inflators being recalled involve a drying agent, but Takata said testing showed ruptures could still take place.  Takata has told the public that their line of air bag inflators with moisture absorbent was safe. This recall now raises serious questions about the threat posed by all of Takataâ€™s ammonium nitrate-based airbags,  U.S. Senator Bill Nelson said in a statement.  If even more are found to be defective, it will take us from the biggest recall ever to something that could become mind-boggling.  Honda Motor Co (7267.T) said Monday it had confirmed an 11th U.S. death involving one of its vehicles tied to a faulty Takata air bag inflator. Takata expects to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including more than 60 million in the United States, Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, said in June.

Britain's Start Network, which includes 42 leading aid agencies such as Oxfam, Care International and Save the Children, has teamed up with social enterprise start up Disberse to use blockchain, the network said.  This exciting partnership could lead to the transformation needed in the way money flows through the humanitarian system,  said Sean Lowrie, director of Start Network, in a statement.  (It) could catalyze a new way of working, one that is transparent, fast and which drives accountability to taxpayers and those affected by crises.  Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralized authority. It has become a key technology in both the public and private sectors, given its ability to record and keep track of assets or transactions without the need for middlemen. The new Disberse platform will use the blockchain technology to ensure that less money is lost to banking fees, poor exchange rates and currency fluctuations, Start Network said. Fraud is also a major issue within the international aid system. In 2012, former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said 30 percent of all U.N. development assistance was lost to corruption. As blockchain automatically records transactions on a secure ledger, donors can easily follow the money lowering the risk of financial misuse.     A UK-based charity  Positive Women  has already completed a pilot project using the Disberse platform to reduce its transfer fees to educational projects in Swaziland. Aid was sent from Britain to four Swaziland schools, via a local aid group, and the savings made by using the Disberse platform enabled Positive Women to fund an additional three students' fees for a year.    We normally use our bank to transfer funds, but transfers have become increasingly expensive and slow. Using Disberse, we saved 2.5 per cent (on fees), which covered the costs of a year's education for an additional three girls,  said Sarah Llewellyn, director of Positive Women. The new partnership using the blockchain technology will now scale up to work on a series of small disbursements within Start Network's existing programs over the next six months.

The EU force, known as Operation Sophia, was set up in 2015 to fight people smuggling in the south-central Mediterranean, but it cannot enter Libyan waters without an invitation from the government, of which there are two vying for power in Tripoli and Benghazi. Libya is a major departure point for mainly sub-Saharan African migrants trying to reach Europe through crossings arranged by people smugglers, often in flimsy boats. The flow of migrants has increased amid the turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Lawmakers from a parliamentary committee focused on EU affairs, which released the report after an inquiry into the naval operation, said Sophia was costly and has not deterred migrants from risking their lives at sea.   People smuggling begins onshore, so a naval mission is the wrong tool for tackling this dangerous, inhumane and unscrupulous business. Once the boats have set sail, it is too late,  said Conservative lawmaker Sandip Verma, chair of the committee that scrutinizes EU documents and policies.  The key is to look at the economic difficulties of these countries and why (migrants) are leaving in the first instance, and how we can prevent people from wanting to make that treacherous journey,  Verma said at a briefing. The report said the European Union should continue its humanitarian sea rescues with non-military vessels, but it would not be able to disrupt the migrant smuggling business without a stable Libyan government to cooperate with.  Since its deployment, the EU naval force said it has arrested 110 suspected smugglers, prevented 463 boats from being re-used by traffickers, and rescued over 38,000 people at sea. Last October, Operation Sophia also began training Libyan navy coastguards to  improve security of Libyan territorial waters  and to help with search-and-rescue efforts.   As a consequence, the training packages will enhance Libyan Navy Coast Guard and Libyan Navy capability to disrupt smuggling and trafficking,  a spokesman for the EU's Operation Sophia said in an email. As the Mediterranean experiences calm summer weather, Europe's governments are keen to avoid migrant drownings and to deter smugglers finding new routes after a deal between the EU and Turkey in 2016 cut trafficking across the Aegean Sea. Some 100,000 people have arrived in Europe in unseaworthy boats so far this year, says the United Nation's International Organization for Migration.  As of July 6, almost 2,300 died or disappeared during the crossing, making the Central Mediterranean the world's most dangerous border for migrants.

With more than $7 trillion under management, some of the biggest names in global finance have signed onto the United Nations-backed disclosure effort for information on new risks presented by climate change. Information on banks' climate risks could eventually be reviewed by regulators as part of their financial disclosures, said Simone Dettling, a researcher with the U.N. Environment Programme working on the transparency plan.   The goal is to shift lending away from carbon intensive sectors that are becoming risky toward green technologies that are becoming more attractive,  Dettling told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.  Before banks can change their lending patterns they need to understand how their portfolios will be impacted by climate change. Most currently do not have this information, Dettling said.  They have committed to finding these numbers,  she said of the voluntary scheme.  Once banks have information on their exposure to climate risks they can begin disclosing how these risks will impact investors while looking for new sustainable alternatives, she said.  That disclosure could happen within the next year, she said, although banks and U.N. officials are still hammering out the details.  Information on investments in fossil fuel firms, renewable energy businesses and transportation companies is likely to be among the data disclosed as part of banks' climate-risk assessments, Dettling said. Banks backing the plan for new research into climate risks include ANZ, Barclays, Bradesco, Citi, ItaÃº, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Santander, Standard Chartered, TD Bank Group and UBS, said the U.N. Environment Programme.   The scale and sophistication of climate risk and opportunity continue to grow,  Citi Bank spokesman Ed Skyler said in a statement on Tuesday.   Working together to refine our approaches to enhanced disclosure will help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

The social enterprise Empower Generation www.empowergeneration.org/ provides technical training and support to women in the impoverished Himalayan nation to set up clean energy businesses and provide loans to poorer customers.  Since it began operations in 2012, Empower Generation has created over 20 women-led businesses, employing 300 female distribution agents who go from village-to-village, selling, maintaining and collecting repayments for products.  In that time they have sold almost 60,000 products such as solar-powered mobile phone chargers, flashlights, and rechargeable batteries, providing around 300,000 Nepalis with access to cleaner, safer light and power.  There are many slogans to empower women. But in reality little has been done,  Empower Generation's co-founder Sita Adhikari told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. Â Â Â   If we want to really empower women, we must train them in business skills so they can generate income and become economically self-dependent.  Wedged between India and China, Nepal - famed as the birthplace of Buddha and home to Mount Everest - is one of the world's poorest countries. One in four people live on less than $1.90 a day - the World Bank's measure of extreme poverty. Deep-rooted patriarchy means women and girls are often marginalized and vulnerable to exploitation such as human trafficking and sexual slavery. Female participation is the formal workforce is low and few opportunities are available. In addition, more than half of the country's 28 million population do not have reliable access to electricity and daily power cuts lasting up to 18 hours are common. The poorest spend around 20 percent of their income on kerosene and candles which impacts women and children the most by exposing them to fumes from fuels with millions of women and children dying each year from respiratory problems. Adhikari, 43, a social activist and mother of two, said she and her partner, U.S. national Anya Cherneff, wanted to boost the financial independence of Nepali women by addressing the issue of energy poverty. The entrepreneurs are trained in business skills such as maintaining accounts and inventory control while Empower Generation provides marketing materials. They then recruit and train female distribution agents in their communities to go out and sell the products and earn a commission on each sale. They are also piloting selling  pay-as-you-go  solar home systems using mobile money. Empower Generation's business model has received much praise and last month won the International Ashden Award here#continue for Clean Energy for Women and Girls for its innovative approach to propagate sustainable energy among Nepal's rural poor. Adhikari said the company wanted to expand the number of female energy entrepreneurs from all of Nepal's 75 districts from the current 11 where it works. Â Â   We want to scale up to 100 entrepreneurs and 1,000 sales agents by 2020,  she said.  This way more rural community will benefit and more women will be empowered,  she said.

The Japanese conglomerate confirmed it was in talks with suitors, but did not name them, noting it had been unable to reach an agreement by a self-imposed June 28 deadline with its preferred bidder - a group that includes state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS). A representative for Western Digital declined to comment, and a representative for Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), was not immediately available for comment. Talks with the preferred consortium have stalled over what sources say are proposals by SK Hynix that it helps fund a deal through convertible bonds - a step that could eventually give it an equity interest in the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips. Toshiba doesn't want its South Korean rival to have an equity or management influence in the chip business - a stance it has taken to satisfy a Japanese government keen to keep Toshiba's technology under domestic control. Toshiba told its creditor banks at a meeting on Tuesday that it had begun talks with alternative bidders because talks with the consortium had stalled, the banking sources said. They didn't want to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital Corporation hard drive is pictured here in Encinitas, California April 19, 2011.Mike Blake/File Photo Toshiba had no option but to say it's in talks with other suitors because the preferred consortium is falling through,  said another official involved in the talks, who also requested anonymity as those negotiations are sensitive. Toshiba needs to sell its chip business to plug a hole in its balance sheet by the fiscal year-end in March, to avoid an automatic delisting of its shares from Tokyo's stock market. The 140-year-old laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate was still recovering from a $1.3 billion accounting scandal in 2015 when it was hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse in December.  Sources have said that INCJ and DBJ, said to be wary of SK Hynix, could back a deal with Western Digital. Toshiba executives, though, have been reluctant to consider a deal with Western Digital, with sources saying ties between the two companies have been strained since Western Digital bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner, in May last year. Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent Toshiba selling the chip unit without its consent. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Friday. In July 7 court documents, Western Digital said it matched rival bidders' offers to buy the flash memory unit - though the actual dollar figure of the bid was redacted.

Sadiq Khan said the city, with a population of 8.7 million, faces a  mammoth task  to rectify a failure to deal with decades of poorly planned growth, and begin building the 50,000 new homes Londoners need each year.  Today, we face another wave of growth, the likes of which we've not seen for a century,  Khan said in a speech at the London School of Economics (LSE) on Monday to launch his 'Good Growth by Design' program.    In recent years, too much focus has been dedicated to developing the high-price, high-rise central London market. These expensive developments... haven't delivered the genuinely affordable homes ordinary Londoners desperately need.  Tony Travers, director of LSE's research center for London, said the city's population is predicted to rise by 100,000 a year, exceeding 10 million by 2030.  Across London, average property prices have risen 90 percent in the past decade, and a report by the mayor's office in February said a lack of affordable housing is depriving Londoners of the security of home ownership. Khan said the team of 50 design advisers, including Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye and fashion designer Wayne Hemingway, are the first of a new generation he will bring in to guide the city toward inclusive growth. A new scheme aims to fast-track talented designers and planners from across the city into year-long placements in local authorities. Khan said the new program would reverse the drain of urban design expertise from local councils, after a massive fall in the proportion of architects employed in the public sector since the 1970s. Khan said the explosion in the number of skyscrapers and drastic changes to the city skyline under his predecessor Boris Johnson had failed to provide the homes regular Londoners need. Such growth has left Londoners with a housing crisis where rapid gentrification forces diverse communities from the city and strains local services, according to Khan.  Allowing this kind of unbalanced, unfocused and unsustainable growth is leaving many Londoners feeling excluded and left behind,  he said.      In 2015, the year before Khan took office, 13 percent of houses built were  affordable  - which can cost up to 80 percent of market rates - down from one third in 2007, according to London Annual Monitoring Report.  Khan said he would aim for more than 35 percent.

For four years he wrote short stories inspired by his own life, his struggle to be open about his sexuality, his despair and frustration that nearly drove him to suicide - quietly breathing life into Mohanaswamy, the hero of his stories. Just days before his book was first published in 2013, under a pseudonym in Kannada, the regional language of the southern state of Karnataka, he plucked up the courage to tell his sister that he was gay.  And with me and Mohanaswamy, many of my readers embraced their truth,  the award winning Kannada writer said, adding that when he finally did reveal his identity, gay men from across Karnataka started calling him, sharing stories with him, crying, laughing and talking.  Many readers who called me, from villages and small towns, do not read English and for them the Mohanaswamy series was a way to rediscover themselves and find solace in the fact that they were not alone,  he said. The acclaimed series, which was recently translated in English, will also be published in other Indian languages, including Telugu and Malayalam in the coming months.  Gay men don't only live in an urban setting. Thousands are growing up in villages and towns, with no way to access information on sexuality, most of which is available only in English,  Vasudhendra, who goes by just one name, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  More has to be written and it has to be written in the language people are familiar with.  Since the stories were published gay women have approached him to write about their lives, frustrated that they cannot even find magazine articles that reflect their situation.  For women it is so much tougher because saying 'no' to a marriage is never an option,  he said.  What they go through is something I cannot imagine because at least I got away by refusing to marry.  There is no official data on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) population in India, but the government in the past has submitted in the Supreme Court that there are an estimated 2.5 million gay people in the country.  Those numbers reflect only those who have self declared to the Health Ministry and will be far higher as many individuals conceal their identity fearing discrimination, campaigners say. Healing Process  In Kannada literature, homosexuality has been portrayed in a very negative way, pushing it to the margins,  said Vasudhendra, who came out in his early 40s.  It took me a long time because I also feared discrimination and lacked courage. Many go through their life keeping their sexuality a secret.  The software engineer turned author vividly recalls a telephone call from an elderly man after the Mohanaswamy stories were published.  The man said he had regretted his marriage every single day,  said Vasudhendra, 48.  And when he read my book he relived his own struggle with his sexuality and the lie his life had been. I realised then that my story had resonated with people who live in small towns and villages, just like the one I grew up in.  The series of 11 stories of homosexual love and lives explore sexuality, urbanization and class. Mohanaswamy talks about losing his partner to a woman, mentions an imaginary girlfriend to a fellow passenger on a plane while picturing the man he is in love with, losing friends, being shown around a flat by a real-estate agent who assumes he has a wife and children.  Mohanaswamy dreams of living a simple, dignified life that would allow him to leave, even forget, the humiliation and fears of adolescence, the slurs his mind still carries and the despair that made him crave to conform,  is how the stories are described on the book jacket. While city readers have told the author these are  once upon a time in India  stories, rural readers say they are ahead of their time.  Being gay is not easy, especially in small communities, where talking about it is taboo. It gives you many sleepless nights, there is constant pressure to get married and many friendships get ruined,  said Vasudhendra.  Writing the stories was a healing process for me and for many of my readers, it was a book they understood.

The Nikkei shed 0.3 percent to 20,131.06 in mid-morning trade. Exporters, which gained over the past few days on hopes for better earnings helped by a weaker yen, lost ground on profit-taking. Advantest Corp dropped 0.6 percent, Tokyo Electron Ltd declined 1.0 percent and Toyota Motor Corp 1.0 percent after the dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 113.675 yen , moving away from a four-month high of 114.495 yen on Tuesday. Trump's eldest son eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow's official support for his father, according to emails released on Tuesday.

Investors are not that frustrated with the political event in Washington after they saw that Wall Street seemed to have digested it before the market open in Asia,  said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.

In April, Trump ordered the Interior Department to review 27 national monuments created since 1996, with an eye to rescinding or shrinking the size of some of them to increase development opportunities. Zinke said on Tuesday that more than 1.2 million comments were received on the Regulations.gov website and thousands more were received via traditional mail. Environmental groups have said more than 2.5 million comments were submitted in total by Monday's deadline. Over the last few weeks, Zinke visited national monuments under review in Utah, Maine and other places to meet with different stakeholders.  After hearing some feedback, I'd like to remind and reassure folks that even if a monument is modified, the land will remain under federal ownership,  Zinke said in a statement, adding that he remains opposed to the sale or transfer of publicÂ lands.   Nothing in this review changes that policy,  he said. U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke rides a boat to Georges Island, while traveling for his National Monuments Review process, in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts, U.S., June 16, 2017.Brian SnyderLast month, Zinke made a preliminary recommendation to Trump to reduce the size of the 1.35 million acre (5,463 square km) Bears Ears monument in Utah, the country's newest monument, over the objections of a coalition of Native American tribes who say the area is sacred tribal land. His report said that the Antiquities Act, used by past presidents to declare monuments, should cover the  smallest area compatible  with protecting important sites. Democratic senators representing western states on Tuesday urged Zinke to leave the monuments in tact, saying that they should not downsized or rescinded for energy or other economic development. Nevada Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto said national monuments in her state - including two under review Gold Butte, and Basin and Range - contribute to a  booming  outdoor recreation industry that supports 150,000 jobs and generates close to $15 billion in economic activity.   We have to fight to protect against any privatization,  she said in a joint press conference with other Democratic senators. Democratic Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz, whose state is home to the PapahÄ�naumokuÄ�kea marine monument, which is under review, said should Zinke recommend changes to any monument, he will face legal battles.  The Antiquities Act is a very strong and clear statute. We will win on that basis,  he said.

Revenue from the company's North American Frito-Lay business, under which it sells snacks such as Lay's chips, rose 3 percent in the quarter ended June 17. Sales volumes rose 1 percent and net pricing climbed 3 percent. Demand for snacks was boosted by the launch of premium products such as Lay's Poppables - chips that have relatively less sugar content. Poppables cost more as well: a 5-ounce pack sells for $2.48 on Walmart.com versus a 10-ounce pack of Lay's Classic chips that sells for $2.50. PepsiCo isn't the only company promoting foods perceived as healthier than its traditional products. Rival Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and other companies such as Nestle SA (NESN.S) and General Mills Inc (GIS.N) have cut sugar content in their snacks and drinks to cater to consumers who are shunning unhealthy foods and are willing to pay more for healthier options. PepsiCo shares, however, fell nearly 1 percent to $113.19, in sync with broader market.

With his reputation as a master strategist on the line, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid out a timetable for Senate consideration of legislation to fulfill President Donald Trump's campaign promise to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In a departure from Republican orthodoxy on tax-cutting, the legislation likely will retain some of the taxes that were imposed on the wealthy under Obamacare, Senate sources said. But it was unknown whether a revised version of the bill to be announced on Thursday morning can satisfy both moderates and hard-line conservatives in the Republican majority who voiced opposition to a draft unveiled last month on very different grounds. With Trump urging the Senate to act before taking the August break, McConnell pushed back the Senate's planned August recess by two weeks to allow senators more time to tackle the measure that would repeal key parts of Obamacare, as well as pursue other legislative priorities. McConnellâ€™s announcement drove a turn-around in stock prices in afternoon trading on Wall Street after an earlier sell-off, on hopes that a shortened recess could mean progress on the stalled Republican legislative agenda.  A dark mood lingered among some Republicans over the healthcare subject, with party leaders appearing to act because of the need to dispense with healthcare and turn to other issues, among them increasing the U.S. debt ceiling.  I think we've narrowed down now to where we know where the decision points are, and we just have to make those decisions,  Senator John Thune, a junior member of the Republican leadership, told reporters. Leaders were still trying to  figure out how we get to 50  votes, he said. Republicans, who hold 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate, would need 50 votes to pass the bill, with Vice President Mike Pence providing the tie-breaking vote.  I am very pessimistic  about the prospects for Republican healthcare legislation, Chuck Grassley, a senior senator, told Fox News on Tuesday. Another Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, was working on his own healthcare proposal and will unveil it this week, a Graham aide said. Senate Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) attends a new conference following party policy lunch meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. July 11, 2017.Carlos BarriaKeeping Obamacare Taxes McConnell said the plan was to vote on the healthcare bill next week, and said he hoped to have a fresh analysis of the bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office at the start of the week. He did not reveal any of the planned changes to the draft, on which he postponed action last month after it failed to gather enough support. But Senate sources said it is likely that two Obamacare taxes on the wealthy will be kept in place - a 3.8 percent net investment tax and a 0.9 percent payroll tax that helps finance Medicare - which would appeal to moderates who have balked at the prospect of cutting taxes for the wealthy while reducing benefits for the poor.  Obviously that's the direction I think that a lot of our members want to move, is to keep some of those (taxes) in place and be able to use those revenues to put it into other places in the bill,  Thune said, while stressing that no decisions were final. Slideshow (5 Images)Republicans could also retain Obamacare's limit on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry, one Senate source said. It was unclear whether the bill would include a proposal by conservative Republican Ted Cruz that would allow insurers to offer basic low-cost healthcare plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations. Cruz argues it would help to lower premiums, but critics say it would allow insurers to offer skimpier plans that may not cover essential health benefits while also charging more for more comprehensive, Obamacare-compliant plans. The Senate Republican healthcare bill unveiled last month would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal many of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on individuals who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Democrats are united in opposition to the bill and at least 10 Republicans have said they oppose the existing draft. The House of Representatives passed its own version in May. Moderate Republicans are uneasy about the millions of people forecast to lose their medical insurance under the draft legislation, and hard-line conservatives say it leaves too much of Obamacare intact. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt the most vulnerable Americans.

Access to birth control boosts economic productivity by freeing up women to work, and leads to smaller families with parents able to devote more resources to their children's health and education, Gates told an international summit in London on family planning. Financial commitments announced at the conference were expected to total at least $2.5 billion - of which $1.5 billion has been pledged by countries in Africa and Asia.  Contraceptives empower women. And we know what empowered women do ... they transform societies,  Gates said. She announced the foundation would provide an additional $375 million for family planning over the next four years. The summit comes at a critical time, with U.S. President Donald Trump having said he will end funding to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), the U.N. agency which deals with family planning, sexual and reproductive health. The Trump administration has also reinstated a policy blocking U.S. funding to overseas groups that perform or provide information about abortion. Gates said she was  deeply troubled  by the proposed cuts. Related CoverageFactbox: Why contraceptive access is key to global development If empowering women is more than just rhetoric for the president, he will prove it by funding family planning,  she added. Gates, who is married to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, said contraception allowed her to finish her education, pursue a career in technology and plan when she had her children.  My family, my career, my life as I know it are because I had access to ... contraceptives,  she said. But many women around the world were getting pregnant  too young, too old and too often .  When I went to Malawi, everyone told me they knew a woman who had died in pregnancy,  she said.   I sat in a circle of women in India and asked if anyone had lost a child. Every single hand went up.  Some 214 million women and girls in developing countries cannot get access to contraceptives, experts say. The estimate that meeting that need could help avert 67 million unintended pregnancies a year, thereby preventing the deaths of 76,000 women from pregnancy and childbirth related complications, as well as cutting stillbirths and newborn deaths. Experts say universal access to reproductive health services would also lead to economic benefits of more than $430 billion a year.  At the individual level, contraceptives make lives better. In the aggregate, they transform economies,  Gates said. Priti Patel, Britain's minister for international development, described family planning as  one of the smartest and savviest tools  for poverty reduction.  We cannot tackle the scourge of poverty unless we get on top of this issue,  she added. Patel announced Britain would boost funding for family planning in developing countries to 225 million pounds ($289 million) a year until 2022 - an increase of 25 percent. The new head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, promised to  personally champion the issue of sexual and reproductive rights as a top priority . The summit, held on World Population Day, focused on ramping up access to contraceptives for adolescents, boosting family planning services in humanitarian crises and improving the supply and range of contraceptives available. It comes five years after activists, philanthropists and leaders gathered at an earlier summit and set a goal to empower 120 million additional women and girls in the 69 least developed countries to use modern contraception by 2020. The number has only grown by 30 million since then, meaning the target will be missed unless efforts are accelerated, organizers said.

One after another, top-rated contenders came through the Media Center for the year's third women's major with the same bland message -- they are here to play golf and not talk about politics.  I have my opinion and everybody is free to have their own opinion,  former world number one Lydia Ko of New Zealand told reporters.  But for me, I think I'm just going to have a great week here, enjoy it.  I'm excited to play the U.S. Women's Open and not think about it in a political way.  Yet a Trump cloud hung over the pastoral setting where the course routed through rolling farmland and horse pastures will be the battleground for 156 players contesting the third women's major of the year. The U.S. Golf Association (USGA) named Trump's Bedminster course in 2012 as host for the 2017 Women's Open, long before the golf-loving real estate magnate and reality TV star officially entered the political arena. Campaign rhetoric and revelations that many found to be misogynistic created an uproar, particularly among women's rights activists, and hundreds of thousands of women filled the streets of several major U.S. cities in mass protests the day after the inauguration of President Trump.

Brittany Lincicome, a two-time major winner, said she hoped Trump stayed away from Bedminster during the championship.  Hopefully he doesn't show up and it will be about us,  she told the Chicago Tribune, instead of the limelight falling on the president. Word this week that a temporary flight restriction notice was issued by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) for the Bedminster area during the tournament raised speculation Trump could be planning to drop in. Championship director, Matt Sawicki said:  The only thing we know about the President's schedule is that he plans on attending a Bastille Day celebration in France on Friday. Beyond that we have not been told.  A local protest is expected to be staged off the course grounds at some point during the tournament.

He's an established top-10 player, big game, flat shots, which are pretty good for this surface obviously where the ball bounces quite low,  said Djokovic.

He's got experience,  said Djokovic.  For me, it's important to start off well. I've played him many times. I know what I need to do. Hopefully I can execute that,  he added. Defending champion and top seed Murray is expected to get past 24th-seeded Sam Querrey, although the American reached this stage a year ago, defeating Djokovic along the way. Perhaps the most fascinating match-up, however, pits Luxembourg's number 16 seed Muller, a left-handed grass court specialist, against seventh-seeded Croatian Marin Cilic.

Natalie Levine, who worked at the Arizona-based drugmaker from 2013 to 2014, plead guilty in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, to conspiring to violate a federal anti-kickback statute, prosecutors said. Karen Hill, a sales representative who became the company's district manager for the Miami region, pleaded guilty in federal court in Mobile, Alabama to conspiring to violate the same anti-kickback law, court records show. The pleas came amid ongoing investigations of Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. Federal prosecutors in Boston in December announced charges against six former Insys executives and managers, including Levine's husband, former Chief Executive Officer Michael Babich, in connection with the probes. Prosecutors said Babich and others led a conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys to non-cancer patients through payments disguised as marketing event and speaker fees. They have pleaded not guilty. Insys has said it is working toward a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. Several other people affiliated with Insys also face charges. Levine's lawyer had no immediate comment. Lawyers for Hill and Babich and representatives for Insys did not respond to requests for comment. In Levine's case, prosecutors said she used a sham speaker program to pay a Connecticut nurse, a New Hampshire physician's assistant and a Rhode Island doctor to prescribe Subsys. While Insys ostensibly designed the speaker program to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys, its primary purpose was to reward healthcare providers who prescribed Subsys, prosecutors said. They said the medical providers earned thousands of dollars in kickbacks through the speaker events, which were usually just a gathering of friends and co-workers at high-end restaurants, prosecutors said. According to court papers, Hill admitted to facilitating kickbacks through the same speaker program to two Alabama doctors, Xiulu Ruan and John Couch, and Florida medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys. Ruan and Couch were sentenced in May to 21 and 20 years in prison, respectively, after being convicted on charges related to their operation of what prosecutors called a massive  pill mill.  Both Levine and Hill face a maximum of five years in prison when they are sentenced.

Brent crude futures rose 65 cents, or 1.4 percent to $48.17 per barrel by 0155 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.77 per barrel, up 73 cents, or 1.6 percent. Both settled about 1.4 percent higher on Tuesday.  The oil price... climbed sharply overnight as the Energy Information Agency cut its forecast for U.S. production in 2018 and API data showed another large inventory drawdown,  said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities. U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 8.1 million barrels in the week to July 7 to 495.6 million, according to the American Petroleum Institute (API), in an indictor that a long-standing fuel supply overhang is starting to draw down. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said late on Tuesday that it expected 2018 crude oil output to rise to 9.9 million barrels per day (bpd) from 9.3 million bpd this year, a 570,000 bpd increase. This was down from last month's forecast 680,000 bpd year-over-year increase. Despite the slight downward revision, U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA is still set to break the 9.61 million bpd record from June 2015. At the same time, output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) remains high despite a pledge led by the producer group to cut supplies between January of this year and March 2018 in order to tighten the market and prop up prices.

Natalie Levine, who worked at the Arizona-based drugmaker from 2013 to 2014, plead guilty in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, to conspiring to violate a federal anti-kickback statute, prosecutors said. Karen Hill, a sales representative who became the company's district manager for the Miami region, pleaded guilty in federal court in Mobile, Alabama to conspiring to violate the same anti-kickback law, court records show. The pleas came amid ongoing investigations of Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. Federal prosecutors in Boston in December announced charges against six former Insys executives and managers, including Levine's husband, former Chief Executive Officer Michael Babich, in connection with the probes. Prosecutors said Babich and others led a conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys to non-cancer patients through payments disguised as marketing event and speaker fees. They have pleaded not guilty. Insys has said it is working toward a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. Several other people affiliated with Insys also face charges. Levine's lawyer had no immediate comment. Lawyers for Hill and Babich and representatives for Insys did not respond to requests for comment. In Levine's case, prosecutors said she used a sham speaker program to pay a Connecticut nurse, a New Hampshire physician's assistant and a Rhode Island doctor to prescribe Subsys. While Insys ostensibly designed the speaker program to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys, its primary purpose was to reward healthcare providers who prescribed Subsys, prosecutors said. They said the medical providers earned thousands of dollars in kickbacks through the speaker events, which were usually just a gathering of friends and co-workers at high-end restaurants, prosecutors said. According to court papers, Hill admitted to facilitating kickbacks through the same speaker program to two Alabama doctors, Xiulu Ruan and John Couch, and Florida medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys. Ruan and Couch were sentenced in May to 21 and 20 years in prison, respectively, after being convicted on charges related to their operation of what prosecutors called a massive  pill mill.  Both Levine and Hill face a maximum of five years in prison when they are sentenced.

The Juno probe logged its close encounter with Jupiter's most distinctive feature on Monday evening Pacific time as it passed about 5,600 miles (9,000 kilometers) above the clouds of the mammoth cyclone. But it will take days for readings captured by Juno's array of cameras and other instruments to be delivered to scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, and much longer still for the data to be analyzed. Scientists hope the exercise will help unlock such mysteries as what forces are driving the storm, how long it has existed, how deeply it penetrates the planet's lower atmosphere and why it appears to be gradually dissipating. Astronomers also believe a greater understanding of the Great Red Spot may yield clues to the structure, mechanics and formation of Jupiter as a whole.  This is a storm bigger than the entire Earth. It's been there for hundreds of years. We want to know what makes it tick,  said Steve Levin, the lead project scientist for the Juno mission at JPL. The Great Red Spot on Jupiter is shown in this NASA Juno spacecraft photo released on July 12, 2017.  Courtesy NASA/Handout via REUTERSLevin said the storm is believed to be powered by energy oozing from Jupiter's interior combined with rotation of the planet, but the precise inner workings are unknown.  Some of the most valuable data from Monday's flyby is expected to come from an instrument designed to peer into the red spot at six different depths, Levin said. Slideshow (4 Images)The churning cyclone ranks as the largest known storm in the solar system, measuring about 10,000 miles (16,000 km) in diameter with winds clocked at hundreds of miles (km) an hour around its outer edges. It appears as a deep, red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow, orange and white. The red spot has been continuously monitored from Earth since about 1830, though observations believed to have been of the same feature date back more than 350 years.  Once wide enough to swallow three Earth-sized planets, the famed Jovian weather system has been shrinking for the past 100 years and may eventually disappear altogether. Still, the spot remains the most prominent characteristic of the solar system's largest planet, a gargantuan ball of gas -- mostly hydrogen and helium -- 11 times the diameter of Earth with more than twice as much mass as all the other planets combined. Monday's encounter with the Great Red Spot was the latest of 12 flyby missions currently scheduled by NASA for Juno, which is to make its next close approach to Jupiter's cloud tops on Sept. 1.

The joint venture of Taiwanese conglomerate Ruentex Group and French retailer Groupe Auchan SA said it had 9.702 billion yuan ($1.43 billion) in  advance receipts from customers  under  trade and other payables  as of end-2016. The amount was attributable to the unused balances on pre-paid cards issued a number of years ago, Sun Art said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse.  As the number of long-aging pre-paid cards has continued to increase over time, the total unutilised balance on such prepaid cards ... has also gradually accumulated and began contributing to a larger percentage of the total balance of all prepaid cards in issue,  Chairman Cheng Chuan-tai said in the statement. Many Chinese buy pre-paid cards as gifts. Preliminary analysis showed that the estimated mid-2012 unutilised balance amounted to over 15 percent of the total balance of all pre-paid cards issued as at Dec. 31, 2016, and the portion of the unutilised balance unlikely to be used is estimated at 460 million yuan. The amount will contribute to about 345 million yuan after tax to the company's consolidated net profit for the six months ended in June, Sun Art said. It said it may recognise further amounts in future. In a separate statement, Sun Art said Bruno Robert Mercier had resigned as chief executive officer with immediate effect to pursue personal and entrepreneurial projects, but would stay on as a senior adviser until the end of 2019. Ludovic FrÃ©dÃ©ric Pierre Holinier has been appointed as the new chief executive.

Speaking to reporters side-by-side outside of the presidential palace in Lima, centrist Kuczynski and rightwing Keiko Fujimori agreed that political dialogue is needed to jumpstart the country's faltering economic growth. Fujimori proposed the meeting last week after Congress forced Kuczynski's finance minister to resign - the third of Kuczynski's ministers to step down due to pressures from her party.  I walk away from this with optimistic that the executive can take actions that all Peruvians are waiting for,  Fujimori told journalists after listing her concerns about the economy and corruption that she said she discussed with Kuczynski. Kuczynski described the meeting as positive and said it would bear fruit  in the not-too-distant future.  However, no pact or concrete plans for new reforms that would be backed by both political leaders were announced.  The tone of their remarks was similar to those following a meeting December after Congress ousted Kuczynski's education minister - raising questions about how lasting the renewed gesture of political cooperation might be. Amid rising political tensions with Congress last month, Kuczynski proposed evaluating a potential pardon for Fujimori's imprisoned father, ex-president Alberto Fujimori - an announcement that has been widely viewed as a bid to placate Fujimori's party. Kuczynski, a 78-year-old former Wall Street banker, took office a year ago after scraping together a razor-thin victory against Fujimori in a run-off election. But he will need the support of Fujimori's party, which holds a majority in Congress, to govern effectively in the remaining four years of his term.

The views expressed are his own) U.S. Independence Day marked a turning point in the oil market, when a short-covering rally ran out of momentum and gave way to a renewed and very aggressive bear market. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 46 million barrels in the week leading up to July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2uInAFV). Funds increased their net long position for the first time after reducing it by a cumulative 231 million barrels over the previous four weeks, according to data from regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2tzCiRh). The move had all the characteristics of a short covering rally, with crude prices rising steadily between June 21 and July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2t4K7ek). The commencement of short-covering was widely anticipated after hedge funds established a record number of short positions in crude, gasoline and heating oil by June 27. The total number of short positions held by hedge fund managers in the five major crude and products contracts declined from a record 510 million barrels on June 27 to 463 million barrels on July 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2u9sW00). Fund managers cut short positions in WTI by 14 million barrels, Brent by 13 million, U.S. gasoline by 8 million and U.S. heating oil by 13 million in the week running up to Independence Day. Even so, only a small number of short positions had been closed out by July 4.  But then something very unexpected happened. Instead of prices continuing to climb as more short positions were closed, prices began to sink in the second half of last week. From a positioning perspective, the balance of risks remained tilted to the upside, with a small number of long positions left to liquidate and a large number of shorts still needing to be closed out. So the renewed decline in oil prices therefore marked an unusual and aggressive move, with extra selling from unknown traders pushing prices lower. Oil prices continued to slide despite an unusually large drawdown in U.S. commercial crude stocks reported on July 6. From a positioning perspective, positions still appear very stretched on the downside. There is still a very high risk of the trade becoming crowded. But sentiment in the oil market has become exceptionally bearish, with most traders concluding OPEC won't, or can't, do anything to support prices, and U.S. shale producers can't, or won't, moderate the drilling boom. Prices may therefore have to continue falling low enough for long enough to enforce a strategy correction from the shale drillers or OPEC. The result is an unresolved tension between positioning risks (which remain biased to the upside) and fundamental risks (which are increasingly tilted to the downside).

Speculators have turned bullish across all three Chicago and Minneapolis wheat contracts for the first time in over two years. Funds are also buying back gobs of corn and soybean contracts after being record or near-record short in recent weeks.   Crops in the United States are extremely sensitive to weather at this time of year. Condition scores are not as good as they have been in previous seasons and have declined this week, and the weather forecasts continue to show dry â€“ and potentially hot â€“ weather for much of the areas producing U.S. corn, wheat, and soybeans, sparking supply fears. In combining Chicago-traded corn, hard and soft red winter wheat, soybeans, soybean oil and meal, and Minneapolis-traded spring wheat, money managers held an overall net short position of 53,234 futures and options contracts in the week ended July 4, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (reut.rs/2uGTIdb). This is the least bearish combined view that the funds have held in recent months since crossing onto the short side in mid-March. They now also hold their most bullish stance since May 2014 when summing positions over all three wheat contracts. Money managers entered bullish territory on Chicago wheat in the week ended July 4, which was both the result of short-covering and new longs. The net long of 18,003 futures and options contracts compares with 10,158 contracts short in the previous week and is the first bullish fund view since July 28, 2015 (reut.rs/2ty55pj). But the milestone traces back further when examining the outright Chicago wheat longs â€“ some 113,929 contracts â€“ which is the most since Nov. 13, 2012. The number of outright shorts dropped below 100,000 contracts for the first time since November 2015. Funds reached an even longer-standing landmark in K.C. wheat last week by extending their net long to 54,926 futures and options contracts from 44,240 in the week before. This marks the fundsâ€™ most bullish bet on hard red winter wheat since Nov. 9, 2010 (reut.rs/2uH1G5Y). Speculators either extended longs or trimmed shorts across all grains and oilseeds through July 4 except for Minneapolis wheat. Shorts reappeared in the spring wheat market for the first time in five weeks, which assisted in the slight cut to 14,017 futures and options contracts net long from 15,347 the week prior (reut.rs/2u8DiNR). Funds mostly sold wheat late last week as futures prices dropped across all three contracts, but the action was reignited Monday on fresh weather concerns for Minneapolis wheat, and the spec buying continued. Corn Spooks Specs Again Speculators were frantically buying back their short positions once again in the Chicago corn futures and options market last week, though the degree of short-covering was only half of what it was back in the week ended June 13.  The U.S. corn crop is pollinating this month and the weather is more critical than ever. Dry weather forecasts, which have since begun trending warmer, prompted funds to slash their bearish corn bets to 46,715 contracts in the week ended July 4 from 106,119 in the week prior (reut.rs/2tyd1af). Money managers have been buying even more of the yellow grain in the days since as forecasts have continued to show dry, and in some places, warm weather for key spots in the U.S. Corn Belt. The buying was extremely heavy on Monday as CBOT corn futures hit a one-year high.  The buying trend is likely to continue on Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Agriculture late on Monday rated 65 percent of the domestic crop in good or excellent condition, down 3 percentage points on the week. Soy Backpedaling U.S. soybeans are influenced by precipitation in August more so than in July, but specs decided that the drier weather â€“ and the potential for that to extend into next month â€“ was concerning enough to start shedding their record bearish soybean stance (reut.rs/2t4etgZ). The lower-than-expected June 1 U.S. soybean inventory published by USDA on the last day of the month â€“ along with slightly fewer planted acres than were anticipated â€“ also encouraged the shift in spec attitude toward the oilseed.  Money managers cut their net short in CBOT soybean futures and options to 70,216 contracts from an all-time record 118,683 the week before. This move was the result of the fourth-largest ever reduction of outright shorts, but funds were also actively adding longs to the largest degree that they have in five months. Funds also bought back CBOT soybean meal shorts for a new bearish stance of 42,967 futures and options contracts versus 54,530 in the week prior â€“ which was also a record. However, specs actually cut outright longs in soymeal in the week ended July 4, suggesting that they were still largely pessimistic on the protein-rich animal feed. CBOT soybean oil is the only non-wheat contract in which money managers hold bullish bets, as they extended their net long to 19,718 futures and options contracts from 10,511 the week before. Monday was another very active buying day for the funds across the soy complex as CBOT soybean futures hit four-month highs on weather concerns and strength in corn. There has also been notable buying in both soymeal and soyoil since last Wednesday. Soybean ratings were also trimmed late Monday as 62 percent of the U.S. crop is in good or excellent condition as of July 9, down 2 percentage points on the week.

Stocks of copper registered with the London Metal Exchange (LME) jumped by a net 72,625 tonnes, or 30 percent, in the space of just four days starting June 29. That was courtesy of whoever warranted 86,950 tonnes of metal in LME sheds.  It was the fourth time since December that LME copper stocks have been rocked by huge inflows. All four  arrivals events  have been unprecedented in scale, and the cumulative inflow has been in excess of 500,000 tonnes. The London aluminum market has grown accustomed to huge tonnages appearing and disappearing in the LME warehouse network. But prior to last December the largest concentrated warranting in the copper market took place in February 2015, when 32,750 tonnes showed up on a single day.  These running stock shocks have obscured any coherent market narrative behind a lot of smoke and several mirrors.  Copper is a market that is collectively trying to work out whether it is in supply surplus or shortfall. Opinions are divided. The median forecast in the latest quarterly Reuters base metals poll of analysts was for a 17,000-tonne deficit for 2017. Well, good luck trying to discern such a small market balance from LME stocks right now.  Don't despair, however.  There's a bigger stocks picture which is generating a better signal of copper's supply-chain dynamics. It's just that the LME's part in that picture appears to be changing.        Scream if You Want to Go Faster This latest  arrivals event  is just another whirl of a copper stocks merry-go-round that has been spinning for many months. The previous three spins took place in May, March and last December. There was a precedent in August 2016 as well, although the warranting action in that month was more dispersed.  There are two common themes to all these stocks shocks.  What enters the system does so primarily at Asian locations. Cumulative  arrivals event  inflows have been concentrated on the ports of Busan in South Korea, Singapore, Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Port Klang in Malaysia. The only exception has been Rotterdam, which has seen significant inflows over the same days.  And what enters the system doesn't stay around for long.  May's  arrivals event  saw 126,150 tonnes warranted in just three days, boosting headline stocks to a six-month high of 354,650 tonnes. By the time of the most recent surge, however, they had fallen back to 243,300 tonnes.  What's going on?  A big bull-bear battle is what's going on.  One rooted in physical flow, warehousing and arbitrage dynamics. Metal is being relentlessly shuffled between LME and off-market storage and between geographic locations.  Reading the game is hard because most of it is taking place in the physical market shadows.  This feud has also become a battle of market narrative, each player using LME stocks to express an opposing view. [nL8N1IA3Q3] The problem is that the smoke of battle has hopelessly distorted any stocks' pricing signal, bullish or bearish. An LME copper stocks chart right now looks like a badly drawn zig-zag.  And it's getting worse, because this merry-go-round seems to be turning ever faster.    The Bigger Picture    There is some good news, though.  Firstly, it's questionable just how much these games with LME stocks have impacted price.  LME three-month copper has held station in a broad $5,420-6,205 range since the start of December.  Time-spreads, which should be more sensitive to stocks shocks, have largely held steady over the same period. The benchmark cash-to-three months spread was valued at $28-per tonne contango at the close of Monday.  Secondly, LME stocks are only one third of the visible copper stocks picture. The other two components are the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and CME (COMEX).  Taking all three together, as of last Friday the cumulative net change so far this year was a build of 114,040 tonnes.  It's not an outlandish signal, factoring in both this year's increased scrap availability and lower Chinese imports.   Nor is it dramatically out of line with the latest market balance assessment from the International Copper Study Group. According to the ICSG, the global refined market recorded a supply surplus of 164,000 tonnes or, seasonally adjusted, 72,000 tonnes in the first quarter of this year. The bigger picture is clearer because the other two components have acted in different ways to mitigate the volatility emanating from the LME stocks battleground.  First, ShFE stocks have tended to move inversely to those registered with the LME.  The net stocks change across the two exchanges over the first half of 2017 was a decline of just 3,528 tonnes.  This is not coincidental since China sits at the center of the Asian physical and arbitrage markets, placing it at the heart of the ongoing tug-of-war between bull and bear. ShFE stocks have become a second, more distant front in the same struggle.  Second, without anyone paying too much intention, COMEX warehouses are filling up to levels not seen in many, many years.  Total deliverable stocks currently stand at 164,184 imperial tons, equivalent to 148,947 tonnes, of which all but 1,447 tons are on warrant. It's the highest count since May 2004.  Even with the latest  arrivals event  in the LME system, it is the 68,026-tonne rise in COMEX stocks that has generated most of the global exchange stocks increase this year.  Realigning the Lens The COMEX warehouse system has only U.S. good delivery points so should, in theory, be largely reflective of domestic market availability.  But this stocks build has been running for 11 straight months and suggests something more structural than cyclical.  It's possible we're seeing a reaction to the threat of U.S. trade tariffs. The prospect has caused a shift in physical market flows in several industrial metals as merchants look to build  just in case  inventory in the United States.  It's also possible that rising exchange inventories are in some way related to rising trade activity on the CME copper contract, although disentangling cause and effect is an impossible task.   CME copper volumes rose by 18.5 percent in the first seven months of this year and, equally significantly, open interest at the end of June was up by 59 percent.  It's all part of an increasingly complex global trading environment for old  Dr Copper . Trading is no longer concentrated just on the LME but is dispersing in still-evolving ways across all three major time zones.      Copper stocks may be starting to mirror that new landscape.  Certainly, the COMEX warehouse system is no longer a marginal part of the global stocks picture. COMEX copper stocks currently account for 23 percent of global exchange stocks.  They have been the key driver of the overall rise in visible inventory this year, a trend that has been lost in the noise of the LME system and the echo from the ShFE system.  So, if you're finding LME stocks a bit of a confusing read right now, take a step out of the optical illusion machine and focus on the bigger picture.

In the agency's latest monthly short-term energy outlook, it forecast that 2018 crude oil output will rise to 9.9 million barrels per day from 9.3 million bpd this year, a 570,000 bpd increase. Last month, it forecast a 680,000 bpd year-over-year increase. The agency's forecast for 2017 is unchanged.  â€œA lower forecast for crude oil prices is expected to shave a little off projected growth in U.S. oil production next year compared with the previous forecast,  said Howard Gruenspecht, acting EIA administrator. The EIA cut its 2018 pricing outlook for global benchmark Brent crude futures to $52 a barrel down $4 a barrel from the previous month.  Still, output of 9.9 million barrels a day would be a record for U.S. production, Gruenspecht said.  Growing U.S. crude output has put pressure on OPEC to cut production in an effort to shrink a global crude glut that has weighed on prices, causing a price rout that has reduced oil prices since 2014.  U.S. demand growth in 2017 is expected to be slightly lower than previously forecast at 310,000 barrels per day, compared with 320,000 in the June forecast.

The LMEprecious suite of gold and silver contracts was developed with a group of backers including banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which then set up EOS Precious Metals to promote trade in the contracts and benefit from a 50:50 revenue-sharing deal with the LME.  The LME launched its contracts at 0000 GMT on Monday, though volumes did not pick up until the start of the European trading day at 0700 GMT. By close of business on Monday, 75,500 ounces (2.3 tonnes) of gold had traded on the LMEprecious spot contract, exchange data showed. That is worth some $91.3 million at current spot prices.  Typical interbank trade between one party and another would be 5,000-10,000 ounces in a single trade,  said Ross Norman, chief executive of bullion trader Sharps Pixley.  It will be nice to see what the trend is -- if (it picks up), you'd begin to think, here we go.  Market makers were quoting prices on spreads between contracts out to June 2022. A source at one of the EOS partners said:  At this early stage players are finding their feet. It may be a while until people start trading in size.  As well as Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the EOS partnership includes banks ICBC Standard Societe Generale and Natixis, proprietary trader OSTC and the World Gold Council, an industry market development body.  All the banks except Natixis are general clearing members of LMEPrecious, along with brokers Marex Financial and BOCI Global Commodities (UK). OSTC, XTX Markets and Morgan Stanley's commodities unit are non-clearing members, while Natixis is an individual clearing member.   London's gold trade is dominated by over-the-counter (OTC) business conducted bilaterally among networks of brokers, banks and traders. The LME's new contracts aim to capitalize on increasing regulatory scrutiny that is raising costs for banks trading gold over the counter. U.S. exchanges CME Group and ICE have also launched London gold contracts this year, hoping to lure business from the traditional OTC market, which is estimated to be worth $5 trillion a year. Liquidity Split?  Both the LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, and ICE are in the running to take over as operators of the global silver benchmark, the LBMA Silver Price, when incumbents Thomson Reuters and CME Group step down. On the gold front, meanwhile, CME Group's introduction of a spot spread contract in London this year and ICE's launch of a futures contract in January have led market participants to suggest that market liquidity could be fractured.   We will be monitoring volumes and comparing with LBMA to see how LME impinges on OTC volume,  Rhona O'Connell, head of research and forecasts at GFMS, told the Reuters Global Gold Forum on Monday.  With the wings of the regulators beating ever closer with respect to transparency, then some OTC business may well move onto the exchange.   Increased scrutiny of London's financial markets since the LIBOR benchmark interest rate scandal has led to tighter regulatory capital requirements, increasing the push for trades that were once routinely carried out between counterparties to be performed on the exchanges.  Clearing, where an exchange acts as an intermediary to settle trades, is seen by some as an inevitable progression for the gold market.   The clearing aspect, especially for the market makers, reduces capital charges,  one market participant said.

Including Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the deal, output by all 13 OPEC members in June rose to about 32.47 million bpd, according to the average assessments of secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor its output. The figures were seen by Reuters. That would be up 330,000 bpd from OPEC's published May figure. A jump in output in Nigeria and Libya, where output had been limited by conflict, has weighed on oil prices LCOc1. The recovery has prompted more talk among producers about asking them to join the supply cut deal. nL8N1K12YX Production from the 11 OPEC members with output targets under the agreement has averaged 29.840 million bpd in June, according to the secondary sources. Reuters also saw these figures. That means compliance in June is 97 percent, according to an OPEC calculation. That is lower than in May, as OPEC's published figures for that month point to compliance above 100 percent. [nL8N1JA2SE] OPEC is scheduled to publish the assessment of June output based on secondary sources in its monthly oil market report on Wednesday. The figures could be revised before publication as more secondary-source estimates are added, OPEC sources said. OPEC uses two sets of figures to monitor its output -- figures provided by each country and those provided by secondary sources that include industry media. This is a legacy of old disputes over real production levels. The production cut agreed last year was from levels as assessed by the secondary sources. OPEC's report on Wednesday is also expected to show that  Saudi Arabia told OPEC that it raised production to 10.07 million bpd in June, industry sources said, up from 9.88 million bpd in May. The increase takes Saudi production slightly above its OPEC production target of 10.058 million bpd for the first month this year, although on average in 2017, output remains below the target, an OPEC source said. The six secondary sources used by OPEC are the International Energy Agency, oil-pricing agencies Platts and Argus, â€Žthe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) and industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly (PIW).

Stocks of copper registered with the London Metal Exchange (LME) jumped by a net 72,625 tonnes, or 30 percent, in the space of just four days starting June 29. That was courtesy of whoever warranted 86,950 tonnes of metal in LME sheds.  It was the fourth time since December that LME copper stocks have been rocked by huge inflows. All four  arrivals events  have been unprecedented in scale, and the cumulative inflow has been in excess of 500,000 tonnes. The London aluminum market has grown accustomed to huge tonnages appearing and disappearing in the LME warehouse network. But prior to last December the largest concentrated warranting in the copper market took place in February 2015, when 32,750 tonnes showed up on a single day.  These running stock shocks have obscured any coherent market narrative behind a lot of smoke and several mirrors.  Copper is a market that is collectively trying to work out whether it is in supply surplus or shortfall. Opinions are divided. The median forecast in the latest quarterly Reuters base metals poll of analysts was for a 17,000-tonne deficit for 2017. Well, good luck trying to discern such a small market balance from LME stocks right now.  Don't despair, however.  There's a bigger stocks picture which is generating a better signal of copper's supply-chain dynamics. It's just that the LME's part in that picture appears to be changing.        Scream if You Want to Go Faster This latest  arrivals event  is just another whirl of a copper stocks merry-go-round that has been spinning for many months. The previous three spins took place in May, March and last December. There was a precedent in August 2016 as well, although the warranting action in that month was more dispersed.  There are two common themes to all these stocks shocks.  What enters the system does so primarily at Asian locations. Cumulative  arrivals event  inflows have been concentrated on the ports of Busan in South Korea, Singapore, Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Port Klang in Malaysia. The only exception has been Rotterdam, which has seen significant inflows over the same days.  And what enters the system doesn't stay around for long.  May's  arrivals event  saw 126,150 tonnes warranted in just three days, boosting headline stocks to a six-month high of 354,650 tonnes. By the time of the most recent surge, however, they had fallen back to 243,300 tonnes.  What's going on?  A big bull-bear battle is what's going on.  One rooted in physical flow, warehousing and arbitrage dynamics. Metal is being relentlessly shuffled between LME and off-market storage and between geographic locations.  Reading the game is hard because most of it is taking place in the physical market shadows.  This feud has also become a battle of market narrative, each player using LME stocks to express an opposing view. [nL8N1IA3Q3] The problem is that the smoke of battle has hopelessly distorted any stocks' pricing signal, bullish or bearish. An LME copper stocks chart right now looks like a badly drawn zig-zag.  And it's getting worse, because this merry-go-round seems to be turning ever faster.    The Bigger Picture    There is some good news, though.  Firstly, it's questionable just how much these games with LME stocks have impacted price.  LME three-month copper has held station in a broad $5,420-6,205 range since the start of December.  Time-spreads, which should be more sensitive to stocks shocks, have largely held steady over the same period. The benchmark cash-to-three months spread was valued at $28-per tonne contango at the close of Monday.  Secondly, LME stocks are only one third of the visible copper stocks picture. The other two components are the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and CME (COMEX).  Taking all three together, as of last Friday the cumulative net change so far this year was a build of 114,040 tonnes.  It's not an outlandish signal, factoring in both this year's increased scrap availability and lower Chinese imports.   Nor is it dramatically out of line with the latest market balance assessment from the International Copper Study Group. According to the ICSG, the global refined market recorded a supply surplus of 164,000 tonnes or, seasonally adjusted, 72,000 tonnes in the first quarter of this year. The bigger picture is clearer because the other two components have acted in different ways to mitigate the volatility emanating from the LME stocks battleground.  First, ShFE stocks have tended to move inversely to those registered with the LME.  The net stocks change across the two exchanges over the first half of 2017 was a decline of just 3,528 tonnes.  This is not coincidental since China sits at the center of the Asian physical and arbitrage markets, placing it at the heart of the ongoing tug-of-war between bull and bear. ShFE stocks have become a second, more distant front in the same struggle.  Second, without anyone paying too much intention, COMEX warehouses are filling up to levels not seen in many, many years.  Total deliverable stocks currently stand at 164,184 imperial tons, equivalent to 148,947 tonnes, of which all but 1,447 tons are on warrant. It's the highest count since May 2004.  Even with the latest  arrivals event  in the LME system, it is the 68,026-tonne rise in COMEX stocks that has generated most of the global exchange stocks increase this year.  Realigning the Lens The COMEX warehouse system has only U.S. good delivery points so should, in theory, be largely reflective of domestic market availability.  But this stocks build has been running for 11 straight months and suggests something more structural than cyclical.  It's possible we're seeing a reaction to the threat of U.S. trade tariffs. The prospect has caused a shift in physical market flows in several industrial metals as merchants look to build  just in case  inventory in the United States.  It's also possible that rising exchange inventories are in some way related to rising trade activity on the CME copper contract, although disentangling cause and effect is an impossible task.   CME copper volumes rose by 18.5 percent in the first seven months of this year and, equally significantly, open interest at the end of June was up by 59 percent.  It's all part of an increasingly complex global trading environment for old  Dr Copper . Trading is no longer concentrated just on the LME but is dispersing in still-evolving ways across all three major time zones.      Copper stocks may be starting to mirror that new landscape.  Certainly, the COMEX warehouse system is no longer a marginal part of the global stocks picture. COMEX copper stocks currently account for 23 percent of global exchange stocks.  They have been the key driver of the overall rise in visible inventory this year, a trend that has been lost in the noise of the LME system and the echo from the ShFE system.  So, if you're finding LME stocks a bit of a confusing read right now, take a step out of the optical illusion machine and focus on the bigger picture.

Yellen will give her semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress later on Wednesday and on Thursday, and investors will be parsing it for or clues on when the Fed will start reducing its massive balance sheet. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was slightly lower on the day at 95.641. Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 113.675 yen, moving away from a four-month high of 114.495 yen marked on Tuesday. Emails released by Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday showed he agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow's official support for his father. Investors' mood turned more hopeful later in the session after U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a two-week delay in the Senate's August recess to provide more time to work on legislation and approve nominees, which could lead to progress on tax reform and fiscal stimulus. Even after the news of the longer session,  the U.S. dollar did not return to beginning-of-the-day levels,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bancorp Wealth Management in Helena, Montana. While the dollar was buffeted by the political headlines on Tuesday, it remains underpinned against the yen by divergent monetary policy expectations for the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, he said.  Central banks around the globe seem to be either removing their accommodation or talking about removing their accommodation, except for the BOJ,  said Northey. Ahead of Yellen's remarks, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said the central bank should soon begin reducing its balance sheet, as long as economic data on U.S. jobs and growth holds up. But she wasn't as hawkish as some investors hoped, saying that once balance sheet reduction is under way, she will assess inflation before deciding on further interest rate increases. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, a voter on the Federal Open Market Committee, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that if inflation did not move toward the Fed's 2 percent target, then this would be a reason to hold off raising rates. The euro added 0.1 percent to $1.1473, within sight of the previous session's 14-month high of $1.1480. The Canadian dollar was slightly higher against its U.S. counterpart as investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision later on Wednesday. While forecasters remain divided on whether the central bank will raise rates, data from the overnight index swaps market showed that money markets have priced in a hike, as well as a second hike before the end of the year.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily lifted sanctions for six months in January, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing financial sanctions.  The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday the agency would announce a decision on Wednesday about whether to make the relief permanent. In June the United State said it was  very concerned  about Sudan's human rights record.         Washington will decide if Sudan has complied with demands that include resolving internal military conflicts in areas such as war-torn Darfur, cooperating on counter-terrorism and improving access to humanitarian aid. Related CoverageU.S. postpones decision on Sudan sanctions for three months The natural and logical step is that America's economic sanctions are lifted from Sudan because Sudan has implemented what was asked of it entirely,  Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Abdul Ghani al-Naim told Reuters.   The two sides have had monthly joint meetings to follow up on implementation and there doesn't remain anything left to be done. Positive progress was achieved,  Naim said. Sudan this month extended a unilateral ceasefire until the end of October with rebels it has been at war with in the southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur regions.  Sudan is looking to win back access to the global banking system, potentially unlocking badly needed trade and foreign investment that could help it manage soaring inflation of 35 percent and a shortage of foreign currency that has hampered its ability to purchase from abroad. The economy has been reeling ever since South Sudan, which contains three-quarters of former Sudan's oil wells, seceded in 2011.  The sanction relief would not change Sudan's designation by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism, and President Omar Hassan al-Bashir remains wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. This status could make investors and banks hesitant to do business, even if sanctions are lifted, said Magnus Taylor, a Sudan analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank.   There will be an economic impact but it won't be instantaneous,  said Taylor.  It's the beginning of the process of normalisation.     Taylor said that it is likely, but not certain, that the United States will lift sanctions.    The State Department wants it to happen and the people working on Sudan within the State Department want it to happen, but ultimately it's kind of a political decision after that,  he said.

What happened with Donald Trump Jr. just underscores how Russia was operating,  said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin said the bill should have been passed because of Russian interference in last year's U.S. elections, occupation of parts of Ukraine and Georgia and support of the Syrian government. The Senate backed the sanctions legislation by 98-2 on June 15 but it has been stuck in the House of Representatives, amid partisan squabbling between Republicans and Democrats. Trump's relationship with Russia has been in particularly sharp focus this month because he had his first meeting last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some Democrats had accused Trump's fellow Republicans of stalling the sanctions package at least until after that meeting, to please the president. Republicans denied that. House Republican leaders initially rejected the bill for procedural reasons, prompting the Senate to tweak it. But Democrats then objected to a change by the Senate that they said weakened the bill by making it more difficult for the House to vote on any change in sanctions policy by Trump. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Democrats still were objecting to moving the bill in its current form. But both Republican and Democratic House aides said talks between the two parties were continuing and there was a decent chance for a quick compromise, more so because of the latest revelations about Trump's eldest son. 'Certainly Does Not Help' Donald Trump Jr. eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he believed was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton, as part of Moscow's official support for his father, according to emails released on Tuesday.  It certainly does not help the administration at this point,  a senior Republican House aide said. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, predicted that the matter would be cleared up quickly and brought to the floor for a vote this week. The Russia package, written as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, puts into law sanctions previously established through presidential executive order, including some on Russian energy projects and debt financing. It also imposes sanctions on Russians convicted of human rights abuses or cyber attacks and would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. Trump administration officials have been meeting with lawmakers to argue against some parts of the bill, including the requirement that Trump obtain Congress' permission before easing any sanctions. They also objected to the fact that many of the sanctions are mandatory, meaning Trump could not waive them for national security reasons.  This is more about foreign policy and having the flexibility to negotiate with other countries,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a daily briefing. But many of Trump's fellow Republicans said they wanted to move ahead nonetheless to send a strong message to Russia.  Any administration would prefer to conduct foreign policy 100 percent without involvement by Congress. That's just the way life is,  said Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will introduce his own Russia sanctions legislation in the House if the Senate bill remains stalled, a source familiar with his thinking said. Royce's thinking was first reported by Politico. (Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sanctions-russia-idUSL1N1K301D"},

The world's largest online retailer said customers ordered more than three times as many Echo-family speakers than during Prime Day 2016, which at the time broke records for Amazon devices.  Third-party sellers sold over 50 percent more items on the site by noon local time (1900 GMT) than in the same timeframe last year, Amazon said in a statement. The company has not disclosed sales figures, overall or for the Echo. Analysts estimated last year's event brought in well over $500 million. The news underscores Amazon's break-neck pace of growth as more shoppers order online instead of going to brick-and-mortar stores. It also highlights the winning formula of Amazon's shopping club Prime, the cornerstone of its business. Customers had to join Amazon Prime to get discounts during the 30-hour event. U.S. members of the club pay $99 per year for benefits like two-day shipping, and they tend to buy more goods, more often from Amazon. A timer showing when the deals would expire added further shopping encouragement. Rival retailers like Macy's Inc (M.N) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) took advantage of Prime Day's hype to launch promotions of their own. Still, Amazon often came out on top. Best Buy was 27 percent more expensive for overlapping technology products excluding Amazon devices, according to retail technology company Boomerang Commerce. Deals on Amazon for the voice-controlled Echo speakers had the promise of boosting its sales indirectly, too. The devices let shoppers re-order products by voice command, removing friction from checkout. Consumer buzz and heavier discounts likely increased orders for the Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap speakers. Amazon offered the Echo at half price in the United States, or $89.99, versus 28 percent off on Prime Day in 2016.  The voice-controlled assistant market is hot right now, and by offering a reasonably priced device that does a lot of things - and the promise of many more skills to come - Amazon is positioning itself as a leader in this market,  said eMarketer analyst Victoria Petrock. Beyond shopping on Amazon, people can tell an Echo to play music, order an Uber ride or turn on the house lights. Research firm eMarketer has forecast the number of U.S. consumers actively using voice-controlled devices will more than double this year to 35.6 million.

Symantec has called Google's claims  exaggerated and misleading.   Symantec is in talks with a small number of companies and private equity firms about the potential sale, three sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. There is no certainty that a deal will occur, the sources added. Symantec declined to comment. A representative for Google did not respond to a request for comment. Symantec acquired most of its web certification business in 2010, when it paid $1.28 billion to buy Verisign Inc's (VRSN.O) security business. The unit has about $400 million in revenue, according to one of the sources.  Symantec said in June it was reviewing a proposal by Google and other internet companies to help fix issues with its security certificates. It said it is speaking to its partners about how to minimize disruptions to customers while also  reassuring trust in Symantec certificates.  Chief Executive Officer Greg Clark has been transforming Mountain View, California-based Symantec by jettisoning slow-growth units and spending billions of dollars on acquisitions. It has been moving away from services that are more commoditized, selling its data storage business Veritas in January 2016 to private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) for $7.4 billion. Symantec completed its $2.3 billion acquisition of LifeLock Inc in February, a move that will bolster its consumer security business. That followed the purchase of Blue Coat Inc for $4.65 billion in August 2016, which expanded its product line for large corporations. Reporting by Liana B.

The world's largest online retailer said customers ordered more than three times as many Echo-family speakers than during Prime Day 2016, which at the time broke records for Amazon devices.  Third-party sellers sold over 50 percent more items on the site by noon local time (1900 GMT) than in the same timeframe last year, Amazon said in a statement. The company has not disclosed sales figures, overall or for the Echo. Analysts estimated last year's event brought in well over $500 million. The news underscores Amazon's break-neck pace of growth as more shoppers order online instead of going to brick-and-mortar stores. It also highlights the winning formula of Amazon's shopping club Prime, the cornerstone of its business. Customers had to join Amazon Prime to get discounts during the 30-hour event. U.S. members of the club pay $99 per year for benefits like two-day shipping, and they tend to buy more goods, more often from Amazon. A timer showing when the deals would expire added further shopping encouragement. Rival retailers like Macy's Inc (M.N) and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) took advantage of Prime Day's hype to launch promotions of their own. Still, Amazon often came out on top. Best Buy was 27 percent more expensive for overlapping technology products excluding Amazon devices, according to retail technology company Boomerang Commerce. Deals on Amazon for the voice-controlled Echo speakers had the promise of boosting its sales indirectly, too. The devices let shoppers re-order products by voice command, removing friction from checkout. Consumer buzz and heavier discounts likely increased orders for the Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap speakers. Amazon offered the Echo at half price in the United States, or $89.99, versus 28 percent off on Prime Day in 2016.  The voice-controlled assistant market is hot right now, and by offering a reasonably priced device that does a lot of things - and the promise of many more skills to come - Amazon is positioning itself as a leader in this market,  said eMarketer analyst Victoria Petrock. Beyond shopping on Amazon, people can tell an Echo to play music, order an Uber ride or turn on the house lights. Research firm eMarketer has forecast the number of U.S. consumers actively using voice-controlled devices will more than double this year to 35.6 million.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily lifted sanctions for six months in January, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing financial sanctions.  The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday the agency would announce a decision on Wednesday about whether to make the relief permanent. In June the United State said it was  very concerned  about Sudan's human rights record.         Washington will decide if Sudan has complied with demands that include resolving internal military conflicts in areas such as war-torn Darfur, cooperating on counter-terrorism and improving access to humanitarian aid. Related CoverageU.S. postpones decision on Sudan sanctions for three months The natural and logical step is that America's economic sanctions are lifted from Sudan because Sudan has implemented what was asked of it entirely,  Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Abdul Ghani al-Naim told Reuters.   The two sides have had monthly joint meetings to follow up on implementation and there doesn't remain anything left to be done. Positive progress was achieved,  Naim said. Sudan this month extended a unilateral ceasefire until the end of October with rebels it has been at war with in the southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur regions.  Sudan is looking to win back access to the global banking system, potentially unlocking badly needed trade and foreign investment that could help it manage soaring inflation of 35 percent and a shortage of foreign currency that has hampered its ability to purchase from abroad. The economy has been reeling ever since South Sudan, which contains three-quarters of former Sudan's oil wells, seceded in 2011.  The sanction relief would not change Sudan's designation by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism, and President Omar Hassan al-Bashir remains wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. This status could make investors and banks hesitant to do business, even if sanctions are lifted, said Magnus Taylor, a Sudan analyst at the International Crisis Group think-tank.   There will be an economic impact but it won't be instantaneous,  said Taylor.  It's the beginning of the process of normalisation.     Taylor said that it is likely, but not certain, that the United States will lift sanctions.    The State Department wants it to happen and the people working on Sudan within the State Department want it to happen, but ultimately it's kind of a political decision after that,  he said.

Twenty-one percent of streaming viewers ages 18 to 24 said they had accessed at least one digital video service such as Netflix Inc, HBO Now or Hulu by using log-in credentials from someone outside their household at some time. Overall, 12 percent of adults said they did the same thing.       Infographic ID: '2sUQIYJ'             Subscription revenue is likely to come under scrutiny starting next week when TV industry players begin reporting quarterly earnings. Netflix, the dominant streaming service, releases its results on Monday.  Up to now, Netflix and other streaming networks have accepted some password-sharing, but they may face pressure from investors to change course if new sign-ups slow substantially, Wall Street analysts said. Revenue growth at Netflix is projected to drop from 31 percent in this year's second quarter to 19 percent in the second quarter of next year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   If Netflix goes from a 30 percent revenue growth story to a 10 percent story, there is absolutely going to be more focus on their leaving money on the table,  said Justin Patterson, an analyst with Raymond James.  Netflix declined to comment.  Respondents to the Reuters/Ipsos survey said they borrow passwords to save money on video subscriptions, which can be cheap on their own but add up with multiple services.  Donielle Bradshaw, a live-in nanny in Smyrna, Georgia, said she uses her 28-year-old sister’s password for Hulu, and her 32-year-old brother’s password for Netflix.   I feel like since we are family, it’s OK,  said the 22-year-old Bradshaw, who estimates she watches four hours of shows on weeknights and 10 hours a day on weekends.    If companies cracked down on password sharing, Bradshaw said she would be willing to pay for her own Netflix subscription but is not sure about Hulu, which is owned by several media companies.  I binge a lot of shows on Netflix. I don’t think I could do without it,  she said.  Companies say they accept some sharing as a way to promote their programming to potential customers, but they also take steps to curtail blatant freeloading.  The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., January 18, 2017.Mike BlakeMany networks limit the number of people who can watch programming at the same time. Netflix, for example, allows two to four simultaneous streams per subscription, depending on the plan, and charges more for the higher number of streams.  HBO, a unit of Time Warner Inc, actually encourages younger viewers to use its HBO Now and HBO Go services for free by offering it to about 100 U.S. colleges and universities.    For us it’s more important that at that age where they are not financially independent quite yet, they are habituating to using the product to ultimately aspiring to becoming paid customers,  Bernadette Aulestia, executive vice president of global distribution, said in an interview.  Netflix executives also have said they know some viewers share passwords.  FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is pictured on a television remote in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., on January 18, 2017.Mike Blake/File Photo We could crack down on it, but you wouldn't suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,  Netflix Chief Financial Officer David Wells said at a Goldman Sachs conference last September.  Missing a Chance  Industry analysts say companies are missing a chance to grow revenue. An analysis by Parks Associates estimated streaming providers will lose $550 million in 2019 from password sharing.   There has been this kind of cavalier attitude about it,  Parks Associates analyst Glenn Hower said.  It hasn't been a priority.   Companies could crack down if they want. Cisco Systems Inc, for example, sells products that can detect abnormal activity on an account such as an unusual time or place, said Conrad Clemson, Cisco's senior vice president and general manager of service provider platforms and applications.  Cisco's customers, which include streaming services and pay TV distributors, decide whether to use the information simply for monitoring or take additional steps such as sending a warning to account holders or shutting down an account, he said.   A lot of service providers and content providers are very much in the experimental phase right now,  he said.  Streaming providers say they do track account use but have provided few specifics.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States from June 8 to June 26. It gathered responses from 4,453 adults, including 3,557 people who said they streamed video from their cable TV provider or from standalone services like Amazon Prime, Hulu or Netflix. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.

Unlike the other 10 GICS sectors, the S&P 500 telecom segment is so small there is not a single exchange-traded fund to mirror it, given that a fund holding just a few stocks would fall short of regulatory requirements.

The deal is the latest and most high-profile transaction to be refiled this year with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a secretive government panel which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks. Ant Financial and MoneyGram refiled after they were unable to secure clearance from CFIUS within the maximum time of 75 days that is awarded for assessing applications, the sources said on Tuesday.  Refiling resets the clock and gives up to another 75 days for the companies to complete the national security review and try to resolve potential issues.  We are not commenting on the CFIUS process, but we are continuing to work with the various regulatory agencies and remain focused on closing the transaction by the end of the year,  Ant Financial said in a statement.  MoneyGram declined to comment. A CFIUS refile does not necessarily mean that a deal will be rejected, although it does indicate increased government scrutiny. More deals have had to be refiled with CFIUS following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump in January, as several key positions at several government departments remain vacant or have taken too long to be filled. CFIUS did not respond to a request for comment. CFIUS had accepted notices of more than 120 transactions as of June 23, on pace to set a record, according to estimates by law firm Covington & Burling LLP. By comparison, CFIUS had received notices of just 97 transactions in all of 2013. Ant Financial finalized its deal to buy Dallas-based MoneyGram in April, after it sweetened its bid by over a third to beat a rival offer from U.S.-based Euronet Worldwide Inc (EEFT.O). MoneyGram's global remittance channels for sending money overseas would help Ant Financial, formerly known as Alipay, build a cross-border network after a string of recent investments in Asia. Some U.S. lawmakers, including Republican Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran, have written to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who also serves as chairman of CFIUS, to express concern that Ant Financial's acquisition of MoneyGram could pose national security threats, arguing that the information of U.S. citizens, including military personnel, could be compromised. Ant Financial has said that MoneyGram's data infrastructure will remain in the United States, with personal information encrypted or held in secure facilities on U.S. soil. It has also pointed to existing U.S. regulations that call for such protections.  CFIUS approved a previous deal by Ant Financial, its acquisition last year of Kansas City-based EyeVerify, the company behind a mobile eye verification technology.  In addition to CFIUS, at least 46 U.S. states must have granted money transmitter licenses before the deal closes. Ant Financial is already approved for money transfers in 23 U.S. states, according to analysts at Elevation LLC.

The move adds another China trade hawk to Trump's trade policy team, joining USTR Robert Lighthizer, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, the White House director of trade and industrial policy. Shea is vice chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which is charged with annually assessing the security, economic and trade relationship between the two countries, including China's compliance with its commitments to the World Trade Organization. In November, the panel recommended that U.S. lawmakers take action to ban China's state-owned firms from acquiring U.S. companies, arguing that Beijing uses state back firms to advance its national security objectives. It said lawmakers should strengthen the role of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, an interagency government panel that conducts national security reviews of acquisitions by foreign firms. The United States has seen a growing wave of Chinese acquisitions in recent years, especially in the technology sector.   Chinese state-owned enterprises are arms of the Chinese state,  Shea told a news conference at the time the recommendation was released.  We don't want the U.S. government purchasing companies in the United States, why would we want the Chinese Communist government purchasing companies in the United States?  Shea has served a decade on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and has been its chairman or vice chairman each year since 2012. A Harvard-trained lawyer, Shea has worked in and around government for much of the past 30 years, including as senior adviser to former Republican Senators Bob Dole and Elizabeth Dole and as assistant secretary for policy development and research at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He also has worked as a lobbyist, forming his own firm, Shea Public Strategies LLC, in 2010.

The move comes as the administration of President Donald Trump seeks to roll back a slew of Obama-era regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, and begins a withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement - a global pact to stem planetary warming through emissions cuts.  There are lots of questions that have not been asked and answered (about climate change),  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told Reuters in an interview late on Monday.   Who better to do that than a group of scientists... getting together and having a robust discussion for all the world to see,  he added without explaining how the scientists would be chosen. Asked if he thought the debate should be televised, Pruitt said:  I think so. I think so. I mean, I donâ€™t know yet, but you want this to be open to the world. You want this to be on full display. I think the American people would be very interested in consuming that. I think they deserve it.  Pruitt, one of the most controversial figures in the Trump administration, has repeatedly expressed doubts about climate change â€“ one of the main points of contention in his narrow confirmation by the Senate.  Related CoverageTranscript of Reuters interview with EPA Administrator Scott PruittWhile acknowledging the planet is warming, Pruitt says he questions the gravity of the problem and the need for regulations that require companies to take costly measures to reduce their carbon footprint.  It is a question about how much we contribute to it. How do we measure that with precision? And by the way, are we on an unsustainable path? And is it causing an existential threat?  he said in the interview. Since taking up his role at EPA, he has emerged as one of the more prolific Trump cabinet appointees, taking steps to undo more than two dozen regulations, and influencing Trumpâ€™s decision to pull the United States from the Paris climate change deal, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015. Pruitt rejected global criticism of the United States for pulling out of the climate deal, which Trump has said would have cost America trillions of dollars without benefit. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt waves after an interview for Reuters at his office in Washington, U.S., July 10, 2017.Yuri Gripas We have nothing to be apologetic about,  Pruitt said.  It was absolutely a decision of courage and fortitude and truly represented an America First strategy with respect to how we are leading on this issue.  Pruitt said the United States had already cut its carbon output to the lowest levels in nearly 25 years without mandates, thanks mainly to increased use of natural gas - which burns cleaner than coal.  Red Team, Blue Team  Tactics Slideshow (4 Images)Pruitt said his desire for the agency to host an ongoing climate change debate was inspired by two articles published in April â€“ one in the Wall Street Journal by theoretical physicist Steve Koonin, who served as undersecretary of energy under Obama â€“ and one by conservative columnist Brett Stephens in the New York Times.  Kooninâ€™s article made the case that climate science should use the  red team-blue team  methodology used by the national security community to test assumptions. Stephensâ€™ article criticized claims of complete certainty in climate science, saying that it  traduces the spirit of science.  Pruitt said scientists should not scoff at the idea of participating in these debates.  If youâ€™re going to win and if youâ€™re so certain about it, come and do your deal. They shouldnâ€™t be scared of the debate and discussion,  he said. Pruitt said debate is not necessarily aimed at undermining the 2009  endangerment finding,  the scientific determination that carbon dioxide harms human health that formed the basis for the Democratic Obama administration's regulation of greenhouse gases. He said there may be a legal basis to challenge the finding but would prefer Congress weigh in on the matter. In the interview, Pruitt added that he intended to deal  very aggressively  with automakers that use devices to cheat emissions tests, and would also seek to boost accountability for companies to clean up polluted sites under the Superfund program.  He said EPA was also not ready to decide yet on a change proposed by Trumpâ€™s special adviser Carl Icahn to the U.S. biofuels program, that would shift the burden of blending biofuels like ethanol into gasoline away from refiners to companies further down the supply chain.

The following is a full transcript of the interview: REUTERS: You have said the EPA will focus on a â€œBack to Basicsâ€� approach under your leadership. What does this mean for how EPA enforces polluters? You have been critical of the idea of regulation by enforcement. PRUITT: I think what Iâ€™m speaking about there is a consent decree approach to enforcement, where you use judicial proceedings to actually engage in regulation. Enforcement should be about existing regulations that youâ€™re actually enforcing against someone who may be violating that, very much in the prosecutorial manner. As attorney general [in Oklahoma], I lived that. There was a grand jury that I led. Being a prosecutor, I understand very much the importance of prioritization, of enforcing the rule of law, of addressing bad actors. Thatâ€™s something we are going to do in a meaningful way across the broad spectrum of cases, whether it is in the office of air or the superfund area, or otherwise. REUTERS: Do you want to see states play a bigger role in enforcing polluters, even though some have less of a capacity to do so â€“ financially and personnel wise? PRUITT: I think the stateâ€™s role is really, when you look at this office working with states it should be how do we assist, how do we engage in compliance and assistance with states. The office [at EPA that deals with enforcement] is called OECA, the Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Assistance, so those are the tools we have in the tool box to achieve better outcomes. So what we ought to be doing is working proactively with state DEQs [Departments of Environmental Quality] to get their state implementation plans [for federal regulations] timely submitted, provide assistance and technical support, drive a draft of state implementation plans and then actually work with them on how to achieve through those plans better outcomes and air and water quality. As far as enforcement is concerned we will actually work with states. We actually did that recently with Colorado, there was an oil and gas company that was emitting some 3,000 tons, is that what it was, it was quite a bit, ofâ€¦ it was an ozone case. In any event, we joined with ColoradoÂ in that prosecution. So sometimes states will do it, sometimes we will join with them. The importance is, in my view, that with respect to achieving good environmental outcomes, you need to use all of the tools in the toolbox to achieve that â€“ compliance, assistance and enforcement â€“ and use that enforcement in a meaningful impactful way to ensure that actions are addressed in a timely way. REUTERS: Some of the pending settlements that are out there â€“ Harley-Davidson for example â€“ where do they stand? And would you look at some of these previous settlements that were reached during the last days of the Obama administration and revisit them? PRUITT: Well, Iâ€™m not familiar withâ€¦ I donâ€™t know the latest on the Harley Davidson caseâ€¦ My review predominantly has been with respect to the consent decrees that were being used to engage in regulation. There is a distinction there. I want to make sure Iâ€™m saying that clearly. In one instance with respect to enforcement you have a regulation that has already been adopted and a standard that has to be met and a company that is not meeting the standard that was set by regulation. That is enforcement. This is what OECA should be working with the states to address. The part that has not been handled well over the past several years is the part where you have the EPA sued by third party, not an enforcement mechanism, but sued by an NGO, and that NGO is asking the court to compel this agency to take certain steps, either through change in statute or time lines set by statute and then the agency will acquiesce through a consent decree changing the very statutory framework. That is regulation through litigation and that is inconsistent with the authority in my view of this agency. That has nothing to do with enforcement. REUTERS: What are some examples that are egregious? PRUITT: There is a host of consent decrees that Iâ€™ve inherited that we are evaluating on a case by case basis to see what authority we have to address those. But again, that is not enforcement that is completely under the banner of regulation by litigation. Let me say to you that it is important because Congress has said that as you engage in rulemaking you follow the administrative procedures act, which is you propose a rule, you take comment, you respond to that comment on the record, you make an informed decision and then you finalize the rule. The reason that is important is that is how you build consensus. That is how you hear from people at the state level. That is how you hear from states. That is how you hear from industry. All these various voices are heard in that process and you make a more robust and informed decision. And the merits of the rule, I think, are received better that way. And when you do it through one case, through litigation, and it is passed on to the rest of the country, voices are subverted in that process and it is not good decision-making.  REUTERS: With the cheat devises used by automakers to skirt EPA vehicle emission standards, did you think that some of those penalties were too harsh? PRUITT: Look, what VW and Fiatâ€¦ youâ€™ve got this Fiat case that is on the horizon as well. The emails and the communications that Iâ€™m aware of: it was strategic and intentional and should be dealt with very aggressively. They knew very, very well what they did. I wouldnâ€™t call what was done too light at all. Iâ€™m fact, I would tell you that as we look forwardâ€¦ what VW did was very, very troublesome and we need to make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again. REUTERS: Will you model EPA enforcement after what you did in Oklahoma as attorney general? PRUITT: It is a completely different role that I had as attorney general. In fact, as I said during my confirmation process, the AG is not the enforcement arm at the state level with respect to permitting. That is DEQ. The environmental unit that we set up in the previous administration was not set up to address enforcement. It was actually set up to address a nuisance claim that was filed against a company on poultry waste that we dealt with in other ways with the state of Arkansas. Long and short of it, the role that I have here is very different from the role. As it turned out we were not the front-line enforcer. It was the DEQ and the state regulatory bodies. Now we did provide assistance to them through general counsel, and they provided support and input to them. But as far as a standalone enforcement arm, that was handled by the individual agencies in the state of Oklahoma. Which is different than here [at EPA]. We have a robust, very important role of enforcement here. We are coordinating with the regions, making sure there is consistency across the regionsâ€¦I tried to explain it during the confirmation hearing. Look at Superfund. People donâ€™t usually equate that with enforcement. Under the CERCLA statute [the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980] we have joint and several liability with respect to potential responsible parties, and a large percentage of our portfolio at the Superfund is through responsible parties, private funding. I think the agency has not done the best job historically at holding those private parties accountable for the amount of waste and remediation that needs to take place. We have tremendous authority. Iâ€™m going to have a very thoughtful and meaningful enforcement response to Superfund to make sure that we are achieving good outcomes for citizens across the country with respect to that entire portfolio of 1,336 or so sites. Again, that is not often thought about in terms of enforcement. We think about air, we think about permitting, but we donâ€™t often think about remediation under CERCLA and I think we have got a lot of room for improvement and opportunity to get accountability in that area. Iâ€™ve got a report on my desk that spent thirty or so days. Iâ€™m doing the task force recommendations right now, on how to better achieve accountability from enforcement across the board. REUTERS: But the administrationâ€™s proposed budget for FY2018 proposes severe budget cuts across the board, including to Superfund â€¦ Â  PRUITT: But there arenâ€™t. There arenâ€™t budget cuts across the board. We have a Continuing Resolution until the end of April that funded us around $8 billion or so, and Congress is going through that process with respect to what the funding levels are going to be on Superfund. So the fact that we have a proposed budgetâ€¦ Congress is having that discussion and there havenâ€™t been any budget cuts taking place at this point and weâ€™re working with Congress to make sure that there is adequate funding to address both the enforcement side and the Superfund side. REUTERS: When you saw the presidentâ€™s budget proposal which called for a 31 percent cut to the EPA budget, did it worry you? PRUITT: I think there are certain parts of the agency that there is room for true legitimate cuts, and there are other parts of the agency where that is not the case - as it is in every department. But to take something like Superfund and say that whatever the proposed budget was means that we canâ€™t do what we need to do as far as our reform and accountability is just simply not accurate. Most of the challenges Iâ€™ve seen from the Superfund program have been related to attitude management leadership and less about money. But as I told Congress during the budget and nomination process, if I determine that we need more moneys there, weâ€™ll ask Congress, because thatâ€™s the priority. Enforcement and Superfund are included in that category. When youâ€™re funding [inaudible] million dollars youâ€™ve got room to cut. But I can tell you this, the core mission of the agency â€“ improving air and water quality, addressing remediation as far as the superfund sites â€“ those types of priorities â€¦ REUTERS: There have been reports about the EPA launching what has been called a red team-blue team review of climate change science. Can you tell us more about this?Â  Will this lead to a re-evaluation of the 2009 endangerment finding that carbon dioxide endangers human health? PRUITT: Iâ€™m thinking about it. Steve Koonin, professor at NYU, did a very exciting piece in the Wall Street Journal called Red Team Blue Team. I scheduled time with Steve in my office the week that article came out. I didnâ€™t know it was coming outâ€¦ So Steve and I were meeting about some other things, and we didnâ€™t really focus on that, but I took the opportunity to talk to him about it and â€¦ weâ€™re considering it. I think the American people deserve and honest, open, transparent discussion. What do we know? What donâ€™t we know? Does it pose an existential threat, what can be done about it? etcâ€¦ There are lots of questions that have not been asked and answered. Who better to do that than a group of scientists? Red team scientists and blue team scientists getting together and having a robust discussion about that for all the world to see. So, Iâ€™m not a scientist, Iâ€™m an attorney. That does beg the question because there is a follow-up question to that, which is what can be done about it [climate change] that is statutory and legal? But as Iâ€™ve shared with senators in the confirmation process, Congress has never responded to this issue. If you ask people that amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, including [former Michigan Democratic] Congressman Dingle, he is endlessly quoted as saying that if you try to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act of 1990 that it would create â€œa glorious mess.â€� So the Clean Air Act was truly set up to address local and regional air pollutants. So, you hear often about the regulation of GHG and CO2, but there has to be a determination of what can be done. What are the tools in the toolbox? If the tools are not in the toolbox to address this issue, I canâ€™t, and this agency canâ€™t, just simply make it up. We canâ€™t re-imagine authority. The past administration tried to do that with its Clean Power Plan. It was extraordinary what the Supreme Court did [in its 2014 ruling on the Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA case. The court backed the EPAâ€™s ability to regulate greenhouse gases from mobile and stationary sources but threw out its â€œtailoring rule,â€� which revised the statutory thresholds for requiring federal air permits for greenhouse gases.] Â It said a lot. It said the authority the previous administration was trying to say that they had in regulating carbon dioxide wasnâ€™t there. So there are two parts to this question: what do we know/what donâ€™t we know? And two, what is the responseâ€¦the statutory response? The red team blue team is intended to be a response that provides answers to the American peopleâ€¦ the American people deserve, in my view, an open transparent honest discussion about this issueâ€¦. So we are contemplating being a part of that process. REUTERS: The consensus has been overwhelming that climate change has been caused by human beingsâ€¦ PRUITT: Thatâ€™s not the question.Â  It is not a question about whether the climate is warming. It is not a question about whether human activity contributes to it. It is a question about how much we contribute to it? How do we measure that with precision? And by the way, are we on an unsustainable path? And what harm...is it causing an existential threat? There is another great piece in the New York Times by Brett Stephens, I think it was, that talked about the climate of complete certainty. His whole premise is that there is a basis of consensus we know but the politicians have done what? Created an elasticity approach. Theyâ€™ve stretched it so far that itâ€™s reached a point where the credibility is being strained. That article, along with the red-team blue-team, I think those book-end this approach where we have a discussion about that. Some of the blue team scientists â€“ they say oh we are not going to participate in that. Why not? Why donâ€™t you want to participate? Itâ€™s like the New York Yankees according to them. Itâ€™s like the New York Yankees playing a Little League team. If youâ€™re going to win and if youâ€™re so certain about it, come and do your deal. They shouldnâ€™t be scared of the debate and discussion. Thatâ€™s what science is all about. Thatâ€™s what scientific debate is about. Letâ€™s get red team scientists in. Letâ€™s get blue team scientists in. Letâ€™s let them question one another. That would be exciting to see. REUTERS: But what would it look like? PRUITT: Itâ€™s in its formative stages. The idea is a good idea because itâ€™s an idea that advances science. It advances discussion. It advances transparency. It advances for the American people to consume and participate through this debate because there is not consensus on this issue. How do we know that? There has been no policy response. Thatâ€™s why we havenâ€™t seen Congress act because there has been such a question. Itâ€™s not a question about whether warming is happening or whether we are contributing to it. Thatâ€™s not what we are debating. Itâ€™s how much? To what degree? The precision of measurement. Does it pose a meaningful threat? Is it unsustainable? There is a host of questions that will be asked and answered during the process. Itâ€™s exciting.  REUTERS: But how would this be brought to the public? Would you put it on television? PRUITT:Â  I think so. I think so. I mean, I donâ€™t know yet, but you want this to be open to the world. You want this to be on full display. I think the American people would be very interested in consuming that. I think they deserve it.  REUTERS: How do you guarantee the objectivity of scientists? Make sure there are no conflicts of interest? PRUITT: Thatâ€™s why the red team blue team matters. Steve modeled this after national security and defense [exercises] - they kind of check one another. There is a consumption, an evaluation and interpretation. They will check one another.Â   REUTERS: Congress hasnâ€™t legislated on the endangerment finding. Will this scientific review lead to a review of the endangerment finding? PRUITT: You have the 2007 Massachusetts vs. EPA ruling which most people misinterpret. Mass vs. EPA didnâ€™t say to the EPA that you must regulate CO2. What Mass vs. EPA said is that you must make a decision whether you regulate or not. You canâ€™t just simply not make a decision. That was whole thing about Mass vs. EPA. And then what happened in post script. What happened post script was in 2009 with the endangerment finding but that was for mobile sources. Thatâ€™s another thing that important. The endangerment funding was focused on mobile sources â€“cars â€“ and section 111 [of the Clean Air Act]â€“ what the [Obama administration] Clean Power Plan dealt with â€“ was stationary sources. And they are separate requirements under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. There are a lot of process/ legal-related issues here that the previous administration didnâ€™t comply with. But the endangerment finding is only on the mobile side. When I say Congress hasnâ€™t responded, youâ€™ve had a court case and an endangerment finding and then youâ€™ve had an agency engage in regulatory response â€“ by the way using tools currently in the Clean Air Act â€“ and failed twice. They tried to respond to the endangerment finding by regulating under section 111 and failed and failed with the UARG decision (with the tailoring rule). So the question is begged â€“ what are the tools in the toolbox? I talked about that in my confirmation hearing. Iâ€™ve talked about that with individual senators. Itâ€™s something that Congress has to ask and answer. We have no authority except that which Congress gives us. We canâ€™t just simply make it up. The previous administration made it up with WOTUS [the Waters of the United States act]. They re-imagined authority in defining the Waters of the United States to include things that included dry creek beds and puddles. It just went too far and the sixth circuit struck that down or put a stay in place and did the same with CO2. This Supreme Court has been very, very clear that this agency, like any other agency in the federal government, canâ€™t simply re-imagine authority and a large authority beyond the statutory text. The scientific review â€“ the red team blue team discussion â€“ is intended to have an open transparent debate about something that is a policy issue that is extremely important in this country that is not taking place. The endangerment finding in 2009 was based on IPCC [United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] information not on the science of this agency. The red team blue team is intended to provide that type of vehicle, mechanism, to have an open debate, discussion. REUTERS: So you might take a look at the endangerment finding? PRUITT: Thatâ€™s not what this is about. What this is about is exactly what I described. REUTERS: Letâ€™s move on to the California waiver, which allows California to set its own more stringent emissions standards for vehicles. Is that something the EPA will review or change? PRUITT: Itâ€™s not under review right now. REUTERS: Will you review it in the future? PRUITT: The governor of California and I have traded correspondence with respect to Californiaâ€™s role â€“ very important. Congress has recognized it. They were regulating air quality before the Clean Air Act was adopted in 1972, which is why the California waiver exists. Weâ€™ve reached out to the California governor as part of our CAFE midterm review in 2018. Iâ€™m hopeful that the state of California, the governor there, will respond with reciprocity and we are working through that process. REUTERS: Are there any meetings taking place now with automakers? PRUITT: I donâ€™t know what conversations have taken place between automakers and California. The president and I were in Detroit announcing that the midterm review was going to take place when it should have taken place which is April of 2018, which is 16 months early, which occurred January this year. We restored process there and order there. Weâ€™re going through the process now and weâ€™ve reached out to California and believe that it is important to have a holistic discussion with California and weâ€™re optimistic that they will respond with reciprocity. REUTERS: On the Renewable Fuel Standard- How seriously is the EPA taking the proposal by Trump advisor and billionaire investor Carl Icahn to move the point of obligation? PRUITT: As you know, 18,000 comments were submitted. That was actually the process that began late in the last administration. We are still reviewing those comments. But the RFS is something â€“ look, itâ€™s a statute that Congress has passed. And Congress â€“ I take seriously the importance of enforcing a statute that Congress has passed and there are some challenges to that statute as you know. there are targets that have been put in prescriptively in the statute such as billions of gallons of cellulosic being blended into the fuel supply when I think the last numbers we had as far as produced numbers are around 190 million thatâ€™s actually production. Thatâ€™s a problem and it makes it tough administering the statute. I think whatever waiver authority we use we use it judiciously. Tied to production and actual market demand. Our job is to fulfill the objectives as best as possible of the statute and weâ€™re going to do that. The RVOs [renewable volume obligations] were supposed to be published every year in November. The past administration didnâ€™t do that timely.Â  We are. We are going to have those out in November. Weâ€™re on path to do that which is very good for people across the country to know what is expected of them. Thatâ€™s going to be done timely. We just released our proposed volume numbers and the preamble and in the language of the RVOs we talked about production demand market realities with respect to those advanced fuels. We are seeking to do our job there in a very meaningful way. There is a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about the statute and perhaps a bipartisan approach to update the statute because it actually expires in 2022 and so thereâ€™s a lot of discussion about trying to update the statute. Itâ€™s well received here and I encourage Congress to continue that. REUTERS: What is your strategy with your legal defense of your moves to undo the Obama era rules? The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last week denied your bid to delay the Obama administrationâ€™s regulations on methane. PRUITT: There are various authorities. That (methane case) was a case about our authority to stay certain rules. Thatâ€™s distinct from withdrawing rules. On WOTUS [the Waters of the United States rule] weâ€™ve actually proposed a withdrawal. I signed that on June 27 on energy dominance week. I think that our section 307 stay that we used there was because we were up against the compliance time and try to use authority that we thought was well established. We are going to respond to that accordingly. But going forwardâ€¦ I think it was a case focused on the facts of that particular case. I donâ€™t think it says anything to us with respect to authority we have to stay under section 705 of the administrative procedures act or section 307 of the Clean Air Act. Those are well established procedures we have. We will use them accordingly as necessary. Thatâ€™s what we are doing on the Clean Power Plan. We have a proposed rule to withdraw the CPP. What comes next is yet to be determined but what we do know with regards to that particular rule is that SCOTUS has issued a stay against it which means there is a likelihood of success on the merits as far as it being inconsistent with statutory authority and so itâ€™s not wise of this agency to use resources to advance the defense of a rule that maybe deficient. We are going to withdraw that and see what our authority is- the tools in the toolbox on that particular issue. REUTERS: On Paris and climate change, polls show younger people are more supportive of U.S leadership on climate change. How do you explain your decision to a younger generation? PRUITT: Thatâ€™s not what Paris was about.Â  I get what youâ€™re saying but hereâ€™s the deal though. It was not about whether the U.S. is going to continue leading on reducing our CO2 footprint because Paris didnâ€™t actually do that. Paris was a bumper sticker. Go back and read the articles about the criticism that was levied on the environmental left. They were very critical and dismissive of the Paris agreement. You know why? Because China didnâ€™t have to do anything until 2030 and India conditioned all of their obligations upon receiving two and a half trillion dollars of aid. Russia, India and China contributed 0 dollars to the Green Climate Fund. People have short memories there. We are already at pre 94 levels and we exited Kyoto in 2001 and from 2000 to 2014 we reduced our CO2 foot print by 18 plus percent. Thatâ€™s better than others across the globe. When people really want action and meaningful outcomes with regards to this, we are doing it.Â  We are at pre-1994 levels. Paris was not in my view â€“ it shouldnâ€™t be symbolic or optical with respect to whether progress or no progress is being made in CO2 reduction. REUTERS: What do you think about the argument some major fossil fuel companies like Exxon and Cloud Peak Energy (coal company) made that it is better for the US to remain in the Paris agreement because it gives them a competitive advantage? I donâ€™t understand that argument. I just simply donâ€™t understand that argument because if they are saying that the technology that is being developed domestically that we are not going to be able to export and other countries will be interested in? Where is the evidence of that? China is still building coal facilities to the tune of almost one a day. They had 800 planned and they have scaled that back. India is going to continue burning coal.Â  What we ought to be doing is exporting technology and innovation to help them do it cleaner. It is not the job of this agency and it shouldnâ€™t be the job of any regulatory body to force or pick winners and losers in the energy mix. We need fuel diversity as far as the generation of electricity because you can only get so much natural gas through the pipelines. So if there is an attack on your infrastructure with regards to the pipes and how natural gas is delivered to generate electricity, what do you do? You have to have a solid amount of hydrocarbons â€“ coal stored on site â€“ that allows you to address peak demand. If GDP growth is going to continue at 3 percent, then youâ€™ve got to have [fuel] diversity- itâ€™s energy security across the board. Itâ€™s unwise in business to have one client or two clients. Itâ€™s unwise in electricity to have one source or two sources. In Oklahoma â€“ 18 percent of our electricity is wind generated. This is an all of the above approach and EPA should not get in the business of foisting upon the markets decisions to say donâ€™t burn fossil fuels. The past administration was unapologetic. Thatâ€™s not what regulation should be about. Now Paris? Paris was a bad business deal for this country at the end of the day. It put us at an economic disadvantage. The US has never been about agreeing to targets. In this case, 26 - 28 percent [**the U.S. pledge for emissions reductions under the Paris agreement] in this instance. Every rule that the previous administration adoptedâ€¦Their entire climate action plan â€“ fell 40 percent short. It was failed from the very beginning. So why did they go to Paris and agree to 26-28 percent targets? Because it provided exposure domestically. Third party groups â€“ NGOs â€“ could sue this agency and say you need to do more under section 115 of the Clean Air Act [a section of the CAA that enables the United States to work cooperatively with other nations to address trans-boundary air pollution].Â  So there was legal exposure and we were already leading the world with respect to CO2 reduction. To interpret the president â€“ who said by the way engagement, renegotiate or another agreement â€“ but the Paris agreement is bad for this country and doesnâ€™t achieve good environmental outcomes. We have nothing to be apologetic about with regards to what we are already going. It was absolutely a decision of courage and fortitude and truly represented an America First strategy with respect to how we are leading on this issue. Germany is burning more coal. REUTERS: Didnâ€™t the US position on Paris isolate the United States at G20? PRUITT: The past administration was all about words. This administration is all about action. Look at the actions this country has taken. We have reduced our greenhouse gas levels to pre 1994 levels primarily through technology and innovation, not through government mandate. We have nothing to be apologetic about with the rest of the world. And if we really want to do something about reducing the CO2 footprint, then hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling need to be exported to China and India and Europe because that has created the greatest reduction in CO2. And nuclear. Why is Germany going away from nuclear? They are abolishing their nuclear portfolio and increasing what? Their CO2 emissions. Why doesnâ€™t anyone talk to chancellor Merkel about that? REUTERS: Do you ever talk to your kids about climate change? Do they agree with you? PRUITT: My kids are wonderfully talented individuals and their world view is wonderful.

The move adds another China trade hawk to Trump's trade policy team, joining USTR Robert Lighthizer, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, the White House director of trade and industrial policy. Shea is vice chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which is charged with annually assessing the security, economic and trade relationship between the two countries, including China's compliance with its commitments to the World Trade Organization. In November, the panel recommended that U.S. lawmakers take action to ban China's state-owned firms from acquiring U.S. companies, arguing that Beijing uses state back firms to advance its national security objectives. It said lawmakers should strengthen the role of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, an interagency government panel that conducts national security reviews of acquisitions by foreign firms. The United States has seen a growing wave of Chinese acquisitions in recent years, especially in the technology sector.   Chinese state-owned enterprises are arms of the Chinese state,  Shea told a news conference at the time the recommendation was released.  We don't want the U.S. government purchasing companies in the United States, why would we want the Chinese Communist government purchasing companies in the United States?  Shea has served a decade on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission and has been its chairman or vice chairman each year since 2012. A Harvard-trained lawyer, Shea has worked in and around government for much of the past 30 years, including as senior adviser to former Republican Senators Bob Dole and Elizabeth Dole and as assistant secretary for policy development and research at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He also has worked as a lobbyist, forming his own firm, Shea Public Strategies LLC, in 2010. The nomination, which has been submitted to the U.S. Senate for approval, comes about five weeks before the Trump administration is planning to start the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.

The following is a full transcript of the interview:          REUTERS: You have said the EPA will focus on a â€œBack to Basicsâ€� approach under your leadership. What does this mean for how EPA enforces polluters? You have been critical of the idea of regulation by enforcement.       PRUITT: I think what Iâ€™m speaking about there is a consent decree approach to enforcement, where you use judicial proceedings to actually engage in regulation. Enforcement should be about existing regulations that youâ€™re actually enforcing against someone who may be violating that, very much in the prosecutorial manner. As attorney general [in Oklahoma], I lived that. There was a grand jury that I led. Being a prosecutor, I understand very much the importance of prioritization, of enforcing the rule of law, of addressing bad actors. Thatâ€™s something we are going to do in a meaningful way across the broad spectrum of cases, whether it is in the office of air or the superfund area, or otherwise.      REUTERS: Do you want to see states play a bigger role in enforcing polluters, even though some have less of a capacity to do so â€“ financially and personnel wise?      PRUITT: I think the stateâ€™s role is really, when you look at this office working with states it should be how do we assist, how do we engage in compliance and assistance with states. The office [at EPA that deals with enforcement] is called OECA, the Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Assistance, so those are the tools we have in the tool box to achieve better outcomes. So what we ought to be doing is working proactively with state DEQs [Departments of Environmental Quality] to get their state implementation plans [for federal regulations] timely submitted, provide assistance and technical support, drive a draft of state implementation plans and then actually work with them on how to achieve through those plans better outcomes and air and water quality. As far as enforcement is concerned we will actually work with states. We actually did that recently with Colorado, there was an oil and gas company that was emitting some 3,000 tons, is that what it was, it was quite a bit, ofâ€¦ it was an ozone case. In any event, we joined with Colorado in that prosecution. So sometimes states will do it, sometimes we will join with them. The importance is, in my view, that with respect to achieving good environmental outcomes, you need to use all of the tools in the toolbox to achieve that â€“ compliance, assistance and enforcement â€“ and use that enforcement in a meaningful impactful way to ensure that actions are addressed in a timely way.      REUTERS: Some of the pending settlements that are out there â€“ Harley-Davidson for example â€“ where do they stand? And would you look at some of these previous settlements that were reached during the last days of the Obama administration and revisit them?      PRUITT: Well, Iâ€™m not familiar withâ€¦ I donâ€™t know the latest on the Harley Davidson caseâ€¦ My review predominantly has been with respect to the consent decrees that were being used to engage in regulation. There is a distinction there. I want to make sure Iâ€™m saying that clearly. In one instance with respect to enforcement you have a regulation that has already been adopted and a standard that has to be met and a company that is not meeting the standard that was set by regulation. That is enforcement. This is what OECA should be working with the states to address. The part that has not been handled well over the past several years is the part where you have the EPA sued by third party, not an enforcement mechanism, but sued by an NGO, and that NGO is asking the court to compel this agency to take certain steps, either through change in statute or time lines set by statute and then the agency will acquiesce through a consent decree changing the very statutory framework. That is regulation through litigation and that is inconsistent with the authority in my view of this agency. That has nothing to do with enforcement.      REUTERS: What are some examples that are egregious?      PRUITT: There is a host of consent decrees that Iâ€™ve inherited that we are evaluating on a case by case basis to see what authority we have to address those. But again, that is not enforcement that is completely under the banner of regulation by litigation. Let me say to you that it is important because Congress has said that as you engage in rulemaking you follow the administrative procedures act, which is you propose a rule, you take comment, you respond to that comment on the record, you make an informed decision and then you finalize the rule. The reason that is important is that is how you build consensus. That is how you hear from people at the state level. That is how you hear from states. That is how you hear from industry. All these various voices are heard in that process and you make a more robust and informed decision. And the merits of the rule, I think, are received better that way. And when you do it through one case, through litigation, and it is passed on to the rest of the country, voices are subverted in that process and it is not good decision-making.       REUTERS: With the cheat devises used by automakers to skirt EPA vehicle emission standards, did you think that some of those penalties were too harsh?      PRUITT: Look, what VW and Fiatâ€¦ youâ€™ve got this Fiat case that is on the horizon as well. The emails and the communications that Iâ€™m aware of: it was strategic and intentional and should be dealt with very aggressively. They knew very, very well what they did. I wouldnâ€™t call what was done too light at all. Iâ€™m fact, I would tell you that as we look forwardâ€¦ what VW did was very, very troublesome and we need to make sure it doesnâ€™t happen again.      REUTERS: Will you model EPA enforcement after what you did in Oklahoma as attorney general?      PRUITT: It is a completely different role that I had as attorney general. In fact, as I said during my confirmation process, the AG is not the enforcement arm at the state level with respect to permitting. That is DEQ. The environmental unit that we set up in the previous administration was not set up to address enforcement. It was actually set up to address a nuisance claim that was filed against a company on poultry waste that we dealt with in other ways with the state of Arkansas. Long and short of it, the role that I have here is very different from the role. As it turned out we were not the front-line enforcer. It was the DEQ and the state regulatory bodies. Now we did provide assistance to them through general counsel, and they provided support and input to them. But as far as a standalone enforcement arm, that was handled by the individual agencies in the state of Oklahoma. Which is different than here [at EPA]. We have a robust, very important role of enforcement here. We are coordinating with the regions, making sure there is consistency across the regionsâ€¦I tried to explain it during the confirmation hearing. Look at Superfund. People donâ€™t usually equate that with enforcement. Under the CERCLA statute [the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980] we have joint and several liability with respect to potential responsible parties, and a large percentage of our portfolio at the Superfund is through responsible parties, private funding. I think the agency has not done the best job historically at holding those private parties accountable for the amount of waste and remediation that needs to take place. We have tremendous authority. Iâ€™m going to have a very thoughtful and meaningful enforcement response to Superfund to make sure that we are achieving good outcomes for citizens across the country with respect to that entire portfolio of 1,336 or so sites. Again, that is not often thought about in terms of enforcement. We think about air, we think about permitting, but we donâ€™t often think about remediation under CERCLA and I think we have got a lot of room for improvement and opportunity to get accountability in that area. Iâ€™ve got a report on my desk that spent thirty or so days. Iâ€™m doing the task force recommendations right now, on how to better achieve accountability from enforcement across the board.      REUTERS: But the administrationâ€™s proposed budget for FY2018 proposes severe budget cuts across the board, including to Superfund â€¦   PRUITT: But there arenâ€™t. There arenâ€™t budget cuts across the board. We have a Continuing Resolution until the end of April that funded us around $8 billion or so, and Congress is going through that process with respect to what the funding levels are going to be on Superfund. So the fact that we have a proposed budgetâ€¦ Congress is having that discussion and there havenâ€™t been any budget cuts taking place at this point and weâ€™re working with Congress to make sure that there is adequate funding to address both the enforcement side and the Superfund side.      REUTERS: When you saw the presidentâ€™s budget proposal which called for a 31 percent cut to the EPA budget, did it worry you?      PRUITT: I think there are certain parts of the agency that there is room for true legitimate cuts, and there are other parts of the agency where that is not the case - as it is in every department. But to take something like Superfund and say that whatever the proposed budget was means that we canâ€™t do what we need to do as far as our reform and accountability is just simply not accurate. Most of the challenges Iâ€™ve seen from the Superfund program have been related to attitude management leadership and less about money. But as I told Congress during the budget and nomination process, if I determine that we need more moneys there, weâ€™ll ask Congress, because thatâ€™s the priority. Enforcement and Superfund are included in that category. When youâ€™re funding             million dollars youâ€™ve got room to cut. But I can tell you this, the core mission of the agency â€“ improving air and water quality, addressing remediation as far as the superfund sites â€“ those types of priorities â€¦      REUTERS: There have been reports about the EPA launching what has been called a red team-blue team review of climate change science. Can you tell us more about this?  Will this lead to a re-evaluation of the 2009 endangerment finding that carbon dioxide endangers human health?      PRUITT: Iâ€™m thinking about it. Steve Koonin, professor at NYU, did a very exciting piece in the Wall Street Journal called Red Team Blue Team. I scheduled time with Steve in my office the week that article came out. I didnâ€™t know it was coming outâ€¦ So Steve and I were meeting about some other things, and we didnâ€™t really focus on that, but I took the opportunity to talk to him about it and â€¦ weâ€™re considering it. I think the American people deserve and honest, open, transparent discussion. What do we know? What donâ€™t we know? Does it pose an existential threat, what can be done about it? etcâ€¦ There are lots of questions that have not been asked and answered. Who better to do that than a group of scientists? Red team scientists and blue team scientists getting together and having a robust discussion about that for all the world to see. So, Iâ€™m not a scientist, Iâ€™m an attorney. That does beg the question because there is a follow-up question to that, which is what can be done about it [climate change] that is statutory and legal? But as Iâ€™ve shared with senators in the confirmation process, Congress has never responded to this issue. If you ask people that amended the Clean Air Act in 1990, including [former Michigan Democratic] Congressman Dingle, he is endlessly quoted as saying that if you try to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act of 1990 that it would create â€œa glorious mess.â€� So the Clean Air Act was truly set up to address local and regional air pollutants. So, you hear often about the regulation of GHG and CO2, but there has to be a determination of what can be done. What are the tools in the toolbox? If the tools are not in the toolbox to address this issue, I canâ€™t, and this agency canâ€™t, just simply make it up. We canâ€™t re-imagine authority. The past administration tried to do that with its Clean Power Plan. It was extraordinary what the Supreme Court did [in its 2014 ruling on the Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA case. The court backed the EPAâ€™s ability to regulate greenhouse gases from mobile and stationary sources but threw out its â€œtailoring rule,â€� which revised the statutory thresholds for requiring federal air permits for greenhouse gases.]  It said a lot. It said the authority the previous administration was trying to say that they had in regulating carbon dioxide wasnâ€™t there. So there are two parts to this question: what do we know/what donâ€™t we know? And two, what is the responseâ€¦the statutory response? The red team blue team is intended to be a response that provides answers to the American peopleâ€¦ the American people deserve, in my view, an open transparent honest discussion about this issueâ€¦. So we are contemplating being a part of that process.      REUTERS: The consensus has been overwhelming that climate change has been caused by human beingsâ€¦      PRUITT: Thatâ€™s not the question.  It is not a question about whether the climate is warming. It is not a question about whether human activity contributes to it. It is a question about how much we contribute to it? How do we measure that with precision? And by the way, are we on an unsustainable path? And what harm...is it causing an existential threat? There is another great piece in the New York Times by Brett Stephens, I think it was, that talked about the climate of complete certainty. His whole premise is that there is a basis of consensus we know but the politicians have done what? Created an elasticity approach. Theyâ€™ve stretched it so far that itâ€™s reached a point where the credibility is being strained. That article, along with the red-team blue-team, I think those book-end this approach where we have a discussion about that. Some of the blue team scientists â€“ they say oh we are not going to participate in that. Why not? Why donâ€™t you want to participate? Itâ€™s like the New York Yankees according to them. Itâ€™s like the New York Yankees playing a Little League team. If youâ€™re going to win and if youâ€™re so certain about it, come and do your deal. They shouldnâ€™t be scared of the debate and discussion. Thatâ€™s what science is all about. Thatâ€™s what scientific debate is about. Letâ€™s get red team scientists in. Letâ€™s get blue team scientists in. Letâ€™s let them question one another. That would be exciting to see.      REUTERS: But what would it look like?      PRUITT: Itâ€™s in its formative stages. The idea is a good idea because itâ€™s an idea that advances science. It advances discussion. It advances transparency. It advances for the American people to consume and participate through this debate because there is not consensus on this issue. How do we know that? There has been no policy response. Thatâ€™s why we havenâ€™t seen Congress act because there has been such a question. Itâ€™s not a question about whether warming is happening or whether we are contributing to it. Thatâ€™s not what we are debating. Itâ€™s how much? To what degree? The precision of measurement. Does it pose a meaningful threat? Is it unsustainable? There is a host of questions that will be asked and answered during the process. Itâ€™s exciting.       REUTERS: But how would this be brought to the public? Would you put it on television?      PRUITT:  I think so. I think so. I mean, I donâ€™t know yet, but you want this to be open to the world. You want this to be on full display. I think the American people would be very interested in consuming that. I think they deserve it.       REUTERS: How do you guarantee the objectivity of scientists? Make sure there are no conflicts of interest?      PRUITT: Thatâ€™s why the red team blue team matters. Steve modeled this after national security and defense             - they kind of check one another. There is a consumption, an evaluation and interpretation. They will check one another.    REUTERS: Congress hasnâ€™t legislated on the endangerment finding. Will this scientific review lead to a review of the endangerment finding?      PRUITT: You have the 2007 Massachusetts vs. EPA ruling which most people misinterpret. Mass vs. EPA didnâ€™t say to the EPA that you must regulate CO2. What Mass vs. EPA said is that you must make a decision whether you regulate or not. You canâ€™t just simply not make a decision. That was whole thing about Mass vs. EPA. And then what happened in post script. What happened post script was in 2009 with the endangerment finding but that was for mobile sources. Thatâ€™s another thing that important. The endangerment funding was focused on mobile sources â€“cars â€“ and section 111 [of the Clean Air Act]â€“ what the [Obama administration] Clean Power Plan dealt with â€“ was stationary sources. And they are separate requirements under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. There are a lot of process/ legal-related issues here that the previous administration didnâ€™t comply with. But the endangerment finding is only on the mobile side. When I say Congress hasnâ€™t responded, youâ€™ve had a court case and an endangerment finding and then youâ€™ve had an agency engage in regulatory response â€“ by the way using tools currently in the Clean Air Act â€“ and failed twice. They tried to respond to the endangerment finding by regulating under section 111 and failed and failed with the UARG decision (with the tailoring rule). So the question is begged â€“ what are the tools in the toolbox? I talked about that in my confirmation hearing. Iâ€™ve talked about that with individual senators. Itâ€™s something that Congress has to ask and answer. We have no authority except that which Congress gives us. We canâ€™t just simply make it up. The previous administration made it up with WOTUS [the Waters of the United States act]. They re-imagined authority in defining the Waters of the United States to include things that included dry creek beds and puddles. It just went too far and the sixth circuit struck that down or put a stay in place and did the same with CO2. This Supreme Court has been very, very clear that this agency, like any other agency in the federal government, canâ€™t simply re-imagine authority and a large authority beyond the statutory text. The scientific review â€“ the red team blue team discussion â€“ is intended to have an open transparent debate about something that is a policy issue that is extremely important in this country that is not taking place. The endangerment finding in 2009 was based on IPCC [United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] information not on the science of this agency. The red team blue team is intended to provide that type of vehicle, mechanism, to have an open debate, discussion.      REUTERS: So you might take a look at the endangerment finding?      PRUITT: Thatâ€™s not what this is about. What this is about is exactly what I described.      REUTERS: Letâ€™s move on to the California waiver, which allows California to set its own more stringent emissions standards for vehicles. Is that something the EPA will review or change?    PRUITT: Itâ€™s not under review right now.      REUTERS: Will you review it in the future?      PRUITT: The governor of California and I have traded correspondence with respect to Californiaâ€™s role â€“ very important. Congress has recognized it. They were regulating air quality before the Clean Air Act was adopted in 1972, which is why the California waiver exists. Weâ€™ve reached out to the California governor as part of our CAFE midterm review in 2018. Iâ€™m hopeful that the state of California, the governor there, will respond with reciprocity and we are working through that process.      REUTERS: Are there any meetings taking place now with automakers?     PRUITT: I donâ€™t know what conversations have taken place between automakers and California. The president and I were in Detroit announcing that the midterm review was going to take place when it should have taken place which is April of 2018, which is 16 months early, which occurred January this year. We restored process there and order there. Weâ€™re going through the process now and weâ€™ve reached out to California and believe that it is important to have a holistic discussion with California and weâ€™re optimistic that they will respond with reciprocity.      REUTERS: On the Renewable Fuel Standard- How seriously is the EPA taking the proposal by Trump advisor and billionaire investor Carl Icahn to move the point of obligation?      PRUITT: As you know, 18,000 comments were submitted. That was actually the process that began late in the last administration. We are still reviewing those comments. But the RFS is something â€“ look, itâ€™s a statute that Congress has passed. And Congress â€“ I take seriously the importance of enforcing a statute that Congress has passed and there are some challenges to that statute as you know. there are targets that have been put in prescriptively in the statute such as billions of gallons of cellulosic being blended into the fuel supply when I think the last numbers we had as far as produced numbers are around 190 million thatâ€™s actually production. Thatâ€™s a problem and it makes it tough administering the statute. I think whatever waiver authority we use we use it judiciously. Tied to production and actual market demand. Our job is to fulfill the objectives as best as possible of the statute and weâ€™re going to do that. The RVOs [renewable volume obligations] were supposed to be published every year in November. The past administration didnâ€™t do that timely.  We are. We are going to have those out in November. Weâ€™re on path to do that which is very good for people across the country to know what is expected of them. Thatâ€™s going to be done timely. We just released our proposed volume numbers and the preamble and in the language of the RVOs we talked about production demand market realities with respect to those advanced fuels. We are seeking to do our job there in a very meaningful way. There is a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about the statute and perhaps a bipartisan approach to update the statute because it actually expires in 2022 and so thereâ€™s a lot of discussion about trying to update the statute. Itâ€™s well received here and I encourage Congress to continue that.      REUTERS: What is your strategy with your legal defense of your moves to undo the Obama era rules? The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last week denied your bid to delay the Obama administrationâ€™s regulations on methane.      PRUITT: There are various authorities. That (methane case) was a case about our authority to stay certain rules. Thatâ€™s distinct from withdrawing rules. On WOTUS [the Waters of the United States rule] weâ€™ve actually proposed a withdrawal. I signed that on June 27 on energy dominance week. I think that our section 307 stay that we used there was because we were up against the compliance time and try to use authority that we thought was well established. We are going to respond to that accordingly. But going forwardâ€¦ I think it was a case focused on the facts of that particular case. I donâ€™t think it says anything to us with respect to authority we have to stay under section 705 of the administrative procedures act or section 307 of the Clean Air Act. Those are well established procedures we have. We will use them accordingly as necessary. Thatâ€™s what we are doing on the Clean Power Plan. We have a proposed rule to withdraw the CPP. What comes next is yet to be determined but what we do know with regards to that particular rule is that SCOTUS has issued a stay against it which means there is a likelihood of success on the merits as far as it being inconsistent with statutory authority and so itâ€™s not wise of this agency to use resources to advance the defense of a rule that maybe deficient. We are going to withdraw that and see what our authority is- the tools in the toolbox on that particular issue.      REUTERS: On Paris and climate change, polls show younger people are more supportive of U.S leadership on climate change. How do you explain your decision to a younger generation?      PRUITT: Thatâ€™s not what Paris was about.  I get what youâ€™re saying but hereâ€™s the deal though. It was not about whether the U.S. is going to continue leading on reducing our CO2 footprint because Paris didnâ€™t actually do that. Paris was a bumper sticker. Go back and read the articles about the criticism that was levied on the environmental left. They were very critical and dismissive of the Paris agreement. You know why? Because China didnâ€™t have to do anything until 2030 and India conditioned all of their obligations upon receiving two and a half trillion dollars of aid. Russia, India and China contributed 0 dollars to the Green Climate Fund. People have short memories there. We are already at pre 94 levels and we exited Kyoto in 2001 and from 2000 to 2014 we reduced our CO2 foot print by 18 plus percent. Thatâ€™s better than others across the globe. When people really want action and meaningful outcomes with regards to this, we are doing it.  We are at pre-1994 levels. Paris was not in my view â€“ it shouldnâ€™t be symbolic or optical with respect to whether progress or no progress is being made in CO2 reduction.      REUTERS: What do you think about the argument some major fossil fuel companies like Exxon and Cloud Peak Energy (coal company) made that it is better for the US to remain in the Paris agreement because it gives them a competitive advantage? I donâ€™t understand that argument. I just simply donâ€™t understand that argument because if they are saying that the technology that is being developed domestically that we are not going to be able to export and other countries will be interested in? Where is the evidence of that? China is still building coal facilities to the tune of almost one a day. They had 800 planned and they have scaled that back. India is going to continue burning coal.  What we ought to be doing is exporting technology and innovation to help them do it cleaner. It is not the job of this agency and it shouldnâ€™t be the job of any regulatory body to force or pick winners and losers in the energy mix. We need fuel diversity as far as the generation of electricity because you can only get so much natural gas through the pipelines. So if there is an attack on your infrastructure with regards to the pipes and how natural gas is delivered to generate electricity, what do you do? You have to have a solid amount of hydrocarbons â€“ coal stored on site â€“ that allows you to address peak demand. If GDP growth is going to continue at 3 percent, then youâ€™ve got to have        diversity- itâ€™s energy security across the board. Itâ€™s unwise in business to have one client or two clients. Itâ€™s unwise in electricity to have one source or two sources. In Oklahoma â€“ 18 percent of our electricity is wind generated. This is an all of the above approach and EPA should not get in the business of foisting upon the markets decisions to say donâ€™t burn fossil fuels. The past administration was unapologetic. Thatâ€™s not what regulation should be about. Now Paris? Paris was a bad business deal for this country at the end of the day. It put us at an economic disadvantage. The US has never been about agreeing to targets. In this case, 26 - 28 percent [**the U.S. pledge for emissions reductions under the Paris agreement] in this instance. Every rule that the previous administration adoptedâ€¦Their entire climate action plan â€“ fell 40 percent short. It was failed from the very beginning. So why did they go to Paris and agree to 26-28 percent targets? Because it provided exposure domestically. Third party groups â€“ NGOs â€“ could sue this agency and say you need to do more under section 115 of the Clean Air Act [a section of the CAA that enables the United States to work cooperatively with other nations to address trans-boundary air pollution].  So there was legal exposure and we were already leading the world with respect to CO2 reduction. To interpret the president â€“ who said by the way engagement, renegotiate or another agreement â€“ but the Paris agreement is bad for this country and doesnâ€™t achieve good environmental outcomes. We have nothing to be apologetic about with regards to what we are already going. It was absolutely a decision of courage and fortitude and truly represented an America First strategy with respect to how we are leading on this issue. Germany is burning more coal.      REUTERS: Didnâ€™t the US position on Paris isolate the United States at G20?  PRUITT: The past administration was all about words. This administration is all about action. Look at the actions this country has taken. We have reduced our greenhouse gas levels to pre 1994 levels primarily through technology and innovation, not through government mandate. We have nothing to be apologetic about with the rest of the world. And if we really want to do something about reducing the CO2 footprint, then hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling need to be exported to China and India and Europe because that has created the greatest reduction in CO2. And nuclear. Why is Germany going away from nuclear? They are abolishing their nuclear portfolio and increasing what? Their CO2 emissions. Why doesnâ€™t anyone talk to chancellor Merkel about that?      REUTERS: Do you ever talk to your kids about climate change? Do they agree with you?      PRUITT: My kids are wonderfully talented individuals and their world view is wonderful. They look at these issues in a smart way and I think they would probably echo the things that I have shared.

What happened with Donald Trump Jr. just underscores how Russia was operating,  said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin said the bill should have been passed because of Russian interference in last year's U.S. elections, occupation of parts of Ukraine and Georgia and support of the Syrian government. The Senate backed the sanctions legislation by 98-2 on June 15 but it has been stuck in the House of Representatives, amid partisan squabbling between Republicans and Democrats. Trump's relationship with Russia has been in particularly sharp focus this month because he had his first meeting last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some Democrats had accused Trump's fellow Republicans of stalling the sanctions package at least until after that meeting, to please the president. Republicans denied that. House Republican leaders initially rejected the bill for procedural reasons, prompting the Senate to tweak it. But Democrats then objected to a change by the Senate that they said weakened the bill by making it more difficult for the House to vote on any change in sanctions policy by Trump. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Democrats still were objecting to moving the bill in its current form. But both Republican and Democratic House aides said talks between the two parties were continuing and there was a decent chance for a quick compromise, more so because of the latest revelations about Trump's eldest son. 'Certainly Does Not Help' Donald Trump Jr. eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he believed was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton, as part of Moscow's official support for his father, according to emails released on Tuesday.  It certainly does not help the administration at this point,  a senior Republican House aide said. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, predicted that the matter would be cleared up quickly and brought to the floor for a vote this week. The Russia package, written as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, puts into law sanctions previously established through presidential executive order, including some on Russian energy projects and debt financing. It also imposes sanctions on Russians convicted of human rights abuses or cyber attacks and would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. Trump administration officials have been meeting with lawmakers to argue against some parts of the bill, including the requirement that Trump obtain Congress' permission before easing any sanctions. They also objected to the fact that many of the sanctions are mandatory, meaning Trump could not waive them for national security reasons.  This is more about foreign policy and having the flexibility to negotiate with other countries,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a daily briefing. But many of Trump's fellow Republicans said they wanted to move ahead nonetheless to send a strong message to Russia.  Any administration would prefer to conduct foreign policy 100 percent without involvement by Congress. That's just the way life is,  said Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will introduce his own Russia sanctions legislation in the House if the Senate bill remains stalled, a source familiar with his thinking said. Royce's thinking was first reported by Politico.

Formula E boss might","keywords":"Alejandro Agag,US,MOTOR,ELECTRIC,AGAG,Automobiles / Auto Parts (Legacy),Americas,Sports Business,France,Corporate Events,Spain,Automobiles and Auto Parts (TRBC),Sport,Interviews,Motor Racing,Government Borrowing Requirement,Internet / World Wide Web,Europe,Science,United Kingdom,United States","sector":"Life","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - Formula E boss Alejandro Agag has brought plenty of novelty to  the world's first all-electric motor racing series and now he is wondering about unleashing fake dogs as a hazard for driverless cars. If that idea sounds virtually barking, the 46-year-old Spaniard appears to be serious.  Speaking ahead of races in New York this weekend, Agag ran the rule over some of his championship's technological innovations -- from 'fanboost' to digital dimensions and driverless racing cars -- and ventured one step beyond. Part of the program envisages futuristic-looking 'Roborace' cars doing demonstration laps around the Brooklyn street circuit. Formula E organizers hope ultimately to have up to 10 of the  cars racing together, run by teams who write their own software, around city tracks as a support event to their series. They are not there yet, however, and the format of any such race has yet to be decided. One problem is that all are likely to be programmed to take the perfect line around the track and may not be able to overtake. Agag's view, however, is that the driverless technology is less about motorsport than safety and that maybe highlighting the latter is the best way forward.  Maybe the way to do it is to have (the cars lap) one by one and see which one is safer,  he told Reuters.  So you throw in a fake dog for example, a fake obstacle, and see how the car reacts to that.   The fake dog has to be fake,  he added, firmly. Geeks and Gamers  Such thinking is typical of Formula E, a series that appeals as much if not more to geeks and gamers than old-style petrolheads. While Formula One talks about entering a digital era, with an expansion of social media and putting content onto previously neglected platforms under new owners Liberty Media, Formula E has enjoyed a head start.  The digital world is so wide that you can do a million things and you don't collide with someone else doing another million things,  said Agag.  We keep having new ideas that nobody has done and maybe they (Formula One Management) are having some ideas that nobody has done.  They have started a little bit late but we can see the new team is really pushing on that and doing some interesting things. But we started much earlier.  That means near-live clips on social media platforms such as Instagram Stories and Snapchat, with the best race action soon after it has happened. 'Fanboost' is another example, allowing fans to vote online with the three most popular drivers given a power boost during the race. Once seen as a gimmick, it has become widely accepted.  I think Fanboost is not discussed any more,  said Agag.  People have accepted that Fanboost is a great tool and particularly sponsors love Fanboost and the openness that it gives, the access and engagement with the fans and so on.  Gaming and eSports is also increasingly to the fore, with Formula E having already staged a virtual event in Las Vegas pitting gamers against the real racing drivers on simulators.  We are moving to the limit with live and gaming,  said Agag. In New York, Formula E will hook up with the Real Racing3 gaming platform. Fans will set their times on simulators at the real racetrack and the fastest will compete against the Formula E drivers in a virtual race to be livestreamed through mobile phones and watched around the world.

But despite decades of power shortages, companies are only starting to catch on. Old Mutual Zimbabwe Ltd, the countryâ€™s biggest insurance and property firm, now plans to install up to 20 megawatts of rooftop solar panels on all its commercial buildings over the next two years to help ease a countrywide power crisis that has begun to drag profits down, company officials said. As state power utility ZESA Holdings struggles to generate enough electricity to meet demand, power outages have hurt businesses in recent years, according to the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI). During 2015-2016, as drought hit hydropower production in much of southern Africa, industrial production fell by more than 50 percent, confederation officials said. Now a growing share of companies are looking to solar power not just as an alternative to the grid but as a way to cut costs and keep businesses going in a country where energy costs can be a substantial drain on businesses.  But progress is so far slow, though picking up speed, officials said. â€œBy securing clean reliable power in its (Old Mutual) buildings, this will benefit its commercial tenants who rely on consistent availability of power,â€� said Simba Mhuriro, chief executive of Oxygen Africa Ltd, an independent energy producer that won the contract to put in place Old Mutualâ€™s $38 million solar project. The company has begun a technical study to establish how power consumption operates at the Old Mutual properties in question, using a $1 million grant from the African Development Bank. Mhuriro said the project will provide power for lighting and heating, and for operating office equipment and small machinery, such as sewing machines, for over 8,000 small businesses renting space from Old Mutualâ€™s $500 million property portfolio, which spans offices, homes and shopping malls. â€œThe systems will be grid-tied systems that integrate both solar and grid power. The solar will primarily displace grid power during the day,â€� Mhuriro told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email. Cash to Switch Zimbabweâ€™s government has said it needs $3 billion in aid to meet its goals to expand off-grid solar power laid out in a government plan drawn up as part of the Paris Agreement on climate change. That plan aims to reduce carbon emissions by measures such as requiring that solar water heaters be installed in all new homes and in commercial and industrial buildings. The southern African country aims to cut its total emissions by about a third by 2030, mostly by increasing investment in hydropower and solar power and improving energy efficiency. At the end of June, nearly 28 percent of Zimbabweâ€™s electricity supply came from fossil fuel power plants, and about half from hydropower. The remainder is imported, according to ZESA Holdings, the national utility. Businesses so far havenâ€™t played a significant part in transitioning to cleaner energy, even though they have been one of the biggest sources of emissions, said Tendai Marowa, a director with the Business Council for Sustainable Development Zimbabwe. Thatâ€™s in part due to a lack of clear-cut national policies for driving renewable energy use in industry, which consumes 64 percent of the national power supply, he said. According to a CZI survey, only 2 percent of company spending on energy alternatives to the national grid in 2016 went to solar power. Another 10 percent went to liquefied petroleum gas. The majority â€“ 60 percent â€“ went to diesel generators, the survey said. But Old Mutual expects that installing solar panels will help it save $16 million it spends each year buying 12 million liters of diesel to supplement grid power, company spokesperson Tendayi Mutseyekwa said. â€œMore than 33,000 tonnes of emissions will be avoided each year,â€� he said. At Mimosa Platinum, a company in the countryâ€™s Midlands province, 360 solar water heaters installed in staff houses three years ago generate 1.5 MW of power. That's been helpful - but very small in terms of the company's overall power bills, given the huge amount of power required by the mine itself, officials said. â€œThe financial impact in the context of Mimosaâ€™s overall costs has not been ... significant,â€� said Winston Chitando, Mimosa Platinumâ€™s executive chairman. But the company is now awaiting the results of a feasibility study into using solar power for the mine itself, he said. Altogether, CZI data show that a quarter of companies in Zimbabwe remain completely dependent on grid electricity supplies. But Tawanda Muzamwese, a Zimbabwean independent energy expert, believes many more companies eventually will make the switch to solar power â€“ a potentially abundant source of energy in a largely sunny country. â€œCompanies are beginning to realize that sustainable energy can improve their competitiveness (and) profitability as well as improve access to foreign markets that are increasingly demanding products produced sustainably,â€� Muzamwese said.

Trump Jr. met the woman, lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, on June 9, 2016, after an email exchange with an intermediary.  The emails, tweeted by Trump Jr. on Tuesday, could provide material for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.  In one of the emails dated June 3, 2016, Trump Jr. wrote:  If it's what you say I love it.  He released the tweets after the New York Times said it planned to write about their contents and sought his comment. Trump Jr. said in his tweets that nothing came of the meeting. Veselnitskaya told NBC News early on Tuesday she was not affiliated with the Russian government and had passed no information.   In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently,  Trump Jr. said in an interview on Fox News.  For me, this was opposition research.  Collusion itself is not an actual crime under the U.S. criminal code, so prosecutors would look to see if Trump Jr.'s conduct ran afoul of a specific law, legal experts said. Moscow has denied interference in the U.S. election, and President Donald Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia. Alan Futerfas, Trump Jr.'s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.  Federal Election Campaign Act FILE PHOTO: Donald Trump Jr. (L) with Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio U.S. July 20, 2016.Jim Young/File photoOne law that might come into play is the Federal Election Campaign Act, which makes it illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. The campaign is also prohibited from soliciting such contributions. A contribution does not have to be monetary in nature, according to Paul S. Ryan, an attorney with watchdog group Common Cause. He said incriminating information about Clinton could be considered a contribution under the act. Ryan said Trump Jr.'s  enthusiastic response  to the offer for information and particularly his proposal in his email to have a follow-up call the next week constituted  solicitation.    That to me is an indication, a concession by Donald Trump Jr. that he wants and is requesting this information,  Ryan said.  Joshua Douglas, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, said Trump Jr.'s emails made it  more plausible  that there could be a criminal case against him. James Gardner, an election law expert at the University of Buffalo Law School, said the election law was intended to target donations of cash or goods and services. He said he did not believe Trump Jr. would have violated the law if he solicited damaging information about Clinton.  A federal law known as the general conspiracy statute that makes it illegal to conspire to commit a crime against or defraud the United States could also come into play if, for example, Trump Jr. tried to help Russians hack into U.S. computer networks. There was no indication that Trump Jr. did such a thing. Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School who was  associate counsel in the White House Counselâ€™s Office under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said he thought Trump Jr.â€™s agreeing to meet with someone to discuss an illegal act would be enough to trigger a conspiracy charge.  â€œItâ€™s a very powerful tool,â€� he said.

Keller added that Governor Susana Martinez decided the assets would be removed from state university balance sheets.  Weâ€™re hopeful that thereâ€™s not a material impact on the universities, but that will really be up to rating agencies and their respective accounting firms that make that decision,  Keller said. The governor's office did not respond to phone or email queries from Reuters.

Britain's Start Network, which includes 42 leading aid agencies such as Oxfam, Care International and Save the Children, has teamed up with social enterprise start up Disberse to use blockchain, the network said.  This exciting partnership could lead to the transformation needed in the way money flows through the humanitarian system,  said Sean Lowrie, director of Start Network, in a statement.  (It) could catalyze a new way of working, one that is transparent, fast and which drives accountability to taxpayers and those affected by crises.  Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralized authority. It has become a key technology in both the public and private sectors, given its ability to record and keep track of assets or transactions without the need for middlemen. The new Disberse platform will use the blockchain technology to ensure that less money is lost to banking fees, poor exchange rates and currency fluctuations, Start Network said. Fraud is also a major issue within the international aid system. In 2012, former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said 30 percent of all U.N. development assistance was lost to corruption. As blockchain automatically records transactions on a secure ledger, donors can easily follow the money lowering the risk of financial misuse.     A UK-based charity  Positive Women  has already completed a pilot project using the Disberse platform to reduce its transfer fees to educational projects in Swaziland. Aid was sent from Britain to four Swaziland schools, via a local aid group, and the savings made by using the Disberse platform enabled Positive Women to fund an additional three students' fees for a year.    We normally use our bank to transfer funds, but transfers have become increasingly expensive and slow. Using Disberse, we saved 2.5 per cent (on fees), which covered the costs of a year's education for an additional three girls,  said Sarah Llewellyn, director of Positive Women. The new partnership using the blockchain technology will now scale up to work on a series of small disbursements within Start Network's existing programs over the next six months.

The annual exercises named Malabar are being held off India. They are the largest since India and the United States launched the exercise in 1992. Japan was later included.  Malabar 2017 is the latest in a continuing series of exercises that has grown in scope and complexity over the years to address the variety of shared threats to maritime security in the Indo-Asia Pacific,  the U.S. Pacific command said. Military officials say the drills involving the U.S. carrier USS Nimitz, India's lone carrier Vikramaditya and Japan's biggest warship, the helicopter carrier Izumo, are aimed at helping to maintain a balance of power in the Asia-Pacific against the rising weight of China.  The three countries have been concerned about China's claims to almost all of the waters of the South China Sea, and more broadly, its expanding military presence across the region. Chinese submarines, for example, recently docked in Sri Lanka, an island just off the southern tip of India that it has long seen as squarely in its back yard. The maritime drills are taking place as India and China are locked in a standoff on their land border in the Himalayas.  The U.S. Pacific command said in a statement the exercises would help the three countries operate together and it was learning how to integrate with the Indian navy. India and the United States were for decades on opposite sides of a Cold War divide but have in recent years become major defense partners. China has in the past criticized the exercises as destabilizing to the region.  India this year turned down an Australian request to join the exercises for now, for fear that would antagonize China further. The Indian navy said the exercises would focus on aircraft carrier operations and ways to hunt submarines. The navy has spotted more than a dozen Chinese military vessels including submarines in the Indian Ocean over the past two months, media reported days ahead of Malabar.  Naval co-operation between India, US and Japan epitomizes the strong and resilient relationship between the three democracies,  India's defense ministry said in a statement. The border stand-off on a plateau next to the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim, which borders China, has ratcheted up tension between the neighboring giants, who share a 3,500 km (2,175 miles) frontier, large parts of which are disputed.

The new Xeon Scalable Processor chips provide far greater support for next-generation computing applications such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars, said Naveen Rao, vice president of Intel's artificial intelligence products group, in an interview with Reuters. The chips are aimed at companies including Alphabet's Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc  and others that operate data centers with thousands of computers, both to power their own services and to provide computing horsepower for customers who don't want to own and maintain their own computer systems.  Google Cloud Platform was the first data center to adopt the new Intel processors. Paul Nash, project manager for Google Compute Engine, called the deal an  expansion and deepening of our partnership  with Intel. But Intel will face stiff competition from historic rival AMD, which recently launched its own next-generation data center processor. The big Internet companies are also doing more of their own hardware design and experimenting with chips based on technology from ARM Holdings and others, partly as a way of pushing Intel to keep prices in line. Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner, said the new Intel processor is a step up from its previous generation with better power efficiency, improvement on artificial intelligence workload and more advanced storage. Reynolds noted that the biggest risk for Intel may be its dependence on a relatively small number of big data center operators.  The challenge now is so much of our their work is going to these big internet guys,  he said, and thus demand for chips is subject to how successful the companies are in the fierce battle for customers who are moving their computing to the cloud.

U.S President Trump took a more conciliatory tone at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday, but he has expressed some impatience that China, with its close economic and diplomatic ties to Pyongyang, is not doing enough to rein in North Korea. That feeling has become particularly acute since Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe could have the range to reach Alaska, and parts of the U.S. West Coast. Asked about calls from the United States, Japan and others for China to put more pressure on North Korea, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said it was not China ratcheting up tension and the key to a resolution did not lie with Beijing. Related CoverageU.S. THAAD missile defenses hit test target as North Korea tension rises Recently, certain people, talking about the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, have been exaggerating and giving prominence to the so-called 'China responsibility theory,'  Geng told a daily news briefing, without naming any parties.  I think this either shows lack of a full, correct knowledge of the issue, or there are ulterior motives for it, trying to shift responsibility,  he added. China has been making unremitting efforts and has played a constructive role, but all parties have to meet each other half way, Geng said. The intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 is seen in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 5, 2017. KCNA/via REUTERS Asking others to do work, but doing nothing themselves is not OK,  he added.  Being stabbed in the back is really not OK.  While China has been angered by North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests, it also blames the United States and South Korea for worsening tension with their military exercises. China has been upset with the U.S. deployment of an advanced anti-missile system in South Korea too, which it says threatens its own security and will do nothing to ease tensions.  Additionally, Beijing has complained about Washington putting unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals for their dealings with North Korea. Geng questioned how China's efforts could bear fruit if, while it tried to put out the flames, others added oil to the fire, and if, while it enforced U.N. resolutions, others harmed its interests. Everyone needed to accept their responsibilities to get the North Korea issue back on the correct track of a peaceful resolution through talks, he added.

The new Xeon Scalable Processor chips provide far greater support for next-generation computing applications such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars, said Naveen Rao, vice president of Intel's artificial intelligence products group, in an interview with Reuters. The chips are aimed at companies including Alphabet's Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc  and others that operate data centers with thousands of computers, both to power their own services and to provide computing horsepower for customers who don't want to own and maintain their own computer systems.  Google Cloud Platform was the first data center to adopt the new Intel processors. Paul Nash, project manager for Google Compute Engine, called the deal an  expansion and deepening of our partnership  with Intel. But Intel will face stiff competition from historic rival AMD, which recently launched its own next-generation data center processor. The big Internet companies are also doing more of their own hardware design and experimenting with chips based on technology from ARM Holdings and others, partly as a way of pushing Intel to keep prices in line. Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner, said the new Intel processor is a step up from its previous generation with better power efficiency, improvement on artificial intelligence workload and more advanced storage. Reynolds noted that the biggest risk for Intel may be its dependence on a relatively small number of big data center operators.  The challenge now is so much of our their work is going to these big internet guys,  he said, and thus demand for chips is subject to how successful the companies are in the fierce battle for customers who are moving their computing to the cloud.

Google said in March that it was investigating Symantec's failure to properly validate its certificates, which confirm that websites can be trusted. Symantec has called Google's claims  exaggerated and misleading.  Symantec is in talks with a small number of companies and private equity firms about the potential sale, three sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. There is no certainty that a deal will occur, the sources added. Symantec declined to comment. A representative for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Symantec acquired most of its web certification business in 2010, when it paid $1.28 billion to buy Verisign Inc's security business. The unit has about $400 million in revenue, according to one of the sources. Chief Executive Greg Clark has been transforming Mountain View, California-based Symantec by jettisoning slow-growth units and spending billions of dollars on acquisitions. It has been moving away from services that are more commoditized, selling its data storage business Veritas in January 2016 to private equity firm Carlyle Group LP for $7.4 billion. Symantec completed its $2.3 billion acquisition of LifeLock Inc in February, a move that will bolster its consumer security business. That followed the purchase of Blue Coat Inc for $4.65 billion in August 2016, which expanded its product line for large corporations. (Reporting by Liana B.

Speaker Rodrigo Maia of the Democrats Party, who would become the interim president should Temer step aside, said Brazil  cannot wait  for resolution of the first charge among several expected to be brought against Temer.   We need to make a decision, to give a response to the prosecutor general's charge, so that we can continue voting on our agenda, and our agenda is the (economic) reforms,  Maia told journalists.  Temer was charged last month in connection with a graft scheme involving JBS SA, the world's biggest meatpacker. Executives said the president took bribes to resolve tax matters and facilitate loans from state-run banks. Temer has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Under Brazilian law, two-thirds of the lower house of Congress must vote to allow a criminal charge against a sitting president to move to the Supreme Court. The vote could happen this Friday or possibly be delayed until early August, after a congressional recess. A swift vote on the charge is seen by many in Brasilia as a way to block prosecution of Temer while his hand is stronger in Congress, before any further plea bargains by jailed politicians and executives bring fresh allegations to light. Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot alleged in the charge that Temer made deals under which JBS would have paid him 38 million reais ($11.5 million) over the next nine months.     Janot has said he will likely charge Temer in the coming weeks with racketeering and obstruction of justice. If the top court accepts a charge and puts the president on trial, he would be suspended for 180 days and replaced by Maia on an interim basis. In interviews with Reuters this week, six key lawmakers both in Temer's coalition and in the opposition said on condition of anonymity that they think the president can muster the votes to block the first charge against him in a vote this week. However, the congressmen also said that a delayed vote or an accumulation of charges from Janot could erode the president's support in Congress.

The bill, which modernizes some labor laws dating back to the 1940s, was passed in a 50 to 26 vote following approval in the lower house of Congress and will be sent to Temer to be signed into law.     The changes, which were opposed by trade unions, give more leeway toÂ collective bargaining and reduce the scope for legal action in labor disputes in Latin America's largest economy. Remote work will become regulated and companies will get more flexibilityÂ to allocate work hours and vacation time. Approval of the labor reform in the Senate did not necessarily mean Temer held enough support in the lower house to avoid being suspended from office later this month to be tried for corruption. However, it showed continued support in his multiparty coalition for an economic agenda that investors see as crucial to reviving Brazil's economy.     Under the labor bill, labor union dues, currently mandatory, will become voluntary. The bill also gives more flexibility for part-time work and temporary contracts.  We've raised our forecasts for job growth in coming years after we started to expect the labor reform approval,  said Alessandra Ribeiro, an economist with TendÃªncias Consultoria. Opposition senators talk in the dark after the lights were switched off following the adjournment by Senate President Eunicio Oliveira of a plenary session for a vote on labor reform, in Brasilia, Brazil July 11, 2017.Adriano Machado The changes will make the job market more flexible and above all they will lower the risks associated with new hires.   Unions said the changes reduced job security while weakening their organizing power by eliminating mandatory union dues.  None of us senators campaigned in our districts in favor of a labor reform,  Workers Party senator Gleisi Hoffmann said on the Senate floor Tuesday during a failed opposition attempt to obstruct the vote.  None of you here was mandated to vote this reform.  Slideshow (2 Images)Some senators within the ruling coalition also opposed some parts of the bill but agreed to pass the proposal exactly as approved by the lower house after Temer vowed to make a few small changes by provisional decree.  Many of Temer's proposals for the economy, including planned auctions for oil licensing rights and transport concessions, have remained on track despite the political crisis. The government initiative most likely at risk, according to lawmakers, was a proposed overhaul of the social security system. It requires a supermajority of votes in both chambers of Congress to change the constitution.     Temer was charged last month with taking multimillion-dollar bribes, but the lower house of Congress must now vote on whether to allow the Supreme Court to try the conservative leader.  He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and refuses to resign despite polls showing his government's approval rating is in the single digits.

Forestry products are a significant driver of the economy of British Columbia, which bills itself as the world's biggest exporter of softwood lumber, a product targeted by U.S. tariffs in April as a trade dispute escalated. Fires across the western province intensified last Friday and have since covered more than 38,000 hectares (93,900 acres). They have forced more than 14,000 people from their homes, disrupted mining and forestry operations and damaged public utilities. Wood prices can rise as high as 6 percent if operations remain shut for weeks, but the higher cost, a small part of construction budgets, will be absorbed by builders and is unlikely to affect home buyers, Bank of Montreal analyst Ketan Mamtora said in an interview. Walter â€ŽBramsleven, an official of the BC Log and Timber Building Industry Associationâ€Ž, said he expects higher prices, but said the fires could also represent an opportunity if the province grants access to the burned wood in the region before it starts rotting. Forestry companies that have suspended production include West Fraser Timber Co and privately held Tolko, among the largest Canadian producers, and Norbord Inc, the world's largest maker of oriented strand board, a plywood-like material used in house building. Mamtora said West Fraser's shutdown represents a loss of about 6.7 percent of interior British Columbia's lumber production and 13.8 percent of Canada's plywood production, while Norbord's shut mill represents 5.6 percent of Canadian production of oriented strand board. The companies said the facilities were shut due to evacuation orders and nearby fires, although the sites themselves were not burned. James Armstrong of Armstrong Investment Research said the shutdowns will exacerbate the low supply for an already tight market.  The question is what happens longer term,  he said.  We don't know what happens with the fire yet. Longer term, if it misses the mill ... it probably won't have a huge impact.  Mamtora said prices could increase up to 14 percent if the sites remain shut for months. The fires broke out some 14 months after a wildfire in Fort McMurray in neighboring Alberta province displaced 88,000 people and burned 590,000 hectares. British Columbia on Friday declared its first state of emergency since 2003.

Three-putts will present an acute danger on the large, fast and sloping greens for the 156-player field gathered for the year's third major.  The greens will be the biggest part of this golf course,  former world number one Lydia Ko said on Tuesday.  The greens are really big here ... just because you're on the green doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be an easy two-putt or a birdie.  So, I think getting the speed right, because you might be a long distance away, I think that's going to be super important.  The 6,732-yard rolling layout is framed by graduated rough with the second cut grown to four inches, but players are somewhat accustomed to that in majors and generous fairways should help them stay out of the long grass most of the time. The greens, however, pose a different test.  More than half of them stretch over 40 yards long,  championship director Shannon Rouillard, adding that they would likely be presented at a lightning-fast speed. Two-time champion Park In-bee, who won the crown in 2008 and 2013, said the greens could determine the winner.  You have to avoid three-putts because you'll be putting from far away from the holes here,  the South Korean former world number one said.  Some sloping greens and downhill putts can be very, very quick here.  Current world number one Ryu So-yeon, acknowledged as one of the best ball-strikers in the game, said she could be lifted by the confidence gained with the putter over the last year while working with former British Open champion Ian Baker-Finch.  When I first met Ian Baker-Finch I told him, 'I'm the worst putter in the world, I'm putting really bad, I really need your help.'   He was like, 'you know what So-yeon, your stroke is perfect. You don't need to think you are the worst putter in the world. Your putting stroke is awesome. You just need to trust yourself and enjoy your moment on the greens.â€™  Ryu said she had been her own worst enemy.  If I look back, I was definitely a bit afraid of getting on the green because even after I hit a really great shot, (for a) four-foot birdie putt or six-foot birdie putt, what if I'm going to miss it?  she said.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) has accused the nation's  toshin  investment funds of charging high fees, delivering poor returns and pushing investors from one trendy product to the next to generate fees. It hopes that inviting internet writers to meetings with investors can help spread its message further than via traditional media and so influence the  toshin  fund industry to change. Persuading Japanese to move their savings out of bank accounts and government bonds and into riskier assets is vital for reinvigorating Japan's long-sluggish economy and financing the retirements of its rapidly ageing people, government and financial experts say. But that is less likely to happen so long as investors receive poor service and low returns from fund managers.  Fund distributors have gotten their asset-management subsidiaries to create products that help themselves make money, ignoring customer needs,  wrote 44-year-old blogger Kenichi Minase, who joined a recent meeting of bloggers, investors and FSA officials. Bloggers go by pseudonyms in Japan and the FSA did not require them to give their real names at the meetings. Minase is one of Japan's best-known bloggers among retail investors and his blog has been viewed 41 million times since January 2016. He declined to be identified other than by his pseudonym.  That led to creation of too many small toshin and churning of funds,  he wrote.  I think the industry's sin is grave. We need to have a system where the industry takes into account not only their own interest but also investorsâ€™ interest.  A lack of attractive investment trusts, critics argue, partly explains why Japanese keep more than half of their 1,800 trillion yen ($16 trillion) in personal financial assets in bank accounts generating virtually no interest, rather than in shares and other investments that would reap higher returns. Individuals hold barely 10 percent of their total assets in stocks, with less than 6 percent in  toshin  funds. In the United States, households have 35 percent of their financial assets in stocks and 11 percent in mutual funds, according to Bank of Japan and U.S. Federal Reserve data. Motoyuki Yufu (2nd L), Deputy Director-General of Planning and Coordination Bureau at Financial Services Agency (FSA), and other FSA staff members hold a meeting with investors and influential bloggers at FSA in Tokyo, Japan June 29, 2017. Picture taken June 29, 2017.Issei KatoThe FSA broadside was delivered in a speech in early April by Commissioner Nobuchika Mori, who said about 280 active Japanese stocks funds over the last 10 years had returned an average of 1.4 percent after deducting fees. He said a third had made losses, while the benchmark Nikkei share average produced annual gains of 3 percent during that period. Mori's speech hit a nerve. Japan's investment trusts that month saw their first net outflow of funds in six months, data from the Japan Investment Trusts Association showed. The association's vice chairman, Yoshio Okubo, said the organization was studying the challenges facing funds and asset managers and was seeking to strengthen governance.  We take the FSA's criticism seriously,  he said.  But some of its comments, such as those on churning and aggressive selling of funds with monthly dividends, have more to do with sales agents rather than fund management companies.  Slideshow (3 Images)Satoshi Nojiri, head of Fidelity Investor Education Institute at FIL Investments Japan, said the FSA is right to promote  a shift to wealth development from savings  but said it was not clear what the authorities are seeking to do by inviting in the bloggers.  It would be better to include the financial industry as well so both investors and the industry can move ahead hand in hand.  The FSA regularly meets with financial professionals and other experts and began its  grassroots blogger project  in April by reaching out to individual investors and the internet writers.  This project is ground-breaking for us - we normally don't do this,  said Motoyuki Yufu, deputy director-general at the agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau.  We decided to try this new approach as we felt that communication through existing channels such as mass media has its limits, and that bloggers' influence is powerful and this could be a major channel of communication.  The FSA has adopted some of the bloggers' opinions as policy, officials said, such as the criteria funds need to meet to be eligible for a new type of Nippon Individual Savings Accounts, or NISAs, the equivalent of Britain's tax-free ISAs.  Some FSA officials may have thought of us as a bit dodgy at first,  said 38-year-old investment blogger Mushitori Kozou, who declined to be identified beyond his pseudonym.  But we have things to say. I'm glad that the FSA is listening to us.

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory business and Western Digital is among the bidders. In a sign of high tensions around the deal, Toshiba threatened to lock Western Digital out of shared databases and quit sending chip samples. Western Digital sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court saying that its joint venture with Toshiba means Toshiba must get its consent for a sale. It asked the court for two separate orders: An injunction to stop the sale, and a temporary restraining order forcing Toshiba to give its workers access to shared databases. A judge granted the temporary order for access to the shared databases Tuesday and set a further hearing on July 28.  We welcome the decision of the court, which we believe validates our position,  Western Digital said in a statement. Toshiba plans to appeal the ruling, which it believes essentially provides Western Digital access to technical information until the July 28, the company said in a statement.  This is a proceeding with many rounds and many rulings, and while we are disappointed with the judge's ruling, it doesn't forecast the outcome of this proceeding or those to come,  Toshiba said in the statement. A hearing on the injunction to stop the sale is set for Friday. Despite the legal tensions between them, Toshiba and Western Digital resumed talks this week.

With only a third of the country's 60 million people connected to the grid and major cities experiencing blackouts, finding investors is tough for Myanmar and it is now looking at options, from coal to deep-sea gas, to boost its power supply. Myanmar has reserves of natural gas, but most existing offshore production is exported under agreements struck during the junta era, while new blocks will not come on stream for some years. Coal would be one of the quickest ways to ramp up power generation but, as protests against the proposed 1,280 megawatts (MW) project in the eastern Kayin state show, the option is unpopular in Myanmar. More than 100 activist groups across the country have signed a joint statement calling for the project to be canceled and urging the government to look at renewable energy instead.   They are worried about their land and water, which would be affected by the coal-fired plant,  said Kayin-based activist Nan Myint Aung, referring to residents in the area who mostly depend on agriculture. Attracting investment is crucial for Suu Kyi, who has made job creation one of her top priorities. Foreign direct investment has fallen 30 percent from the previous year to $6.6 billion in 2016/17 due to sluggish progress on retooling the economy after decades of military rule. Myanmar aims a more than fourfold increase in its electricity generation of over 23,500 MW by 2030 to meet rising demand, a target experts said will be difficult to achieve - particularly, they say, if policy remains confused. Uncertainty Over Energy Mix The Kayin state project, which is still awaiting approval from the authorities, is among the 11 planned coal-fired plants in Myanmar and, by itself, would increase the country's current electricity production by 25 percent, official data shows. But it is uncertain how many of those projects will go ahead. The former quasi-civilian government led by President Thein Sein had to stall more than 10 coal projects across the country due to opposition on environmental grounds. Some western experts advising the government also oppose the solution, arguing that importing coal - which is not abundant in Myanmar - would mean an outflow of dollars from a country with tiny reserves of hard currency.

Picture taken February 6, 2017.Soe Zeya Tun -Officials have previously said they were looking to increase the share of hydro power in the country's energy mix. Most of its 49 planned hydropower projects have stalled, however, amid a lengthy dispute with China over the building of the Myitsone mega dam. An electricity master plan has been under review since last year, but the government has yet to reveal details. Several energy officials said the share of coal and gas could be increased at the expense of hydro.  International investors would like to see more clarity on energy policy. It is presently very difficult to say exactly what Myanmar's energy plans are,  said Jeremy Mullins, researcher at Yangon-based consulting firm Frontier Myanmar.  Slideshow (7 Images) Dilemma of Coal  Kayin's energy minister, Soe Hlaing, told Reuters that the government would go ahead with the project if there was  enough public support.  He did not elaborate.  Residents and environmentalists say the risks the plant in Kayin could pose to the environment and the livelihoods of local people are not being properly investigated. A feasibility study on the environmental and social impact will be ready later this year before the final decision from the energy ministry, local authorities said. Thailand-based TTCL Public Company Ltd, developer of the project, said it would build a high-efficiency low-emissions station with advanced  clean coal  technology to mitigate environmental impact. Coal currently generates just 1 percent of Myanmar's electricity.  Win Htein, one of the top leaders from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, said alternatives such as hydropower would take time and coal was ideal for the country's urgent energy demand.  If we have to choose between the dilemma of coal and the development of the country, we prioritize the development,  he said.

Twenty-one percent of streaming viewers ages 18 to 24 said they had accessed at least one digital video service such as Netflix Inc, HBO Now or Hulu by using log-in credentials from someone outside their household at some time. Overall, 12 percent of adults said they did the same thing.       Infographic ID: '2sUQIYJ'             Subscription revenue is likely to come under scrutiny starting next week when TV industry players begin reporting quarterly earnings. Netflix, the dominant streaming service, releases its results on Monday.  Up to now, Netflix and other streaming networks have accepted some password-sharing, but they may face pressure from investors to change course if new sign-ups slow substantially, Wall Street analysts said. Revenue growth at Netflix is projected to drop from 31 percent in this year's second quarter to 19 percent in the second quarter of next year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   If Netflix goes from a 30 percent revenue growth story to a 10 percent story, there is absolutely going to be more focus on their leaving money on the table,  said Justin Patterson, an analyst with Raymond James.  Netflix declined to comment.  Respondents to the Reuters/Ipsos survey said they borrow passwords to save money on video subscriptions, which can be cheap on their own but add up with multiple services.  Donielle Bradshaw, a live-in nanny in Smyrna, Georgia, said she uses her 28-year-old sister’s password for Hulu, and her 32-year-old brother’s password for Netflix.   I feel like since we are family, it’s OK,  said the 22-year-old Bradshaw, who estimates she watches four hours of shows on weeknights and 10 hours a day on weekends.    If companies cracked down on password sharing, Bradshaw said she would be willing to pay for her own Netflix subscription but is not sure about Hulu, which is owned by several media companies.  I binge a lot of shows on Netflix. I don’t think I could do without it,  she said.  Companies say they accept some sharing as a way to promote their programming to potential customers, but they also take steps to curtail blatant freeloading.  The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., January 18, 2017.Mike BlakeMany networks limit the number of people who can watch programming at the same time. Netflix, for example, allows two to four simultaneous streams per subscription, depending on the plan, and charges more for the higher number of streams.  HBO, a unit of Time Warner Inc, actually encourages younger viewers to use its HBO Now and HBO Go services for free by offering it to about 100 U.S. colleges and universities.    For us it’s more important that at that age where they are not financially independent quite yet, they are habituating to using the product to ultimately aspiring to becoming paid customers,  Bernadette Aulestia, executive vice president of global distribution, said in an interview.  Netflix executives also have said they know some viewers share passwords.  FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is pictured on a television remote in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., on January 18, 2017.Mike Blake/File Photo We could crack down on it, but you wouldn't suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,  Netflix Chief Financial Officer David Wells said at a Goldman Sachs conference last September.  Missing a Chance  Industry analysts say companies are missing a chance to grow revenue. An analysis by Parks Associates estimated streaming providers will lose $550 million in 2019 from password sharing.   There has been this kind of cavalier attitude about it,  Parks Associates analyst Glenn Hower said.  It hasn't been a priority.   Companies could crack down if they want. Cisco Systems Inc, for example, sells products that can detect abnormal activity on an account such as an unusual time or place, said Conrad Clemson, Cisco's senior vice president and general manager of service provider platforms and applications.  Cisco's customers, which include streaming services and pay TV distributors, decide whether to use the information simply for monitoring or take additional steps such as sending a warning to account holders or shutting down an account, he said.   A lot of service providers and content providers are very much in the experimental phase right now,  he said.  Streaming providers say they do track account use but have provided few specifics.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States from June 8 to June 26. It gathered responses from 4,453 adults, including 3,557 people who said they streamed video from their cable TV provider or from standalone services like Amazon Prime, Hulu or Netflix.

Politico said sources in the White House, the Treasury Department and on Capitol Hill said that if Cohn decides he wants the job, he is likely to get it.  It's Gary's if he wants it, and I think he wants it,  Politico quoted one Republican whom it said was close to the selection process as saying. A few Senate Republicans may express reservations about Cohn but he would probably receive widespread support, a senior congressional Republican aide said, according to Politico.  In response to a query from Reuters, White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said: â€œGary is focused on his responsibilities at the NEC.â€�  Cohn, a Democrat and former Goldman Sachs president, did not work on Trump's campaign and only got to know him after the November election. Yellen took over from Ben Bernanke as Fed chair in February 2014 with the U.S. economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis still on shaky ground. She has made no secret she puts a priority on growth in jobs and wages and a broad recovery in U.S. household wealth. Yellen begins two days of congressional testimony on Wednesday on the Fed's semi-annual report on the state of the U.S. economy. Under her leadership the Fed has pared the massive stimulus it put in place to counteract the 2007-2009 financial crisis and begun raising interest rates. Later this year Yellen expects to begin trimming the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet in a gradual and predictable manner.  The Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen speaks during a discussion at The British Academy President's Lecture in London, Britain, June 27, 2017.Hannah McKay I do think the Fed's trying to set a course toward normalization that won't be knocked out by a new Fed chair,  said Eric Stein, co-director of global income at Eaton Vance. Still, Cohn would be a very different kind of leader than Yellen or her immediate predecessor, Ben Bernanke, both of whom hold doctorates in economics.  Cohn began his career at Goldman as a commodities trader in 1990.   He has more knowledge of financial markets than almost any Fed chair would have and less of a monetary policy background,  Stein said.  During last year's election campaign, Trump accused Yellen of accepting orders from then-President Barack Obama to keep interest rates low for political reasons, and he said he would replace her as Fed chair because she is not a Republican Party member. But in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in April, Trump said Yellen was  not toast  and that he respected her. A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the Politico story.  Yellen has said she plans to serve out her full four-year term as chair, which runs through Feb. 3.  Cohn would join several other Goldman alumni around the Fed policymaking table, including New York Fed President William Dudley, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Monday finalized the new rule banning  mandatory arbitration clauses  requiring consumers to forego class-action suits and instead settle disputes in negotiations overseen by arbitrators frequently hired by companies. The rule immediately ran into fierce opposition by Wall Street and Republicans who control both Congress and the White House. They have long criticized the consumer agency, which is run by a Democrat, Richard Cordray. Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Banking Committee, has already announced he is drafting a resolution to kill the rule. His fellow Republican Senator Pat Toomey, chair of the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, said he is considering a similar step.  Republican lawmakers plan to eliminate the rule, using a law that allows Congress to undo new regulations with simple majority votes in both chambers and a signature from the president. Analysts and consumer advocates have said the agency's rule may survive the Congressional challenge. Still, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is contemplating a legal challenge and Trump administration officials are also looking at ways to kill the rule. Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst for the investment firm Compass Point Research & Trading, said the rule has a slightly better than 50 percent chance of surviving in Congress. Joe Valenti, who tracks the issue for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said the House of Representatives was unified against the rule, which opponents have argued benefits class-action lawyers, not consumers.  It comes down to the Senate,  said Valenti, noting that the rule would survive if only three Republicans in that chamber switched sides. That is possible, said Ed Mierzwinksi, the consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups. He noted that Senate Republicans have struggled to gather enough votes for majorities and the calendar is swollen with pressing legislation and confirmation hearings. In addition, Mierzwinksi said, senators may be leery of appearing to side with Wall Street against consumers. He noted that Wells Fargo & Co used clauses in its account-opening agreements to block customers from suing over its phantom account scandal. Supporters of the rule say mandatory arbitration denies citizens their day in court and is rigged in favor of big firms. They say litigants banding together in a class-action lawsuit have a better chance of getting companies to answer publicly for illegal activities and that fears of such a suit can discourage law breaking. The consumer protection agency wrote the rule after conducting a lengthy, multi-year study of the issue. Opponents of the rule say the study is flawed and that arbitration is cheaper and faster than class-action lawsuits and produces better awards for consumers. Other Challenges The Chamber is exploring a prompt legal challenge to the rule, said Matt Webb, senior vice president for its legal reform institute. Another possible challenge could come from the acting comptroller of the currency, Keith Noreika. He is laying groundwork to invoke an untested provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law that allows the council of the country's top financial regulators to nullify a consumer agency rule if they decide it threatens the safety and soundness of the banking system. Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and former CFPB assistant director, said a lawsuit will probably fail because the law says the agency can restrict arbitration as long as it hews to its study.  He said the Dodd-Frank provision that the comptroller's office is looking at was meant to keep risks to the financial system at bay.   To suggest that this rule would cause a financial crisis is ridiculous on its face,  he said.

The order calls for Colorado to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 26 percent from 2005 by 2025 and lower carbon emissions from the electricity sector by 25 percent, among other goals.  Coloradans value clean air and clean water,  Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper said in a written statement.  Our strong economy is a reflection of how our exhilarating outdoors attracts young entrepreneurs and the talent they need for their businesses.  The vast majority of our residents, and indeed the country, expect us to help lead the way toward a clean and affordable energy future. In this process, we no doubt can address climate change while keeping a priority on household budgets.  California Governor Jerry Brown, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Washington State Governor Jay Inslee in June announced the creation of the climate alliance, seeking to claim the mantle of U.S. leadership in fighting global warming. In withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate accord, Trump said its requirement to cut U.S. emission of carbon dioxide threatened millions of jobs and productivity. The Republican president said he would start a process that could last four years to withdraw from the deal..

With his reputation as a master strategist on the line, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell laid out a timetable for Senate consideration of legislation to fulfill President Donald Trump's campaign promise to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In a departure from Republican orthodoxy on tax-cutting, the legislation likely will retain some of the taxes that were imposed on the wealthy under Obamacare, Senate sources said. But it was unknown whether a revised version of the bill to be announced on Thursday morning can satisfy both moderates and hard-line conservatives in the Republican majority who voiced opposition to a draft unveiled last month on very different grounds. With Trump urging the Senate to act before taking the August break, McConnell pushed back the Senate's planned August recess by two weeks to allow senators more time to tackle the measure that would repeal key parts of Obamacare, as well as pursue other legislative priorities. McConnellâ€™s announcement drove a turn-around in stock prices in afternoon trading on Wall Street after an earlier sell-off, on hopes that a shortened recess could mean progress on the stalled Republican legislative agenda.  A dark mood lingered among some Republicans over the healthcare subject, with party leaders appearing to act because of the need to dispense with healthcare and turn to other issues, among them increasing the U.S. debt ceiling.  I think we've narrowed down now to where we know where the decision points are, and we just have to make those decisions,  Senator John Thune, a junior member of the Republican leadership, told reporters. Leaders were still trying to  figure out how we get to 50  votes, he said. Republicans, who hold 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate, would need 50 votes to pass the bill, with Vice President Mike Pence providing the tie-breaking vote.  I am very pessimistic  about the prospects for Republican healthcare legislation, Chuck Grassley, a senior senator, told Fox News on Tuesday. Another Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, was working on his own healthcare proposal and will unveil it this week, a Graham aide said. Senate Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) attends a new conference following party policy lunch meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. July 11, 2017.Carlos BarriaKeeping Obamacare Taxes McConnell said the plan was to vote on the healthcare bill next week, and said he hoped to have a fresh analysis of the bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office at the start of the week. He did not reveal any of the planned changes to the draft, on which he postponed action last month after it failed to gather enough support. But Senate sources said it is likely that two Obamacare taxes on the wealthy will be kept in place - a 3.8 percent net investment tax and a 0.9 percent payroll tax that helps finance Medicare - which would appeal to moderates who have balked at the prospect of cutting taxes for the wealthy while reducing benefits for the poor.  Obviously that's the direction I think that a lot of our members want to move, is to keep some of those (taxes) in place and be able to use those revenues to put it into other places in the bill,  Thune said, while stressing that no decisions were final. Slideshow (5 Images)Republicans could also retain Obamacare's limit on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry, one Senate source said. It was unclear whether the bill would include a proposal by conservative Republican Ted Cruz that would allow insurers to offer basic low-cost healthcare plans that do not comply with Obamacare regulations. Cruz argues it would help to lower premiums, but critics say it would allow insurers to offer skimpier plans that may not cover essential health benefits while also charging more for more comprehensive, Obamacare-compliant plans. The Senate Republican healthcare bill unveiled last month would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal many of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on individuals who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Democrats are united in opposition to the bill and at least 10 Republicans have said they oppose the existing draft. The House of Representatives passed its own version in May. Moderate Republicans are uneasy about the millions of people forecast to lose their medical insurance under the draft legislation, and hard-line conservatives say it leaves too much of Obamacare intact. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt the most vulnerable Americans.

Stocks fell sharply in late-morning trading after emails disclosed by President Donald Trump's eldest son cited Russian support for his father's 2016 election campaign. The emails referred to a top Russian government prosecutor offering the Republican Trump campaign damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. But the market recovered later as U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a two-week delay in the Senate's August recess to provide more time to work on legislation and approve nominees, signaling prospects of progress on the Republican agenda.  It's a play off hope. We had something that might be negative and now we have something that might be positive,  said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. The Senate's delayed break  says to me there's a commitment to make some of the changes that the markets would like to see,  while Trump Jr's email exchange could put more focus on the Russia-related investigations that have overshadowed the White House, he said. Uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would be able to push through its agenda this year has weighed on the market, especially after repeated delays in getting a new health care bill passed.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Monday finalized the new rule banning  mandatory arbitration clauses  requiring consumers to forego class-action suits and instead settle disputes in negotiations overseen by arbitrators frequently hired by companies. The rule immediately ran into fierce opposition by Wall Street and Republicans who control both Congress and the White House. They have long criticized the consumer agency, which is run by a Democrat, Richard Cordray. Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Banking Committee, has already announced he is drafting a resolution to kill the rule. His fellow Republican Senator Pat Toomey, chair of the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, said he is considering a similar step.  Republican lawmakers plan to eliminate the rule, using a law that allows Congress to undo new regulations with simple majority votes in both chambers and a signature from the president. Analysts and consumer advocates have said the agency's rule may survive the Congressional challenge. Still, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is contemplating a legal challenge and Trump administration officials are also looking at ways to kill the rule. Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst for the investment firm Compass Point Research & Trading, said the rule has a slightly better than 50 percent chance of surviving in Congress. Joe Valenti, who tracks the issue for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said the House of Representatives was unified against the rule, which opponents have argued benefits class-action lawyers, not consumers.  It comes down to the Senate,  said Valenti, noting that the rule would survive if only three Republicans in that chamber switched sides. That is possible, said Ed Mierzwinksi, the consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups. He noted that Senate Republicans have struggled to gather enough votes for majorities and the calendar is swollen with pressing legislation and confirmation hearings. In addition, Mierzwinksi said, senators may be leery of appearing to side with Wall Street against consumers. He noted that Wells Fargo & Co used clauses in its account-opening agreements to block customers from suing over its phantom account scandal. Supporters of the rule say mandatory arbitration denies citizens their day in court and is rigged in favor of big firms. They say litigants banding together in a class-action lawsuit have a better chance of getting companies to answer publicly for illegal activities and that fears of such a suit can discourage law breaking. The consumer protection agency wrote the rule after conducting a lengthy, multi-year study of the issue. Opponents of the rule say the study is flawed and that arbitration is cheaper and faster than class-action lawsuits and produces better awards for consumers. Other Challenges The Chamber is exploring a prompt legal challenge to the rule, said Matt Webb, senior vice president for its legal reform institute. Another possible challenge could come from the acting comptroller of the currency, Keith Noreika. He is laying groundwork to invoke an untested provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law that allows the council of the country's top financial regulators to nullify a consumer agency rule if they decide it threatens the safety and soundness of the banking system. Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and former CFPB assistant director, said a lawsuit will probably fail because the law says the agency can restrict arbitration as long as it hews to its study.  He said the Dodd-Frank provision that the comptroller's office is looking at was meant to keep risks to the financial system at bay.   To suggest that this rule would cause a financial crisis is ridiculous on its face,  he said.

Politico said sources in the White House, the Treasury Department and on Capitol Hill said that if Cohn decides he wants the job, he is likely to get it.  It's Gary's if he wants it, and I think he wants it,  Politico quoted one Republican whom it said was close to the selection process as saying. A few Senate Republicans may express reservations about Cohn but he would probably receive widespread support, a senior congressional Republican aide said, according to Politico.  In response to a query from Reuters, White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said: â€œGary is focused on his responsibilities at the NEC.â€�  Cohn, a Democrat and former Goldman Sachs president, did not work on Trump's campaign and only got to know him after the November election. Yellen took over from Ben Bernanke as Fed chair in February 2014 with the U.S. economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis still on shaky ground. She has made no secret she puts a priority on growth in jobs and wages and a broad recovery in U.S. household wealth. Yellen begins two days of congressional testimony on Wednesday on the Fed's semi-annual report on the state of the U.S. economy. Under her leadership the Fed has pared the massive stimulus it put in place to counteract the 2007-2009 financial crisis and begun raising interest rates. Later this year Yellen expects to begin trimming the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet in a gradual and predictable manner.  The Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen speaks during a discussion at The British Academy President's Lecture in London, Britain, June 27, 2017.Hannah McKay I do think the Fed's trying to set a course toward normalization that won't be knocked out by a new Fed chair,  said Eric Stein, co-director of global income at Eaton Vance. Still, Cohn would be a very different kind of leader than Yellen or her immediate predecessor, Ben Bernanke, both of whom hold doctorates in economics.  Cohn began his career at Goldman as a commodities trader in 1990.   He has more knowledge of financial markets than almost any Fed chair would have and less of a monetary policy background,  Stein said.  During last year's election campaign, Trump accused Yellen of accepting orders from then-President Barack Obama to keep interest rates low for political reasons, and he said he would replace her as Fed chair because she is not a Republican Party member. But in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in April, Trump said Yellen was  not toast  and that he respected her. A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the Politico story.  Yellen has said she plans to serve out her full four-year term as chair, which runs through Feb. 3.  Cohn would join several other Goldman alumni around the Fed policymaking table, including New York Fed President William Dudley, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.

The report came just days after the Iraqi army recaptured the last sectors of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, which Baghdadi's forces overran almost exactly three years ago. Russia's Defence Ministry said in June that it might have killed Baghdadi when one of its air strikes hit a gathering of Islamic State commanders on the outskirts of the Syrian city of Raqqa. But Washington said it could not corroborate the death and Western and Iraqi officials have been skeptical. Reuters could not independently verify Baghdadi's death.  (We have) confirmed information from leaders, including one of the first rank who is Syrian, in the Islamic State in the eastern countryside of Deir al-Zor,  said Rami Abdulrahman, the director of the British-based war monitoring group. In Iraq, U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, said he could not confirm the news. Abdulrahman said activists working with him in Deir al-Zor   had been told by the Islamic State sources that Baghdadi had died, but not when or how. The sources said Baghdadi had been present in the eastern countryside of Syria's Deir al-Zor province in the past three months. Related CoverageU.S. general says cannot confirm if Islamic State's chief deadThe Pentagon said it had no information to corroborate the reports. Kurdish and Iraqi officials also had no immediate confirmation. Baghdadi's death has been announced many times before, but the Observatory has a record of credible reporting on the Syrian conflict. Islamic State-affiliated websites and social media feeds have so far said nothing. The death of Baghdadi, who declared a caliphate governed by Islamic law from a mosque in Mosul in 2014, would be one of the biggest blows yet to the jihadist group, which is trying to defend shrinking territory in Syria and Iraq. The United States put up a $25 million reward for his capture, the same amount as it had offered for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his successor Ayman al-Zawahri. It is not yet known if anybody will claim the bounty.

Family of Preachers Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai in 1971 in Tobchi, a poor area nearÂ Samarra, north of the capital Baghdad. His family included preachers from the ultra-conservative Salafi school of Sunni Islam, which sees many other branches of the faith as heretical and other religions as anathema. He joined the Salafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the year of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, and was captured by the Americans. They released him about a year later, thinking he was a civilian agitator rather than a military threat. It was not until July 4, 2014, that he seized the world's attention, climbing the pulpit of Mosul's medieval al-Nuri mosque in black clerical garb during Friday prayers to announce the restoration of the caliphate.  Thousands of volunteers flocked into Iraq and Syria from around the world to become  Jund al-Khilafa , or soldiers of the caliphate.  At the height of its power two years ago, Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. It claimed or inspired attacks in dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In Iraq, it staged dozens of attacks targeting Shi'ite Muslim areas. A truck bomb in July 2016 killed more than 324 people in a crowded area of Baghdad, the deadliest attack since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  The loss of Mosul and the siege of Raqqa, Islamic State's capital in Syria, by a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led force stripped Baghdadi of the trappings of caliph and made him a fugitive in the desert border area between the two countries.

With only a third of the country's 60 million people connected to the grid and major cities experiencing blackouts, finding investors is tough for Myanmar and it is now looking at options, from coal to deep-sea gas, to boost its power supply. Myanmar has reserves of natural gas, but most existing offshore production is exported under agreements struck during the junta era, while new blocks will not come on stream for some years. Coal would be one of the quickest ways to ramp up power generation but, as protests against the proposed 1,280 megawatts (MW) project in the eastern Kayin state show, the option is unpopular in Myanmar. More than 100 activist groups across the country have signed a joint statement calling for the project to be canceled and urging the government to look at renewable energy instead.   They are worried about their land and water, which would be affected by the coal-fired plant,  said Kayin-based activist Nan Myint Aung, referring to residents in the area who mostly depend on agriculture. Attracting investment is crucial for Suu Kyi, who has made job creation one of her top priorities. Foreign direct investment has fallen 30 percent from the previous year to $6.6 billion in 2016/17 due to sluggish progress on retooling the economy after decades of military rule. Myanmar aims a more than fourfold increase in its electricity generation of over 23,500 MW by 2030 to meet rising demand, a target experts said will be difficult to achieve - particularly, they say, if policy remains confused. Uncertainty Over Energy Mix The Kayin state project, which is still awaiting approval from the authorities, is among the 11 planned coal-fired plants in Myanmar and, by itself, would increase the country's current electricity production by 25 percent, official data shows. But it is uncertain how many of those projects will go ahead. The former quasi-civilian government led by President Thein Sein had to stall more than 10 coal projects across the country due to opposition on environmental grounds. Some western experts advising the government also oppose the solution, arguing that importing coal - which is not abundant in Myanmar - would mean an outflow of dollars from a country with tiny reserves of hard currency. A woman prepares dinner by candlelight in her home in Dala township, outside Yangon, Myanmar February 6, 2017. Picture taken February 6, 2017.Soe Zeya Tun -Officials have previously said they were looking to increase the share of hydro power in the country's energy mix. Most of its 49 planned hydropower projects have stalled, however, amid a lengthy dispute with China over the building of the Myitsone mega dam. An electricity master plan has been under review since last year, but the government has yet to reveal details. Several energy officials said the share of coal and gas could be increased at the expense of hydro.  International investors would like to see more clarity on energy policy. It is presently very difficult to say exactly what Myanmar's energy plans are,  said Jeremy Mullins, researcher at Yangon-based consulting firm Frontier Myanmar.  Slideshow (7 Images) Dilemma of Coal  Kayin's energy minister, Soe Hlaing, told Reuters that the government would go ahead with the project if there was  enough public support.  He did not elaborate.  Residents and environmentalists say the risks the plant in Kayin could pose to the environment and the livelihoods of local people are not being properly investigated. A feasibility study on the environmental and social impact will be ready later this year before the final decision from the energy ministry, local authorities said. Thailand-based TTCL Public Company Ltd, developer of the project, said it would build a high-efficiency low-emissions station with advanced  clean coal  technology to mitigate environmental impact. Coal currently generates just 1 percent of Myanmar's electricity.  Win Htein, one of the top leaders from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, said alternatives such as hydropower would take time and coal was ideal for the country's urgent energy demand.  If we have to choose between the dilemma of coal and the development of the country, we prioritize the development,  he said.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) has accused the nation's  toshin  investment funds of charging high fees, delivering poor returns and pushing investors from one trendy product to the next to generate fees. It hopes that inviting internet writers to meetings with investors can help spread its message further than via traditional media and so influence the  toshin  fund industry to change. Persuading Japanese to move their savings out of bank accounts and government bonds and into riskier assets is vital for reinvigorating Japan's long-sluggish economy and financing the retirements of its rapidly ageing people, government and financial experts say. But that is less likely to happen so long as investors receive poor service and low returns from fund managers.

Minase is one of Japan's best-known bloggers among retail investors and his blog has been viewed 41 million times since January 2016. He declined to be identified other than by his pseudonym.  That led to creation of too many small toshin and churning of funds,  he wrote.  I think the industry's sin is grave. We need to have a system where the industry takes into account not only their own interest but also investorsâ€™ interest.  A lack of attractive investment trusts, critics argue, partly explains why Japanese keep more than half of their 1,800 trillion yen ($16 trillion) in personal financial assets in bank accounts generating virtually no interest, rather than in shares and other investments that would reap higher returns. Individuals hold barely 10 percent of their total assets in stocks, with less than 6 percent in  toshin  funds. In the United States, households have 35 percent of their financial assets in stocks and 11 percent in mutual funds, according to Bank of Japan and U.S. Federal Reserve data. Motoyuki Yufu (2nd L), Deputy Director-General of Planning and Coordination Bureau at Financial Services Agency (FSA), and other FSA staff members hold a meeting with investors and influential bloggers at FSA in Tokyo, Japan June 29, 2017. Picture taken June 29, 2017.Issei KatoThe FSA broadside was delivered in a speech in early April by Commissioner Nobuchika Mori, who said about 280 active Japanese stocks funds over the last 10 years had returned an average of 1.4 percent after deducting fees. He said a third had made losses, while the benchmark Nikkei share average produced annual gains of 3 percent during that period. Mori's speech hit a nerve. Japan's investment trusts that month saw their first net outflow of funds in six months, data from the Japan Investment Trusts Association showed. The association's vice chairman, Yoshio Okubo, said the organization was studying the challenges facing funds and asset managers and was seeking to strengthen governance.  We take the FSA's criticism seriously,  he said.  But some of its comments, such as those on churning and aggressive selling of funds with monthly dividends, have more to do with sales agents rather than fund management companies.  Slideshow (3 Images)Satoshi Nojiri, head of Fidelity Investor Education Institute at FIL Investments Japan, said the FSA is right to promote  a shift to wealth development from savings  but said it was not clear what the authorities are seeking to do by inviting in the bloggers.  It would be better to include the financial industry as well so both investors and the industry can move ahead hand in hand.  The FSA regularly meets with financial professionals and other experts and began its  grassroots blogger project  in April by reaching out to individual investors and the internet writers.  This project is ground-breaking for us - we normally don't do this,  said Motoyuki Yufu, deputy director-general at the agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau.  We decided to try this new approach as we felt that communication through existing channels such as mass media has its limits, and that bloggers' influence is powerful and this could be a major channel of communication.  The FSA has adopted some of the bloggers' opinions as policy, officials said, such as the criteria funds need to meet to be eligible for a new type of Nippon Individual Savings Accounts, or NISAs, the equivalent of Britain's tax-free ISAs.  Some FSA officials may have thought of us as a bit dodgy at first,  said 38-year-old investment blogger Mushitori Kozou, who declined to be identified beyond his pseudonym.  But we have things to say. I'm glad that the FSA is listening to us.

Led by Europe- and San Francisco-based venture capital fund Index Ventures, the fund-raising round was one of the biggest ever Series B rounds in Europe. It should provide some comfort to the British capitol as it jostles to hold onto its reputation as Europe's leading hub for the nascent fintech sector.  The investment dwarfs the 19.5 million pounds ($25 million) raised by London-based rival Monzo in its Series B round earlier this year.   Revolut, which has around 700,000 customers, over 400,000 of them based in Britain, provides payment cards that can be used abroad to pay for goods and services at the exchange rate used by banks anywhere that Mastercard (MA.N) is accepted.  Other start-ups, such as Monzo and Germany's N26, offer similar products, but Revolut says it is distinctive in offering interbank exchange rates, zero-fee international money transfers, and in allowing customers to hold and exchange up to 16 different currencies in their app-based accounts. Revolut was set up in July 2015 by Russian-born Nikolay Storonsky, who first moved to London in 2007 to work for Lehman Bros as a derivatives trader and later also worked for Credit Suisse.   If he were starting the company now, as Britain heads out of the European Union, Storonsky would still choose London as its base, he said.   I donâ€™t see any problems with Brexit,  he told Reuters.  London is much more international than anywhere else in Europe, (and) in terms of regulation, itâ€™s a great place to be.  Some fintech firms are worried about losing  passporting  rights, which give companies licenced in one EU country the right to trade freely in any other. But Storonsky, whose firm has a UK e-money license, said if that happens it would only take a few months to get such a license for the rest of the EU.   Storonsky, 34, said he wanted to set up a business that acted like a bank but had less bureaucracy.   I just don't like banks,  he said.  They're so bureaucratic, with so many managers not really doing anything ... If you fired 80 percent of bankers, nothing would change.   Bitcoin Bet  Revolut also announced that it is adding digital currency bitcoin BTC=BTSP to its app in response to high demand from customers. Users will now be able to hold, exchange, spend and transfer bitcoin the same way they use other currencies. Rival cryptocurrencies Ether and Litecoin will soon be added. Revolut, whose license does not allow it to invest clients' money, gets revenue from commissions paid by merchants, from users who change more than 5000 euros ($5,736) per month and from add-ons such as insurance, which is provided by third parties through the app. It is not yet profitable, but that does not worry its founder.       Itâ€™s normal at this point for a start-up â€“ this is how billion-dollar companies are being made now,  Storonsky said.  The firm had intended on breaking even by November, but it now says that will take longer, because it is using the extra funding to expand the company into the United States and Asia.  Revolut also secured more money from London-based Balderton Capital and Californian Ribbit Capital. The latest cash injection takes its total investment so far to $83 million. It will run a further $5 million crowdfunding campaign this month.

Poloz,CANADA,CENBANK/RATES,Americas,Inflation,Central Banks / Central Bank Events,Corporate Events,Interest Rates / Policy,Economic Events,Bank of Canada,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,Canada","sector":"Markets","content":"OTTAWA, July 11 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in nearly seven years, following the Federal Reserve in a bid to inch rates back towards normal after the global financial crisis a decade ago. The move, considered unlikely as recently as six weeks ago, would make Canada the first major central bank to follow the U.S. central bank in removing the monetary stimulus poured into the global economy in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis. The bid by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to move rates from near-historic lows of 0.50 percent is hotly debated, with the nation facing stronger economic growth but also a cooling housing market, little inflation, and uncertainty about its trade with an increasingly protectionist United States.  Initiating a hiking cycle when core inflation is running at 1.3 percent ... would probably grant Governor Poloz the title of being the most hawkish Bank of Canada governor during the inflation targeting regime,  economists at TD Securities wrote in a research note. Market-watchers have scrambled in recent days to keep up with the increasingly hawkish tone from Poloz, who has signaled a desire to reverse two rate cuts made in 2015 to counter low oil prices. The likely hike comes as central banks are looking to lift rates to give themselves ammunition to fight the next downturn, said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, who expects the bank to wait until October to hike.  The bottom line is we're moving away from crisis-type levels of monetary policy because it's no longer warranted,  Ryan said.  It doesn't mean we're going to yank the punch bowl away, it's just it's time to start taking our foot off the accelerator.  The Fed has hiked rates three times in the last eight months and four times since 2015. While other central banks are not yet tightening, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in late June a rate hike was probably necessary and the bank would debate it in the coming months. Analysts said following the Fed provides a degree of safety.  Absolutely we are insulated, since the huge neighbor to the south has already done so,  said James Laird, president of CanWise Financial.  It doesn't change the spread tomorrow - they (the Fed) are still significantly higher and they still moved before we did.  A rate increase would be the first by Poloz, who took over at the helm of the bank in 2013 after his predecessor Carney went to the Bank of England. The Bank of Canada cut rates eight times under Carney during the financial crisis before hiking three times in 2010 in an aborted attempt to wean the economy off cheap money before the oil crisis forced a return to easing.

Itâ€™s reasonable to assume we generate more revenue than any other European grand prix and we still canâ€™t make the numbers work,  he said on Tuesday after announcing that the BRDC-owned British Grand Prix circuit was breaking its contract. The decision means Britain risks having no race after 2019 unless a revised deal is agreed.  We believe that we run the event quite efficiently and our costs of delivery we think are low,  added Grant.  So the economics of the other European circuits must be equally challenging.  Iâ€™m sure they are asking themselves the same sort of questions that we are asking.  Germany's Hockenheim, which returns to the calendar in 2018 after a year's absence, has struggled financially while Belgium's Spa track and Italy's Monza have also had difficulties. Grant said Silverstone lost 2.8 million pounds ($3.60 million) in 2015, 4.8 million in 2016 and faced a similar loss  from this weekend's race. He blamed the ever-increasing hosting fees for the situation.  The cost of running the event is actually quite small relative to the amount of money it generates. The thing that puts the cost up is the promoterâ€™s fee that we have to pay,  he told Reuters. Formula One's business model under former supremo Bernie Ecclestone was heavily based on annually escalating hosting fees and television revenues. The sport's new owners U.S.-based Liberty Media have said they want to safeguard the traditional European races but Silverstone's move will be seen as a test of that. Grant said the promoter's fee for hosting the British Grand Prix increased by five percent annually, growing from 11.5 million pounds in 2010 to 16.2 million this year. By the final year in 2026, it would be 25 million pounds. That is still a lot less than places like Baku, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, which can count on state funds and attract far smaller crowds, have to pay. Last year's race, a home grand prix for triple world champion Lewis Hamilton and seven of the 10 teams, attracted 139,000 people on the Sunday but Grant said only about 100,000 were paying ticket holders. McLaren executive director Zak Brown has said Liberty should buy Silverstone to secure the race's future but Grant said the BRDC had a duty to fulfill.  We see ourselves as the guardians of British motorsport... so we feel that having the BRDC retain ownership of Silverstone helps to achieve that long-term objective,  he said.  Selling Silverstone is not actually on our agenda at this moment.

The biggest evacuation was in Northern California's Butte County, where the 5,800-acre (2,350-hectare) Wall Fire, which began on Friday, displaced about 4,000 people, officials said.  We're certainly getting to where we're at the peak of fire season conditions,  Cal-Fire Chief Ken Pimlott said in an interview with Capital Public Radio on Tuesday. In the U.S. West, where more than 50 uncontained large fires are burning, temperatures in many locations will top 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) this week with only scattered showers to possibly quell some flames, said meteorologist Brian Hurley of the National Weather Service. Some people displaced by the Wall Fire were allowed to return to their houses on Tuesday, as firefighters held containment lines around 45 percent of the blaze, compared to 35 percent the day before. In Santa Barbara County along California's central coast, about 200 people were under evacuation orders because of the Alamo Fire, named after a creek near where it started on Thursday, said Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover.

The deal follows an investigation that began in 2012 after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration noticed an increased number of thefts and unexplained losses of the opioid pain medication hydrocodone at some CVS stores, according to settlement papers. The settlement came as U.S. authorities continue to grapple with a national opioid addiction epidemic, which has brought increased attention on companies involved in the distribution and production of prescription painkillers.  The Department of Justice is committed to fighting prescription drug abuse, including the alarming rise of prescription opioid abuse that is plaguing the country,  U.S. Attorney Phillip Talbert in Sacramento said in a statement. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to Talbert's office, from April 2011 through April 2013, CVS pharmacies failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances. In addition to paying $5 million, CVS also entered into an administrative compliance plan with the DEA that covers 168 pharmacies in California, Talbert's office said. As part of the settlement agreement, CVS acknowledged that during that time frame, some of its California pharmacies failed to fulfill certain record-keeping obligations under federal law. But CVS contends any record-keeping failure did not cause drugs to be diverted for illegal uses, the settlement agreement said.

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory business and Western Digital is among the bidders. In a sign of high tensions around the deal, Toshiba threatened to lock Western Digital out of shared databases and quit sending chip samples. Western Digital sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court saying that its joint venture with Toshiba means Toshiba must get its consent for a sale. It asked the court for two separate orders: An injunction to stop the sale, and a temporary restraining order forcing Toshiba to give its workers access to shared databases.

Defense Secretary James Mattis, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are advocating for yet another troop increase less than three years after the U.S. officially transferred all security responsibility to the Afghans. But it’s Steve Bannon, the White House’s controversial chief political strategist, whom President Trump should listen to before dispatching his advisers to brief Congress on the strategy in mid-July.  As commander-in-chief Trump has granted the U.S. military tremendous latitude to resource operations as it sees fit. So Trump may not be inclined to overrule the Pentagon's recommendation for 3,000 to 5,000 more American trainers and advisers to support the 8,500 troops. It seems clear, though, that the administration is divided over the decision - and Steve Bannon is the most influential adviser in the White House urging Trump to think twice before deploying those forces. In fact, Bannon may be the only aide among the non-interventionist camp in the White House, which also includes senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who has sufficient access to the president to persuade him to carefully review the military’s request before approving it.  In this case, Bannon, who was removed from the National Security Council in April, is right. One doesn't have to agree with Bannon's world view or nationalist ideology to recognize his logical and pragmatic perception of the war in Afghanistan.   After more than 15 years of combat, the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money, and the ultimate sacrifice of nearly 2,400 U.S. troops, it's tragic that more officials in Washington can't see the war as it is: a chaotic environment full of false hopes, unrealistic promises, and an American inability to come to grips with the impossibility of creating a safe, democratic, and prosperous nation in a country where corruption, violence and patronage determine who wins and who loses.   America's military intervention in Afghanistan was the quintessential example of a war launched on solid moral and strategic grounds. The Taliban regime, after all, harbored al Qaeda, the group behind the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Rooting out al Qaeda from Afghanistan, killing its top leadership, cutting off its financing and ousting the Taliban were all objectives that U.S. liberals and conservatives alike could agree on.   But after the invasion, the U.S. objective switched from destroying al Qaeda in Afghanistan to developing a new government in Kabul from the ground. Because Afghanistan had not possessed a national army or police force since the Soviet-backed government collapsed in the early 1990’s, the U.S. was also put into the position of starting one from scratch. Uprooting al Qaeda’s terrorist infrastructure and supply lines in Afghanistan was diluted from the principal U.S. goal in the country to one of many. Perhaps it was hubris to think that the West could construct a democratic state in the middle of Central Asia, unshackled by corruption and strong enough to keep the militants and warlords at bay. Or perhaps Washington truly believed it could pacify a country that knew nothing but war since the late 1970s. Whatever the reason, Afghanistan translated virtually overnight into a laboratory where the establishment of a presidential system could be tested.    This context is important because the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces have been fighting and dying in Afghanistan to this very day - with little sustainable, strategic success to show for it. It's a policy failure, not a military failure. And as the U.S. should have learned already through two troop surges - the first of which took place in 2007 and the second in 2010-2011 - a policy failure cannot be solved with a few more troops.    The latest quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction shows the war is nowhere close to being over. According to United Nations statistics, 2016 was the bloodiest on record for Afghan security forces and civilians alike. Over a third of the country's districts are either under the control or influence of the Taliban. It's difficult to say U.S. policy is going smoothly when General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, calls the war a stalemate in public testimony to the U.S. Senate. It's even harder when so many “ghost” troops - non-existent soldiers listed by corrupt Afghan officials to obtain additional U.S. taxpayer funding - are on the Afghan army's payroll that Washington can't be certain where its money is going or whether the Afghan security forces are equipped to respond to a crisis.  None of this lies at the feet of the corporal or sergeant on the ground risking their lives. Rather, the blame lies squarely on the policymakers in the national security bureaucracy who still think that the Afghanistan mess can be sorted out if just a few thousand additional soldiers are deployed, or a bigger check is written, or a few more years are dedicated to the mission. The blame should be directed at the generals and officials who fail to ask why 5,000 more trainers, advisers, and special operators will be capable of doing what 140,000 soldiers in the field during the troop surge couldn't. Congress shares the blame for deferring to the generals without asking questions and for failing to understand that military power alone can’t quash an insurgency, especially when those insurgents can cross the border to find safe havens in neighboring Pakistan.   We don’t know yet if Trump will follow the advice of the Mattis trio or his political adviser. But the fact that the president didn’t announce his intentions at the May NATO summit in Belgium suggests that something may have made him think twice on troop deployment. Thanks perhaps to Steve Bannon, the president may be slower to repeat the mistakes of his predecessors - at least when it comes to Afghanistan.    (Daniel R.

Babich,Michael Shea,Natalie Levine,Thomas Gallagher,INSYS,COURT/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - A former Insys Therapeutics Inc sales representative who is married to its former chief executive pleaded guilty on Tuesday to engaging in a scheme to pay kickbacks to medical practitioners to prescribe a drug containing the opioid fentanyl. Natalie Levine, who worked at the Arizona-based drugmaker from 2013 to 2014, entered her plea in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, to one count of conspiring to violate a federal anti-kickback statute, U.S. prosecutors said. The plea marked the latest development in the ongoing investigations of Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray intended for cancer patients that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive and regulated synthetic opioid. Federal prosecutors in Boston in December announced charges against six former Insys executives and managers, including Levine's husband, former Chief Executive Michael Babich, in connection with a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys. Prosecutors said Babich and others led a conspiracy to bribe medical practitioners to unnecessarily prescribe Subsys to non-cancer patients through payments disguised as marketing event and speaker fees. They have pleaded not guilty. Insys has said it is working toward a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. Several other people affiliated with Insys have also faced charges in various states. Levine's lawyer, Thomas Gallagher, had no immediate comment. Babich's lawyer and representatives for Insys did not respond to requests for comment. Prosecutors said that during her time as a sales representative, Levine used a sham speaker program to pay a Connecticut nurse, a New Hampshire physician's assistant and a Rhode Island doctor to prescribe Subsys. While Insys ostensibly designed the speaker program to educate healthcare professionals about Subsys, its primary purpose was in fact to reward healthcare providers who prescribing large amounts of Subsys. Prosecutors said the three medical providers earned thousands of dollars in kickbacks through the speaker events, which were usually just a gathering of friends and co-workers at high-end restaurants, prosecutors said. Under a plea deal, Levine, a resident of Scottsdale, Arizona, agreed not to appeal any sentence of 4-3/4 years in prison or less. U.S. District Judge Michael Shea scheduled her sentencing for Oct. 5. The charges against Levine came after a Connecticut nurse, Heather Alfonso, pleaded guilty in 2015 to having received kickbacks to prescribe Subsys. Federal prosecutors in Connecticut have also charged a former Insys district manager, Jeffery Pearlman, for engaging in a kickback scheme. He has pleaded not guilty.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/insys-court-idUSL1N1K21YO"},

Scott Hamilton, a career diplomat who has served as deputy chief of mission in Havana for two years, will become chief until further notice, the U.S. embassy spokesman in Havana said.  (DeLaurentis') departure is part of the normal rotation cycle of career diplomats,  he said, adding he could not comment on DeLaurentis' next assignment. Some Cuba onlookers had questioned whether DeLaurentis, who led the embassy during the historic U.S.-Cuban detente and restoration of diplomatic ties in July 2015, would stay on under U.S. President Donald Trump.  Trump last month announced a partial rollback of that opening toward Cuba, ordering tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba and a clampdown on U.S. business dealings with the Caribbean islandâ€™s military. DeLaurentis had been U.S. chief of mission in Cuba since August 2014, his third posting in Havana. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, last year nominated the career diplomat to be the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than five decades, but his nomination got stuck in the Republican-controlled Senate.  The president will decide when and if we nominate an ambassador to Cuba or any country,  the Havana U.S. embassy spokesman said.  Should the president decide not to nominate an ambassador, a chargÃ© will be named in accordance with the departmentâ€™s principal officer assignment procedures.

(Reuters) - Small satellites used for observing conditions on the earth are the fastest growing segment of the $260.5 billion global satellite industry, the Satellite Industries Association said in an annual report released on Tuesday. Small satellites, some no bigger than a shoe box, generated an 11 percent jump in annual revenue for Earth imagery in 2016 and a growing share of the 1,459 operating spacecraft that circled the planet at the end of the year, the report said. The orbital fleet includesÂ 499 satellites that weigh up to 1,323 pounds (600 kg), many of them used for Earth observation and remote sensing, said Carissa Christensen, chief executive of Bryce Technology and Space, which wrote the report for the trade association.Â  Satellite services, including home television, broadband and Earth observation services, collectively generated $127.7 billion of revenue in 2016, the biggest single piece of the industry, according to the report.Â  Satellites used for earth imagery accounted for just $2 billion of the total industry but accounted for 11 percent of the sectorâ€™s growth, according to the report. â€œThatâ€™s expected to continue to grow, given the new companies coming into the industry,â€� association President Tom Stroup said in an interview. The report found at least 33 dedicated small satellite launchers in development worldwide, including privately owned Rocket Lab, which debuted its Electron booster in May, and Richard Bransonâ€™s Virgin Orbit, which is expected to fly its LauncherOne rocket this year.Â  Revenue from Earth observation services would have been higher, but the launches of many small satellites were delayed after a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch pad accident in September 2016, the report said.Â  SpaceX, owned and operated by entrepreneur Elon Musk, returned its Falcon fleet to flight in January and has launched 10 times so far this year. In all, 126 satellites were launched last year, including 55 shoe-box-sized spacecraft known as CubeSats. About twice as many CubeSats were launched in 2015, the report said.Â  The number of small satellite launched during the first half of 2017 already has surpassed last yearâ€™s flight rate, Christensen said.  In February, a single Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket put 103 small satellites into orbit, along with a larger Earth-imaging spacecraft called Cartosat.

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory business and Western Digital is among the bidders. In a sign of high tensions around the deal, Toshiba threatened to lock Western Digital out of shared databases and quit sending chip samples. Western Digital sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court saying that its joint venture with Toshiba means Toshiba must get its consent for a sale. It asked the court for two separate orders: An injunction to stop the sale, and a temporary restraining order forcing Toshiba to give its workers access to shared databases. A judge granted the temporary order for access to the shared databases Tuesday and set a further hearing on July 28.   We welcome the decision of the court, which we believe validates our position,  Western Digital said in a statement. Toshiba plans to appeal the ruling, which it believes essentially provides Western Digital access to technical information until the July 28, the company said in a statement.  This is a proceeding with many rounds and many rulings, and while we are disappointed with the judge's ruling, it doesn't forecast the outcome of this proceeding or those to come,  Toshiba said in the statement. A hearing on the injunction to stop the sale is set for Friday. Despite the legal tensions between them, Toshiba and Western Digital resumed talks this week. Toshiba also returned to talks with a group led by Taiwan's Foxconn. The renewed negotiations come after a potential $18 billion sale to Bain Capital and South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) stalled out.

David Wildstein, who helped the government convict two former Christie associates after he pleaded guilty in 2015, is set to be sentenced in federal court in Newark on Wednesday. Wildstein, 55, admitted overseeing a scheme to shut down access lanes at the busy George Washington Bridge in 2013 to create massive traffic gridlock as punishment for a local Democratic mayor who refused to endorse Christie's reelection campaign. U.S. prosecutors charged Wildstein, former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and a former executive of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Bill Baroni, with concocting the plot. The Port Authority supervises operations for the George Washington Bridge, which connects Manhattan and New Jersey and is one of the world's busiest crossings. Christie, who has denied any involvement, was not charged. But the fallout dogged his bid for the Republican nomination for president in 2016 and has contributed to his current record-low approval rating of 15 percent in New Jersey. Wildstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2015 and agreed to cooperate with authorities, eventually appearing as the star witness at Kelly and Baroni's trial for eight days of testimony.  Put simply, were it not for Wildstein's decision to cooperate and disclose the true nature of the lane reductions, there likely would have been no prosecutions related to the bridge scheme,  U.S. prosecutors wrote in arguing that Wildstein should receive probation but no prison time. Kelly and Baroni were sentenced to 1-1/2 and two years in prison, respectively. Wildstein testified at trial that he and Baroni joked with Christie about the traffic jams caused by the lane closures as they were occurring, an assertion that Christie and Baroni both denied. He also told jurors that he and Baroni used the Port Authority as a  goody bag  to dole out favors to local officials in exchange for support for Christie's re-election. In a court submission made public on Tuesday, Wildstein's lawyer also requested probation, noting that Wildstein voluntarily met with investigators at the start of their probe.  Mr. Wildstein remains alone in taking responsibility for his role in the George Washington Bridge lane realignment issue, even though others were clearly involved,  Alan Zegas wrote.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/new-jersey-bridgegate-idUSL1N1K21YC"},

Jio, run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani and his conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), said on Monday it was investigating whether personal data of more than 100 million of its customers had been leaked to a website named  Magicapk.com . The company said it was working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the alleged leak, which cyber security analysts say could be the first large-scale data leak from an Indian telecoms firm. The local police official, who asked not to be named, said Imran Chhimpa was detained on Tuesday in connection with the investigation. He said investigators from Mumbai were due to arrive in the area shortly. The proprietor of a local internet service provider in Sujangarh, where Chhimpa was a customer, confirmed Chhimpa had been detained, adding he had received a query from the police about Chhimpa earlier on Tuesday. In a July 5 post on Frendz4m, an online message board, a person with Chhimpa's Internet Protocol (IP) address and using the handle  imranchhimpa , posted a link to  magicapk.com  saying the site could provide personal user details of anyone with a Jio connection. The post said the data was obtained from original documents. The proprietor of the local internet service provider told Reuters that police asked him for the installation address of that particular IP address, and made him accompany them to Chhimpa's home, where he was later detained. Chhimpa was not immediately reachable for comment, and his phone was switched off. Police declined to comment on whether there were any other suspects in the case at this time. A woman waits at a bus stop with an advertisement of Reliance Industries' Jio telecoms unit in Mumbai, India, July 11, 2017.Danish SiddiquiA spokesman for Jio said there was no immediate comment on the company's own investigation into the alleged leak. Major Breach On Monday, Jio said the data leak appeared to be  unauthentic , and the company's subscriber data was safe and maintained with the highest security. Some Jio users, though, took to Twitter to say they were concerned that personal information on Magicapk.com could be accurate. Some Indian media said their own checks suggested some leaked data were authentic. The Indian Express newspaper said it was able to cross-verify details on a number of Jio customers it knows. The Magicapk.com website showed as  suspended  since late Sunday. Jio launched last September and already boasts over 100 million subscribers after drawing in users with months of free service and now cut-price deals. Analysts said that if the names, contact numbers, email addresses and Aadhaar numbers of all Jio customers were compromised, it would be a major setback for the telecoms industry's new entrant. Many users registered for Jio using a 12-digit Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) number, commonly known as the Aadhaar number.  The government is pushing for Aadhaar numbers to be used in everything from opening a bank account to filing tax returns. The number, which works in a similar way to U.S. Social Security numbers, is unique to each Indian citizen and stores users' biometric data in a centralized database.

The detention of Mohsen Dehnavi, along with his wife and three children, late Monday was unrelated to President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning travelers from six majority-Muslim countries, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Officials at Boston Children's Hospital and an immigration law specialist protested the move, noting that Dehnavi had a valid entry visa.  He and his family are being detained at Logan (and) are supposed to be sent back to Iran later today,  said hospital spokesman Rob Graham, in a statement.  Boston Children's hopes that this situation will be quickly resolved and Dr. Dehnavi and his family will be released and allowed to enter the U.S.  Two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a revised version of Trump's executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, though the court excluded visitors with a  bona fide  family tie. The executive order itself did not apply to travelers with valid visas.  This individual was deemed inadmissible to the U.S. based on information discovered during the CBP inspection for reasons unrelated to the executive order,  Customs said in a statement, adding that all foreigners seeking entry to the United States are evaluated for  health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds.  Susan Church, chair of the New England Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said her group objected:  The rules say if you have a valid visa you have to be let in.  Dehnavi and his spouse and children, the youngest 7 months old, were detained late Monday, Church said in a phone interview. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump had called for a  complete and total shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States, a move he said was necessary to protect national security following attacks at home and abroad by Islamist extremists. Opponents of the idea called it a violation of the U.S. Constitution's protection of free expression of religion. Trump's initial January order, which also applied to Iraq, caused a weekend of chaos at U.S. airports as travelers were turned away upon arriving on U.S. soil and crowds of thousands of people turned out to protest the move.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-boston-idUSL1N1K21Y3"},

Last week U.S. President Donald Trump denounced China's trade with North Korea, saying it had grown almost 40 percent in the first quarter, and cast doubt on whether Beijing was helping to counter the threat from North Korea. Data released in April showed China's trade with North Korea grew 37.4 percent year on year in the first quarter, in spite of a ban on coal imports China announced in February.  This is a distorted picture,  China's ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said in a speech to a Washington think tank on Monday. Cui said bilateral trade declined in 2015 and 2016, and by 41 percent in April and 32 percent in May as a result of the coal import ban. At the same time, Cui stressed that U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea did not constitute an embargo.  Normal trade ... is not banned by these sanctions,  he said. The Chinese embassy released a copy of Cui's speech, originally delivered in an off-the-record setting, on Tuesday. Cui said China backed further U.N. action against North Korea for violations of U.N. resolutions such as nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). He did not though make clear whether China believed North Korea's latest missile test last week, which the United States described as a first ICBM test, was of that type of missile. Diplomats say the United States is aiming for a vote within weeks to strengthen U.N. sanctions on North Korea over the test, but Russia has objected to a Security Council condemnation of the launch as a U.S.-drafted statement labeled it an ICBM. Cui said sanctions were necessary, but could not solve the North Korean problem alone. He repeated a call for Washington to back a Chinese  suspension for suspension  proposal under which North Korea would freeze weapons testing in return for suspension of U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Washington says the exercises are needed to maintain defenses against North Korea and U.S. officials say Beijing could face U.S. economic and trade pressure unless it does more to rein in North Korea.

The report by USA Today, using an unnamed source with direct knowledge of the meeting, said USGA executive director Mike Davis informed the group's executive committee of Trump's threats while on a 2015 conference call.  As a matter of policy, the terms of our contracts with championship host sites are confidential and accordingly the USGA will not comment,  the USGA said in a statement on Tuesday.  We are excited that our U.S. Womenâ€™s Open Championship week has begun and are focused on providing the ultimate test of golf for the best female players in the world.  Calls for moving the 72-hole tournament, which begins on Thursday, followed controversial comments on women made by Trump during his campaign. The day after January's inauguration of President Trump, hundreds of thousands of women filled the streets of several major U.S. cities in mass protests, galvanized by his campaign rhetoric and behavior they found to be misogynistic. Last month a women's advocacy group called UltraViolet protested during the men's U.S. Open in Wisconsin by flying a banner that read:  USGA/LPGA: TAKE A MULLIGAN, DUMP TRUMP.  A local protest is expected to be staged off the Trump National Golf Club grounds at some point during the tournament. The year's third major women's championship features 156 players, including 10 former champions, and will be played on a Tom Fazio-designed course routed through more than 500 acres of rolling farmland and horse pastures.

The Redmond, Washington, technology company proposed using spectrum typically reserved for TV stations to broadcast high-speed internet to underserved U.S. locations. To start, Microsoft will commit to a five-year effort to bring broadband connectivity to 2 million underserved rural Americans. Microsoft, whose products include the Windows operating system, Office 365 productivity suite and Skype video service, hopes other companies and the government will support what it has dubbed the Rural Airband Initiative. However, the plan has attracted opposition from broadcasters who are reluctant to share the airwaves. â€œThis is really all about getting everybody online in rural communities,â€� Brad Smith, Microsoftâ€™s chief legal officer, told Reuters. â€œThat includes consumers, it includes businesses, it includes farmers and agricultural enterprises and it includes schools.â€� Reaching all 23 million underserved rural Americans would cost as much as $12 billion, Microsoft said. Smith said the company will spend whatever it takes to reach the targeted 2 million people. It plans to launch at least 12 projects across 12 states within the next 12 months, and has partnerships with telecom companies including CenturyLink Inc(CTL.N) in Washington state, and hopes for more partners, Smith said.  â€œOur goal is to work with as many people as possible,â€� he said, adding he hopes the Trump Administration will consider government funding for the project as part of an infrastructure bill expected in the fall.  â€œMy sense is that they are focused on a full range of infrastructure needs, including 21st century infrastructure like broadband,â€� Smith said. â€œWe welcome the dialogue.â€� Costly equipment is among the challenges. Microsoft bets costs will come down, but that is not guaranteed. Opposition from broadcasters is also a concern. â€œPolicymakers should not be misled by slick Microsoft promises,â€� said Dennis Wharton, vice president of communications for the National Association of Broadcasters, in a statement.  Forrester analyst James McQuivey called the plan a low-risk, high-reward effort for Microsoft, which might have to spend money in a lobbying fight with broadcasters, but stands to gain millions of new users. â€œIt would only be valuable to Microsoft if the company uses that engagement to build a branded relationship with the customer, moving them to Bing as a search engine, encouraging them to use Office 365, Outlook, and Skype,â€� McQuivey said.

Chile's concessions unit has over $2 billion of tenders scheduled to be published by the end of the year and its director, Eduardo Abedrapo, told Reuters a $600 million tender for Chile's Route 66, known as  The Fruit Highway,  will be published in the coming weeks. Chile, like neighboring Argentina, is trying to attract private investment to improve its ports, roads and airports, and two major candidates in November's presidential election have also pledged to dramatically expand the nation's transport network. Chinese and Korean firms are demonstrating strong interest, Abedrapo said in his office in downtown Santiago, a novelty in a market dominated by Spanish firms such as Sacyr and Abertis as well as domestic companies. That's despite slowing growth and poor business confidence in the South American nation, which has been battered in recent years by low prices for copper, its main export.  I've received a lot of Chinese companies, Korean companies, and also Japanese companies that have come to talk with us,  Abedrapo said.  Sometimes, there's a certain political and economic pessimism in Chile, and what I see is that investors still see a peaceful country, one that continues being a good place to invest, with clear rules.  Public records show Abedrapo met this year with the China Harbor Engineering Co and the China Gezhouba Group Co , as well as South Korea's SK E&C, Posco E&C, and Hyundai. Last year, he met with the China Three Gorges Corp, as well as a Malaysian investors' group. Chile's infrastructure scene is also experiencing a shake-up from the arrival of no-frills, low-cost airlines, such as JetSmart, launched this year by U.S. private equity firm Indigo Partners. While airlines were demanding more amenities at terminals up until a few months ago, Abedrapo said, now the emphasis is on bare-bones arrangements that lower airport fees. As a result, he said, the government would make future airport contracts more flexible to accommodate both traditional and low-cost carriers. Abedrapo added that the government is also considering opening tenders for airport contracts in which the winner would be required to spruce up smaller, nearby airports, such as one in the town of Castro, near the southern city of Puerto Montt.

The Air Canada A320 from Toronto was cleared to land on a runway at the airport just before midnight on Friday, the FAA said in a statement.  But instead, the pilot of flight AC759 inadvertently lined up to land on a parallel taxiway where four planes were waiting to depart.  The Air Canada plane was estimated to have flown over the planes on the taxiway by as little as 100 feet (30 meters), according to a preliminary summary published on Tuesday by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.  Along with the FAA, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident. According to an audio recording of the incident, a United Airlines pilot is heard saying that the Air Canada plane  flew directly over us,  alerting the air traffic controller that the plane was headed toward the taxiway.  The controller took charge, averting what could have been the worst aviation disaster since the collision of two B747 planes in 1977 in Tenerife in the Canary Islands, U.S. pilot and Aero Consulting Experts Chief Executive Ross Aimer said by phone.   An air traffic controller sent the Air Canada jet around,  the FAA said.  The plane made another approach and landed without incident.

The United Nations University (UNU) said financial tools were a powerful means to disrupt the flow of money generated from human trafficking with the illegal industry estimated to be worth about $150 billion a year. As many as 45.8 million people, most of them women and girls, are estimated to be enslaved globally, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by rights group Walk Free Foundation. They are typically forced to work in factories, mines and farms, sold for sex, trapped in debt bondage or born into servitude. Money generated by human trafficking comes from crime and handling those funds can be considered money laundering or, in some cases, financing terrorism, the UNU report said.  Human trafficking is both big business and a serious crime,  said James Cockayne, head of the UNU Office at the United Nations and author of the report, in an accompanying statement.  Disrupting the associated financial flows associated with these crimes will make a powerful contribution to improving these lives and preventing future crimes.  Financial institutions could help identify money couriers as well as so-called  straw men  used to conceal identities and cash-intensive businesses that typically play roles in human trafficking networks, the report said. Risk assessment maps, due diligence procedures, information sharing and protecting whistleblowers are among the tools available to banks, private investors, credit risk agencies, institutional investors and regulators, it said. Obstacles may include laws protecting privacy and confidentiality, technical issues or rules regarding defamation or libel, said the report, entitled  25 Keys to Unlock the Financial Chains of Human Trafficking & Modern Slavery.  In the United States, legislation was introduced in May in Congress that would boost financial regulations to help identify and report trafficking and help deny traffickers access to the financial system.

Three board members of the watchdog known as CVM voted to absolve Petrobras, former Chief Executive Officers JosÃ© Sergio Gabrielli and Maria das GraÃ§as Foster, arguing the company did not act in bad faith.  CVM also exonerated an executive at underwriter Banco Bradesco SA and the bank itself.  Regulators had been investigating whether Petrobras deceived minority shareholders by presenting misleading information to them in the offer, the world's largest ever follow-on stock offering, which took place in September 2010. Tuesday's ruling put an end to an episode that sparked doubts over the company's business model and triggered $100 billion in market value losses that grew with a drop in oil prices and fallout from a massive corruption probe. At the time, Petrobras raised the money to buy the right to exclusively explore a subsea oil area known as pre-salt from Brazil's federal government and help fund a $225 billion, five-year investment plan, the oil industry's largest at the time. Petrobras ended up paying more for the so-called transfer of rights than it fetched from the offering, forcing the company to borrow considerably until it posted two years of consecutive losses. Petrobras is nowadays the world's most indebted major oil firm. Preferred shares (PETR4.SA), the company's most widely traded class of stock, added 2.9 percent to 12.33 reais on Tuesday.    At issue in the case were 50 billion reais ($15 billion) in preferred shares which, according to the offering's prospectus, could be swapped for voting stock should Petrobras pay out dividends in three consecutive years. However, after Petrobras reported a loss of 21.7 billion reais in 2014, new management at the company said that the preferred shares would never have voting rights.  CVM subsequently opened a case to hold those responsible accountable. Last October, CVM rejected a settlement proposal by Petrobras which would have included the payment of over 1 million reais.

The Air Canada A320 from Toronto was cleared to land on a runway at the airport just before midnight on Friday, the FAA said in a statement.  But instead, the pilot of flight AC759 inadvertently lined up to land on a parallel taxiway where four planes were waiting to depart.  The Air Canada plane was estimated to have flown over the planes on the taxiway by as little as 100 feet (30 meters), according to a preliminary summary published on Tuesday by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.  Along with the FAA, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident. According to an audio recording of the incident, a United Airlines pilot is heard saying that the Air Canada plane  flew directly over us,  alerting the air traffic controller that the plane was headed toward the taxiway.  The controller took charge, averting what could have been the worst aviation disaster since the collision of two B747 planes in 1977 in Tenerife in the Canary Islands, U.S. pilot and Aero Consulting Experts Chief Executive Ross Aimer said by phone.   An air traffic controller sent the Air Canada jet around,  the FAA said.  The plane made another approach and landed without incident.

But Miller, who won the title at the course in 1976, said on Tuesday that picking a champion was even tougher than usual in view of the poor form of several of the sportâ€™s biggest names. â€œThe real hot shots in golf, like Dustin Johnson and Rory (McIlroy) and Jason Day... theyâ€™re not on the top of their game right now,â€� Miller said, adding Sergio Garcia, Henrik Stenson, Rickie Fowler and Justin Thomas to that list. â€œSo I don't know what to expect, because majors are a whole different animal but Hideki, I think heâ€™s the best player right now. â€œTournament in and tournament out his bad shots are really good, which is what you need at Birkdale. And I think that he's ready to win.â€� World number two Matsuyama tied for second at the U.S. Open last month behind Brooks Koepka, though he has the added pressure of trying to become the first Japanese to win a menâ€™s major. Miller, speaking on a telephone conference call promoting the Golf Channel and NBC coverage of the Open in the United States, does not think Birkdale is likely to throw up an obscure winner. Eight of the nine previous Opens there were won by multiple major champions and, though Birkdale is not the most famous Open course, it is a strong test, Miller believes. â€œI think Royal Birkdale is one of my favorite courses, especially my favorite links, because we deem it a little fairer, the fairways are a little flatter but the sand dunes are fantastic and very demanding,â€� said the American, who perhaps is a little biased in view of his victory there in 1976. â€œIâ€™m excited to go back there and sort of see if my memory resurrects. I believe it's an accuracy course. The reason why I won the Open in '76 is my caddie literally made me hit a one-iron. I hit a one-iron 12 out of the 14 tee shots.â€� That will not be an option this year, as players no longer carry one-irons. â€œI can see a lot of driving irons and three-woods off the tee like (2016 champion) Stenson did last year,â€� Miller said. While the players will try to keep mistakes to a minimum, Miller will aim to avoid any verbal bogeys in the commentary booth, no easy task he said given the long hours on air. â€œYou've got to keep your wits about you and you've got to be careful what you say nowadays a bit,â€� he said. â€œNot that I'm very careful.

Local residents, merchants and farmers have protested on federal road BR-163 since July 5 against a veto by President Michel Temer of legislation that would reduce the area under protection at a national forest in the region, Brazil's federal highway police (PRF) said. Cereals exporting group Anec said the situation in ParÃ¡ could impact its projections for corn exports. Brazil's northern grains ports could account for 25 percent of total corn and soybean exports this year, according to the government.    Everyday they stage a blockade at some point of the highway. When we get there, they move to another point,  said Ana Rabelo, a spokeswoman for the PRF in ParÃ¡. It was not possible to reach leaders of the protests. Rabelo said the protesters have planned new blockades for at least one week ahead, each day at a different point in the BR-163, which is a key road for trucks carrying soybeans and corn from center-west farms to a trans-shipment hub in Miritituba. From there, the grains are transferred to barges that move them to exporting ports such as SantarÃ©m and Barcarena.  Brazilian soybean industry association Abiove said the protests were impacting grain deliveries at the Miritituba hub, so barges are waiting longer to be filled up.    Commodities traders in Miritituba say they are receiving only small amounts of corn and soybeans,  Daniel Furlan Amaral, a manager at Abiove, said.  Since most of the soybean crop has already been shipped, ports are handling a larger amount of corn currently, as center-west states speed up harvest of the second-corn crop. SÃ©rgio Mendes, a director at Anec, said he had been in contact with authorities in ParÃ¡ and Mato Grosso states to share information he receives from traders regarding the location and impact of the blockades.

Fitzgerald/Handout/File Photo via REUTERSU.S. President Donald Trump said on Twitter that the crash was heartbreaking.  Melania and I send our deepest condolences to all!  he wrote.  Stars and Stripes, which covers U.S. military affairs, reported that witnesses said bodies were found a mile from the wreckage.  Images posted online by local media showed the plane's crumpled remains engulfed in flames in a field surrounded by tall vegetation, with a large plume of smoke in the sky. The crash left a five-mile (8-km) trail of debris, the local Clarion-Ledger newspaper reported.  The KC-130 Hercules, manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), conducts air-to-air refueling, carries cargo and performs tactical passenger missions. It is operated by three crew members and can carry 92 ground troops or 64 paratroopers, according to a Navy website. Greenwood Fire Department Chief Marcus Banks told the Greenwood Commonwealth newspaper that firefighters were driven back by several  high-intensity explosions  that may have been caused by ammunition igniting.  It was the worst Marine Corps aviation crash since January 2005, when a CH-53E crashed in Iraq, killing 30 Marines and one sailor.

Talks that began more than two years ago to invest in 666 Fifth Avenue, located in the heart of Manhattan, with Qatar's Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani were  recently terminated,  a Kushner spokesman, James Yolles, said in a statement to Reuters. Kushner Cos  is currently reassessing the financing structure of the overall project. The company remains in active discussions with a number of potential investorsÂ around the property's redevelopment,  Yolles said. Sheikh Hamad agreed to invest $500 million on condition that the company, recently headed by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now one of his senior advisers, obtain the rest of a multi-billion-dollar refinancing elsewhere, The Intercept publication reported on Monday. Jared, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, sold his interests in the company to a family trust in January.

President Trump in early June accused Qatar of being a  high level  sponsor of terrorism, days after four Arab states cut ties with the Gulf nation over its alleged support of terrorism. Kushner Cos in March said it ended talks with China's Anbang Insurance Group to redevelop the 39-story marquee property it bought in 2006 for $1.8 billion, at the time a record for a Manhattan office building.  Talks had centered on Anbang providing as much as half of $2.5 billion in equity in a plan that called for stripping the building down to its steel columns and adding about 40 floors, according to media reports. A $1.2 billion loan used to buy the property was later refinanced and comes due in February 2019.    The company also said in March that advanced talks were ongoing with other investors to redevelop the tower, valued for its proximity to St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefeller Center. Kushner Cos has a joint venture in the 60-year-old tower with Vornado Realty Trust, a major city property owner.

Inflation in the greater Buenos Aires area - previously used as a proxy - was 1.4 percent in June and 21.9 percent for the prior 12 months. In the first half of the year, consumer prices rose 11.8 percent nationwide and 12 percent in greater Buenos Aires.  The nationwide index represented a milestone for Macri's efforts to restore the credibility of the country's official statistics after widespread allegations that former President Cristina Fernandez's administration manipulated the statistics to make them look rosier than they really were.  Indec resumed publishing an inflation index for greater Buenos Aires last year after a months-long absence. In November, the IMF lifted its censure against the statistics agency. The central bank said it would now use the national index as the reference for monetary policy. On Tuesday, the bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 26.25 percent, noting that inflation expectations remain above its target range of 12-17 percent.  The economy has returned to its path of disinflation,  the central bank wrote.  While core inflation in June was lower than previous months, this change should be taken with caution given that it has persistently been higher than the monetary authority's target levels this year.   Economists expect national inflation of 21.5 percent this year.

The planned labor reform, which investors see as critical to boost long-term economic growth, is expected to clear a final Senate vote later in the day.     Traders said the vote will serve as a gauge of lawmaker's support for Temer's reform platform, which came under pressure in recent months after he was caught on tape allegedly condoning bribes to silence a key witness in Brazil's largest-ever corruption scandal.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index gained nearly 1.3 percent, as rising prices of crude and iron ore lifted shares of state-controlled oil company PetrÃ³leo Brasileiro SA  and miner Vale SA.     Shares of planemaker Embraer SA also advanced following strong second-quarter delivery figures.     Mexico's S&P BMV IPC stock index touched a fresh intraday record high but ended a bit down.

(Reuters) - A Pennsylvania State University fraternity pledge who died in February after consuming massive amounts of alcohol was one of several prospective members who felt compelled to drink to gain admission, a police detective testified on Tuesday. David Scicchitano, a detective in State College, Pennsylvania, took the witness stand for a third day at a hearing for 16 fraternity brothers charged in the Feb. 4 hazing death of Timothy Piazza.  Multiple people told me that this was a rite of passage, a way to get accepted by the fraternity,  Scicchitano said.  Pledges felt if they didn't participate, they wouldn't get into the fraternity.  The 16 members of Beta Theta Pi face a range of criminal charges after Piazza, 19, fell multiple times, including down a flight of stairs, after ingesting toxic amounts of alcohol. Authorities say the fraternity brothers waited for hours before calling for medical help. The preliminary hearing determines whether there is enough evidence for the case to proceed to trial.  The proceeding, which has moved slowly due to the number of defendants, is scheduled to continue for at least two more days in August. Steven Trialonis, a defense lawyer for Daniel Casey, the  pledge master  who allegedly gave Piazza a bottle of vodka he was expected to drink, questioned whether Piazza and other pledges were forced to drink or participated willingly. Trialonis also argued that  The Gauntlet,  a drinking obstacle course in which pledges consumed large amounts of vodka, wine and beer in the span of a few minutes, was not as dangerous as prosecutors had portrayed, saying only two prospective members had ever been injured. But Scicchitano testified that the pledges  felt compelled  to drink. Eight members, including Casey and the fraternity president, Brandon Young, face charges including aggravated assault that could result in many years in prison. The other defendants are charged with misdemeanors. Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by James Dalgleish","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pennsylvania-fraternity-idUSKBN19W2NG"},

The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati said the Ohio city of roughly 299,000 people failed to show that higher police and fire expenses to combat crime and blight, and a drop in its property tax base, were the direct result of misconduct by Wells Fargo. It also said Cincinnati failed to show that the third-largest U.S. bank intended to cause harm, or that the hundreds of properties it has owned, including in distressed neighborhoods, endangered the public's health or safety.  The city may use nuisance law to address an actual nuisance,  Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote for a 2-1 majority.  But alleged bad intent or alleged code violations by themselves do not suffice in the absence of an unsafe or unsanitary condition associated with an identifiable property.  Cincinnati's city solicitor, Paula Boggs Muething, expressed disappointment with the decision, saying it frees banks to continue  privatizing economic benefit and socializing economic loss  in Ohio.  The city of Cincinnati will continue to aggressively protect its neighborhoods from out of town, problem property owners, but today's decision - that banks may ignore the city's laws without consequence - has dealt a blow to that effort,  she said in a statement. Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cincinnati is one of many large U.S. cities to accuse banks following the 2008 financial crisis of causing harm by letting properties deteriorate, conducting predatory lending, or both. The city claimed that San Francisco-based Wells Fargo disregarded state and local property maintenance laws  with impunity,  including by routinely ignoring civil fines for high weeds, grass and building code violations. It said the bank's unlawful practices have persisted since 2006, including in  more vulnerable  neighborhoods where Wells Fargo appeared willing to spend on upkeep only if it stood to profit or reduce losses. Cincinnati previously resolved other claims against Wells Fargo, as well as nuisance and other claims in a similar lawsuit against Deutsche Bank AG, the appeals court said. The case is Cincinnati v Wells Fargo Bank NA et al, 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-3752.

Local residents, merchants and farmers have protested on federal road BR-163 since July 5 against a veto by President Michel Temer of legislation that would reduce the area under protection at a national forest in the region, Brazil's federal highway police (PRF) said. Cereals exporting group Anec said the situation in ParÃ¡ could impact its projections for corn exports. Brazil's northern grains ports could account for 25 percent of total corn and soybean exports this year, according to the government.    Everyday they stage a blockade at some point of the highway. When we get there, they move to another point,  said Ana Rabelo, a spokeswoman for the PRF in ParÃ¡. It was not possible to reach leaders of the protests. Rabelo said the protesters have planned new blockades for at least one week ahead, each day at a different point in the BR-163, which is a key road for trucks carrying soybeans and corn from center-west farms to a trans-shipment hub in Miritituba. From there, the grains are transferred to barges that move them to exporting ports such as SantarÃ©m and Barcarena.  Brazilian soybean industry association Abiove said the protests were impacting grain deliveries at the Miritituba hub, so barges are waiting longer to be filled up.    Commodities traders in Miritituba say they are receiving only small amounts of corn and soybeans,  Daniel Furlan Amaral, a manager at Abiove, said.  Since most of the soybean crop has already been shipped, ports are handling a larger amount of corn currently, as center-west states speed up harvest of the second-corn crop. SÃ©rgio Mendes, a director at Anec, said he had been in contact with authorities in ParÃ¡ and Mato Grosso states to share information he receives from traders regarding the location and impact of the blockades.

U.S. crude stocks plunged almost three times more than forecast in the latest week, while gasoline inventories decreased unexpectedly and distillate stocks built, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday. Crude inventories fell by 8.1 million barrels in the week to July 7 to 495.6 million, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.9 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 2 million barrels, API said. Benchmark Brent LCOc1 futures rose 64 cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $47.52 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 also rose 64 cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $45.04 per barrel. After the close and the supportive API data, Benchmark Brent LCOc1 futures rose $1.25, or 2.7 percent, to $48.12 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 rose $1.31, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $45.71 per barrel. U.S. heating oil HOc1 futures, meanwhile, gained 1.6 percent on Tuesday, boosting the products crack spread CL321-1=R, a measure of refinery margins, to the highest since late May. European refineries increased crude oil intake in June, but stocks of oil products, particularly diesel, slid, Euroilstock data showed on Tuesday.  That tells you demand globally is a lot stronger than people thought it was going to be and that is having a net positive effect on heating prices,  said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at energy brokerage ICAP in Durham, North Carolina. In a separate report on Tuesday, EIA projected U.S. crude oil production in 2018 will rise by less than previously expected. Traders noted Tuesday's crude price declines were mitigated by reports Saudi Arabia exceeded its OPEC production target and notes from banks lowering oil price forecasts for this year and 2018. BNP Paribas slashed its forecasts for Brent by $9 to $51 a barrel for 2017 and by $15 to $48 for 2018. Barclays cut its 2017 and 2018 Brent forecasts to $52 a barrel for both years from $55 for 2017 and $57 for 2018. Crude prices remain about 16 percent below 2017 opening levels despite a deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production from January. OPEC agreed with Russia and some other major exporters to cut output about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018. But production elsewhere has risen as OPEC has held back. U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has jumped more than 10 percent over the last year to 9.34 million bpd. Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members exempt from production limits, have also increased output. Saudi Arabia's oil production in June rose to 10.07 million bpd, putting it about 12,000 bpd over its OPEC output target. Without a significant fall in oil inventories or a decline in U.S. drilling and production, Goldman Sachs said U.S. crude could drop below $40 per barrel.

The central bank rate decision was the main focus for the Canadian dollar, which softened even as prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose and the U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies.           At 4:00 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2923 to the greenback, or 77.38 U.S. cents, down 0.2 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2886 to C$1.2944, still within reach of a 10-month high at C$1.2860, reached on Friday. The currency had rallied following stronger-than-expected domestic jobs data, which bolstered expectations of a rate increase on Wednesday.      It's lost a little bit of ground today, but we're really positioning ourselves in front of the imminent rate hike tomorrow,  said Rahim Madhavji, President at KnightsbridgeFX.com, but he added that the Bank of Canada was  very far away  from going on a long-term rate hike cycle.       I think it's just a short term blip ... much of it is priced into the market, and I think we'll oscillate around this level for the rest of the year.      Madhavji said overall weakness in oil prices and uncertainty around the North American Free Trade Agreement will keep the loonie under some pressure this year. He said the Bank of Canada will likely take more action in 2018.     Chances of a hike on Wednesday sit just under 88 percent, according to data from the overnight index swaps market. A nearly 80-percent chance of a second hike has been implied by December.                After years of being warned that borrowing costs would have to rise eventually, debt-laden Canadians may be about to face a reckoning if the Bank of Canada hikes rates.                         Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve. The two-year            rose 6.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.124 percent and the 10-year             climbed 29 Canadian cents to yield 1.860 percent.     The 2-year yield fell 3.1 basis further below its U.S. equivalent to a spread of -25.82 basis points. The spread had touched its narrowest on Tuesday since October at -22.7 basis points.     Canadian housing starts rose more than expected in June as construction intentions in and around Toronto remained strong while Vancouver trended downwards, data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation showed.

U.S. crude stocks plunged almost three times more than forecast in the latest week, while gasoline inventories decreased unexpectedly and distillate stocks built, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday. Crude inventories fell by 8.1 million barrels in the week to July 7 to 495.6 million, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.9 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 2 million barrels, API said. Benchmark Brent LCOc1 futures rose 64 cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $47.52 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 also rose 64 cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $45.04 per barrel. After the close and the supportive API data, Benchmark Brent LCOc1 futures rose $1.25, or 2.7 percent, to $48.12 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 rose $1.31, or 2.9 percent, to settle at $45.71 per barrel. U.S. heating oil HOc1 futures, meanwhile, gained 1.6 percent on Tuesday, boosting the products crack spread CL321-1=R, a measure of refinery margins, to the highest since late May. European refineries increased crude oil intake in June, but stocks of oil products, particularly diesel, slid, Euroilstock data showed on Tuesday.  That tells you demand globally is a lot stronger than people thought it was going to be and that is having a net positive effect on heating prices,  said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at energy brokerage ICAP in Durham, North Carolina. In a separate report on Tuesday, EIA projected U.S. crude oil production in 2018 will rise by less than previously expected. Traders noted Tuesday's crude price declines were mitigated by reports Saudi Arabia exceeded its OPEC production target and notes from banks lowering oil price forecasts for this year and 2018. BNP Paribas slashed its forecasts for Brent by $9 to $51 a barrel for 2017 and by $15 to $48 for 2018. Barclays cut its 2017 and 2018 Brent forecasts to $52 a barrel for both years from $55 for 2017 and $57 for 2018. Crude prices remain about 16 percent below 2017 opening levels despite a deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production from January. OPEC agreed with Russia and some other major exporters to cut output about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018. But production elsewhere has risen as OPEC has held back. U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has jumped more than 10 percent over the last year to 9.34 million bpd. Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members exempt from production limits, have also increased output. Saudi Arabia's oil production in June rose to 10.07 million bpd, putting it about 12,000 bpd over its OPEC output target. Without a significant fall in oil inventories or a decline in U.S. drilling and production, Goldman Sachs said U.S. crude could drop below $40 per barrel.

The resignation of one of the five commissioners in charge of the inquiry came less than two weeks after the departure of the executive director, and added pressure to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who took office in 2015 promising to repair the relationship with Canada's 1.4 million aboriginals. The inquiry, launched in August 2016, vowed to push ahead with its investigation into the root cause of more than a thousand deaths of aboriginal women and girls in recent decades. Marilyn Poitras will step down on Saturday, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls said in a statement. She cited disagreement with the structure of the inquiry. Executive Director Michele Moreau resigned in late June, citing personal reasons. â€œâ€ŽWe â€Žwant â€Žto reassure the public that now, more than ever, we remain focused on this tremendously important â€Žwork,â€�â€Ž Chiefâ€Ž Commissioner â€ŽMarion Buller said in a statement.â€Ž Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said the government would discuss whether the inquiry, which is due to issue an interim report in the autumn, could continue with reduced staffing.  Yesterday the commission felt they were more than prepared to go forward as four commissioners ... but ultimately it will be up to government to decide, in consultation, as to what the next step will be,  Bennett told reporters. Some aboriginal leaders lamented the departure, but said the inquiry must go on.  Weâ€™re very concerned about this resignation because the work of the national inquiry is too important and we want to see it succeed for the families,  Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said in a statement. Robert Bertrand, chief of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, which represents indigenous people living off of reserves, said abandoning or restarting the inquiry was not an option.  The families of the victims, the mothers and daughters and aunts have been waiting for this for years and years. We cannot disappoint them,  Bertrand said in a telephone interview. Many aboriginals accuse Trudeau's Liberal government of not doing enough to help poor communities, and protests by indigenous people disrupted the country's July 1 Canada Day festivities.

Roughly half of people with living wills or other types of advanced medical directives were not suffering from a chronic illness, the researchers note.   â€œImproving end-of-life care has been a national conversation for some time now, presumably because it will affect all of us at some point and is a very personal matter,â€� said senior study author Dr. Katherine Courtright of the Fostering Improvement in End-of-Life Decision Science Program at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.  The conversation has revived since Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over age 65, began reimbursing physicians for advance-care planning counseling on January 1, 2016. â€œThis is a comprehensive national snapshot of the most widely promoted tool for end-of-life care planning and suggests that there is plenty of room to increase its reach,â€� she told Reuters Health by email. Courtrightâ€™s team analyzed 150 studies published between 2000 and 2015 that reported on advanced directive completion in the United States. The studies included both healthy and sick patients, some focused on specific diseases or different types of advanced directives or particular populations. In total, they covered nearly 796,000 adults, of whom 64 percent were women, 65 percent were white, 81 percent were age 65 and older and 63 percent were in a nursing home. The research team found that 36.7 percent of adults completed an advanced directive of some kind: 29 percent had living wills, 33 percent had health care powers of attorney and 32 percent had undefined advanced directives.  Older patients and those in hospice or palliative care were more likely to have an advanced directive, and end-of-life care documents were more common among those with neurologic disease such as dementia and least common among those with HIV/AIDS, according to the results published in Health Affairs.   But overall, 38.2 percent of people with a chronic illness had advanced directives compared to 32.7 percent of healthy people, a difference that wasnâ€™t statistically meaningful.  â€œIt was somewhat surprising how much the completion rate varied based on age, patient location and diagnosis, yet even among those with the highest completion rates, nearly half still hadnâ€™t completed them,â€� Courtright said. â€œThe fact that only a third of sick patients are expressing their end-of-life wishes means weâ€™re in trouble,â€� said Dr. Melissa Wachterman of Harvard Medical School in Boston, who wasnâ€™t involved in the study.  â€œEverybody should have this conversation because our values and preferences change over time,â€� she told Reuters Health in a phone interview. â€œA healthy 72-year-old may say she wants a breathing tube, but that choice may change.â€� One limitation of the study is that it doesnâ€™t include many population groups that may not document their end-of-life care wishes formally or trust medical or legal forms that dictate advanced directives, the authors note. â€œAs I like to say, the form is only as good as the conversation and the shared understanding that goes along with it,â€� said Dr. Rebecca Sudore of the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine who wasnâ€™t involved in the study.  â€œSome people do fill out these forms with families or lawyers, and then the forms sit in the dusty recesses of a back drawer and they are not available or shared with family and friends, especially before they are needed,â€� she told Reuters Health by email. Advanced care planning advocates and researchers are looking for ways to reduce the barriers to completing directives by removing legal jargon, changing the reading level and revising the medical terms used.  Sudore recommends PrepareForYourCare.org for easy-to-read directives. Other organizations, such as Aging with Dignity (bit.ly/2v9EjBq), promote family conversations by starting with â€œFive Wishesâ€� they want for the end of life.  â€œAt the end of the day, Iâ€™ve heard from too many families that they couldnâ€™t agree on what to do for mom or dad, and itâ€™s often not on your radar until itâ€™s too late,â€� said Paul Malley, president of Aging with Dignity in Tallahassee, Florida, in a phone interview.

In his first economic policy interview since his appointment by centrist president Emmanuel Macron in May, Philippe told Les Echos daily the public deficit would amount to 2.7 percent of GDP next year thanks to savings of at least 20 billion euros ($22.9 billion). France, the euro zone's second largest economy, already forecasts a deficit below 3 percent of GDP this year, from 3.4 percent in 2016.  If the country met this objective, it would honor the EU-agreed 3 percent limit for the first time since 2007. But last month, France's independent auditor revealed a more than 8 billion-euro funding shortfall in this year's budget, forecasting a deficit once again above the EU cap.  I know France has a lot to do to restore budget credibility in the medium term. But we have a clear road map with structural reforms which, I believe, will convince our European partners,  Philippe said. The savings effort would materialize through job attrition in the public sector and a possible simplification of layers of local administration, he added. The government had already said it wanted to diminish the number of civil servants in France by 120,000 by 2022.  The real work will have to be done ministry by ministry and administration by administration to assess what is really essential,  he said.   Earlier this week, Philippe told members of parliament it was time to end France's addiction to easy public spending, promising to cut expenditures over the next five years. New president Emmanuel Macron regards reducing France's deficit and debt as key to winning the trust of European Union partner Germany and persuading Berlin to embark on reforms to shore up the bloc. Despite still forecasting a public deficit for this year and next, Philippe said the debt-to-GDP ratio, which in France stood at 96.3 percent last year, would decrease by 5 percentage points over the period 2017-2022. He did not give further details. Philippe said the defense ministry would see increased spending as soon as next year, after an expected budget cut of 850 million euros in 2017, as France wanted defense funding to reach the target recommended by NATO for its member states of 2 percent of GDP by 2025.

The agency will assess airlines from Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Egypt in coming weeks to see if they have introduced security measures to allow the ban to be removed at four airports, DHS spokesman David Lapan said. Saudi Arabian Airlines, also known as Saudia, said it expected the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19, while Royal Air Maroc believed it could get off the ban for flights out of Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport by July 19. State-owned EgyptAir, which has also been covered by the ban, said Tuesday the restrictions would be lifted on Wednesday. Lapan said DHS would confirm the removal of the measures for EgyptAir after they verified the airline's security procedures. The measures were imposed in March on nine airlines to address the potential threat of hidden explosives in laptops and other devices. The restrictions, coupled with the Trump administration's travel ban on six majority-Muslim countries, hurt the predominantly Middle Eastern carriers.   Over the past 10 days, DHS has lifted restrictions on in-cabin large electronics on six of the airlines after they adopted stricter screening for explosives and other enhanced measures.  They include Royal Jordanian Airways, Kuwait Airways, which saw the ban removed on Sunday. Restrictions on Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines were dropped last week. On June 28, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly unveiled enhanced security measures for all foreign flights arriving in the United States in what officials said was a move to end a limited in-cabin ban on laptops and prevent its expansion to additional airports. The new security measures could prompt additional screening time for the 325,000 airline passengers arriving in the United States daily. European and U.S. officials told Reuters airlines had 21 days to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers. Lapan on Tuesday declined to discuss the timetable for enhanced security procedures, but emphasized that the U.S. government would work with airlines.  Some airports, airlines will be able to get there more quickly,  Lapan said.  DHS is  looking for progress,  he added. The United States could still impose penalties on airlines that are not moving fast enough, he said.

Genital mutilation of girls, typically involving removal of all or part of the clitoris, is banned by several international treaties but remains a common cultural or religious practice in some African countries, including Somalia, Sudan and Egypt. The package of 13 bills signed by Snyder, a Republican, was spurred by the case of an emergency room physician, Jumana Nagarwala, who was charged in April under federal law with performing genital mutilation on two 7-year-old girls at a suburban Detroit medical clinic. Another doctor and his wife who ran the clinic also have been charged in that case, believed to mark the first U.S. criminal prosecution of its kind. The three defendants could face prison terms of up to five years if convicted. The three, who are members a small sect of Indian Muslims known as the Dawoodi Bohra, according to local media reports, have pleaded not guilty, court documents show. Shannon Smith, an attorney for Nagarwala, has argued in court that her client used a  scraper  on the girls' genitals to perform a religious ritual but said that Nagarwala did not cut the girls, the Detroit Free Press reported in April.  Those who commit these horrendous crimes should be held accountable for their actions, and these bills stiffen the penalties for offenders while providing additional support to victims,  Snyder said in a statement.  This legislation is an important step toward eliminating this despicable practice in Michigan while empowering victims to find healing and justice.  The practice was outlawed in the United States in 1996, but Michigan's laws are now tougher than the federal regulations. Prior to Tuesday, 25 states had laws against the practice, according to Equality Now, a women's rights organization. A health professional convicted of female genital mutilation can also have their registration or license permanently revoked, under Michigan's new laws. The World Health Organization has estimated that more than 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone genital mutilation, which can cause lasting health problems.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/michigan-mutilation-idUSL1N1K21P9"},

Luis Vicente Pedrote-Salinas, 25, of Chicago, argued in a lawsuit filed in U.S. district court in Chicago that his false inclusion on the gang list led immigration agents to raid his home in 2011 and detain him. He was brought to the United States when he was five years old. U.S authorities denied his application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, even though he met all the requirements, the lawsuit said. President Barack Obama created DACA to give people brought to the county as children temporary protection from deportation. Pedrote must leave the country July 20. The lawsuit seeks damages and asks the judge to declare that the city's practices violated Pedrote's constitutional rights. Chicago police spokesman Frank Giancamilli declined to comment. It is not the first lawsuit targeting the Chicago police database. Sejal Zota, legal director of the National Immigration Project, sued on behalf of a client in May she said was also mistakenly listed. Those concerns come as agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement increasingly target gang members for deportation, she said.  The problem with these databases is you're never informed that you're part of a gang database, and you're never confronted with any evidence they're using,  she said.  Mr. Pedrote was not the first, nor the last person to be targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of false information ICE received from the CPD,  the lawsuit said.  This gang database is arbitrary, over-inclusive and contains false information.  Pedrote argued in the lawsuit that no process existed to allow him to contest inclusion. Pedrote's troubles began in January 2011, when Chicago police working as part of a  gang suppression mission  arrested him on an alcohol-related charge that was later dismissed, the lawsuit said. Police then falsely listed him as member of the Latin Kings, the lawsuit said, including him because of his race, age and neighborhood, and triggering a  catastrophic chain of events.  In August 2011, Pedrote was arrested by immigration agents acting on the gang information, the lawsuit said. After six months jail, he has fought to stay in the country.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/illinois-immigration-lawsuit-idUSL1N1K21P2"},

Beef exports to Chile and Peru have also been suspended, an official at the Colombian Agricultural and Livestock Institute (ICA) said. Beef certified before July 5 will be accepted, ICA said. The outbreak, the first since 2009, was detected in eight properties in Yacopi, central Cundinamarca province, and a quarantine declared to prevent the spread to 13 municipalities bordering the cattle corridor, ICA said.

The agency will assess airlines from Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Egypt in coming weeks to see if they have introduced security measures to allow the ban to be removed at four airports, DHS spokesman David Lapan said. Saudi Arabian Airlines, also known as Saudia, said it expected the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19, while Royal Air Maroc believed it could get off the ban for flights out of Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport by July 19. State-owned EgyptAir, which has also been covered by the ban, said Tuesday the restrictions would be lifted on Wednesday. Lapan said DHS would confirm the removal of the measures for EgyptAir after they verified the airline's security procedures. The measures were imposed in March on nine airlines to address the potential threat of hidden explosives in laptops and other devices. The restrictions, coupled with the Trump administration's travel ban on six majority-Muslim countries, hurt the predominantly Middle Eastern carriers. Over the past 10 days, DHS has lifted restrictions on in-cabin large electronics on six of the airlines after they adopted stricter screening for explosives and other enhanced measures. They include Royal Jordanian Airways, Kuwait Airways, which saw the ban removed on Sunday. Restrictions on Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines were dropped last week. On June 28, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly unveiled enhanced security measures for all foreign flights arriving in the United States in what officials said was a move to end a limited in-cabin ban on laptops and prevent its expansion to additional airports. The new security measures could prompt additional screening time for the 325,000 airline passengers arriving in the United States daily. European and U.S. officials told Reuters airlines had 21 days to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers. Lapan on Tuesday declined to discuss the timetable for enhanced security procedures, but emphasized that the U.S. government would work with airlines.  Some airports, airlines will be able to get there more quickly,  Lapan said. DHS is  looking for progress,  he added. The United States could still impose penalties on airlines that are not moving fast enough, he said.

The Redmond, Washington, technology company proposed using spectrum typically reserved for TV stations to broadcast high-speed internet to underserved U.S. locations. To start, Microsoft will commit to a five-year effort to bring broadband connectivity to 2 million underserved rural Americans. Microsoft, whose products include the Windows operating system, Office 365 productivity suite and Skype video service, hopes other companies and the government will support what it has dubbed the Rural Airband Initiative. However, the plan has attracted opposition from broadcasters who are reluctant to share the airwaves. â€œThis is really all about getting everybody online in rural communities,â€� Brad Smith, Microsoftâ€™s chief legal officer, told Reuters. â€œThat includes consumers, it includes businesses, it includes farmers and agricultural enterprises and it includes schools.â€� Reaching all 23 million underserved rural Americans would cost as much as $12 billion, Microsoft said. Smith said the company will spend whatever it takes to reach the targeted 2 million people. It plans to launch at least 12 projects across 12 states within the next 12 months, and has partnerships with telecom companies including CenturyLink Inc(CTL.N) in Washington state, and hopes for more partners, Smith said.  â€œOur goal is to work with as many people as possible,â€� he said, adding he hopes the Trump Administration will consider government funding for the project as part of an infrastructure bill expected in the fall.  â€œMy sense is that they are focused on a full range of infrastructure needs, including 21st century infrastructure like broadband,â€� Smith said. â€œWe welcome the dialogue.â€� Costly equipment is among the challenges. Microsoft bets costs will come down, but that is not guaranteed. Opposition from broadcasters is also a concern. â€œPolicymakers should not be misled by slick Microsoft promises,â€� said Dennis Wharton, vice president of communications for the National Association of Broadcasters, in a statement.  Forrester analyst James McQuivey called the plan a low-risk, high-reward effort for Microsoft, which might have to spend money in a lobbying fight with broadcasters, but stands to gain millions of new users. â€œIt would only be valuable to Microsoft if the company uses that engagement to build a branded relationship with the customer, moving them to Bing as a search engine, encouraging them to use Office 365, Outlook, and Skype,â€� McQuivey said.

Coach has been removed from Negative Watch and the ratings have been assigned a Stable Outlook. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. At closing, the Kate Spade acquisition has caused Coach's adjusted leverage to increase from the previous 2.6x level to 3.7x on a pro forma basis. To fund the $2.4 billion acquisition, which represents a 9x EBITDA multiple on Kate Spade's TTM results, Coach has issued $2.1 billion of debt, including $1 billion of unsecured notes, an $800 million six-month term loan credit facility and a $300 million three-year term loan facility. Leverage is expected to decline to around 3.3x at the end of FY 2018 upon repayment of the $800 million six-month term loan. Leverage is expected to trend to under 3.0x in fiscal 2020 on EBITDA growth. The ratings also reflect Coach's strong position in the premium bag and small leather goods market, albeit a market which is somewhat exposed to fashion and brand risk. Finally, the ratings reflect integration risk from potential changes to Kate Spade's growth strategies, and the addition of a young, rapidly grown brand to Coach's portfolio. KEY RATING DRIVERS Kate Spade Acquisition: Kate Spade is a global specialty soft goods retailer that designs and markets women's, men's and children's accessories and apparel under the kate spade new york and Jack Spade brands. Kate Spade generated $1.4 billion in sales and $264 million in EBITDA, for a 19.2% margin, in the LTM ended April 1, 2017. While handbags and small leather goods drive approximately 70% of the company's sales, the company has recently sought to diversify its mix through product introductions in other accessories, apparel and home categories. Products are sold through wholly owned specialty retail and outlet stores and wholesale distribution at select specialty retail and upscale department stores, such as Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdales. Approximately 75% of Kate Spade's revenue is generated in the direct-to-consumer segment, while the remaining 25% comes from the wholesale and licensing channels. Additionally, approximately 20% of revenues are generated online. Kate Spade grew brand revenues at a compound annual rate of nearly 40% from 2010 to 2015. Growth was predicated on square footage growth in the U.S., international expansion, and double-digit annual comps between 2010 and 2015. Comps slowed meaningfully to the mid-single digits in 2016 and turned negative 2.4% in first quarter of 2017 due to reduced promotions, weak tourist traffic caused by the stronger U.S. dollar and a general slowdown in luxury spend. Pro forma for the acquisition, Coach generates almost $6 billion in sales and $1.4 billion in EBITDA. From a qualitative standpoint, Fitch views the addition of Kate Spade to Coach's portfolio as neutral to modestly negative given the rapid rise of the young brand that creates a higher risk of the brand falling out of favor and the targeted changes to the company's operating strategy through pullback of online flash sales. Coach closed on its acquisition of Kate Spade in 1Q of fiscal 2018. The acquisition price of $2.4 billion represents a 9x EBITDA multiple on an LTM basis. Coach expects to realize approximately $50 million of run-rate cost synergies within three years of acquisition close, which would be evenly split between cost of goods sold and SG&A. Fitch views these synergies as modest but reasonable relative to the combined EBITDA base (at around 4% of total EBITDA). Standalone Coach Coach's current ratings reflect the company's strong position in the premium bag and small leather goods market as well as reasonable credit metrics despite recent EBITDA headwinds. Since fiscal year (FY) 2013, the company has seen significant sales declines in its North American (NA) business, now representing approximately 60% of total sales and EBITDA. Reported international sales growth has averaged approximately 4% since FY 2013, as growth in China and Coach's entry in Europe has been mitigated by a decline in Japan and currency headwinds. The approximately 40% decline in consolidated EBITDA to $1.1 billion in FY 2015 and FY 2016 from $1.9 billion in FY 2013, coupled with the company's issuance of $900 million in senior unsecured debt in March 2015 to support the purchase and construction of its new headquarters, has resulted in adjusted leverage increasing to 2.6x from 1.4x at the end of FY 2014, in line with Fitch's expectations. Coach's North American Sales Improving NA revenue, which has declined since FY 2013, appears to be stabilizing, with comps improving from -9.5% in 1Q 2016 to 3% in 3Q 2017. Comps are expected to be modestly positive in 4Q 2016 (around 2.5% for the full year) and positive low-single digits beginning FY 2018. NA EBITDA after corporate overhead has declined from $1.1 billion in FY 2013 (32% of sales) to $412 million in FY 2016 (17% of sales), and is expected to be in this range in FY 2017. Coach has undertaken a number of actions to reposition the brand further upscale, with the intention to increase the penetration of full-price sales and higher price point purchases. First, Stuart Vevers, the company's creative director who joined in September 2013, has evolved the product mix with a view toward an innovative, design-led and editorial offering. Second, Coach has invested in remodels of owned stores and department store presentations, yielding positive sales results. The remodels have continued in FY 2017, and the company plans to end the year with over 700 remodeled locations (or about 70% of the total store base) globally versus 450 locations last year. Third, Coach has restructured its promotional cadence by reducing the amount of periodic sale events. Finally, Coach has refocused its marketing efforts away from price point and event messaging to a product-focused platform across e-mail, social media, and fashion industry activity. The combination of the above have yielded stabilization in Coach's operating performance in FY 2016 and FY 2017, improving Fitch's confidence in its projections of positive annual comps beginning 2017. Coupled with modest declines in square footage, Fitch expects modestly positive NA sales growth annually. Comps and EBITDA in recent quarters have stabilized despite continued challenges for many mid-tier mall-based apparel and accessories retailers. Fitch assumes slight EBITDA margin expansion from trough FY 2015-FY 2016 levels, but the fashion nature of Coach's assortment, coupled with its recent volatile history, could lead to either to material downside or upside risk to our expectations. International Sales Stability International sales, which represent approximately 40% of revenue, have been less volatile, with a 4% increase in FY 2015 and 9% in FY 2016 (constant currency basis). Despite increasing economic headwinds, China has continued its growth trajectory, becoming Coach's largest international market in FY 2016 at $652 million, while Europe has had the highest growth rate, albeit from a small base. Japan, Coach's second largest international market at approximately $560 million in FY 2016 revenue, has seen positive mid-single digit constant currency growth in FY 2016 after experiencing a modest constant currency decline in FY 2015. Fitch expects annual sales growth beginning FY 2017 to trend in the mid-to-high single digits, predicated on mid-single-digit growth in China and significant square footage expansion in Europe. Stable Credit Metrics Despite a 42% decline in EBITDA from peak fiscal 2013 levels to FY 2016 levels, credit metrics remain reasonable with LTM adjusted debt/EBITDAR leverage of 2.6x. Fitch expects standalone leverage to remain in the 2.6x to 2.7x range over the next 24 to 26 months, with EBITDA growth in FY 2017 and onwards and the $293 million term loan repayment being somewhat offset by increased capitalized rent from the headquarters sale-leaseback and expansion in China and Europe. Following the closing of the Kate Spade acquisition, pro forma leverage is 3.7x but is expected to decline to 3.3x at the end of FY 2018 following pay down of the company's $800 million six-month term loan. Leverage is expected to trend to under 3.0x two years post acquisition close based on EBITDA growth. Standalone Coach FCF is expected to be about $120 million in FY 2017 and increase to $350 million to $400 million annually over the next two to three years as remodelling activity moderates and capex declines to about $200 million. FCF including Kate Spade is expected to be around $200 million in FY 2018 and increase to around $400 million annually thereafter driven by EBITDA growth. DERIVATION SUMMARY Coach's 'BBB-' rating reflects its strong brand positioning and leading market share within the U.S handbag market. The rating is constrained relative to department stores with similar leverage metrics like Macy's Inc. ('BBB'/Outlook Negative) and Kohl's Corporation ('BBB'/Outlook Negative) due to the diversified brand and category profile of these leading department stores. The rating is lower than leading global jeweler Tiffany & Co ('BBB+'/Outlook Negative) due to both higher leverage and higher fashion-related sales volatility in handbags vis a vis jewelry. Finally, Coach is rated higher than The Gap Inc. ('BB+'/Outlook Stable), primarily due to Coach's lower leverage profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --Fitch expects reported sales growth to be flattish in FY 2017 for standalone Coach. NA Coach brand sales are expected to be up modestly and international sales down modestly. NA comps are expected to be around 2.5% in FY 2017 and positive low-single digits thereafter, with continued expansion in Europe driving low- to mid-single digit company-wide annual revenue growth. Reported FY 2018 revenue growth is expected to be almost 40% to reflect the inclusion of Kate Spade. --FY 2017 standalone EBITDA is expected to up low-single digits at $1.1 billion, driven by improvement in NA comp stores sales and improve to $1.2 billion by FY 2019/FY 2020. Including Kate Spade, EBITDA is expected to be $1.4 billion in FY 2018 and improve to $1.6 billion thereafter, including the around $50 million of expected run-rate synergies. --Standalone FCF is expected to be about $120 million in FY 2017 and increase to $350 million to $400 million annually over the next two to three years on moderating capex. FCF including Kate Spade is expected to be around $200 million in FY 2018 and increase to around $400 million annually thereafter driven by EBITDA growth. --Adjusted leverage including Kate Spade, which is 3.7x at close on a pro forma basis, is expected to decline to 3.3x at the end of FY 2018 following pay down of the $800 million six-month term loan. Leverage is expected to trend to under 3.0x two years post close on EBITDA growth. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action A positive rating action would result from Coach's core NA comparable store sales growing mid-single digits and a successful Kate Spade integration, yielding at least $1.8 billion in EBITDA by year three post acquisition. These assumptions, plus expected debt paydown, would drive leverage to the mid 2x range. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action A negative rating action could result from worse than expected top-line, profitability and cash flow trends driven by the inability to stabilize its market share in the low- to mid-tier luxury market; a slowdown in the momentum of Coach's international business; mis-execution of Kate Spade integration strategies; and/or loss in confidence of the company's ability to reduce leverage to the high-2.0x range. LIQUIDITY As of April 1, 2017, Coach had $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, of which approximately 70% was overseas. Coach has a $900 million unsecured domestic facility with a maturity date of May 30, 2022. Historically, Coach generated strong FCF (after dividends) of $700 million to $800 million between FY 2011 through FY 2013. However, FCF dropped to approximately $390 million and $365 million FY 2014 and FY 2015, respectively, on significant EBITDA declines and spending on the new headquarters. FCF was negative $12 million in FY 2016 driven by $146 million capex spend on the new headquarters and higher interest costs. Coach sold its interest in its headquarters in August 2016 and subsequently paid down its $293 million senior unsecured term loan. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded Coach, Inc. as follows: --Long-term IDR to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured bank credit facility to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured term loans to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-' from 'BBB'.

Genital mutilation of girls, typically involving removal of all or part of the clitoris, is banned by several international treaties but remains a common cultural or religious practice in some African countries, including Somalia, Sudan and Egypt.  The package of 13 bills signed by Snyder, a Republican, was spurred by the case of an emergency room physician, Jumana Nagarwala, who was charged in April under federal law with performing genital mutilation on two 7-year-old girls at a suburban Detroit medical clinic.  Another doctor and his wife who ran the clinic also have been charged in that case, believed to mark the first U.S. criminal prosecution of its kind. The three defendants could face prison terms of up to five years if convicted.  The three, who are members a small sect of Indian Muslims known as the Dawoodi Bohra, according to local media reports, have pleaded not guilty, court documents show. Shannon Smith, an attorney for Nagarwala, has argued in court that her client used a  scraper  on the girls' genitals to perform a religious ritual but said that Nagarwala did not cut the girls, the Detroit Free Press reported in April.     Those who commit these horrendous crimes should be held accountable for their actions, and these bills stiffen the penalties for offenders while providing additional support to victims,  Snyder said in a statement.   This legislation is an important step toward eliminating this despicable practice in Michigan while empowering victims to find healing and justice.  The practice was outlawed in the United States in 1996, but Michigan's laws are now tougher than the federal regulations. Prior to Tuesday, 25 states had laws against the practice, according to Equality Now, a women's rights organization.  A health professional convicted of female genital mutilation can also have their registration or license permanently revoked, under Michigan's new laws.  The World Health Organization has estimated that more than 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone genital mutilation, which can cause lasting health problems.

A ship carrying beef to Russia was turned back when its authorities were notified about diseased animals in Colombia, Jose De Silvestri, head of the northern cattle ranchers association, told Reuters. Beef exports to Chile and Peru have also been suspended, an official at the Colombian Agricultural and Livestock Institute (ICA) said. Beef certified before July 5 will be accepted, ICA said. The outbreak, the first since 2009, was detected in eight properties in Yacopi, central Cundinamarca province, and a quarantine declared to prevent the spread to 13 municipalities bordering the cattle corridor, ICA said. Last month, the disease was detected at a farm in northern Arauca province, close to the border with Venezuela. It was contained with the slaughter of seven animals. Foot and mouth is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal disease that affects hooved animals such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffalo and pigs, although it is not a direct threat to humans. Colombian Agriculture Minister Aurelio Iragorri has said the virus that causes the disease came from an external source, likely Venezuela which smuggles cattle into Colombia. Colombia exports beef and livestock to countries like Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Panama, but its main markets are in Russia, Dutch Caribbean island Curacao, Lebanon and Jordan.

Takata air bag inflators are already linked to 17 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide, and the recalls will eventually cover about 125 million inflators. The auto safety agency said new testing is prompting the recall of some driver-side air bags built from 2015 through 2012. Nissan said it will recall 627,000 Versa cars from 2007-2012 model years, including 515,000 in the United States  out of an abundance of caution.  It will notify owners within 60 days with additional instructions. Ford spokesman John Cangany said the issue covers about 2.2 million Ford vehicles, and the company has five days to respond to the Takata filing. The automaker is  aware of Takataâ€™s submission, and we have been in regular contact with the agency on the issue. Importantly, we arenâ€™t aware of any incidents, and test data doesnâ€™t suggest any issues,  he said. Mazda said the new recall impacts just 6,000 B-series trucks. More than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. The issue is the largest ever auto safety recall covering 17 automakers. Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in June. Takata inflator ruptures occur after long-term exposure to high humidity, NHTSA has said. Prior Takata recalls have involved air bag inflators without a drying agent. The new 2.7 million air bag inflators being recalled involve a drying agent, but Takata said testing showed ruptures could still take place.  Takata has told the public that their line of air bag inflators with moisture absorbent was safe. This recall now raises serious questions about the threat posed by all of Takataâ€™s ammonium nitrate-based airbags,  U.S. Senator Bill Nelson said in a statement.  If even more are found to be defective, it will take us from the biggest recall ever to something that could become mind-boggling.  Honda Motor Co said Monday it had confirmed an 11th U.S. death involving one of its vehicles tied to a faulty Takata air bag inflator. Takata expects to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including more than 60 million in the United States, Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, said in June.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/takata-recall-idUSL1N1K217F"},

The deal, in which Mallinckrodt did not admit wrongdoing, marked a record settlement of claims that a drugmaker failed to properly notify the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration of suspicious orders for drugs such as oxycodone, the Justice Department said. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the settlement will send a message to other drugmakers that the Justice Department will seek to hold them accountable for their actions amid a national opioid addiction epidemic.  Mallinckrodt's actions and omissions formed a link in the chain of supply that resulted in millions of oxycodone pills being sold on the street,  he said in a statement.  I believe that will prevent drug abuse, prevent new addictions from starting and ultimately save lives.  Mallinckrodt previously announced an agreement-in-principle to resolve the investigations in April. The company said it continues to deny the allegations. Michael-Bryant Hicks, Mallinckrodt's general counsel, said the company chose to settle  to eliminate the uncertainty, distraction and expense of litigation and to allow the company to focus on meeting the important needs of its patients and customers.  Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the Justice Department, from 2008 to 2011, Mallinckrodt supplied distributors increasingly excessive amounts of oxycodone pills without notifying the DEA of the suspicious orders. Those distributors in turn supplied the drugs to various U.S. pharmacies and pain clinics, the Justice Department said. In addition to the monetary penalty, Mallinckrodt agreed to analyze data on orders from customers down the supply chain to identify suspicious sales, the Justice Department said.

Luis Vicente Pedrote-Salinas, 25, of Chicago, argued in a  lawsuit filed in U.S. district court in Chicago that his false inclusion on the gang list led immigration agents to raid his home in 2011 and detain him. He was brought to the United States when he was five years old. U.S authorities denied his application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, even though he met all the requirements, the lawsuit said. President Barack Obama created DACA to give people brought to the county as children temporary protection from deportation.  Pedrote must leave the country July 20. The lawsuit seeks damages and asks the judge to declare that the city's practices violated Pedrote's constitutional rights. Chicago police spokesman Frank Giancamilli declined to comment. It is not the first lawsuit targeting the Chicago police database. Sejal Zota, legal director of the National Immigration Project, sued on behalf of a client in May she said was also mistakenly listed. Those concerns come as agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement increasingly target gang members for deportation, she said.  The problem with these databases is you're never informed that you're part of a gang database, and you're never confronted  with any evidence they're using,  she said.  Mr. Pedrote was not the first, nor the last person to be targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of false information ICE received from the CPD,  the lawsuit said.  This gang database is arbitrary, over-inclusive and contains false information.  Pedrote argued in the lawsuit that no process existed to allow him to contest inclusion. Pedrote's troubles began in January 2011, when Chicago police working as part of a  gang suppression mission  arrested him on an alcohol-related charge that was later dismissed, the lawsuit said. Police then falsely listed him as member of the Latin Kings, the lawsuit said, including him because of his race, age and neighborhood, and triggering a  catastrophic chain of events.  In August 2011, Pedrote was arrested by immigration agents acting on the gang information, the lawsuit said. After six months jail, he has fought to stay in the country.

Morgan Stanley, a lead underwriter on the company's initial public offering, slapped a price target of $16 on the stock - a buck below its March IPO price. Analyst Brian Nowak wrote in the note that  we have been wrong about Snap's ability to innovate and improve its ad product this year.  Snap shares got slammed, slumping nearly 9 percent in heavy trading volume to close at $15.47. It was a 47 percent bump down from the $29.44 intraday high they hit the day after the IPO. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of people betting that this stock is going down and I think this analyst is just adding fuel to the fire,â€�  King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, said of Morgan Stanley's downgrade. The bank cut its rating to  equal-weight  from  outperform  and slashed its price target to $16 from $28, below the median target of $19.50.  The ratings move was a rarity by a lead underwriter so soon after a listing. Goldman Sachs, another lead underwriter, still has a  buy  rating on the stock and an unchanged $27 price target. Related CoverageInvestors pay top dollar to short SnapFactbox: Snap IPO underwriters' coverage We have been wrong about Snap's ability to innovate and improve its ad product this year and user monetization as it works to move beyond  experimental  ad budgets into larger branded and direct response ad allocations,  Nowak wrote.  Nowak raised concerns about Snapchat parent's ability to compete with Facebook Inc's Instagram. Snap's user growth trends have been modestly weaker than expected.  In the downgrade report, Morgan Stanley also cut its estimates for Snap's 2017 revenue by 6.9 percent to $897 million and lowered its expectations for daily active users by 1.6 percent to 182 million.

Longs vs Shorts  Short-sellers were placing bets on Tuesday that Snap would continue to fall, representing about 2.4 percent of trading volume in the stock by midday despite it being one of the most expensive to borrow on Wall Street. A fresh round of selling could follow the July 29 expiry of the stock's lockup period, after which certain insider investors will be allowed to unload their shares.

The company's current market value was about $18.3 billion.  Facebook, which once made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat, has made the camera central to its own apps and offers Snapchat-like features on its Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. In June, Instagram said its Stories feature had 250 million users, compared with 166 million users for Snapchat at the end of the first quarter.  You have a one, two, three punch here: Slowing growth, advertisers are still favoring established platforms and a very, very threatening competitor,  said Philippe Collard, founder of management consulting firm Yabusame Partners, which specializes in the tech industry.   Probably, people are sitting on the sideline saying, 'What do I do with Snap, is it going to be another Twitter?'  Shares of Twitter, which went public in 2013, now trade about 30 percent below their IPO price.    Some big names took stakes in Snap during the first quarter, including billionaire George Soros' hedge fund, activist hedge fund Jana Partners, Daniel Loeb's Third Point and Daniel Och's Och-Ziff Capital Management.

(Reuters) - Small satellites used for observing conditions on the earth are the fastest growing segment of the $260.5 billion global satellite industry, the Satellite Industries Association said in an annual report released on Tuesday. Small satellites, some no bigger than a shoe box, generated an 11 percent jump in annual revenue for Earth imagery in 2016 and a growing share of the 1,459 operating spacecraft that circled the planet at the end of the year, the report said. The orbital fleet includesÂ 499 satellites that weigh up to 1,323 pounds (600 kg), many of them used for Earth observation and remote sensing, said Carissa Christensen, chief executive of Bryce Technology and Space, which wrote the report for the trade association.Â  Satellite services, including home television, broadband and Earth observation services, collectively generated $127.7 billion of revenue in 2016, the biggest single piece of the industry, according to the report.Â  Satellites used for earth imagery accounted for just $2 billion of the total industry but accounted for 11 percent of the sectorâ€™s growth, according to the report. â€œThatâ€™s expected to continue to grow, given the new companies coming into the industry,â€� association President Tom Stroup said in an interview. The report found at least 33 dedicated small satellite launchers in development worldwide, including privately owned Rocket Lab, which debuted its Electron booster in May, and Richard Bransonâ€™s Virgin Orbit, which is expected to fly its LauncherOne rocket this year.Â  Revenue from Earth observation services would have been higher, but the launches of many small satellites were delayed after a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch pad accident in September 2016, the report said.Â  SpaceX, owned and operated by entrepreneur Elon Musk, returned its Falcon fleet to flight in January and has launched 10 times so far this year. In all, 126 satellites were launched last year, including 55 shoe-box-sized spacecraft known as CubeSats. About twice as many CubeSats were launched in 2015, the report said.Â  The number of small satellite launched during the first half of 2017 already has surpassed last yearâ€™s flight rate, Christensen said.  In February, a single Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket put 103 small satellites into orbit, along with a larger Earth-imaging spacecraft called Cartosat.

Money markets are nearly fully priced for a rate hike, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.  It sends a clear message to international investors that the Canadian economy is doing fine,  said Ian Nakamoto, equity specialist at MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier, a division of Raymond James.  Obviously, the Bank of Canada would not be raising rates if it thought it would cause a downturn in house prices.  Investors have worried that a downturn in the country's housing market, which had been red-hot in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, could weigh on the economy. Domestic data showed housing starts rose more than expected in June as construction plans in and around Toronto remained strong. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index closed up 43.86 points, or 0.29 percent, to 15,149.14. It was led by a 1.3 percent gain for the energy group as oil prices climbed. Suncor Energy rose 2.0 percent to C$37.26, while Canadian Natural Resources advanced 1.5 percent to C$37.50. U.S. crude oil futures settled 64 cents higher at $45.04 a barrel on reports showing forecast cuts in U.S. oil production and a decline in European product stockpiles. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.2 percent. Barrick Gold gained 0.9 percent to C$20.55 and Teck Resources Ltd climbed 3.8 percent to C$24.55. Gold futures rose 0.2 percent to $1,214.2 an ounce, while copper prices advanced 0.9 percent to $5,877 a tonne. Seven of the index's 10 main groups rose. It included a 0.1 percent gain for the financials group, which accounts for about 30 percent of the index. Shares of timber producers rose as wildfires in the western province of British Columbia disrupted timber and mining operations and forced thousands from their homes. Also on the upside, shares of Alimentation Couche Tard rose 1.4 percent to C$60.15 after TD Securities raised its target to C$78 from C$75.

The Mercy James Institute for Paediatric Surgery and Intensive Care located in Blantyre, Malawi's second-largest city, is the first such facility built in the country by Madonna's charity Raising Malawi.   We will ensure that not only will it be a world-class children's hospital, but also a superior center of learning. This is as much about healing as it is about empowerment,  Madonna said at the hospital's official opening. The singer adopted Malawian children David Banda and Mercy James in 2006 and 2009 respectively and twins Esther and Stella Mwale earlier this year. She has two other children, Lourdes and Rocco, from previous relationships.  Speaking at the event, Mercy James drew applause and ululation from the crowd after saying:  Many kids and many lives will be saved. Thank you mum, you're the bomb.  Madonna established the non-profit Raising Malawi charity in 2006 to provide health and education, particularly for girls. The charity has built 10 schools in Malawi, according to its website. Madonna criticized Malawi's slow pace of law reform, saying it nearly prevented her from adopting Mercy James. US singer Madonna embraces her adopted son, David Banda ahead of the opening of the Mercy James hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, July 11,2017. Reuters/Siphiwe Sibeko It was not an easy battle,  said Madonna as her voice cracked with emotion as she stood near her daughter.  The judge refused me because I was recently divorced. We hired lawyers, went to the Supreme Court. But I never gave up, I never backed down,  added the 58-year-old, who previously stirred anger among some Malawians as they felt the government allowed her to skirt laws that ban non-residents from adopting.   I fought for Mercy and won. We fought for this hospital and won. Love conquers all.  Slideshow (9 Images)Madonna then danced to a local song with Malawi's first lady Gertrude Mutharika. Mutharika, who attended the hospital's launch, said  Madonna is a symbol of a motherly spirit  and that the hospital was Malawi's  national pride.  The health minister Peter Kumpalume said the hospital will help save lives of newborns in a country where infant mortality is still one of the highest in the world, but steadily declining.  For our part, we will fully support the facility, we are bringing in doctors and drugs,  Kumpalume told Reuters. Malawi's infant mortality rate declined to 42 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016 from 135 deaths in 1992, government data shows.

The company made an operating loss in the second quarter and now only expects to break even at EBITA (earnings before interest, tax and amortisation) level in 2017, abandoning a previous target of raising its EBITA margin by 100 basis points from 0.4 percent. Bilfinger has slimmed down and regrouped under Blades, who was brought in after six profit warnings, four CEOs and multiple reorganisations in the space of two years amid a decline in the company's primary energy markets.  We are resolutely working through legacy projects,  Blades said in a statement. Blades brought in a new finance chief, Klaus Patzak, who started in October 2016. Bilfinger said in May that it had begun to take a  very selective approach  to higher-risk projects and had also begun to reduce selling and administrative expenses. Second-quarter orders were stable year-on-year and output - the value of work done - declined slightly, it said in a preliminary statement of results it is due to publish in detail on Aug. 14. Bilfinger confirmed its targets for a full-year organic increase in orders this year but a decline in output in a mid- to-high single-digit percentage range. It said a share buyback programme of up to 150 million euros would begin as planned this autumn. The Mannheim-based company confirmed its mid-term goals for an annual increase in output of at least 5 percent between 2017 and 2020, and a EBITA margin of around 5 percent by 2020. The 55 million euros ($63 million) in provisions for the U.S. projects were offset on a net-profit level by a legal case it won over a Doha expressway project, for which it was paid 60 million euros. Bilfinger, previously a storied name in German construction that was associated with the Munich Olympic stadium among other projects, lost out in a bet to focus on higher-margin services in the early years of this decade. Its main customers were energy utilities and petrochemical companies, which suffered badly and cut spending as the oil price went into decline. Its share price has dropped from a high of around 93 euros in April 2014 to 34.39 euros at Tuesday's close, although it has recovered by around a quarter since Blades started as CEO just over a year ago. The company's value, at 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion), is around half what it was when major shareholder Cevian began acquiring shares in 2011. The activist investor now owns about 30 percent of the company.

Stocks fell sharply in late-morning trading after emails disclosed by President Donald Trump's eldest son cited Russian support for his father's 2016 election campaign. The emails referred to a top Russian government prosecutor offering the Republican Trump campaign damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. But the market recovered later as U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a two-week delay in the Senate's August recess to provide more time to work on legislation and approve nominees, signaling prospects of progress on the Republican agenda.  It's a play off hope. We had something that might be negative and now we have something that might be positive,  said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. The Senate's delayed break  says to me there's a commitment to make some of the changes that the markets would like to see,  while Trump Jr's email exchange could put more focus on the Russia-related investigations that have overshadowed the White House, he said. Uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would be able to push through its agenda this year has weighed on the market, especially after repeated delays in getting a new health care bill passed.

Physical education for women is controversial in Saudi Arabia, where conservatives consider it immodest, and it is not mandatory. It has not been offered in most public schools.  Sports is empowerment,  said Lina Almaeena, a member of the advisory Shura Council who founded the kingdom's first female sports club, basketball team Jeddah United.  It's a historic announcement.  Saudi Arabia adheres to strict interpretations of Islamic law and tribal custom, requiring women to have male guardians and obey a modest dress code. They are barred from driving. However, the Saudi government has in recent years begun introducing gradual reforms to open new opportunities for women and expand their participation in the labor force. The Shura Council approved the introduction of physical education for girls in 2014, but the decision was never implemented as it faced opposition from clerics who decried it as  Westernisation . Earlier this year, the council opened the door to licensing women's gyms, which were previously in legal limbo.  One of our challenges was always the logistics. We didn't have sports facilities in schools. Another challenge was instructors, so now they've started on training the trainers,  said Almaeena. The government has appointed Princess Reema bint Bandar to lead a women's section of the national General Sports Authority. The kingdom sent two female athletes to the Olympics for the first time in 2012, and four to the 2016 games. Authorities have increasingly framed the issue of women's sport in health terms to overcome conservative objections. Saudi Arabia has high rates of obesity. According to the kingdom's Vision 2030 reform plan, introduced last year, only 13 percent of the Saudi population exercises at least once a week. The plan aims to boost that number to 40 percent.

American Querrey is no stranger to the big stage and 12 months ago he rose to the occasion by stunning then defending champion Novak Djokovic en route to the quarter-finals.

Women fleeing conflict or uprooted by disaster are desperate not to become pregnant when their lives are already at risk, said Ugochi Daniels of the United Nations Population Fund. Pregnancies are particularly dangerous during emergencies because of a lack of health services, and women may face an increased risk of sexual violence as well, experts told a global summit on family planning in London.  Family planning services should be implemented within 48 hours of an emergency, they said.  When we made family planning available at the same time as water, shelter and immunizations, the demand was extraordinary,  said Ashley Wolfington, senior reproductive health adviser at the International Rescue Committee aid agency. Limiting unintended pregnancies reduces deaths from obstetric complications and unsafe abortions, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Spacing out births also cuts the risk of infant mortality.  If we want to talk about saving lives, family planning is one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent mortality down the road,  Wolfington said.  It is even more critical in humanitarian settings than it might be in other settings.  Around a quarter of the estimated 128 million people in need of humanitarian assistance today are girls and women of reproductive age. But experts say family planning remains a massive gap in emergency responses due to a lack of prioritization and funding. Daniels told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that U.S. President Donald Tramp's decision to end funding to the UNFPA, the U.N. agency which deals with family planning, will have a significant impact. Services under threat would include the UNFPA's flagship program in the Zaatari camp in Jordan, home to some 80,000 refugees who have fled the war in Syria.  It's services that are saving women's lives that are under threat,  said Daniels, UNFPA's humanitarian lead.  (Trump) single-handedly has the power and the means to transform the lives of 26 million girls and women in humanitarian settings who don't have access to these services - he can make that difference,  she added. Daniels said 7,000 babies had been born in Zaatari since the crisis started with no loss of life.  She contrasted Zaatari with the northeast of Nigeria, where Boko Haram militants have caused massive displacement. Maternal morality rates in these areas are 10 times the national average partly due to the lack of reproductive and sexual health services, she said. Congolese refugee Mugisha Willet, who fled to a camp in Uganda as a child, told the summit she became pregnant at 17 because like most of her peers she knew nothing about reproductive health.  I felt a victim, not just because of the war but because I lost a future I had dreamed of,  said Willet, now 25, who said she had hoped to train as a lawyer.  Willet, a youth ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency, said there is a desperate need for information on reproductive health at Kjangwali camp.     Women are living with 10 children in one room. If women cannot feed their children they become malnourished,  she said.  If you have family planning you have fewer children and you can manage.   Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

Women fleeing conflict or uprooted by disaster are desperate not to become pregnant when their lives are already at risk, said Ugochi Daniels of the United Nations Population Fund. Pregnancies are particularly dangerous during emergencies because of a lack of health services, and women may face an increased risk of sexual violence as well, experts told a global summit on family planning in London.  Family planning services should be implemented within 48 hours of an emergency, they said.  When we made family planning available at the same time as water, shelter and immunizations, the demand was extraordinary,  said Ashley Wolfington, senior reproductive health adviser at the International Rescue Committee aid agency. Limiting unintended pregnancies reduces deaths from obstetric complications and unsafe abortions, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Spacing out births also cuts the risk of infant mortality.  If we want to talk about saving lives, family planning is one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent mortality down the road,  Wolfington said.  It is even more critical in humanitarian settings than it might be in other settings.  Around a quarter of the estimated 128 million people in need of humanitarian assistance today are girls and women of reproductive age. But experts say family planning remains a massive gap in emergency responses due to a lack of prioritization and funding. Daniels told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that U.S. President Donald Tramp's decision to end funding to the UNFPA, the U.N. agency which deals with family planning, will have a significant impact. Services under threat would include the UNFPA's flagship program in the Zaatari camp in Jordan, home to some 80,000 refugees who have fled the war in Syria.  It's services that are saving women's lives that are under threat,  said Daniels, UNFPA's humanitarian lead.  (Trump) single-handedly has the power and the means to transform the lives of 26 million girls and women in humanitarian settings who don't have access to these services - he can make that difference,  she added. Daniels said 7,000 babies had been born in Zaatari since the crisis started with no loss of life.  She contrasted Zaatari with the northeast of Nigeria, where Boko Haram militants have caused massive displacement. Maternal morality rates in these areas are 10 times the national average partly due to the lack of reproductive and sexual health services, she said. Congolese refugee Mugisha Willet, who fled to a camp in Uganda as a child, told the summit she became pregnant at 17 because like most of her peers she knew nothing about reproductive health.  I felt a victim, not just because of the war but because I lost a future I had dreamed of,  said Willet, now 25, who said she had hoped to train as a lawyer.  Willet, a youth ambassador for the U.N. refugee agency, said there is a desperate need for information on reproductive health at Kjangwali camp.     Women are living with 10 children in one room. If women cannot feed their children they become malnourished,  she said.  If you have family planning you have fewer children and you can manage.   Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

The nine-month offensive to recapture the northern city began in October, with thousands killed or displaced before Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory on Monday, three years after the militants seized the city.  Reuters has re-released a selection of pictures from the offensive along with our photographers' accounts of the events behind them. They can be seen by clicking: reut.rs/2sMj8og As U.S.-led coalition air strikes hit the Tahrir district of eastern Mosul in November, Reuters photographer Goran Tomasevic was on the streets and captured the panic from one strike that sent civilians fleeing for safety.  It was close and total panic ensued. People were screaming, ducking and running away,  he said. The air strikes aided the 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias who made ground against the militants, some of whom were manhandled when found hiding among civilians.  People run in panic after a coalition airstrike hit Islamic State fighters positions in Tahrir neighbourhood of Mosul, Iraq, November 17, 2016.Goran Tomasevic/File photoReuters photographer Alaa Al-Marjani captured the moment one suspect was  tossed into the bed of the pickup truck  in February during patrols in the west of the city. Other militants were shot on site. Tomasevic photographed over the shoulder of one Iraqi special forces soldier as he fired on an Islamic State suicide bomber in March. Slideshow (11 Images) I took the picture seconds later standing just behind the shooter in silhouette, with the suicide bomber visible through a shell hole in the house wall, dead on the ground in a spreading pool of blood,  he said.  It was pretty heavy stuff, extremely close-range war fighting.      The pain of the thousands of displaced families was captured by Zohra Bensemra, who photographed a fatigued 90-year-old woman in western Mosul, barely able to stand as she made her way to the Iraqi security forces area.  I felt bad because I could not do anything else for her apart from photographing her to show the world what physical and mental state the people who flee Mosul are in, Bensemra said. Other images showcase the relief and celebration among Iraqis, with Suhaib Salem photographing a smiling man having his beard shaved in March outside Hamam al-Alil camp after being forced to grow it long by Islamic State.

Virginia Wade was the last British woman to reach the last four in 1978, the year after she won the title. Halep's defeat cost her top spot in the world rankings as she was overhauled by Czech Karolina Pliskova, who was knocked out in the second round. The second-seeded Romanian would have become number one had she beaten sixth seed Konta. American Venus Williams rolled back the years to defeat Latvian Jelena Ostapenko in straight sets and will meet Konta in the semi-finals while Spain's Garbine Muguruza moved confidently into the last four by beating Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova. Muguruza, who is seeded 14th, will meet the unseeded Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia, who beat American Coco Vandeweghe 6-3 6-3 in a rain-delayed contest to reach the semi-finals of a grand slam for the first time.

The five-times champion, who turned 37 last month, tamed the big-hitting Latvian with a rock-solid performance under the Centre Court roof, winning with something to spare to book a semi-final against Britain's Johanna Konta. Ostapenko turned women's tennis upside down when she rocketed out of the pack to claim her first professional title at the French Open last month and the feisty 20-year-old appeared to be gathering momentum on the All England Club lawns. A rare French Open/Wimbledon double looked within reach for Ostapenko who had struck 121 winners en route to the last eight. But old maestro Williams, who had already schooled a 21-year-old and two teenagers en route to her 38th grand slam quarter-final, has seen it all before and barely flinched. There was a wobble when she dropped serve with a double-fault in the second set -- giving Ostapenko renewed belief -- but she never look ruffled as she reached the semi-finals here for the 10th time in 20 visits. Related CoverageFactbox: Highlights of Wimbledon eighth dayMaking her Centre Court debut Ostapenko was a little more subdued than normal but received a glowing report from the veteran of 75 grand slam campaigns.  She went for a lot of shots. She competed really well. She kept herself really in the game with her attitude. I thought she just did a lot of things really well and kept it close,  Williams, who made her Wimbledon debut in 1997, a few weeks after Ostapenko was born, told reporters.  I never played her. Didn't really know what to expect. I was really happy to come out on top.  Slow Start Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 11, 2017   Venus Williams of the U.S. celebrates winning the quarter final match against Latviaâ€™s Jelena OstapenkoTony O'BrienOstapenko, who three years ago served notice of her talent by winning the Wimbledon junior title, said she paid for the slow start which allowed Williams to sprint into a 3-0 lead.  I was missing a little bit,  Ostapenko, who tasted defeat for the first time in 12 grand slam singles matches, said.  I was not playing bad, but I was just not playing the way I wanted to play today. I wasn't serving so well.  Slideshow (8 Images)Ostapenko shoveled a backhand into the net in the second game to gift Williams a break and the American breezed through the opener in 29 minutes -- sealing it when Ostapenko completely missed an attempted service return. Williams secured an early break in the second set but a double-fault allowed Ostapenko to break back and briefly the Latvian livewire looked dangerous with some bludgeoning winners. Ostapenko was two points from squaring the match when 10th seed Williams served at 4-5 but narrowly missed the line with a forehand howitzer at 30-30, to the relief of her opponent. Williams capitalized on some errors to break in the next game and held to love to claim victory. Since winning Wimbledon in 2008, her seventh major, Williams has only reached the final here once, losing to Serena in 2009. Without her younger sibling for company this time, however, a sixth title beckons, although Konta will be a tough nut to crack with 15,000 home fans roaring her on.  I'm sure she's confident and determined,  Williams said.  She's probably dealing with a different kind of pressure playing here at home. But she seems to be handling it well.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in entering a judgment to enforce the $1.6 billion award, since reduced to about $188 million, announced in October 2014 by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It agreed with Venezuela's argument, which the U.S. government supported, that Exxon should have tried to enforce the award under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which offers more protections for sovereign defendants, rather than be permitted to use streamlined procedures.  Applying the FSIA will facilitate national uniformity in procedure,  Circuit Judge Susan Carney wrote.  Consistency as to enforcement seems to us importantly aligned with the values of predictability and federal control that foreign affairs demands and that the FSIA was designed to promote.  Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based oil company disagreed with the 3-0 decision and is considering its legal options. Venezuela and its U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case arose from Venezuela's seizure of Exxon assets in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba oil development ventures, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry. Exxon had made its investments on a joint-venture basis with the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA. According to court papers, an ICSID annulment committee on March 9 threw out nearly all of the arbitration award that concerned the Cerro Negro project, reducing Venezuela's payout to $188.3 million from $1.6 billion. Tuesday's decision voids a 2015 judgment by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan. The appeals court also said Exxon's petition should be dismissed without prejudice, allowing the company to seek enforcement in compliance with the FSIA. The case is Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd et al v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-707.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) says that for certain people without high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, diabetes or obesity, diet and exercise counseling might help prevent heart disease, although the benefit would likely be small.  Patients who express interest in these types of changes are most likely to benefit from those counseling opportunities,  said panel vice-chair Susan Curry, who is interim executive vice president and provost of the University of Iowa in Iowa City. The new recommendation from the USPSTF is a grade C, which means doctors should selectively offer the service based on an individual's circumstances. The finding is nearly unchanged since the panel last reviewed the evidence in 2012.  We were able to look at additional studies that have been published since the last recommendation,  Curry told Reuters Health.  The good news is that there were more studies to look at than in 2012, and that evidence confirms the recommendation we made last time.  The behavioral counseling can take many forms from mailings to face-to-face meetings, the panel writes in JAMA.  The reviewed studies examined the potential benefits of counseling about a healthy diet, physical activity or both. Heart-healthy diets generally focus on increasing the amount of fruits, vegetables, fiber and whole grains while decreasing the amount salt, fat and processed meats. Adults are also encouraged to get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise or a combination of the two each week. They should also take part in strength training exercises twice per week. Programs that focus on those behaviors were found to lead to better levels of heart risk factors like cholesterol and blood pressure, according to a review of the evidence published with the recommendation.      Curry said the recommendation regarding counseling for healthy people is for those who feel they could do better managing their diet and getting the right amount of exercise.  Those are the folks Iâ€™d be likely to refer to a behavioral counseling program,  she said. An editorial accompanying the new recommendation points out that all people should be concerned about poor heart health.  Indeed, the guideline also states that adults who adhere to national guidelines for a healthful diet and physical activity have lower rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than those who do not,  write Drs.

The Syrian national was shot dead during an operation launched after the army received intelligence that an Islamic State-linked cell was meeting, the security source said. A Lebanese national suspected of weapons smuggling was also arrested in the raid, and the army discovered several bombs, an explosive belt, and nearly 50 kg (110 pounds) of explosives, the source said.  The operation took place in the Arsal area, where the army says it has been carrying out a major security operation against suspected militants. In late June, authorities arrested several hundred people in raids on refugee camps in Arsal.

Picture taken September 21, 2016.Mohamed Azakir/File photoSome attacks in Lebanon have been linked to the six-year-old war in neighbouring Syria, where Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah is fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad. In a televised speech, Hezbollah's leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah praised the security campaign waged by the army and warned that time was running out for Syrian militants along the border area in Arsal to reach reconciliation deals with the Syrian authorities.

Haena Park, who established Phaetra Capital Management LP and Argenta Group LLC, cried as she expressed remorse to U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams before being sentenced.  I appear before you today ready to accept the consequences of my actions, which have devastated people I care about most in this world,  she said. According to court papers, Park, 41, solicited investments from friends, family and former Harvard University classmates by touting herself as an accomplished foreign-exchange currency trader who had generated annual returns of as high as 48.9 percent. In fact, Park's trading was consistently unsuccessful, and she lost $19.5 million of the $20 million she traded, mostly in highly leveraged futures and foreign exchange transactions, prosecutors said. Park generated fictitious account statements that showed investors were making money almost every month, prosecutors said. They said she hid her trading losses by returning $3 million to earlier investors from funds deposited by new investors. Park, who according to school records graduated from Harvard in 1998 with a psychology degree, was arrested in June 2016 and pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud in January. Park said at Tuesday's hearing that during the six years she carried out her fraud, she was  repeating to myself constantly that I'll turn the losses into gains and pay these people back.  Park's attorney, Julia Gatto, had argued earlier in the hearing that Park was a  fundamentally good person  who was overwhelmed by  a lifetime of family pressure, cultural pressure and internal pressure.  She asked for a sentence of 1-1/2 years of house arrest, noting that Park had serious health conditions and is currently pregnant. However, she acknowledged that such a sentence would be extraordinarily lenient.  I recognize how crazy it is to ask for house arrest in a case where the losses are over $20 million,  Gatto said. Prosecutors had asked for at least nine years. In imposing a lighter sentence, Abrams said she recognized that there were reasons for leniency, but that Park's conduct nonetheless warranted a  very substantial  sentence.  I still don't totally understand how you could do that,  the judge told Park.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fraud-park-idUSL1N1K21K3"},

In a match dripping with tension toward the business end of one of the most open women's grasscourt grand slams in years Konta rode a wave of home support to win 6-7(2) 7-6(5) 6-4.  The sixth seed and second-seeded Halep were facing each other for the first time since a turbulent Fed Cup tie in April. Serving up the only tennis show in town as the rain drummed down outside the roofed-in Centre Court and avoiding eye contact at changeovers, the pair also had the extra weight of history to contend with. Konta, working hard to keep her opponent pinned behind the baseline, was bidding to book a date with Venus Williams on Thursday as the first home semi-finalist since Virginia Wade in 1978, the year after Wade won the title. Halep, scampering from wing to wing as she soaked up the pressure, was one match from becoming the first Romanian to top the computerized world rankings - a distinction that, following her defeat, passed to Czech Karolina Pliskova. The refined surroundings of the main showcourt were a world away from the tiny stadium on the Black Sea where the two players last met, Halep winning that encounter in straight sets. Konta became tearful during her other singles match in that Fed Cup tie, against Sorana Cirstea, blaming what she called a hostile reception from Romanian fans who Halep this week described as  very fair . On Tuesday the Australia-born Briton struggled to take it all in too -- but for altogether different reasons.  Right now it's a little bit surreal,  she told the BBC after sealing victory in just under two-and-three-quarter hours.  Simona... was really not going to give me much for free so I definitely had to be the one out there to create my own chances and I felt I did that.  Konta said she was  excited and humble  to be facing Venus Williams, a match that Wade predicted the Briton would win. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 11, 2017   Great Britainâ€™s Johanna Konta celebrates during her quarter final match against Romaniaâ€™s Simona HalepTony O'Brien Itâ€™s fine to be the last British womenâ€™s winner (at) ...Wimbledon, but itâ€™s better to have plenty of British players to win,  Wade said in comments released by the All England Club.   If I get a chance I will tell (Johanna) how well she played and wish her good luck.       Final Scream The match closed on a surreal note, when the final point was punctuated by a spectator's scream, Halep lamely netting a forehand as she appealed in vain for a let. Slideshow (8 Images)In a nod to that episode, Konta described the crowd as incredible, adding: I think they were a little over-enthusiastic in parts, but I definitely cannot complain with the amount of support and general good feeling they were wishing my way.     Defying the cheers and cries of  C'mon Jo  echoing around the arena, where only the Royal Box had seats to spare, Halep shaded the early exchanges. She pounced on any error and broke serve to lead 3-0 as the sixth-seeded Briton, close to brimming over with nervous energy, struggled to keep her searing groundstrokes in court. But Konta fought back, cranking up her serve and winning eight straight points to draw level at 4-4. Halep won the first set on a tiebreak with Konta, having squandered a clutch of break points, returning the favor in the second. The intensity moved up a notch in the third set before Konta broke in the fifth game and held her nerve to serve the match out. The stadium erupted and, out on Henman Hill, the umbrellas of the fans massed in front of the big screen twirled.  We've been to every (other) Konta match,  said Glenda Powell from Farnham.  She gives the British people heart.  Reporting by John Stonestreet; editing by Ken Ferris","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-konta-idUSKBN19W2AB"},

Donald Trump Jr. was told a Russian prosecutor was offering his father's presidential campaign incriminating information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as part of Russian government support, according to an email chain that he released on Tuesday.  At the very least, these types of headlines play up concerns about dysfunction in Washington and the inability of this administration to pass any meaningful legislation, particularly related to fiscal stimulus,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth FX in Washington. U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that the Senate would vote on a bill to roll back Obamacare next week and then move on to other legislative business. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, turned negative on the day to trade down 0.28 percent at 95.751, after hitting 95.651, its lowest since July 3. Investors are waiting for U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semiannual monetary policy testimony before Congress on Wednesday and U.S. consumer inflation data on Friday. Meanwhile, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said the Fed should soon begin reducing its balance sheet, as long as economic data on U.S. jobs and growth holds up. Once balance sheet reduction is under way, she will assess inflation before deciding on further interest rates rises, she said. The greenback, which touched a four-month high against the Japanese yen earlier in the session spurred by the recent rise in U.S. government bond yields, reversed course to fall 0.16 percent to 113.85 yen. The euro rose to a 14-month high of $1.1479. The Canadian dollar slipped against its U.S. counterpart as traders awaited an interest rate hike decision by the Bank of Canada on Wednesday. The greenback gained against the New Zealand dollar as rising U.S. yields, soft commodity prices and a disappointing report on domestic credit card spending sent investors fleeing kiwi assets. Sterling fell to an eight-month low against the euro after the Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent declined to back up recent hints from other policymakers at the central bank that suggested it may be moving toward raising interest rates.

Takata air bag inflators are already linked to 17 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide, and the recalls will eventually cover about 125 million inflators. The auto safety agency said new testing is prompting the recall of some driver-side air bags built from 2015 through 2012. Nissan said it will recall 627,000 Versa cars from 2007-2012 model years, including 515,000 in the United States  out of an abundance of caution.  It will notify owners within 60 days with additional instructions.     Ford spokesman John Cangany said the issue covers about 2.2 million Ford vehicles, and the company has five days to respond to the Takata filing. The automaker is  aware of Takataâ€™s submission, and we have been in regular contact with the agency on the issue. Importantly, we arenâ€™t aware of any incidents, and test data doesnâ€™t suggest any issues,  he said.  Mazda said the new recall impacts just 6,000 B-series trucks. FILE PHOTO: A woman stands next to a logo of Takata Corp at a showroom for vehicles in Tokyo, Japan,  November 6, 2015.Toru Hanai/File PhotoMore than 65 percent of 46.2 million previously recalled Takata airbag inflators in the United States have not been repaired. The issue is the largest ever auto safety recall covering 17 automakers. Takata filed for bankruptcy protection in June. Takata inflator ruptures occur after long-term exposure to high humidity, NHTSA has said. Prior Takata recalls have involved air bag inflators without a drying agent. The new 2.7 million air bag inflators being recalled involve a drying agent, but Takata said testing showed ruptures could still take place.  Takata has told the public that their line of air bag inflators with moisture absorbent was safe. This recall now raises serious questions about the threat posed by all of Takataâ€™s ammonium nitrate-based airbags,  U.S. Senator Bill Nelson said in a statement.  If even more are found to be defective, it will take us from the biggest recall ever to something that could become mind-boggling.  Honda Motor Co (7267.T) said Monday it had confirmed an 11th U.S. death involving one of its vehicles tied to a faulty Takata air bag inflator. Takata expects to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide, including more than 60 million in the United States, Scott Caudill, chief operating officer of TK Holdings, Takata's U.S. unit, said in June.

Larry Nassar, once a team doctor for Olympians at USA Gymnastics and a former employee at Michigan State University, pleaded guilty to receiving child pornography, possession of child pornography and destruction and concealment of records, according to a plea agreement filed at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan in Grand Rapids.  Nassar originally pleaded not guilty in December 2016, court records show. An attorney for Nassar did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. More than a dozen female athletes sued Nassar in January, saying he sexually assaulted them under the guise of medical examinations over two decades when most were minors.  The lawsuit says Michigan State University failed to act on complaints about Nassar from two of the plaintiffs in 1999 and 2000. It also says USA Gymnastics, the U.S. governing body for the sport, failed to alert Michigan State when it learned about Nassar's alleged misconduct in 2015. In response to abuse allegations, USA Gymnastics launched an investigation resulting in a report last month calling for prioritizing athlete safety over medals. Both receiving and possession of child pornography are punishable by between five and 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000. Destruction of records is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000.  Between 2003 and 2016, Nassar  knowingly possessed thousands of images and videos of child pornography,  Tuesday's plea agreement said.  In September 2016, when Nassar was aware that law enforcement was investigating him, he paid a computer service store to erase the contents of his laptop. He also threw away a number of hard drives, which were later recovered by authorities.  He took these actions  with the intent to impede and obstruct  the investigation, the plea agreement said.   In return for the plea, federal authorities agreed not to prosecute Nassar for sexual exploitation and attempted sexual exploitation of children for an unspecified incident alleged to have happened in Nassar's swimming pool in 2015 involving two unidentified children, the plea agreement said. Authorities will also not prosecute Nassar for engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places for unspecified incidents that allegedly happened between 2006 and 2013 with two unidentified children, the plea agreement said.

Forestry products are a significant driver of the economy of British Columbia, which bills itself as the world's biggest exporter of softwood lumber, a product targeted by new U.S. tariffs in April as a trade dispute escalated. Pockets of fires across the western province intensified last Friday and have since covered more than 38,000 hectares (93,900 acres). They have forced more than 14,000 people from their homes, disrupted mining and forestry operations and damaged public utilities. Wood prices can rise as high as 6 percent if operations remain shut for weeks but the higher cost, a small part of construction budgets, will be absorbed by builders and is unlikely to affect home buyers, Bank of Montreal analyst Ketan Mamtora said in an interview. Forestry companies that have suspended production include West Fraser Timber Co and privately held Tolko, among the largest Canadian producers, and Norbord Inc, the world's largest maker of oriented strand board, a plywood-like material used in house building. Mamtora said West Fraser's shutdown represents a loss of about 6.7 percent of interior British Columbia's lumber production and 13.8 percent of Canada's plywood production, while Norbord's shut mill represents 5.6 percent of Canadian production of oriental strand board. The companies said the facilities were shut due to evacuation orders and nearby fires, although the sites themselves were not burned. James Armstrong of Armstrong Investment Research said the shutdowns will exacerbate the low supply for an already tight market.  The question is what happens longer term,  he said.  We don't know what happens with the fire yet. Longer term, if it misses the mill and doesn't do much, it probably won't have a huge impact.  Mamtora said prices could increase up to 14 percent if the sites remain shut for months. The fires broke out some 14 months after a wildfire in Fort McMurray in neighboring Alberta province displaced 88,000 people and burned 590,000 hectares. British Columbia on Friday declared its first state of emergency since 2003. Authorities said at least 10 of more than 200 fires burning across the province were close to residential communities, although no deaths or serious injuries have been reported.

Doctors need to be aware that while PAP may provide symptomatic relief for sleep apnea, it is unlikely to provide protection against cardiovascular events or death,â€� the study's senior author Bruce Neal from UNSW Sydney in Australia told Reuters Health by email. PAP is commonly used to treat sleep apnea, but it remains unclear whether PAP alters the risk of vascular disease and death in these patients, the study team writes in JAMA. Neal's team analyzed data on adults with sleep apnea from 10 randomized clinical trials that included a total of 7,266 patients. In these trials, PAP was not significantly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attack, major adverse cardiovascular events plus hospitalization for unstable angina, cardiovascular death, all-cause death, non-cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure. Four trials did hint that people who used PAP at least four hours per night might have improved cardiovascular outcomes, but the results didn't reach a statistically meaningful threshold. â€œTwo points here: first, while itâ€™s an intuitively appealing finding, it is statistically rather weak,â€� Neal said. â€œSecond, good adherence is hard to achieve with current therapeutic options for PAP. If a new, very well-tolerated mode of PAP therapy is identified, it would be really helpful to do a large outcome trial to try and confirm this tantalizing observation.â€�  While PAP did not improve blood pressure, body mass index, blood lipids, blood sugar or overall quality of life, it was associated with improvements in sleepiness and some measures of physical and mental wellbeing.  Based on the available evidence,  the researchers conclude,  it is reasonable to recommend PAP therapy for the improvement of symptoms in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) but not for protection against vascular disease or death.  â€œPatients with sleep apnea, who are often at increased cardiovascular risk, need rigorous management with other indicated therapies, such as blood pressure lowering, statins, and antithrombotic drugs,â€� Neal said.   I think the most interesting finding of the meta-analysis is that the best estimate of the effect of obstructive sleep apnea treatment on risk of major adverse cardiovascular events is very similar to the reduction in risk seen with aspirin, beta-blockers, or statin medications,  said Dr. Daniel J. Gottlieb from VA Boston Healthcare System and Harvard Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial.      That this was not statistically significant reflects the small number of patients entered in clinical trials up to this point,â€� he told Reuters Health by email.    â€œI don't think these findings should have a major impact on CPAP prescribing,â€� Gottlieb said. â€œThe main reason for treatment of CPAP remains control of symptoms, especially excessive sleepiness. Whether treatment of OSA will reduce cardiovascular risk remains an unanswered question.â€� Most studies included in this analysis showed that patients are not using their CPAP machine as long as they should, noted Dr. Haitham Al Ashry from The Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, which may explain the study results.  However, when authors looked at patients who wore their CPAP  more than four hours, they found decreased risk of death, heart attacks, and stroke, which is in concert with a similar analysis we published recently in the American Journal of Cardiology,â€� he told Reuters Health by email.  â€œI think physicians should continue to do their due diligence in counseling patients about the importance of adherence to CPAP,â€� Al Ashry said. â€œIt is clear from this paper that cardiovascular benefits may be lost if CPAP is worn less than four hours. This is consistent with Medicare criteria that define patientsâ€™ compliance with CPAP as wearing the machine at least four hours each night for 70 percent of the nights.â€�  SOURCE: bit.ly/2sM80Ii and bit.ly/2v9uovR JAMA, online July 11, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-apnea-cpap-heart-idUSKBN19W2HK"},

In recent months U.S. inflation has moved further below the Fed's 2 percent target even as the labor market, as measured by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, has strengthened.  That disconnect has vexed policymakers, but Yellen has said the retreat in price pressures is likely temporary and signaled she is prepared to continue with rate hikes and a plan to start trimming the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.  The Fed raised rates last month to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.   Fed Governor Lael Brainard supported the June rate rise and on Tuesday embraced the plan to reduce the balance sheet  soon,  but suggested her support for any future rate increases will depend in part on how inflation shapes up.   I will want to monitor inflation developments carefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to help guide inflation back up around our symmetric target,  Brainard said, adding that she believes rates may need to top out near 2 percent, which would give the Fed little room to raise them further.  At a separate event on Tuesday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said he finds it hard to believe that the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating when wage growth is so low.  Government data on Friday showed wage growth of just 2.5 percent annually in June.   I am looking for that wage growth as an indicator that, okay, maybe the economyâ€™s overheating, maybe now we are going to start seeing inflation, maybe thatâ€™s going to lead us to need to raise interest rates,  Kashkari told the Minnesota Women's Economic Roundtable.  Kashkari this year voted against each of the Fed's rate hikes.   It canâ€™t be that bad to find workers because if you really were having to compete with other companies to find the scarce talent, we would see wages climbing, and we are not seeing wages climbing very quickly,  he said.  Kashkari said that when businesses tell him they cannot find skilled workers, he tells them to provide training and to pay more.   The bottom line from my perspective is if there are good opportunities for your business, you will raise wages you will attract workers and you will grow your company,  he said. The Fed's next policy meeting is on July 25-26.

Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist, at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, said those comments sounded like both officials were leaning toward a pause in the Fed's tightening, after raising rates twice so far this year. He added that chances of a December rate hike were now down to 50-50 percent again, after hitting 60-40 percent last week in favor of a rate hike.     Long-dated yields also dipped after President Donald Trump's eldest son released an email chain, which referred to a top Russian government prosecutor as offering the Trump campaign damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.                   This suggests that allegations the Trump campaign colluded with Russia are not yet settled,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York.  At the margin, this draws attention away from President Trump's economic agenda.      The market's focus, however, remained on Yellen, who will  deliver her semi-annual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.      Investors will be looking to Yellen for clues on when the Fed will start reducing its massive balance sheet.       In late trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yielded 2.364 percent            , down slightly from 2.371 percent late on Monday.      Yields on U.S. Treasuries with maturities from 2 to 10 years were also modestly lower.     U.S. 30-year yields             were at 2.924 percent, compared with Monday's 2.923 percent.      The Treasury's auction of $24 billion in three-year notes, meanwhile, was mixed. The note fetched a high yield of 1.573 percent, just below the 1.576 percent rate at the bid deadline.      Bids totaled nearly $68.9 billion for a 2.87 bid-to-cover ratio, a little below last month's 3.00, but slightly higher than the 2.80 average.

Planned months ago, the U.S. missile defense test over the Pacific Ocean has gained significance after North Korea's July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) heightened concerns about the threat from Pyongyang. The test was the first-ever of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system against an incoming IRBM, which experts say is a faster and more difficult target to hit than shorter-range missiles.  The U.S. Missile Defense Agency said the IRBM was designed to behave similarly to the kinds of missiles that could threaten the United States.  The successful demonstration of THAAD against an IRBM-range missile threat bolsters the country's defensive capability against developing missile threats in North Korea and other countries,  the Missile Defense Agency said in a statement. The successful THAAD test adds to the credibility of the U.S. military's missile defense program, which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years, including because of test delays and failures. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, noted in a May report that the Missile Defense Agency had not previously tested THAAD against an IRBM, despite having deployed the system to the island of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, in 2013 amid concerns about North Korea's missile program.  That means that, until the latest test, the THAAD system had an unproven capability against IRBMs, missiles that have a range of between 1,800 and 3,100 miles (3,000 to 5,500 km). Guam is approximately 2,100 miles (3,400 km) from North Korea. Related CoverageChina envoy says North Korea trade growth picture 'distorted'In order to hit the mainland United States, North Korea would need to fire an ICBM, which is defined as a missile with a range greater than 3,400 miles (5,500 km).   100 Percent Track Record In the latest test, a THAAD in Kodiak, Alaska, intercepted a ballistic missile target that was air-launched from a C-17 aircraft flying north of Hawaii, the Missile Defense Agency said in a statement. A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the test took place early on Tuesday. This success leaves THAAD with a 100 percent track record for all 14 intercept attempts since flight testing began just over a decade ago.  Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the prime contractor for the THAAD system, said it could intercept incoming missiles both inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere. The United States deployed THAAD to South Korea this year to guard against North Korea's shorter-range missiles. That has  drawn fierce criticism from China, which says the system's powerful radar can probe deep into its territory. Earlier this month Moscow and Beijing, in a joint statement, called on Washington to immediately halt deployment of THAAD in South Korea. The statement said Washington was using North Korea as a pretext to expand its military infrastructure in Asia and risked upsetting the strategic balance of power in the region.   THAAD's success rate in testing is far higher than the one for America's Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, which is designed to shoot down an ICBM headed for the U.S. mainland. That GMD system has only a 55 percent success rate over the life of the program, stoking fierce criticism from groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit science advocacy group.  But advocates say the technology has improved dramatically in recent years. The GMD system successfully shot down an incoming, simulated North Korean ICBM in a test in May.   That led the Pentagon to upgrade its assessment of the United States' ability to defend against a small number of ICBMs, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. A ground-based missile defense system, THAAD is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. John Schilling, a contributor to 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, downplayed the idea that THAAD might be seen as a backup to hit a longer range ICBM, saying that THAAD was not designed to hit missiles traveling so fast.  To engage an ICBM with THAAD would be like asking a high school baseball player to hit a fastball from a major-league pitcher - literally out of his league,  Schilling said. The Missile Defense Agency told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011.

Kelleher,Donald J. Trump,J. CHRISTOPHER GIANCARLO,James McDonald,Jay,Jimmy Fokas,John J. Carney,Mary Jo White,Richard Satran,Sally Yates,Shlomo Salant,Steve Obie,BC,FINREG,CFTC,REGULATORY,EASE","sector":"Subjects","content":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The Commodity Futures Trading Commissionâ€™s non-prosecution deal with three former Citigroup traders for cooperating in an investigation of their past employer gave one of the clearest signs yet of the direction the Trump administration will take in enforcement actions. The case shows U.S. agenciesâ€™ new willingness to strike such agreements in prosecuting complicated cases. The case reflects a shift at the agency, which is expected to be followed by other regulators in using the kind of cooperation agreements that have been used for years by the U.S. Justice Department in criminal cases. But some are skeptical whether the new focus on cooperation agreements with individuals will produce high-level prosecutions and instead see it being used as an excuse to pull back from the costly penalties firms paid that allowed the top executives to avoid personal culpability.  Most agree, however, that the era of multi-billion dollar settlements is drawing to a close. The top level appointees at regulatory agencies have criticized such deals as punishing shareholders and doing little to change bad behavior.  The Cftc Case: How It Might Work The CFTC case provided a model of how new enforcement might shift, and the agency cited it as the first-ever non-prosecution deal based on a new policy laid out in January. The agency said three former traders, Jeremy Lao and Shlomo Salant of New York, and Daniel Liao of Japan, cooperated in a probe of illegal â€œspoofing.â€�  While the three were involved in the alleged illegal acts they â€œreadily admitted their own wrongdoing, identified misconduct of others, and provided other valuable information, all of which expedited our investigation and strengthened our cases against the other wrongdoers,â€� the CFTC said. With their help the agency settled charges with Citigroup for $25 million and with two other traders, Stephen Gola and Jonathan Brim, who paid fines of $350,000 and $200,000, respectively, and were banned for six months. â€œFor many types of complex cases, there is simply no substitute for cooperating witnesses, who can tell the inside story of the fraud or misconduct at issue,â€� said CFTC Director of Enforcement James McDonald. Legal and compliance experts are awaiting more signs of how the cooperation agreements will be used and for guidelines on how to participate in the programs. Will Higher-Level Execs Be  Turned Out ? Still to be seen, however, are any use of cooperation agreements to make cases against top managers. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has expressed continuing support for the goal of the Yates memo. Issued two years ago by former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, the memo directed U.S. criminal prosecutors to pursue charges against individuals and withhold cooperation credit for firms that do not assist in pursuing those responsible.  Sessions has voiced support for the strategy even though President Donald Trump fired Yates as acting interim attorney general for her refusal to support U.S. enforcement of the travel ban from Muslim countries. Steve Obie, a partner with Jones Day, said the new policy, which has been in effect at the Justice Department, â€œis still evolving at agencies. The agencies need to be able to define what is required to get these kinds of agreements and who will qualify. Since this is novel, more clarity will come about as more agreements are made.â€� Looking Through  Broken Windows   Whatever happens with individual prosecutions, legal experts anticipate a shift away from so-called  Broken Window  violations that former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White championed. The strategy of following small violations led to larger cases settled with multi-million dollar fines by banks and brokers.  The CFTC, headed by acting Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, a Republican appointee who has been heading the agency since the start of the year, and was on the job well before the SECâ€™s new chief, Clayton, was seen heading the  sea change  for enforcement.  The CFTC followed up its non-prosecution case with the Citigroup traders with a decision to take no action against another Wall Street firm was seen as another signal of regulators easing up on minor reporting infractions. The agency last week granted no-action relief(here) that exempted Cantor Fitzgerald and the North American Derivatives Exchange, known as NADEX, from reporting requirements on binary options for which the regulatory requirements were unclear to some in the market. Sec's Non-Prosecutions Already in Effect  The SEC has had a similar non-prosecution initiative in place for three years but has used the tactic in only a handful of cases of employees or firms coming forward in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations. The non-prosecution agreements are expected to be used more at the SEC once Clayton exerts his authority.  â€œWhat we are hearing from (newly seated SEC Chairman Jay) Claytonâ€™s testimony and statements attributed to him is that the move might certainly be away from that,â€� said Jimmy Fokas, partner in BakerHostetlerâ€™s white collar defense and corporate investigations practice. The agency appears set â€œto move more toward (prosecuting) individual wrongdoers and moving away from the large civil penalties seen in recent years.â€� The legal and compliance community will be watching closely to see whether the change in enforcement is a tactical move to offer non-prosecutions as a way to win cases against higher-level individuals at firms, or a strategy by the Trump administration to get a quick win in easing regulation by pulling back enforcement.  Enforcement Disclosures Seen as Vague President Donald Trumpâ€™s initial measures â€” executive orders and proposed regulation â€” were seen having little immediate impact. The levers of enforcement may simply be a much quicker way for the executive branch to ease regulatory constraints.  The moves have drawn criticism because there have been few public disclosures and policies have changed with little public comment. The CFTC has offered the guidance(here) that individuals can win cooperation based on: -- the value of the cooperation to the Divisionâ€™s investigation(s) and enforcement action(s); -- the value of the cooperation to the Commissionâ€™s broader law enforcement interests; -- the culpability of the company or individual and other relevant factors; and -- uncooperative conduct that offsets or limits credit that the company or individual would otherwise receive. Those guidelines are vague, said some critics, since  broader interests  and  relevant factors  offer little clarity on how to win non-prosecutions. The SEC has offered similar guidelines for its programs(here). The SEC has been considering boosting incentives for individuals and firms to cooperate in exchange for non-prosecution, legal sources have said. The agency declined to comment. Big Fish Not on Menu Yet The inability of financial regulators to press cases against individuals has been a source of criticism for years, said Dennis M. Kelleher, president and chief executive officer of Better Markets, an investor advocacy group. Letting companies â€œpay millions of dollars of shareholders money to settle a case with no admission of wrongdoingâ€� did little to demonstrate a serious effort to root out the sources of fraud and corruption, he said. â€œSome of the talk I am hearing makes it seem that the pendulum may already have swung too far in the other direction,â€� Dennis Kelleher said. â€œJust as punishing shareholders and letting individuals off the hook is unwise, so is letting companies off the hook entirely. You need a proper mix of holding individuals meaningfully accountable and making sure companies are incentivized to police individuals. Itâ€™s a balancing act,â€� he added. Legal, Compliance Community Watching Legal and compliance experts say it is early days but the methods are changing and the result will depend on how the cases translate to higher-level convictions.  While the trend is beginning to emerge, the extent of change the Trump administration brings to enforcement cases against individuals remains to be seen, said John J. Carney, Partner, Co-Leader of BakerHostetler's white collar defense and corporate investigations practice team.  The agencies move slowly like â€œbattleships turning,â€� he said. â€œ We will have to watch what happens in the six months and the first year and analyze it to get a better view.

In recent months U.S. inflation has moved further below the Fed's 2 percent target even as the labor market, as measured by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, has strengthened.  That disconnect has vexed policymakers, but Yellen has said the retreat in price pressures is likely temporary and signaled she is prepared to continue with rate hikes and a plan to start trimming the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.  The Fed raised rates last month to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent.   Fed Governor Lael Brainard supported the June rate rise and on Tuesday embraced the plan to reduce the balance sheet  soon,  but suggested her support for any future rate increases will depend in part on how inflation shapes up.   I will want to monitor inflation developments carefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to help guide inflation back up around our symmetric target,  Brainard said, adding that she believes rates may need to top out near 2 percent, which would give the Fed little room to raise them further.  At a separate event on Tuesday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said he finds it hard to believe that the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating when wage growth is so low.  Government data on Friday showed wage growth of just 2.5 percent annually in June.   I am looking for that wage growth as an indicator that, okay, maybe the economyâ€™s overheating, maybe now we are going to start seeing inflation, maybe thatâ€™s going to lead us to need to raise interest rates,  Kashkari told the Minnesota Women's Economic Roundtable.  Kashkari this year voted against each of the Fed's rate hikes.   It canâ€™t be that bad to find workers because if you really were having to compete with other companies to find the scarce talent, we would see wages climbing, and we are not seeing wages climbing very quickly,  he said.  Kashkari said that when businesses tell him they cannot find skilled workers, he tells them to provide training and to pay more.   The bottom line from my perspective is if there are good opportunities for your business, you will raise wages you will attract workers and you will grow your company,  he said.

Africa's second-largest copper producer, is usually seen as one of the continent's more stable democracies. But it has been on a political knife-edge since the detention in April on treason charges of Hakainde Hichilema, who narrowly lost to President Edgar Lungu in a bruising election last year.  Lungu invoked the emergency powers last week to deal with  acts of sabotage  by his political opponents, after fire gutted the country's biggest marketplace. On Tuesday, Zambian lawmakers voted to extend the state of emergency by another 90 days to give law enforcement agencies  enhanced measures  to curb  rising cases of politically motivated fires and vandalism of vital electricity supply lines .  The measures ... were deemed necessary to restore public order,  Lungu's aide, Amos Chanda, said in a statement. Chanda said civil liberties such as free movement had not been suspended and businesses would be allowed to operate as normal. Lungu's move last week to impose emergency laws came within a day of the fire that destroyed part of City Market in the capital Lusaka. Nobody was killed or injured in the blaze, which the president said  bordered on economic sabotage  and was aimed at making the country ungovernable.  Police have said some people also planned to vandalise  installations including bridges and power stations. They said one person was taken into custody for trying to torch a bus station and they were seeking others who vandalised electricity transmission lines near the capital last month. Hichilema, leader of the United Party for National Development, was arrested in April at his home and accused of trying to overthrow the government. An economist and businessman widely known by his initials  HH , Hichilema was defeated last August by Lungu in an election the opposition politician denounced as fraudulent.

They say her desire to show her commitment to freedom of speech backfired. On Monday, members of Merkel's conservatives sought to turn the blame back onto Germany's left-wing parties. Some suggested that Hamburg's SPD mayor, Olaf Scholz, should resign for failing to stem the violence.  Olaf Scholz is not responsible for the staging of this summit,  Gabriel told the Funke newspaper group in an interview for publication on Wednesday.  Whoever wants his resignation ... must also demand the resignation of Angela Merkel.  She carries the political responsibility for the staging and direction of the G20 summit in Hamburg, which had a secret goal: the self-promotion of the CDU leader shortly before the election,  he added. Gabriel's comments drew a sharp rebuke from Andreas Scheuer, general secretary of the Christian Social Union, sister party to the CDU.  Gabriel has blown a fuse,  he told the newspaper Bild. Merkel was more relaxed about Gabriel's remarks, saying she was pleased that the foreign minister had accompanied her to the summit and contributed to its success, adding she was sure the coalition with the SPD would hold until the election. Speaking at an event in the western city of Essen, Merkel said the G20 had to take place in a large urban area due to the size of the delegations.  A country like Germany must be in the position to hold such summits,  she said. About 20,000 police struggled to contain several hundred demonstrators who torched cars, looted shops and hurled Molotov cocktails and stones during the July 7-8 summit. Almost 500 officers were injured. In a poll published earlier on Tuesday and conducted before the G20, Merkel's CDU was leading at 39 percent, with the SPD down a point to 22 percent. Gabriel said the G20 summit had been a  total failure  with respect to the big topics affecting humanity - war, civil war, flight, hunger and poverty.  But unfortunately today we have to be satisfied if the 20 heads of state of the rich countries can just meet and it doesn't get even worse. So much for a success,  he said.

U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a two-week delay in the Senate's August recess to provide more time to work on legislation and approve nominees.  It says to me there's a commitment to make some of the changes that the markets would like to see,  Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. The S&P 500 was still down slightly, but well off its low of the day, which followed the release of an email chain from President Donald Trump's eldest son. The emails referred to a top Russian government prosecutor offering the Republican Trump campaign damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  There was a knee-jerk reaction to the Trump Jr emails, but it's a not a problem today, so the reaction was overstated,  McMillan said. Uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would be able to push through its agenda this year have weighed on the market, especially after repeated delays in getting a new health care bill passed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.32 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,416.84, the S&P 500 had lost 2.52 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,424.91 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 10.83 points, or 0.18 percent, to 6,187.22. Energy led gains, with a 0.6 percent increase. Upcoming congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen could shed more light on the pace of U.S. monetary tightening. Yellen will deliver her semi-annual monetary policy testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. Snap Inc shares fell 8.1 percent, after lead underwriter Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock and raised concerns about the social media company's ability to compete against rival Instagram. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The world number 87, who describes her Wimbledon adventure as a  fairy tale , did not allow the disruption to shake her form or focus and produced a sparkling display of grasscourt tennis to close out the quarter-final against the American.  Rybarikova is the lowest-ranked player for almost a decade to reach the women's last four, where she will face Spain's 14th seed Garbine Muguruza, and the first Slovak to do so.  I can't believe it,  she told the BBC, looking stunned after her victory.  I cannot believe I am a Wimbledon semi-finalist. I need to sleep on it to believe it.  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 11, 2017   Slovakiaâ€™s Magdalena Rybarikova celebrates winning the quarter final match against Coco Vandeweghe of the U.S.Andrew CouldridgeHer quarter-final match started on Court One, but was suspended shortly after 4 pm due to rain, with the score at 2-2 in the second set. With no sign of the weather turning, the match was moved to Centre Court, the only court with a roof.  Play resumed at about 7.20 pm and 28-year-old Rybarikova raced to the finish line. Slideshow (2 Images)The match was a thoroughly entertaining tussle and threw up a rare sight in the women's game -- two players willing to abandon the security of the baseline and charge to the net in the heat of battle. They even used serve-and-volley on occasion. Big-hitting Vandeweghe's downfall was the careless mistakes that beset her game throughout, leaving her increasingly frustrated. The 25-year-old American, seeded 24, notched up 30 unforced errors compared with her opponent's eight, and double-faulted several times on crucial points. It has been a dream run for Rybarikova, who was out of action for the second half of 2016 due to wrist and knee surgery. The last time a woman ranked lower reached a Wimbledon semi-final was in 2008 -- China's Zheng Jie, ranked 133.

The hedge-fund chief's Elliott Management has cobbled a proposal to extract Texas electricity provider Energy Future Holdings from bankruptcy, challenging Berkshire Hathaway's $9 billion deal. Even if the rival plan is a stretch, the Oracle of Omaha famously eschews competitive processes. Berkshire Hathaway Energy cleverly wooed regulators, who had been unhappy with two previous overtures from NextEra Energy and Hunt Consolidated. Buffett's enterprise intends to wind up with Energy Future's coveted 80 percent stake in transmission utility Oncor. The cash offer is less than what NextEra put forward. Even so, Buffett is providing a seamless exit path from bankruptcy into a fortified parent company that promises to reinvest all profit back into the business. Elliott's proposal values the companies holding the Oncor stake slightly higher, at $9.3 billion excluding debt, but at this stage it's squishier. Part of the deal includes swapping debt for equity. It also needs additional backers. What's more, it may cost $270 million to terminate the Buffett plan. These factors could make it harder for Elliott to persuade a judge that its idea is superior. That won't necessarily stop Elliott from exerting leverage. For one thing, the hedge fund surely knows how squeamish Buffett is about combative negotiations. As he reminded Berkshire Hathaway shareholders just a few years ago:  We don't participate in auctions.  He then emphasized the point by invoking country music:  When the phone don't ring, you'll know it's me.  Singer, perhaps best known for waging a successful 15-year battle over Argentine bond payments, owns nearly $1.2 billion of Energy Future subordinated debt. Elliott reckons these bonds will be worth just 24 cents on the dollar under Buffett's offer. As the largest holder of notes in one of the biggest creditor groups forced to take a discount, at a minimum it will have a big voice in court. If nothing else, this fight will give Buffett one more reason to loathe hedge funds, which he dressed down again in his most recent annual missive. For now, he has the Public Utility Commission of Texas expressing eagerness to move forward with his offer. With Oncor clearly in his sights, the question is just how much Buffett is willing to bend one of his golden rules.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The strategist, Richard Turnill, said it might be possible to view price movements in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies as influenced by the ultra-easy monetary policies put in place by central banks after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. But sharp price gains in cryptocurrencies may be a sign of excess and have led some investors to call the market a bubble.  I look at the charts, and to me that looks pretty scary,  Turnill said at a media briefing in New York. Turnill and his colleagues have been advising clients to stay invested in global stocks even as some other strategists warn that prices are overextended after a run-up over the better part of the last decade. Bitcoin, the primary cryptocurrency, hit a record just shy of $3,000 last month but has fallen some 20 percent since then, trading at $2,366 on Tuesday. Over the last year, bitcoin is still up 264 percent. Competing cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and litecoin, posted quadruple-digit percentage gains ahead of losses in recent days. The virtual currency relies on  mining  computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins. Some investors have warmed to the technology, wooed by its explosive performance and the potential that the currency compete with gold and government-issued money as a store of value. Some also see other potential uses for blockchain, the technology that documents and verifies bitcoin transactions. But Turnill suggested the broader financial risks associated with blockchain-based currencies appear limited.  There's no evidence that if that price went to zero tomorrow that there'd be any broader financial implication over time, but to me it is example of where you're getting some big price movements in the market.

Demand for large-scale energy storage is growing as the price of advanced batteries tumble and nations turn to renewable energy such as solar and wind. Pairing big batteries and other storage systems with renewable energy improves reliability without creating climate-changing emissions. The 50-50 joint venture, called Fluence, will sell the lithium-ion battery technologies currently sold by AES and Siemens(AES.N), respectively.  Right now this is a very fragmented market. You're bringing together two of the leaders,  AES Chief Executive Andres Gluski told Reuters. Siemens technology focuses more on projects for individual companies and enterprises, such as universities and hospitals, while AES targets larger arrays that are incorporated into a region's electrical grid. Last week, Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) beat out privately owned Lyon Group, working with AES, and dozens of other companies for a contract to install the world's biggest grid-scale battery in Australia.  The U.S. energy storage market alone is expected to increase tenfold from 2016 to 2022, to $3.2 billion, according to a report this year by the U.S. Energy Storage Monitor. AES and Siemens currently account for about 17 percent of installed energy storage, said Kevin Yates, president of Siemens' energy management division.    The joint venture will be based in Washington, D.C., with offices in Germany and other international locations.  AES subsidiary AES Energy Storage and Siemensâ€™ battery-based energy storage solutions group will be merged into Fluence, which will operate independently of its two owners. Gluski said he could not say who top management would be until the company finishes undergoing regulatory processes later this year. The joint venture will start with about 100 people. Gluski said Fluence expects to maintain the same base of American, Korean and Japanese battery suppliers as AES. The companies expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval.

The country's election commission president said on Sunday that the vote, originally due in November 2016, was unlikely to take place in 2017, because of delays in registering millions of voters. Further delays could trigger additional unrest following anti-government street protests last year in which security forces killed dozens of demonstrators. The opposition quickly denounced Sunday's announcement as a declaration of  war .  We are ready to take additional action to sanction those who stand in the way of DRC's first democratic transition of power,  U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Michele Sison told the U.N. Security Council.  The United States imposed sanctions on several Congolese officials last year - blocking any financial assets in the United States and generally barring Americans from engaging in financial transactions with them - for hindering democracy.  The Security Council should also consider targeted sanctions to reduce the violence in the DRC and help pressure all stakeholders to play a more constructive role in moving the country forward,  Sison said.  Kabila has refused to step down at the end of his second elected term in December, sparking protests that killed dozens of people. Militia violence has also intensified across Congo, raising fears the country will slide back into the wars at the turn of the century that killed millions.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would take steps to begin debate and hold a vote on the reformulated plan next week, but did not disclose any of the changes to legislation that some Republican moderates and hard-line conservatives have opposed. McConnell also pushed back the Senate's planned August recess by two weeks to allow senators more time to tackle the measure that would repeal key parts of the Obamacare law as well as pursue other legislative priorities. McConnell said the plan was to vote on the healthcare bill next week, and said he hoped to have a fresh analysis of the bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office at the start of the week.  We're going to do healthcare next week,  McConnell told reporters. In addition to legislation to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, the postponement will allow more time to approve nominees to government posts and tend to other pressing matters, McConnell said in an earlier statement.  Once the Senate completes its work on healthcare reform, we will turn to other important issues including the National Defense Authorization Act and the backlog of critical nominations that have been mindlessly stalled by Democrats,  McConnell said in the statement. Republican senators returned to Washington on Monday following a 10-day holiday recess still at odds with one another over the healthcare legislation, with the Republican president warning Congress not to go on recess without passing the healthcare legislation. The current version of the Senate Republican bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. The House of Representatives passed its own version in May. Trump made repealing and replacing Obamacare a top campaign promise last year. Republicans have sought for seven years to gut the law, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, which they describe as a costly government overreach. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Since the start of 2017, when they took control of the White House, Republicans who also control Congress have been struggling over how to replace Obamacare. For Trump, the healthcare overhaul marks his first major legislative initiative. Republican leaders had initially hoped to vote on legislation to roll back Obamacare before a recess last week, but postponed the planned vote once it became clear the bill did not have enough support for passage. Prospects for passage are still uncertain, despite efforts to modify the legislation to bring aboard recalcitrant conservatives and moderates. If Senate Republicans fall short of approving the healthcare overhaul it would call into question not only Trump's ability to get other key parts of his agenda, including tax cuts and an increase in infrastructure spending, through Congress, but the Republican Party's capacity to govern effectively.

The country's election commission president said on Sunday that the vote, originally due in November 2016, was unlikely to take place in 2017, because of delays in registering millions of voters. Further delays could trigger additional unrest following anti-government street protests last year in which security forces killed dozens of demonstrators. The opposition quickly denounced Sunday's announcement as a declaration of  war .  We are ready to take additional action to sanction those who stand in the way of DRC's first democratic transition of power,  U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Michele Sison told the U.N. Security Council.  The United States imposed sanctions on several Congolese officials last year - blocking any financial assets in the United States and generally barring Americans from engaging in financial transactions with them - for hindering democracy.  The Security Council should also consider targeted sanctions to reduce the violence in the DRC and help pressure all stakeholders to play a more constructive role in moving the country forward,  Sison said.  Kabila has refused to step down at the end of his second elected term in December, sparking protests that killed dozens of people. Militia violence has also intensified across Congo, raising fears the country will slide back into the wars at the turn of the century that killed millions. The IMF has told Congo that  a credible path toward political stability  will probably be a condition of any assistance package, a letter seen by Reuters showed on Tuesday.

Donald Trump Jr. was told a Russian prosecutor was offering his father's presidential campaign incriminating information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as part of Russian government support, according to an email chain that he released on Tuesday.  At the very least, these types of headlines play up concerns about dysfunction in Washington and the inability of this administration to pass any meaningful legislation, particularly related to fiscal stimulus,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth FX in Washington. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, turned negative on the day to fall to a more than one-week low of 95.673. The index was down 0.31 percent.  The Russian investigation has probably been the biggest mark against the Trump administration, and the more we get to know the more the markets gets concerned,  said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto. Investors are waiting for U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress on Wednesday and U.S. consumer inflation data on Friday. Meanwhile, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said the Fed should soon begin reducing its balance sheet, as long as economic data on U.S. jobs and growth holds up. Once balance sheet reduction is under way, she will assess inflation before deciding on further interest rates rises, she said.  Brainard's comments are not helping the dollar much either,  Esiner said. The greenback, which touched a four-month high against the Japanese yen earlier in the session spurred by the recent rise in U.S. government bond yields, reversed course to fall 0.09 percent to 113.93 yen. The euro rose to a more than one-year high of $1.1475. The Canadian dollar slipped against its U.S. counterpart as traders awaited an interest rate hike decision by the Bank of Canada on Wednesday. The greenback gained against the New Zealand dollar as rising U.S. yields, soft commodity prices and a disappointing report on domestic credit card spending sent investors fleeing kiwi assets. Sterling fell to an eight-month low against the euro after the Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent declined to back up recent hints from other policymakers at the central bank that suggested it may be moving toward raising interest rates.

The situation is outrageous,  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian media during a visit to Austria on Tuesday.   I believe that for such a great country like the United States of America, this advocate of international law, it's just shameful to leave the situation in mid-air,  he said in comments posted on his ministry's website.   We are now thinking of specific steps.   At a news conference later in Brussels with the EU's top diplomat Federica Mogherini, Lavrov spoke of  retaliatory measures  but declined to answer when asked if that meant that Russia would expel U.S. diplomats or seize diplomatic property. He called on Washington to heed Moscow's demands for a return of diplomatic assets.  If this does not happen, if we see that this step is not seen as essential in Washington, then of course we will take retaliatory measures. Related CoverageMoscow prepared tough response to U.S. in diplomatic row: RIA This is the law of diplomacy, the law of international affairs, that reciprocity is the basis of all relations.  Citing a Russian diplomatic source, the Izvestia daily said Russia was considering expelling around 30 U.S. diplomats and taking over two U.S. diplomatic compounds in Moscow and St Petersburg. In December, the U.S. seized two Russian diplomatic compounds and then-President Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russians over what he said was their involvement in hacking to interfere in the U.S. presidential election campaign. Moscow denied the allegations and said then it would wait to see if relations improved under incoming President Donald Trump. Izvestia on Tuesday said the Russian government was frustrated that President Vladimir Putin's first meeting with Trump in Hamburg last week had failed to resolve the diplomatic row. Their discussions far exceeded the original time limit,  ranging from cyber security to the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. Trump described the talks soon afterwards as  very, very good .  A senior U.S. administration official told Reuters on Tuesday he had been told the issue of the compounds did not come up during the Trump-Putin meeting. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lavrov's remarks.  Poisoning Ties  Lavrov said on Tuesday Russia well understood the impact of the continued  anti-Russian bias of the U.S. Congress  now that the Trump administration had long been in place.  We realise that the decision to expel our diplomats, to impound our diplomatic property was adopted by the administration of former U.S. President Obama,  he said. The outgoing administration had aimed  to poison to a maximum U.S.-Russian ties  and create a  trap  for Trump, he added. Trump and his aides have been dogged by allegations of collusion with Russian interference in last year's U.S. election. Izvestia said Moscow still hoped the diplomatic row could be solved during a meeting between Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon. It did not say when such a meeting might happen. A previous such meeting between Ryabkov and Shannon, planned for June 23, was abruptly cancelled by Moscow in response to the expansion of U.S. sanctions on Russia.

The two cities were the only ones left in the race to stage the 2024 Games and an IOC session voted that it would seek a  tri-partite agreement  for one host in 2024 and the other in 2028.     The original plan had been to choose one for 2024 at the next session in Lima on Sept. 13, discard the other and start a whole new bidding process for 2028. For the agreement to work, either one or both cities would have to be willing to accept the 2028 Games if they were not awarded 2024, the IOC said.       The mayors of both cities said they would work toward reaching an agreement while IOC president Thomas Bach said he believed a deal could be struck by August.  We will start right away,  Bach told a news conference.  There are procedures to be followed in the two cities but I hope in August we could be there if everything goes well.  Bach said the decision would  ensure the stability of the Olympic Games for 11 years (which) is really, in our world, something extraordinary.  He described it as a  win-win-win  situation.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday, marking the biggest defeat for the hardline Sunni group since its lightning sweep through northern Iraq three years ago. But the militants, armed with machine guns and mortars, have now seized more than 75 percent of Imam Gharbi, a village on the western bank of the Tigris river some 70 km (44 miles) south of Mosul, and reinforcements are expected, the Iraqi army officer said. Islamic State launched its attack on Imam Gharbi last week, in the kind of strike it is expected to deploy now as U.S.-backed Iraqi forces regain control over cities the group captured during its shock 2014 offensive. Mosul resident Hind Mahmoud said by telephone that she had heard exchanges of gunfire in the Old City and seen an Iraqi army helicopter firing on Islamic State militants on Tuesday.  Related CoverageHezbollah leader says Mosul victory major step towards destroying Islamic StateThe top U.S. general in Iraq said that security forces would still need to clear Islamic State hideouts in Mosul, where as many as a couple of hundred fighters could remain, and would rest before fighting against the group in Tal Afar. Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend told a news briefing in Washington that some Islamic State militants in Mosul had offered to surrender. In one instance yesterday, Townsend said, an Islamic State commander had told Iraqi forces that a group of fighters were willing to surrender. However, the militants wanted to surrender as a large group, which was rejected by Iraqi forces who believed it could be a trap. Members of Iraqi Federal police carry suicide belts used by Islamic State militants in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq.Alaa Al-Marjani We saw then later in the day, a wave of suicide attacks come out and we assess that was actually a ploy, a desperate ploy by an ISIS leader to actually get the Iraqi security force to allow a large group of fighters to come out and allow them to get close before they sprung an attack,  Townsend said.  Some militants had offered to surrender today as well, but Townsend did not know the results of those negotiations.  Slideshow (2 Images)Stripped of Mosul, Islamic State's dominion in Iraq will be reduced to mainly rural, desert areas west and south of the city. Islamic State also faces pressure in its operational base in the Syrian city of Raqqa, where U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces have seized territory on three sides of the city. The campaign to retake Mosul from the militants was launched last October by a 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias, with a U.S.-led coalition providing key air and ground support. Abadi's government in Iraq now faces a difficult task managing the sectarian tensions which enabled Islamic State to gain supporters in the country among fellow Sunnis, who say they were marginalized by the Shi'ite-led government. The U.S.-led coalition warned that victory in Mosul did not mark the end of the group's global threat.  Now it is time for all Iraqis to unite to ensure ISIS (Islamic State) is defeated across the rest of Iraq and that the conditions that led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq are not allowed to return again,  Townsend said in a statement on Monday.

Artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based the portraits on a range of possible facial variations generated by software that analyzed DNA samples sent her by the former intelligence analyst when she was behind bars. Manning, 29, was released in May from a U.S. military prison in Kansas where she had been serving time for passing secrets to the WikiLeaks website in the biggest breach of classified data in the history of the United States. Other than one mugshot, photos of Manning were prohibited while she was in custody.  The exhibition by Dewey-Hagborg and Manning at the Fridman Gallery in Manhattan shows portraits of her with different color eyes or skin tone. Manning seems more masculine in some of the depictions, and in others more feminine in the show titled  A Becoming Resemblance.   I'm hoping people will walk in and see a portrait that resonates with them and feel kind of that connection with her,  Dewey-Hagborg said at the gallery, where the exhibit opens on Aug. 2.  We are all Chelsea Manning and we all stand there with her.  Artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg poses with 3-D printed masks created from DNA extracted from cheek swabs and hair clippings she received from formerly imprisoned U.S. Army Private Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, ahead of the August 2, 2017 opening of   A Becoming Resemblance , an exhibition at the Fridman gallery in New York City, July 7, 2017.Mike SegarDewey-Hagborg, who has previously created art pieces produced using DNA samples, worked with Manning for more than two years on the project. It began when a magazine contacted the artist to ask whether she could create an image to accompany a feature profile of Manning. Dewey-Hagborg said she found the former soldier to be optimistic and  incredibly brave  during all of their interactions. Slideshow (17 Images)Manning said she trusted the artist and gave her free reign to produce the images, according to Dewey-Hagborg, asking only that the artist did not make her appear too masculine. â€œPrisons try very hard to make us inhuman and unreal by denying our image, and thus our existence, to the rest of the world.  Manning said in a statement on the gallery's website. Dewey-Hagborg said the exhibition was meant to show that DNA does not necessarily tell you what gender a person is. She also hoped that showing 30 different DNA-generated versions of Manning's face drew attention to the fact DNA-based imaging is not completely accurate.  It's growing and developing but it's not ready for that kind of use yet,  Dewey-Hagborg said of the imaging technology.

The strategist, Richard Turnill, said it might be possible to view price movements in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies as influenced by the ultra-easy monetary policies put in place by central banks after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. But sharp price gains in cryptocurrencies may be a sign of excess and have led some investors to call the market a bubble.  I look at the charts, and to me that looks pretty scary,  Turnill said at a media briefing in New York. Turnill and his colleagues have been advising clients to stay invested in global stocks even as some other strategists warn that prices are overextended after a run-up over the better part of the last decade. Bitcoin, the primary cryptocurrency, hit a record just shy of $3,000 last month but has fallen some 20 percent since then, trading at $2,366 on Tuesday. Over the last year, bitcoin is still up 264 percent. Competing cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and litecoin, posted quadruple-digit percentage gains ahead of losses in recent days. The virtual currency relies on  mining  computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins. Some investors have warmed to the technology, wooed by its explosive performance and the potential that the currency compete with gold and government-issued money as a store of value. Some also see other potential uses for blockchain, the technology that documents and verifies bitcoin transactions. But Turnill suggested the broader financial risks associated with blockchain-based currencies appear limited.  There's no evidence that if that price went to zero tomorrow that there'd be any broader financial implication over time, but to me it is example of where you're getting some big price movements in the market.

While they increased allocation to emerging markets by nearly $52 billion in the first quarter of 2017, U.S.-domiciled active managers still have just 5 percent of assets under management allocated to emerging market equities, data from research firm eVestment shows. Globally, non-U.S. active funds have about twice the exposure to emerging market stocks, at around 9.94 percent, the eVestment data shows. European-domiciled funds have nearly three times the weighting as their U.S. counterparts at 14.8 percent.   A lot of our clients, particularly on the private client side are U.S. (dollar)-denominated â€¦ they do have a home bias and we reflect that home bias in our portfolios,  said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy for Glenmede Investment Management. Data from Lipper shows just 0.21 percent of Glenmede's mutual fund assets are in emerging markets. Meanwhile, MSCI's all-country world index's .MIWD00000PUS weighting to emerging markets has grown to 11.15 percent as of May 2017, from 7 percent in 2006, as more emerging market companies met standards for investable assets. By being so underweight, American investors have missed big gains since emerging market stocks pulled out of a five-year bear market in early 2016. Since then, MSCI's emerging markets index .MSCIEF has surged nearly 48 percent, handily outpacing the S&P 500's .SPX 30-percent gain in the same period. Such caution also reflects emerging markets' long-term volatility. Over the past 18 months of outperformance, emerging markets investors have had to stomach about 35 percent more volatility, Reuters data shows.  Follow the Growth? But with global economic growth trends favoring the fast-growing asset class, investors will need to move into emerging markets to continue reaching gains above 5 percent in bond and equity portfolios, said Krishna Memani, chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds. That sentiment was echoed by more than a dozen fund managers interviewed by Reuters who collectively manage hundreds of billions of dollars.  In a growth-short world, emerging markets are going to be the primary source of growth for the foreseeable future,  Memani said.  That is decades.  Emerging economies are expected to grow between 5 percent and 7 percent a year over the next five years and to represent 45 percent of global GDP by 2020, up from 35 percent in 2010, according to data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF). They could represent as much as 60 percent in 15 years. Developed market economies like the United States and Western Europe are expected to expand around 2 percent annually through 2020. Much of the growth of emerging markets has come from China, which will be more open to investors after MSCI announced in June it would include the country's domestic shares in its emerging markets index starting next year. While few question the growth trajectory of emerging economies, not all fund managers agree that equates to long-term asset outperformance.  There is this narrative that you hear a lot that just by divine order EM is going to outperform developed markets because they're growing faster,  said Tina Byles Williams, chief executive and chief investment officer of FIS Group.  We don't think that. None of those things are necessarily untrue, but market dynamics change (over time).  Linda Bakhshian, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc (FII.N), says that for her clients, who are more conservative, the returns are not consistent enough to merit significantly increasing allocation.   To invest in EM you need to have reliable information,  Bakhshian said.  It takes a lot of resources that I could dedicate to other areas that will provide a better return for what Iâ€™m looking for.  Not as Sticky Volatility and long-term underperformance has long led investors to think of EM as a short-term tactical tool to boost returns at the margins rather than a long-term, strategic investment. Indeed, over the past 20 years, MSCI's emerging index's rise of about 80 percent has delivered less than half the gain of the S&P 500's 164 percent. Emerging markets also have a problem with remaining sticky for foreign investors, according to Emre Tiftik, IIF's deputy director in the capital markets and emerging markets policy department. When developed economies encounter hard times, emerging markets are among the first assets sold. Money piled out of emerging markets after the global financial crash of 2008, investors further pulled out after the European debt crisis of 2011, and the largest migration from EM came after the Federal Reserve announced in 2013 that it would begin to reduce its bond-buying program.  The debate over the merits of investing in emerging markets is also present between asset managers and clients, many of whom remain skittish about emerging markets.  We definitely do our part in terms of our research and all the discussions we have on a regular basis with our clients to tell them, â€˜Based on our analysis EM is a great place to invest right now,'  said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, BlackRock's chief multi-asset strategist.  But ultimately itâ€™s their decision.

Eager to attract banking jobs leaving London, Philippe has pledged to reduce the cost of employing financial services staff in France and also committed to keeping the regulatory burden on finance companies competitive.  The message I want to share with you is clear and it is simple: the French government is committed to boost Paris' attractiveness by all means,  Philippe told a banking conference in Paris, presenting the package of reforms which includes a cut to payroll tax on high-earning bankers.   We want Paris to become Europe's new number one financial hub after Brexit,  Philippe said, speaking in English to an audience of financial executives. Since the election in May of former investment banker Emmanuel Macron as president, the French government is pushing hard to catch up with Frankfurt to attract finance jobs moving from London to retain EU single market access after Brexit. Paris, Frankfurt and other big European cities are all trying to woo banks based in the City of London financial center and some have already made plans to move. In addition to the new measures aimed at the finance industry, the government also has plans to reduce the scope of France's wealth tax to just real estate, while also setting a tax on all capital income at a flat rate of 30 percent. In other business-friendly measures, the government has committed to cutting France's corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 33 percent over time and aims to overhaul its labor code in the coming months. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe delivers a speech at the Paris Europlace International Financial Forum in Paris, France, July 11, 2017.Gonzalo FuentesBank executives welcomed such measures, but France has its work cut out to convince businesses that these changes are for the long term after decades of high taxes and strict labor laws.  It's important to have consistency, the rule of law, stability, steadfast ... it's not just important for banks, but for all economies,  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told the conference.   I think this government has made an enormous leeway, we are here to listen to them,  Dimon said. Slideshow (4 Images)Among the big international banks, only HSBC (HSBA.L) has so far said it would shift a large number of jobs to Paris with plans to move 1,000 posts if Britain opts for a hard Brexit. Among French banks, Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) told Reuters it could move up to 400 investment banking jobs to Paris out of the 2,000 it currently has in London. HSBC's Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver, also speaking at the conference, welcomed Philippe's latest measures as a positive step  if enacted , but also wondered whether they would stay at least through two five-year presidential cycles.  It's very early within the presidency and people still have the impression in their minds of president Hollande declaring finance is the enemy, there were demonstrations, there was a very high tax rate,  Gulliver said.  Are we now on the verge of 10 years, because large companies like ours need to plan for a long period time,  Gulliver said, questioning in particular whether the labor law reform would stick. Dimon said that JP Morgan would probably use its existing bank in Frankfurt to domicile its European operations in the EU, but that jobs could be spread among Paris, the Netherlands and other cities.

The two cities were the only ones left in the race to stage the 2024 Games and an IOC session voted that it would seek a  tri-partite agreement  for one host in 2024 and the other in 2028. The original plan had been to choose one for 2024 at the next session in Lima on Sept. 13, discard the other and start a whole new bidding process for 2028. For the agreement to work, either one or both cities would have to be willing to accept the 2028 Games if they were not awarded 2024, the IOC said. The mayors of both cities said they would work towards reaching an agreement while IOC president Thomas Bach said he believed a deal could be struck by August.  We will start right away,  Bach told a news conference.  There are procedures to be followed in the two cities but I hope in August we could be there if everything goes well.  Bach said the decision would  ensure the stability of the Olympic Games for 11 years (which) is really, in our world, something extraordinary.  He described it as a  win-win-win  situation. Should there be no three-way agreement, the vote at the Lima session will be a straightforward selection of only the 2024 host city. Welcome Departure Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, whose city hosted the Games in 1932 and 1984, said the decision was a welcome departure from what he described as the traditional  winner-takes-all  process.  I'm sitting up here with two mayors of two cities which will host, after Tokyo (in 2020), the next two Olympics ... We are one step closer to making that happen and I have full confidence we will get there,  he said. His Paris counterpart Anne Hidalgo, describing the process as historic, said she was committed to reaching an agreement so  Paris can get back to this wonderful adventure that it has been waiting for for 100 years.  Paris, which hosted the 1900 and 1924 Games, failed with bids to host the 1992, 2008 and 2012 Olympics. The IOC has been desperate to overhaul its bidding process after four cities - Hamburg, Rome, Budapest and Boston - pulled out of the 2024 race, scared off by the size, cost and complexity of hosting the Games. Hidalgo said Paris had  reflected long and hard about embarking once again on this candidature.  Before the vote on Tuesday, Paris and Los Angeles presented their bids to the 83 IOC members present, with the French capital receiving a major boost from the presence of President Emmanuel Macron, who addressed the session. United States president Donald Trump did not attend but later tweeted his support for Los Angeles.  Working hard to get the Olympics for the United States (L.A.). Stay tuned!,  he said.

The judge struck response briefs filed by the Justice Department and by the Air Line Pilots Association because the briefs contained inadequate jurisdictional statements. How inadequate? Well, according to Judge Wood, 7th Circuit rules don’t require appellees and respondents to repeat the entire jurisdictional justification required in opening briefs from the parties that have initiated appeals – but the rules do demand confirmation in response briefs that the other side’s jurisdictional statement is both complete and correct.  DOJ and the pilot union, according to Judge Wood’s order, made the mistake of using just one adjective – but not both – to describe their adversaries’ jurisdictional statements. The Justice Department’s now-stricken brief said visa seeker Jorge Baez-Sanchez was correct in his explanation of the 7th Circuit’s jurisdiction – but DOJ didn’t mention whether Baez-Sanchez’s statement was also complete. The pilot union’s now-stricken response brief, on the other hand, said United pilot instructors challenging the distribution of retroactive pay had supplied a complete jurisdictional statement in their opening brief, but didn’t say the pilot instructors’ statement was also correct. (The judge gave DOJ and the pilot union a week to fix and resubmit their filings.)  Judge Wood really, really wants response briefs to acknowledge that the other side’s jurisdictional justifications are both complete and correct. “These terms are not synonyms,” she wrote in Monday’s orders. “A statement might be complete in the sense of covering all required topics, yet contain inaccuracies. Alternatively, everything furnished might be correct, but the statement might be missing something critical, such as the citizenship of a party, the particular statute at issue, or the dates on which the court’s jurisdiction depends.”  The Justice Department and the pilot union aren’t the only parties that haven’t been careful enough about describing why the 7th Circuit has jurisdiction, Judge Wood said. A “distressing number” of briefs fail to comply with the rules, Judge Wood wrote, before reciting the entirety of the 7th Circuit’s requirements. “I am issuing this opinion in the hope that attorneys practicing in the 7th Circuit, as well as our pro se litigants, will take heed and avoid these errors in the future,” she said. “There is no reason why, month after month, year after year, the court should encounter jurisdictional statements with such obvious flaws. This imposes needless costs on everyone involved.”  Did Judge Wood use a bazooka to address a problem that might have been solved with a water pistol? I asked the 7th Circuit clerk for an interview with Judge Wood about how widespread these jurisdictional statement failures are but didn’t hear back.

Fitch also downgraded both Oklahoma Development Finance Authority bonds and Oklahoma Capital Improvement Authority bonds to AA-minus from AA. The ratings, still within a high investment grade category, carry a stable outlook. The state's revenue collections reflect  subdued energy prices,  according to a Fitch report on Tuesday. About one-third of Oklahoma's gross state product comes from the oil and natural gas sectors, the report said. S&P affirmed their AA rating for the state's GO bonds last month. As of June 2016, Moody's Investors Service rated Oklahoma at Aa2, an equivalent opinion. While Oklahoma has notable energy resources, one of its weaknesses is that it has few non-energy drivers, according to a March 2017 report by Moody's Analytics. While energy prices have been subdued, with benchmark crude oil prices hovering around the $45 per barrel and close to their lows for the year, Oklahoma's state treasurer's office said in a statement on Monday that monthly gross receipts, on a year-over-year basis, have been higher in five out of the last six months.  Current data is encouraging with lagging economic indicators showing improvement in the state economy,  Oklahoma State Treasurer Ken Miller said in the statement.

The researchers looked at 5,711 children in Rotterdam who have been participating since birth, along with their mothers, in a long-term study. At age 6, the children had a full medical examination and 2.4 percent were found to have myopia, or nearsightedness. The researchers used statistical techniques to analyze a wide variety of factors, including social and economic aspects of the household, ethnicity, lifestyle, parentsâ€™ education levels, children'sâ€™ activities and any links between these and the likelihood a child would be nearsighted. The study team found that myopic children spent less time outdoors, had lower levels of vitamin D, had a higher body mass index and were less likely to play sports than children who werenâ€™t nearsighted. While being of non-European descent, having a mother with a low education level and low family income were also associated with myopia, the researchers found that lifestyle factors explained most of these risks. The study was limited by the low number of children with myopia and the lack of information about parentsâ€™ nearsightedness - â€œa well-known myopia risk factor,â€� the authors note.  â€œDifferences in myopia prevalence between ethnic groups that have commonly been assumed to be down to genetics may in fact be due to differences in lifestyle between ethnic groups,â€� Dr. Jeremy Guggenheim, an optometry professor at Cardiff University in the UK, told Reuters Health in an email.  â€œThe new study and other recent work suggests that this preventative effect of time outdoors is beneficial even at very young ages, e.g. 3 - 6 years-old,â€� said Guggenheim, who studies the causes of myopia and sometimes collaborates with Klaverâ€™s team, but was not involved in the current study.  â€œToo much close work, such as reading and using hand-held devices, may also be a risk - although the jury is still out on this question,â€� he added. To help prevent myopia, Klaver said, parents should have children play outside for 15 hours a week, and limit â€œnear workâ€� to no longer than 45 continuous minutes. â€œItâ€™s important to keep in mind that this type of study can never pin-point the precise causes of myopia in the way that is possible using purpose-designed clinical trials,â€� Guggenheim said. â€œNevertheless, the risk factors that were identified in the new study fit neatly with what has been learned in recent years from such trials.â€� â€œBasically this study adds very nicely to the evidence that we already see from many other studies and many other countries that there is definitely a connection between outdoor activity and myopia in children,â€� said Susan Vitale at the U.S. National Eye Institute. â€œThe main thing to remember is that if parents have any concerns about their childâ€™s vision itâ€™s very important that they get a dilated eye exam from a health care professional,â€� Vitale said. Regular eye care is the most important thing people can do to maintain their eye health, she added.

Seven of the nine banks that called for an increase in the discount rate also urged such action in late May and early June. Directors at those banks cited a tight labor market as a factor  that would likely contribute to an increase in price pressures over time.  The Fed decided to raise interest rates for the third time in six months at its June meeting on the strength of the U.S. jobs market and continued economic growth.

In an action-packed ninth stage on Sunday, Fabio Aru attacked Chris Froome six kilometers from the top of the key climb of the day as the race leader raised his arm for assistance, later saying he had a mechanical problem. Froome and some others believe the unwritten rules of the peloton stipulate that you don't attack the yellow jersey if he is not in capacity to respond. LeMond, as well as several other former riders, strongly disagree.  There should never be an unwritten rule that you should stop. Sponsors are paying millions of dollars to get performances,  LeMond, on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in a daily chat with Reuters.   If you're riding along at 40kph and you see the yellow jersey stops to urinate you don't attack, if he crashes and you're not racing fast, you don't attack.   If the race is on, it does not matter what happens to the yellow jersey, he's got a team and that's what a team is for,  added the American, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990. After Aru made his move, he was followed by most of the main contenders while Froome was changing bike, but Australian Richie Porte and Ireland's Dan Martin talked to the Italian to slow him down. BMC Racing leader Porte later abandoned after crashing in the final descent.

One team, however, went on ahead. AG2R-La Mondiale took all risks in the descents to set up Romain Bardet for the stage win and it almost paid off, last year's runner-up being caught only two kilometers from the finish line.  What AG2R did was the best thing I'd seen in a long time,  said LeMond.  There's no team like that on the Tour, they are happy with second place. And BMC, who are they riding for? Are they racing for Richie Porte or for Froome?   These guys should perform for their sponsor. I would ask for some money back,  he added. LeMond believes Sky have too big of an influence on the rest of the peloton.  Sky have been doing that for a couple of years. They come up and slow people down,  he explained.  Remember that stage to the Mont Ventoux (last year).  In 2016, Froome stopped to wait for three team mates who had crashed in a descent ahead of the climb up to the Mont Ventoux, and the rest of the peloton slowed down to wait on them.  The riders have lost their ability to race,  said LeMond. Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Christian Radnedge","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-france-lemond-idUSKBN19W28W"},

These children, known as talibe, are sent by parents in the West African nation or trafficked from neighboring countries such as Guinea-Bissau to schools called daaras where they are expected to receive food, shelter and teachings from the Koran. But at least 50,000 children in Senegal are sent to beg in the streets to make money for teachers, known as marabouts, who beat them if they fail to bring in about 2,000 CFA francs ($3) per day, say rights groups including Human Rights Watch (HRW). Senegal last year launched a drive to get the talibe off the streets, saying those who force them to beg would be imprisoned in a bid to end a practice estimated by the United Nations to generate $8 million a year for Koranic teachers in Dakar.  While it's a step in the right direction, Senegal's program to remove children from the streets has hardly made a dent in the alarming numbers of talibe exploited, abused and neglected each and every day,  Corinne Dufka of HRW said in a statement.  At least 1,500 children have been taken off the streets of Dakar since June last year, and several hundred have returned to their families, said a report by HRW and Senegal-based Platform for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (PPDH).   However, of these children, more than 1,000 talibes were sent back to the Koranic teachers who had sent them to beg, and the government did not investigate the teachers involved, make any arrests, or inspect the schools, according to the report. Daaras visited by the Thomson Reuters Foundation revealed dozens of barefoot, dirty and badly clothed children who slept on the ground and lacked access to running water or toilets. In the past year, HRW said it had documented the deaths of two talibes allegedly due to abuse in Koranic schools, five cases of actual or attempted sexual abuse by teachers, and 28 incidents where children were beaten, chained, or imprisoned.  To deter abuse and to address this pervasive problem at its core, the government should ensure that abusive teachers face penalties or prosecution,  said Dufka of HRW. The Senegalese government could not be reached for comment. Alongside the drive to take the talibe off the streets, the state is considering a law to regulate daaras, seeking to raise teaching standards and eliminate trafficking and forced begging.

Harry, 32, who has become a prominent HIV and AIDS campaigner through his charity Sentebale set up in 2006 to help children in Africa, said HIV needed to be treated like any other disease and without stigma. AIDS is the second most common cause of death among adolescents globally and the leading cause of death among adolescents aged 10 to 19 in Africa, according to the United Nations' program UNAIDS.  To me it is totally absurd that in today's society that young people, the first time they know or the first time they hear about HIV and AIDS, is probably by the time it is too late,  said Harry during a visit to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine this week. Figures show about 36.7 million people worldwide have HIV, which is spread through blood, semen and breast milk. Only around half have access to treatment, and many do not know they have the virus. Harry's campaigning to combat AIDS follows the work of his late mother Princess Diana who opened Britain's first HIV/AIDS unit in London in 1987 and famously shook hands with and kissed an AIDS patient during a hospital visit. Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, set up Sentebale after visiting the Southern African nation of Lesotho in 2004 and seeing for himself the children impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic which led him to filming a documentary there in 2005. The prince has also been a key participant in World Aids Day, launching the #FeelNoShame campaign in 2014 with singers Nicole Scherzinger and Paloma Faith and filmed with Barbadian pop star Rihanna being tested for AIDS in 2016. He said through education he hopes to improve awareness about the disease with a global target to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.  HIV needs to be treated exactly the same as any other disease, and between us hopefully we can eradicate the stigma and give these young people and opportunity to stand up,  Harry said.

The film, starring one of Hindi cinema's most popular actors Akshay Kumar, is to be released on Aug. 11 and will be the world's first feature film focusing on poor sanitation and toilets, and challenging age-old social beliefs on defecation.  Toilet: A Love Story draws its premise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi'sÂ 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' (or  Clean India Campaign ) initiative to improve sanitation across India and the very real problem of open defecation,  said a statement from Sterling Media, the film's public relations agency.       The film is set to make a large impact in India, with the trailer for the film receiving over 25 million viewers in just two days of its release online,  the statement added. Modi has prioritized sanitation since sweeping to power in 2014 and aims to provide toilets for all and end open defecation in the country by 2019. But the task is mammoth.  Around 76 million Indians need improved water sources and 770 million require proper toilets, according to WaterAid. As a result, 68,000 children under five die annually due to diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation. As well as being a major health, hygiene and environmental concern, open defecation also leaves women and girls at risk of sexual assault.   Toilet: A Love Story  is a satirical comedy which follows Keshav (played by Akshay Kumar) and Jaya (played by Bhumi Pednekar), whose new marriage is challenged by lack of a toilet.  Their fight for a toilet inside their home - which is considered unclean according to social norms - quickly becomes a struggle for social change as they campaign for functioning toilets for the local community.  The film's promoters said the movie in particular spotlights women's safety, basic dignity and privacy.   The film is the true story of millions of women in rural India who ... walk a few kilometers away from their homes just to be able to relieve themselves,  said the statement.   At break of dawn or fall of dusk, these women face the risk of rape and/or kidnapping â€“ an inconceivable threat for most of us when routinely going to the toilet,  it added.

A pregnancy test, which was a routine part of the medical examination that potential female recruits had to undergo, will be stopped, the airline said.  We will no longer include a pregnancy test in the medical examination for new hires,  said Maria Teresa Garcia MenÃ©ndez, Iberia's workplace health and safety officer in the statement.  We will continue to use all necessary means to ensure the safety and rights of pregnant employees, as we have always done. This is an exemplary company when it comes to hiring women.  The measures were put in place to ensure that women were not at risk of being assigned tasks that could endanger their pregnancy, such as luggage handling, the airline said. It said it has never rejected a qualified candidate for employment on the grounds of pregnancy. The decision to stop the tests follows a ruling by a regional labor body in the Balearic Islands that fined Spain's national carrier 25,000 euros ($29,000) for the practice which it deemed discriminatory, according to reports by the Spanish newspaper El Pais in English.  Enforcing pregnancy tests as part of recruitment has no place in 2017 and we are pleased that the practice is being reversed,  said Lee Webster, spokesman for international charity Womankind Worldwide. Women make up 38 percent of the total staff at Iberia and childcare policies, along with reduced working hours, facilitate women's access to work, the airline said. Iberia, which is owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (ICAG.L) has undergone a major restructuring since its 2011 merger with British Airways.

The rights group said in a report the Islamic State militant group had also flagrantly violated humanitarian law by deliberately putting civilians in harm's way to shield their fighters and impede the advance of Iraqi and coalition forces. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory in Mosul on Monday, three years after Islamic State seized the city and made it the stronghold of a  caliphate  the Sunni Islamist group said would take over the world. A 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias launched the offensive to recapture the city in October, with air and ground support from the international coalition. Much of Mosul has been destroyed in grinding street-to-street fighting. Thousands of civilians have been killed and nearly a million forced to flee their homes, according to the United Nations. Amnesty said Iraqi forces and the coalition had carried out a series of unlawful attacks in west Mosul since January, relying heavily on Improvised Rocket Assisted Munitions (IRAMs), weapons with crude targeting capabilities that wreaked havoc in densely populated areas.  Even in attacks that seem to have struck their intended military target, the use of unsuitable weapons or failure to take other necessary precautions resulted in needless loss of civilian lives and in some cases appears to have constituted disproportionate attacks,  the report said. The top U.S. general in Iraq strongly rejected that coalition strikes violated international law.  I reject any notion that coalition fires were in any way imprecise, unlawful or excessively targeted civilians,  Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend told a news briefing in Washington.   I would challenge the people from Amnesty International or anyone else out there who makes these charges to first research their facts and make sure they are speaking from a position of authority,  Townsend said.  He added that he believed the fight against Islamic State was the  most precise campaign in the history of warfare.  The Iraqi defense ministry was not immediately available to comment on the Amnesty report. Reprisals U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a statement on Tuesday there were allegations of rights abuses by Iraqi forces and by individuals taking revenge against captured Islamic State fighters or people accused of supporting them. He called on the government in Baghdad to investigate the charges and hold those responsible to account. Amnesty said that during the battle for Mosul, Islamic State fighters had rounded up residents and forced them to move into conflict zones for use as human shields.  As fighting neared, they trapped the civilians inside houses without access to food or medical care, it said. Islamic State summarily killed hundreds, if not thousands, of men, women and children who attempted to flee and left the bodies of some hanging in public places, according to the report. Amnesty acknowledged the difficulty of protecting civilians, but accused Iraqi authorities and the coalition of failing to take feasible precautions to protect them from air strikes. It said leaflet drops warning of attacks had been virtually useless because Islamic State heavily restricted civilian movement. Neither the government nor the coalition publish comprehensive figures of civilian casualties. Amnesty said the toll just in west Mosul from attacks launched by pro-government forces was very likely higher than the 3,706 estimated by monitoring group Airwars.  The true death toll of the west Mosul battle may never be known,  it said.

With only three weeks left before a summer recess scheduled to stretch until Sept. 5, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared determined to keep trying to find agreement on a partisan, all-Republican bill. If he cannot, he will be faced with giving up on a seven-year Republican promise to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare - and possibly turning to Democrats for help in fixing problems with U.S. health insurance markets. The Republican legislation would phase out the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled, sharply cut federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025, repeal most of Obamacare's taxes, end a penalty on Americans who do not obtain insurance and overhaul Obamacare's subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits. Democrats call the Republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt millions of the most vulnerable Americans. Since the start of 2017, when they took control of the White House, Republicans who also control Congress have been struggling over how to replace former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature legislation - which they see as  government intrusion - with less comprehensive federal healthcare provisions. Related CoverageU.S. Senate Republican leader delays Senate's August recessConservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz favors offering a choice of cheaper healthcare plans that would not have to meet minimum standards established by Obamacare, such as coverage for maternity care and prescription drugs. Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins dismissed that approach on Monday, telling reporters:  I believe that it would cause further destabilization of the individual (insurance) market, it would erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions  and cause premiums to rise. Trump Urges Action U.S. President Donald Trump waves as walks on the South Lawn of the White House upon his return to Washington, U.S., from the G20 Summit in Hamburg, July 8, 2017.Yuri GripasEarlier on Monday, Trump used Twitter to prod Republican senators to pass a bill, and senior lawmakers, including the Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, said legislation could advance to votes next week in the deeply divided chamber.   I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!  tweeted Trump, who made repealing and replacing Obamacare a central pledge of his 2016 campaign. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved its healthcare bill in May, knowing the Senate would amend it. Slideshow (14 Images)Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told reporters he was worried about how rural hospitals would be treated in the Senate bill, which is being assembled in secret. He said lawmakers were awaiting an assessment of a retooled Senate bill from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office before making decisions. Senior Republican Orrin Hatch said he did not yet know whether the minimum 50 Republican senators would come together on a bill, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the potential tiebreaking vote. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wrote to McConnell urging a bipartisan effort to stabilize the health insurance market, noting that McConnell had been quoted recently as saying Congress would need to shore up that market if lawmakers fail to repeal Obamacare. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued data on Monday showing a 38 percent decrease in applications by insurers to sell health plans in the Obamacare individual market in 2018 compared with this year. Scores of protesters voiced opposition to the legislation outside Republican National Committee headquarters and at the offices of some Republican lawmakers, chanting slogans including  Trumpcare kills  and  Healthcare is a human right.   U.S. Capitol Police said 80 people were arrested.

Cattaneo took over as CEO a little more than a year ago, earning praise from the French media group and other investors for cutting costs at the heavily indebted firm. But in recent weeks he has engaged in a heated exchange with government officials over the rollout of ultrafast broadband across Italy, ruffling feathers at Vivendi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event in Rome, Cattaneo denied there were any tensions with Telecom Italia's shareholders, its board or the group's chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who is also Vivendi's chief executive. Cattaneo said rumours he might leave were false and said he would remain at Telecom Italia until the end of his mandate in 2020. However, a source familiar with the matter said tensions with Vivendi persisted. A second source said the situation might soon be coming to a head. Telecom Italia declined to comment. ASATI, an association of small investors in Telecom Italia, on Tuesday urged the company to make its position clear.  Should such rumours turn out to be true ... the company should speak up as soon as possible through its chairman,  ASATI said in a note. Telecom Italia shares fell 1.8 percent on Monday with traders citing speculation about the governance clash as a reason for the fall. The stock closed down 0.3 percent on Tuesday, in line with the market. Cattaneo, 54, was appointed last year after his predecessor resigned over strategy clashes with Vivendi. The French firm, controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, backed Cattaneo's promotion to CEO from board member. Telecom Italia has been at loggerheads with Rome over the roll out of superfast internet in so-called non-economically viable areas. The phone group's decision not to invest in areas where it said it could not guarantee a return on its investment forced Rome to hold state subsidised tenders from which utility Enel emerged as the government's broadband partner. But Telecom Italia later said it would invest its own money in some of those areas, arguing the market had changed. This shift angered Rome, which claimed it undermined the state tenders.

Yes, we are talking with them (Compagnie des Alpes). We are still interested,  said Qian, who also heads Fosun's tourism business.  Qian, who was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a Paris forum on Franco-Chinese investments, declined to discuss the size of the stake Fosun was looking for nor timing for a possible deal. Fosun already owns French holiday resorts group Club Med while Compagnie des Alpes (CDA) operates 11 ski resorts in France and 13 leisure parks and tourist attractions in Europe, including Parc Asterix and the Grevin waxworks museum in Paris.  It is also seeking partners to expand overseas in high-growth markets such as China.  Compagnie des Alpes is a very good company,  Qian said.  In China the ski business is booming now and in 2022 we are launching the winter Olympics. For Compagnie des Alpes it would be a good chance to come to China and it will also help their business in France,  he said.  The Chinese customer is very interested in ski, like 10  years ago the Chinese people started to drink wine,  he added.

Until now the procedure which could lead to sainthood --  known as a  cause  -- was limited to three categories. The cause starts after a person's death. The first is martyrdom, where a person is killed out of hatred of Christianity. The second is if a person has lived an exceptionally virtuous Christian life. The third, little used, regards people who have had the reputation of holiness for many years after their death. The Vatican said the pope had issued a decree adding a fourth path. It would apply to people who had led a good Christian life and done something to save others that they know would result in certain and relatively quick death. One example would be that of Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish priest in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz during World War Two. FILE PHOTO: Pope Francis walks at the end of a canonization mass for seven new saints in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican October 16, 2016.Tony Gentile /File PhotoKolbe offered to take the place of a fellow prisoner who had been condemned to death by starvation as part of collective punishment for a prison escape. The Nazis killed Kolbe with a lethal injection of carbolic acid. Kolbe's sainthood cause began in 1955 under the previous rules and he was made a saint in 1982. Those candidates for sainthood whose causes will in future start under the new category of offering their own life would still have to have two miracles attributed to their intercession. The Catholic Church posthumously confers beatification, and later sainthood, on people considered so holy during their lives that they are now believed to be with God and can intercede with him to perform miracles. Miracles are usually the medically unexplained healing of someone.     (This story fixes typo in second para, lead instead of leads.)

Yes, we are talking with them (Compagnie des Alpes). We are still interested,  said Qian, who also heads Fosun's tourism business.  Qian, who was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a Paris forum on Franco-Chinese investments, declined to discuss the size of the stake Fosun was looking for nor timing for a possible deal. Fosun already owns French holiday resorts group Club Med while Compagnie des Alpes (CDA) operates 11 ski resorts in France and 13 leisure parks and tourist attractions in Europe, including Parc Asterix and the Grevin waxworks museum in Paris.  It is also seeking partners to expand overseas in high-growth markets such as China.  Compagnie des Alpes is a very good company,  Qian said.  In China the ski business is booming now and in 2022 we are launching the winter Olympics. For Compagnie des Alpes it would be a good chance to come to China and it will also help their business in France,  he said.

A Reuters survey of five major hotels found average occupancy was around 57 percent at the start of the Eid festival on Sunday which marks the end of the Ramadan fasting month when friends and families eat and pray together and take holidays.  We're usually packed with Saudis and Bahrainis but not this year,  a staff member at a five-star hotel said.  But Qatar's official news agency QNA cited officials and managers in the hotel sector reporting hotel occupancy over the holiday period stood at more than 95 percent and denied reports of lower rates.  They pointed to high tourist flows from the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Kuwait and a significant increase in demand from domestic tourism,  QNA said. QNA said an offer by some hotels to offer guests staying two nights at hotels a third night free had helped win high occupancy and that the sector has shown its ability to  diversify away from traditional markets . Aviation analyst Will Horton estimated Hamad International Airport, one of the Middle East's busiest, would handle 76 percent as many flights in early July compared with the same period last year, a loss of about 27,000 passengers a day.  The airport said in a statement on Tuesday it had experienced a  very busy  Eid period with 580,000 passengers passing through between June 19 and June 25. It did not give comparative figures for last year's Eid. Visitors from the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council usually account for almost half of all visitors to Qatar. So a decision by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt to cut diplomatic and transport ties on June 5 hit traffic hard.     Doha in early July, assuming the restrictions remain, will have less capacity than a year ago - a confronting figure for a region where every month sets year-on-year records,  said Horton, senior analyst at Australia's CAPA Centre for Aviation.  FILE PHOTO: People walk past the Qatar Airways office in Manama, Bahrain, June 8, 2017.Hamad I Mohammed/File PhotoThere is no breakthrough in sight for the crisis in which the four Arab nations issued an ultimatum to Doha to close Al Jazeera television, curb ties with Iran, shut a Turkish base and pay reparations. A defiant Doha has denied accusations of supporting terrorism and says the demands are unrealistic. Air Travel Hit Hundreds of weekly flights to and from Qatar have already been canceled because of the dispute. Hamad airport stands to lose fees paid by airlines and passengers, as well as terminal revenue from duty free shops and restaurants. Air links suspended by the four Arab states represented around 25 percent of flights by state-owned Qatar Airways, one of the region's big three carriers. Qatar Airways, whose hub is Hamad airport, said on Tuesday that 510,949 of its passengers had traveled through the airport in the past seven days. It did not give comparative figures. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker had said on June 14 the majority of its operations had not been affected by restrictions imposed by the four Arab states. Elsewhere in the tourist sector, hotels, restaurants and other facilities have had to find new sources of services and goods, in some cases, at higher cost, due to the boycott, said Rashid Aboobacker, senior director at TRI Consulting in Dubai.  A substantial drop in visitor arrivals is likely to force hotel and real estate developers to re-evaluate their strategies and priorities, potentially causing delays to some of the ongoing (tourism) projects,â€� he said. Qatarâ€™s World Cup organizing committee has said sanctions had not affected preparations for the tournament and alternative sources for construction materials had been secured. Qatar has said 46,000 rooms will be available to host fans by the time of the World Cup. In March, it had 119 hotels with 23,347 rooms, according to the tourism authority.     Developing business and leisure tourism is part of Qatar's drive to develop its economy away from reliance on oil and gas revenue. Doha aims to raise the tourism sector's contribution to GDP to 5.2 percent by 2030 from around 4.1 percent now, while raising the number of people employed by nearly 70 percent to 127,900.

Policymakers and industry executives ended a Tuesday meeting in Brasilia without agreement on details such as a deadline for homebuyer refunds and fines on cancellations of low-income homes, participants told Reuters. There was no set date for a further meeting, they said. Homebuilders have suffered from soaring cancellations during Brazil's worst recession on record. Without legislation, courts have sometimes ruled in favor of giving buyers a refund of all or part of a downpayment if they cancelled a purchase. JosÃ© Carlos Martins, president of Brazilian building lobby group CBIC, had warned that the likelihood of a Tuesday accord was low given the political impasse afflicting President Michel Temer's government during a sweeping corruption probe. The meeting took place as a Brazilian lower house committee examined a corruption charge against Temer and could vote this week to put him on trial. The charge, the first against a sitting president in Brazil, marked another twist in the three-year probe that has revealed massive corruption in Latin America's largest economy. Temer, a third of his cabinet, two past presidents and dozens of lawmakers are either on trial or face charges for corruption. Still, an index grouping homebuilding and property shares trading in the SÃ£o Paulo Stock Exchange extended gains for a third day on Tuesday in line with wider gains and hopes an agreement would eventually be reached. The index is up 15 percent since news of an accord first arose in January. Under preliminary terms of the agreement, the government would back a 20 percent fine on cancellations plus broker fees for homes worth up to 300,000 reais ($92,000), groups said. Builders want a lower threshold, of 235,000 reais. The fines cannot top 5 percent of the value of the contract. For homes worth above that threshold, a 50 percent fine plus fees could be imposed, Martins said. Fines cannot surpass 10 percent of the value of a contract. Commercial property purchase cancellations would lead to a 50 percent fine plus fees, as long as they did not top 12 percent of the value of the contract. CBIC and fellow groups want a 180-day period to refund home cancellations, twice as long the government's proposal. $1 = 3.2561 reais Writing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Andrew Hay","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-construction-regulation-idUSL1N1K2115"},

The lawsuit, brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York and joined by seven individual Twitter users, claims Trump blocked a number of accounts whose owners replied to his tweets with comments that criticized, mocked or disagreed with the president. Trump's blocking of the accounts amounted to an unconstitutional effort to suppress dissent, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York. Because Trump frequently turns to Twitter to make policy statements, his account qualifies as a public forum from which the government cannot exclude people on the basis of their views, according to the lawsuit. Twitter users are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump's tweets were considered  official statements by the president of the United States.  The suit names Spicer and Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media, as defendants in addition to Trump. It asks for the blocking to be deemed unconstitutional and seeks an injunction to require the president to unblock users. The complaint follows a letter from the Knight Institute to Trump last month warning it would sue if users were not unblocked.  Everyone being able to see the president's tweets feels vital to democracy,  Joseph Papp, one of the seven Twitter users involved in the suit, said in a statement. Papp, an author, said he had been a registered Republican for 10 years and did not join the suit for political reasons, but that he  felt a deep sense of unease  when he was blocked. Trump's Twitter use has drawn intense interest for his unvarnished commentary about his agenda and attacks on critics. His tweets often lead to tens of thousands of retweets and comments and can shape the news. The Knight Institute's arguments may have merit, independent free speech and internet law scholars say, in part because Trump's tweets are used to announce policy decisions or can influence legislation. Previous cases involving politicians blocking users on Facebook may bolster its case. The federal suit, case number 1:17-cv-05205, was filed in the Southern District of New York.

Around 600,000 shares were shorted in morning trading, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.       Snap is one of the most expensive stocks to borrow on the Street right now,  said Dusaniwsky.  For a stock that's that expensive, its quite a lot of demand.   Short sellers borrow and then sell stocks they think will fall in value, hoping to profit by buying the stock back more cheaply later on and returning it to its owner.  There was an initial rush to short the stock after its March initial public offering. On Tuesday, Snap shares hit their lowest point since trading began after lead underwriter Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock and raised concerns about the company's ability to compete against rival Instagram. In total, Snap short interest is now $1.19 billion, down $245 million, or 17 percent, from its historical high of $1.44 billion that it hit on June 1. Investors are paying a 50 percent to 60 percent fee on their total notional short position, or the total borrowed, on an annualized basis to short the stock, with Tuesday's spot borrow rates - meaning the price for anyone shorting it today - going at a 70 percent to 80 percent fee, Dusaniwsky said. That compares with an annual fee of under 0.5 percent for an easy-to-short stock. Snap is the second most expensive stock to borrow in the U.S. after Sears Holding Corp, Dusaniwsky said. The fee is so high because high retail demand for the shares means there is a small amount of stock available to short, he said. Snap's shares will have to drop considerably for short-sellers placing bets now to make money, after accounting for the borrowing fees.  If I shorted Snap today it has to drop by $1 by end of month to break even,  said Dusaniwsky. The high volume of trading in Snap shares on Tuesday was being driven more by long holders, who look for the value of a stock to rise, said Dusaniwsky.    It's not the shorts that are driving the price of Snap down, it's the longs selling their position,  he said.

The executions come amid rising tensions in the oil producing eastern province, where many members of the country's Shi'ite Muslim minority live. The ministry's statement said the four had been convicted of taking up weapons against the government, joined armed groups and attacked a police station and security patrols. It was not clear whether those executed were Shi'ite or Sunni Muslims or when the incidents listed had taken place. Those executed were among more than 20 people on death row in the eastern province, but it was not immediately clear when the death sentences were issued. In January 2016 Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shi'ite Muslim cleric and dozens of al Qaeda members, in what appeared as an attempt to show it would not tolerate attacks, whether by Sunni jihadists or minority Shi'ites. The execution of the cleric, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, had sparked protests in the eastern region, where Shi'ites complain of marginalisation and discrimination by the Sunni-led kingdom. Saudi Arabia denies discrimination against Shi'ites. It also led to demonstrations in Iran, where protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions, prompting Riyadh to cut diplomatic ties with Tehran. Tensions have been on the rise in the area, where Saudi authorities have been tearing down the historic old part of the town of Awamiya to make way for a modern project. Saudi authorities say the area, which dates back some 200 years to Ottoman times, is being used by fugitives wanted for attacks on security forces and local dignitaries accused of collaboration with the government to escape arrest.

Revenue from the company's North American Frito-Lay business, under which it sells snacks such as Lay's chips, rose 3 percent in the quarter ended June 17. Sales volumes rose 1 percent and net pricing climbed 3 percent. Demand for snacks was boosted by the launch of premium products such as Lay's Poppables - chips that have relatively less sugar content. Poppables cost more as well: a 5-ounce pack sells for $2.48 on Walmart.com versus a 10-ounce pack of Lay's Classic chips that sells for $2.50. PepsiCo isn't the only company promoting foods perceived as healthier than its traditional products. Rival Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and other companies such as Nestle SA (NESN.S) and General Mills Inc (GIS.N) have cut sugar content in their snacks and drinks to cater to consumers who are shunning unhealthy foods and are willing to pay more for healthier options. PepsiCo shares, however, fell nearly 1 percent to $113.19, in sync with broader market. Bottles of Pepsi are pictured at a grocery store in Pasadena, California, U.S., July 11, 2017.Mario AnzuoniThe company said on Tuesday that North America beverage sales rose 2 percent in the quarter. While volume sales were flat, net pricing rose 1 percent. PepsiCo and Coke have for the past few years focused on selling smaller soda servings such as 7.5 ounce cans in developed markets to cope with falling demand for bigger-sized bottles.

PepsiCo earned $1.44 per share, excluding one-time items and a 6 cents per share gain on an asset sale, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Around 600,000 shares were shorted in morning trading, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.  Snap is one of the most expensive stocks to borrow on the Street right now,  said Dusaniwsky.  For a stock that's that expensive, its quite a lot of demand.  Short sellers borrow and then sell stocks they think will fall in value, hoping to profit by buying the stock back more cheaply later on and returning it to its owner. There was an initial rush to short the stock after its March initial public offering. On Tuesday, Snap shares hit their lowest point since trading began after lead underwriter Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock and raised concerns about the company's ability to compete against rival Instagram. In total, Snap short interest is now $1.19 billion, down $245 million, or 17 percent, from its historical high of $1.44 billion that it hit on June 1. Investors are paying a 50 percent to 60 percent fee on their total notional short position, or the total borrowed, on an annualized basis to short the stock, with Tuesday's spot borrow rates - meaning the price for anyone shorting it today - going at a 70 percent to 80 percent fee, Dusaniwsky said. That compares with an annual fee of under 0.5 percent for an easy-to-short stock. Snap is the second most expensive stock to borrow in the U.S. after Sears Holding Corp, Dusaniwsky said. The fee is so high because high retail demand for the shares means there is a small amount of stock available to short, he said. Snap's shares will have to drop considerably for short-sellers placing bets now to make money, after accounting for the borrowing fees.  If I shorted Snap today it has to drop by $1 by end of month to break even,  said Dusaniwsky. The high volume of trading in Snap shares on Tuesday was being driven more by long holders, who look for the value of a stock to rise, said Dusaniwsky.  It's not the shorts that are driving the price of Snap down, it's the longs selling their position,  he said.

Agriculture Minister Marian Jurecka said on Tuesday tests carried out by his ministry and the University of Chemistry and Technology showed products in Czech supermarkets often had less of the main ingredients than the version sold in Germany, such as frozen fish sticks with less fish.  Double standards  in food has become a hot-button issue for the EU's eastern members. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland see it as an example of their second-class status compared with the bloc's western members. They are all pushing the EU executive to prevent companies from using inferior ingredients in products sold in their markets. Bulgaria has also complained. Jurecka, who told Reuters in February that Czechs were tired of being Europe's  garbage can , said at a news conference he would present the test findings at an EU agriculture ministers' meeting next week to prove  the problem exists . The aim is to push forward legislation.  Czech and other consumers in the European Union should be entitled to the same quality of products,  he said. Companies have said they cater to local tastes by using various recipes. The practice is legal in the EU as long as ingredients are declared. For example, Denmark's Tulip Food Co sells canned  luncheon meat  in the Czech Republic that contains mechanically separated chicken meat along with pork. The German version doesn't include the chicken, comparison tests showed. A Tulip spokesman said the two products are similar in design but are different products with different recipes.  The canned meat products from Tulip are popular around the world and come with a lot of different recipes - taking into account the different preferences regarding taste, market demands and prices,  the spokesman said. The ministry and the university overall tested 21 products, including chocolates, canned and frozen food, and also non-food items like laundry soap. In only three cases were the ingredients the same. Consumer groups and media have conducted similar tests showing different ingredient lists that favour western markets. Food is about 25 percent cheaper overall in the Czech Republic than in Germany, according to Eurostat. That partly reflects lower local costs and living standards. But many Czechs also cross the border regularly to shop in Germany or Austria. Reporting by Robert Muller, editing by Larry King","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-czech-food-idUSKBN19W24Z"},

Nearly one-in-five said they experienced more severe forms of harassment such as physical threats, stalking and sexual harassment. While men are more likely than women to experience online harassment overall - 44 percent versus 37 percent - women, particularly young women, are more likely to be the targets of sexualized forms of online abuse.

A pregnancy test, which was a routine part of the medical examination that potential female recruits had to undergo, will be stopped, the airline said.  We will no longer include a pregnancy test in the medical examination for new hires,  said Maria Teresa Garcia MenÃ©ndez, Iberia's workplace health and safety officer in the statement.  We will continue to use all necessary means to ensure the safety and rights of pregnant employees, as we have always done. This is an exemplary company when it comes to hiring women.  The measures were put in place to ensure that women were not at risk of being assigned tasks that could endanger their pregnancy, such as luggage handling, the airline said. It said it has never rejected a qualified candidate for employment on the grounds of pregnancy. The decision to stop the tests follows a ruling by a regional labor body in the Balearic Islands that fined Spain's national carrier 25,000 euros ($29,000) for the practice which it deemed discriminatory, according to reports by the Spanish newspaper El Pais in English.  Enforcing pregnancy tests as part of recruitment has no place in 2017 and we are pleased that the practice is being reversed,  said Lee Webster, spokesman for international charity Womankind Worldwide. Women make up 38 percent of the total staff at Iberia and childcare policies, along with reduced working hours, facilitate women's access to work, the airline said.

To qualify as an EU airline carriers have to be majority owned by EU investors. Ryanair was 53.6 percent owned by EU nationals, including UK investors in 2016, according to the airline. And Michael O'Leary said around 20 percent of Ryanair's shareholders are UK-based. The carrier has already been carrying out share buybacks to return cash to shareholders.   Ownership post Brexit is a real issue,  O'Leary told a hearing in the European Parliament.  It might help me to accelerate the share buyback if UK shareholders are forced to sell.   Like other European airlines, Ryanair has clauses in its articles of association that mean it can force non-EU shareholders to sell their shares in order to ensure that EU investors retain the majority.   He reiterated concerns that unless a deal is agreed for Brexit then flights between Britain and the remaining EU 27 countries could be grounded.   There is not a legal mechanism on which airlines can operate in a 'hard Brexit, no deal' outcome. There will simply be no flights,  he said, adding that Ryanair would start cancelling flights six months before the March 2019 date when Britain is due to leave the EU with or without a deal. Aviation is not covered by World Trade Organisation rules which would apply to other industries should Britain fail to agree a deal by March 2019. Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L), said he did not agree with O'Leary's assessment and that he believed there would be a solution. He called on the UK to agree a liberal air transport agreement with the EU. One suggestion is that in the absence of a deal on aviation by March 2019 EU national governments could revert to the old bilateral agreements with the UK governing air traffic rights. O'Leary said, however, that individual EU member states were unlikely to be allowed to negotiate bilaterals independently.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed sanctions on Qatar accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge Doha denies. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told a news conference in Doha to mark the inauguration of the joint venture firm that will run the field that the French firm aimed to maintain Al Shaheen's output at 300,000 bpd for  many years . Total won a 30 percent stake in the field last year, while state-owned Qatar Petroleum (QP) holds 70 percent in the joint venture, called North Oil Company (NOC). The previous operator of the field was Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk. QP Chief Executive Saad al-Kaabi said Total had given the best offer for the field last year and that the new contract would bring Qatar more revenue than the previous deal. He said Total would invest $3.5 billion over the next five years.  Pouyanne on Tuesday said Total could invest more in Qatar, as well as in neighboring UAE.

Sealed Air Corp said in March it would sell Diversey Care and its food hygiene business to Bain Capital for about US$3.2bn, as it focuses on its higher margin businesses. The two divisions will be put together and called New Diversey. The cross-border financing comprises a US$900m term loan, an â‚¬820m term loan, and a US$250m revolving credit facility. The seven-year covenant-lite first-lien term loans form part of a wider financing package that is expected to include US$600m of unsecured bonds, although they have yet to launch. Bank meetings are due to take place in the US on Wednesday and London on Thursday, when loan pricing will emerge. The loans are offered with a 0% floor and 101 soft call for six months. Lenders have been asked to commit to the loans by July 26. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are leading the financing, alongside Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, HSBC, Jefferies, RBC and SunTrust. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Sealed Air acquired Diversey in 2011 from its controlling shareholders, the Johnson family and private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC, in a US$4.3bn cash-and-stock deal. Sealed Air said it would use the proceeds to repay debt, repurchase shares, maintain its net leverage ratio in the range of 3.5-4.0 times and fund core growth initiatives.

Donald Trump Jr was told a Russian prosecutor was offering incriminating information about Hillary Clinton as part of Russian government support. Trump Jr. agreed to meet with a Kremlin-linked lawyer during the campaign after being promised damaging information about Clinton, the New York Times reported on Sunday. Financial markets were jolted by the revelation as investors assessed its impact on Trump administration's proposed policies.  I think people are worried that it just means more political uncertainty, and sort of a continuation of the stalemate in Washington, a continuation of the delay in trying to get the Trump agenda passed through Congress,  said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, also turned negative after the news of the email.

The lawsuit, brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York and joined by seven individual Twitter users, claims Trump blocked a number of accounts whose owners replied to his tweets with comments that criticized, mocked or disagreed with the president. Trump's blocking of the accounts amounted to an unconstitutional effort to suppress dissent, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York. Because Trump frequently turns to Twitter to make policy statements, his account qualifies as a public forum from which the government cannot exclude people on the basis of their views, according to the lawsuit. Twitter users are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump's tweets were considered  official statements by the president of the United States.  The suit names Spicer and Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media, as defendants in addition to Trump. It asks for the blocking to be deemed unconstitutional and seeks an injunction to require the president to unblock users. The complaint follows a letter from the Knight Institute to Trump last month warning it would sue if users were not unblocked.  Everyone being able to see the president's tweets feels vital to democracy,  Joseph Papp, one of the seven Twitter users involved in the suit, said in a statement. Papp, an author, said he had been a registered Republican for 10 years and did not join the suit for political reasons, but that he  felt a deep sense of unease  when he was blocked. Trump's Twitter use has drawn intense interest for his unvarnished commentary about his agenda and attacks on critics. His tweets often lead to tens of thousands of retweets and comments and can shape the news. The Knight Institute's arguments may have merit, independent free speech and internet law scholars say, in part because Trump's tweets are used to announce policy decisions or can influence legislation. Previous cases involving politicians blocking users on Facebook may bolster its case. The federal suit, case number 1:17-cv-05205, was filed in the Southern District of New York.

The website framed the video as evidence against claims of ill-treatment, but marks and bruises are visible on Zefzafi's face and lower back.  Within hours, the site removed the video as Moroccans, including some who usually support the government, expressed outrage on social media.     Before his arrest on May 29, Zefzafi led protests against corruption and unemployment in the northern city of Al-Hoceima that have spread to other parts of the kingdom, in a challenge to the government and a monarchy that retains ultimate power. The protests have gathered pace since his detention. Abdessadak Elbouchattaoui, a lawyer for Zefzafi, said the video constituted  yet another crime  against his client. Elbouchattaoui says Zefzafi suffered physical injuries during his arrest and transfer to prison. The government has declined to comment on the claims, pending an investigation. Among those criticizing the video was Human Rights Minister Mustapha Ramid, who said in a Facebook post that he considered the video  an insult, regardless of the charges against [Zefzafi] , adding that the  dignity of all Moroccans is a red line.   General prosecutor Hassan Matar said  necessary legal measures  would be taken over the leaked footage.  The public prosecutor's office called for a meticulous investigation to elucidate the circumstances behind the video and its publication,  his office said in a statement carried by state news agency MAP. Morocco's prisons authority denied the video had been recorded at the Ain Sebaa prison in Casablanca, where Zefzafi is being held. It also announced on Tuesday that it was moving the director of Ain Sebaa as part of a wider reshuffle of prison wardens. Minister of Justice Mohammed Aujjar did not respond to a request for comment. The  Hirak  or Peoples' movement was born after the death of fishmonger Mouhcine Fikri in October, who was crushed inside a rubbish truck trying to recover fish confiscated by police. His death became a symbol of corruption and official abuse.  Demonstrators in Al-Hoceima have vented their frustration over economic and social problems in a kingdom where political protests used to be rare and where the government tries to present the country as a beacon of stability in the region. Over the weekend, women activists organized demonstrations in Casablanca and Rabat, calling for the release of over 100 people held for their role in the protests.

Gox pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges relating to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins and cash from what was once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange. French national Mark Karpeles filed the plea in response to charges of embezzlement and data manipulation at the Tokyo District Court, according to a pool report for foreign  journalists. Mt. Gox once handled 80 percent of the world's bitcoin trades but filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing some 850,000 bitcoins - then worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash from its bank accounts. In its bankruptcy filing, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox blamed hackers for the lost bitcoins, pointing to a software security flaw.  Mt. Gox subsequently said it had found 200,000 of the missing bitcoins. Karpeles was indicted for transferring 341 million yen ($3 million) from a Mt. Gox account holding customer funds to an account in his name during September to December 2013. The prosecution also alleged Karpeles boosted the balance of an account in his name in Mt. Gox's trading system. In its opening statement to the court, Karpeles' defense team did not dispute that the transfers took place, but denied they amounted to embezzlement.  Karpeles told the court he was an information technology engineer.  I swear to God that I am innocent,  he said in Japanese to the three-judge panel hearing his case, according to the pool report.

Gox badly damaged the image of virtual currencies, particularly among risk-averse Japanese investors and corporations. But the bankruptcy also prompted Japan's government to decide how to treat bitcoin, and preceded a push by local regulators to license virtual currency exchanges.  Slideshow (6 Images)Japan this year became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level, part of a government effort to exploit financial technology as a means of stimulating the economy. Interest in bitcoin among Japan's legions of individual investors - encouraged by Tokyo's recognition of the virtual currency as legal tender - has spiked in recent months. Still, institutional investors remain wary, say those running virtual currency exchanges in Tokyo. Japanese firms are also unenthusiastic: Only 4 percent of large and mid-sized firms plan to use bitcoin in the near to medium term, showed a Reuters poll last month.  The value of bitcoin is highly volatile. It hit a record high of $2,980 last month. Like other virtual currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple, bitcoin has no central authority and relies instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new units to the system - technology known as blockchain. Bitcoin can be traded on exchanges in the same manner as stocks and bonds. It has also become a mode of payment for some retailers, and a way to transfer funds without the need for a third party.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories climbed 0.4 percent. That was the biggest gain since December 2016 and followed a 0.4 percent decline in April. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent in May.  Auto inventories jumped 0.7 percent after declining 1.4 percent in April. The auto sector has been hit by slowing demand, with manufacturers reporting a decrease in sales for four straight months. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.3 percent in May. A report last week showed inventories at factories slipped 0.1 percent in May. Data on retail inventories will be published on Friday. Economists expect inventory investment slowed further in the second quarter and remained a drag on GDP growth during the period. The Atlanta Federal Reserve lowered it second-quarter GDP forecast by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.6 percent annualized rate after the wholesale inventory data. Inventory investment subtracted 1.11 percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter, helping to hold down the economy to a 1.4 percent growth pace.  Inventories had contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters. They have remained lean this year, with businesses cautious amid sluggish domestic demand.  Wholesale stocks of electrical goods fell 0.3 percent in May while professional equipment inventories surged 0.7 percent. Machinery inventories also increased 0.7 percent, the largest gain since November 2014. Petroleum stocks advanced 2.6 percent, the biggest rise since last December. Sales at wholesalers fell 0.5 percent after decreasing 0.3 percent in April. Sales of motor vehicles slipped 0.5 percent in May.

Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) reported a rise in full-price sales, but its shares fell 4.7 percent, partly on the back of underwhelming food sales. Broker notes spurred some of the biggest individual moves, with semiconductor maker AMS (AMS.S) a top gainer after Credit Suisse upped its target price. Peer STMicro (STM.MI) - a supplier to tech giant Apple - received a boost after JP Morgan raised it to  overweight , though it ended the session 0.4 percent lower.  We believe that the market is too cautious on STMicro,  wrote European tech analyst Sandeep Deshpande. Deshpande also said Apple suppliers would have a strong second half, calling the market too skeptical and predicting the semiconductor stocks would meet or beat expectations. In the incipient European earnings season, a strong update from Danish insurer Tryg (TRYG.CO) pushed it up 3.6 percent to a two-year high. Berenberg analyst Iain Pearce said a special dividend could be expected at year-end. Randstad (RAND.AS) and Adecco (ADEN.S) both fell more than 2 percent, targeted by Deutsche Bank in a note on staffing firms.  Analysts at Deutsche cut ratings for the world's two largest staffing companies, saying current employment levels in the United States and Europe were associated with peaking 12-month investor returns.

Our mandate is to make sure the business runs as profitably as it can. What is most important now is to ... ensure that the business runs and meets its obligations,  the company's new chief executive Boye Olusanya told Reuters on Tuesday. Nigerian regulators intervened last week to save Etisalat Nigeria after talks with its lenders to renegotiate a $1.2 billion loan from 2013 with 13 local lenders failed. Etisalat Nigeria has 20 million subscribers, making it the country's number four mobile operator with a 14 percent market share. South Africa's MTN has 47 percent, Globacom 20 percent and Airtel - a subsidiary of India's Bharti Airtel - 19 percent.  Once we've gotten ourselves to where certain decisions are made and the structure and form of the business is formed then maybe we would look at a capital raising structure that would be suitable for the nature of how the business will be run,  the new CEO said in an interview in his offices. Olusanya, who took over as CEO of Etisalat Nigeria following the appointment of a new board led by Nigeria's central bank, said that while the business could run without an immediate recapitalisation, he would not rule one out completely.  Obviously if its possible to do it tomorrow we will do it, because that enhances the ability of this business to roll-out quickly, to get more subscribers, which is what everybody wants,  he added. UAE's Etisalat, which had a 45 percent stake in the Nigerian business, has said its exposure to Etisalat Nigeria related to services worth 191 million UAE dirhams ($52 million). In June, Etisalat said it had been ordered to transfer its shares to a loan trustee after debt talks failed.  We're still in negotiations with Etisalat over the use of the brand name,  Olusanya said, adding that the technical service agreement with Etisalat covered the brand name but the telecoms company was run by Nigerians. The former Celtel executive said he has plans in place to rename the company if needed after UAE's Etisalat said it had terminated a management agreement and given its one-time Nigerian business time to phase out the brand. All UAE shareholders in Etisalat Nigeria, including state-owned investment fund Mubadala, had exited the company and left the board and management, Hatem Dowidar, CEO of Etisalat International, told Reuters.

Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups, has repeatedly been targeted by Hungary's right-wing government, in particular over his support for more open immigration. In the latest case, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has backed a campaign in which Soros is singled out as an enemy of the state.  Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh  say billboards next to a picture of the 86-year-old investor, a campaign that Jewish groups and others say foments anti-Semitism. Soros, who rarely addresses personal attacks against him, has not commented on the billboards. But Hungarian Jewish groups and Human Rights Watch, an organization partly funded by Soros, have condemned the campaign, saying it  evokes memories of the Nazi posters during the Second World War . Many posters have been defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti, including the words  stinking Jew  written in magic marker. Israel's ambassador to Hungary issued a statement denouncing the campaign, saying it  evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear , an apparent reference to Hungary's part in the deportation of 500,000 Jews during the Holocaust. But hours after the ambassador made his comments over the weekend, Israel's foreign ministry issued a  clarification  saying that Soros was a legitimate target for criticism.  In no way was the statement (by the ambassador) meant to delegitimize criticism of George Soros, who continuously undermines Israel's democratically elected governments,  said foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon, adding that Soros funded organizations  that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself . A spokesman for Soros's Open Society Foundations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. FILE PHOTO: Hungarian government poster portraying financier George Soros and saying  Don't let George Soros have the last laugh  is seen at a tram stop in Budapest, Hungary July 6, 2017.Krisztina Than/File PhotoNetanyahu Visit The foreign ministry's unusual decision to issue a statement clarifying comments by one of its ambassadors comes days before Netanyahu, who also serves as Israel's foreign minister, is scheduled to visit Orban.  Israel is normally quick to denounce anti-Semitism or threats to Jewish communities anywhere in the world. While it made that point in the statement, it chose to focus on the threat it believes Soros poses to Israeli democracy.  Among the organizations Soros funds is Human Rights Watch, which is frequently critical of Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its policies toward the Palestinians.  Like Hungary, Israel has passed legislation that seeks to limit the influence of non-governmental organizations that receive a large portion of their funding from abroad.  Israel and Hungary were briefly at odds last month after Orban praised Hungary's World War Two leader Miklos Horthy, calling him an  exceptional statesman . Horthy was an ally of Adolf Hitler who approved anti-Jewish legislation in the 1920s and 1930s and cooperated with the Germans in deporting Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. Initially Israel expressed alarm, but then quickly accepted the Hungarian government's explanation that Orban had zero tolerance for anti-Semitism and was not suggesting everything Horthy did was positive. The strong ties between Netanyahu and Orban have raised eyebrows in the European Union, where Orban is regarded as an illiberal maverick. His party has curtailed press freedom and stymied EU efforts to tackle the migrant crisis. Hungary has held discussions with Israel about purchasing security fences to keep migrants out, while Israel has sought better ties with countries that it hopes will take its side in any EU discussions where Israel is criticized.

Vince Cable, currently the only candidate in a contest to lead the Liberal Democrats, said that historically low interest rates had left the British economy too reliant on cheap money and many people would be hit by rising rates. Britain's two main parties - the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour Party - have thrown their support behind the 2016 referendum vote to exit the European Union, promising to negotiate a good deal with Brussels. The Liberal Democrats have instead argued that Britain may yet change its mind.  There is something here which is not sustainable and it is going to hit us very hard,  Cable, who holds a doctorate in economics, told reporters at a lunch in parliament. He said an economic shock would spread doubt about whether the Brexit vote, which Prime Minister Theresa May has taken to mean a withdrawal from all key EU structures including its single market and customs union, was a sensible decision.  We are getting into an environment where economics comes back to center stage...People didn't vote to be poorer and when they find that that's the environment in which they are in, I think the whole political chemistry around this subject will radically change,  he said. Cable, who last week said he thought Brexit might never transpire because the main political parties are too divided over terms for quitting the EU, said his party would be in a strong position to break through when that happens.  We are not going to advance by small incremental steps - that is not my objective, it is actually to make a breakthrough,  he said.   The electorate is very volatile, they have been offered two alternatives neither of which I think are convincing and plausible and I think if we get the messaging right..., we have an opportunity to break through the (political) middle.  Cable served as business minister from 2010 to 2015 when the Liberal Democrats were the junior partners in a coalition government led by then-Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives. Cameron resigned after a narrow majority rejected his  Remain  campaign in the referendum. The Liberal Democrats' influence has since waned and they now hold just 12 out of 650 seats in parliament. Ahead of last month's election they campaigned to give Britons a second referendum on Brexit once the final deal has been agreed. Cable - credited as predicting the 2008 banking crisis - said he did not think the economic impact of Brexit would be comparable to the global financial crisis as banks were stronger now.  It's different, it's a more longstanding, agonizing problem,  he said, highlighting low levels of productivity as the central underlying problem in the British economy.  It's declining. We are weak relative to other countries ... The underpinnings are weak. All this boastful talk about 'Britain has a terribly strong economy' - I'm sorry it's just not true. There are some fundamental weaknesses.  Editing by Mark Heinrich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-cable-idUSKBN19W21T"},

The billboards and full-page media ads that have appeared across Hungary depict a smiling Soros - a vocal critic of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government - and the caption:  Don't let Soros have the last laugh.   Some Soros billboards have been defaced with graffiti that reads  stinking Jew . Soros, 86, is a Hungarian Jew who emigrated after World War Two, made his fortune in the United States and has long supported groups promoting liberal, democratic and open-border values in eastern Europe. Michael Vachon, spokesperson for Soros, condemned the billboard campaign as  anti-European  and said it also misrepresented the financier's views on migration.  Last week the Fidesz-led government launched a nationwide billboard and television advertising campaign reminiscent of Europe's darkest hours,  Vachon said in an emailed statement.  The Hungarian regime's xenophobia and demonization of refugees are anti-European.  Orban, a rightwing nationalist, has often clashed with the European Union in the past, most recently over his clampdown on foreign-funded NGOs.  Uncontrolled Emotions  The Federation of Hungarian Jewish Federations (Mazsihisz) has urged Orban to halt the campaign.  This campaign, while not openly anti-Semitic, clearly has the potential to ignite uncontrolled emotions, including anti-Semitism,  they said. Hungarian government poster portraying financier George Soros and saying  Don't let George Soros have the last laugh  is seen in the street in Budapest, Hungary July 11, 2017.Laszlo BaloghIn a reply to Mazsihisz, Orban said that it was his duty to protect Hungarians - including the country's 100,000-strong Jewish community -- from illegal migration.  The person who uses his wealth, power, influence and a network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) funded by him to settle millions of migrants in Hungary and the European Union puts our future in jeopardy,  Orban said in a letter posted by state news agency MTI late on Friday.  The billionaire speculator George Soros has made it quite clear repeatedly that this is precisely what he wants to do.  Hungarian government poster portraying financier George Soros and saying  Don't let George Soros have the last laugh  is seen at an underground stop in Budapest, Hungary July 11, 2017.Laszlo BaloghVachon said the claim that Soros was promoting a scheme to import millions of illegal immigrants into Europe was  fantasy.   Soros's actual position on migration is that the international community should provide more support to the developing countries that today host 89 percent of refugees and that Europe should accept several hundred thousand fully screened refugees through an orderly process of vetting and resettlement,  he said. Orban's government fortified Hungary's southern border in 2015 against a large influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa into the EU that year. He has also rejected a quota scheme agreed by European Union leaders to distribute migrants among member states and has repeatedly depicted the mostly Muslim migrants and refugees as a threat to Europe's Christian identity and culture. Orban's government has strongly denied that the billboard campaign has anything to do with anti-Semitism. Orban, who faces a national election in April 2018, has long proclaimed zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, though he has more recently risked angering Jews with remarks apparently meant to court far-right voters.  Around 100,000 Jews live in Hungary today, down from more than half a million before the Holocaust.

Top executives at five of the largest banks in the capital told Reuters a staggered deal on leaving the European Union is only likely to be agreed late on in talks with Brussels, meaning they have already begun relocating staff.   And a more conciliatory government tone towards business, having largely refrained from engaging with corporate leaders about Brexit ahead of last month's election, may be too late.        The timeframe for when we wanted a transitional deal has already passed,  an executive at one global bank said, adding it had taken a decision to move hundreds of roles to continental Europe regardless of what the government does. Finance minister Philip Hammond said last week that Britain should push for a transitional deal to help businesses, while the government held its first high level meeting with corporate leaders in months to discuss Brexit.     But James Bardrick, the UK head of U.S. bank Citi (C.N), said the government has been too slow to get any early deals with Europe and banks will have to be ready by September 2018.  There's been a lot of talk and not a lot of action for a long time. I am anxious it is all a bit late,  Bardrick said.     Executives say the timetable to relocate staff and operations is tighter than it looks because it could take longer than eighteen months to set up new buildings, get licenses, hire or relocate staff and build up the capital of EU divisions.      The chairman of one of Britain's largest banks told Reuters he recently resisted pressure from staff to enact his company's contingency plan, but he will probably have to give the go-ahead by the end of the summer.        Every single day I have people coming into my office asking me to press the button on contingency plans,  he said.

Carney has asked banks to show by Friday how they can avoid their customers being abruptly cut off after Brexit, which bankers say may inadvertently speed up the departure of jobs from Britain.     The Department for Exiting the European Union did not immediately respond to a request for comment.       FILE PHOTO: A worker arrives at his office in the Canary Wharf business district in London February 26, 2014.Eddie Keogh/File PhotoThe British government is yet to ask for a transitional deal and any plans are likely to face opposition from eurosceptic British lawmakers who view it as delaying exiting the EU.     Executives are pessimistic about Britain getting a bridging period until late in the talks - if at all - because they say it must first agree with the EU its exit terms, notably the rights of expatriate citizens and any money it owes. An executive at a large British bank said many Britons are not prepared to pay an exit bill, which is likely to lead to a protracted row that will delay agreement on other measures. Only then can Britain move on to discuss a future deal and possible transitional arrangements and any deal is likely to be complicated because Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the authority of the European Court of Justice.      Jobs are moving out of the City by the day. Even by the turn of the year, a transition agreement will be too late.         James Palmer, a senior partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, said many banks have accelerated plans to relocate parts of their businesses after the inconclusive results of last month's general election because it has increased the likelihood that Britain walks away without a deal.       Therefore getting a transition committed now is absolutely fundamental,  Palmer said, adding that if politicians did not take this on board they  will have failed, and will have failure on their tombstones as their legacies .

A senior executive speaking on behalf of the company told Reuters that Tesla would be able to triple its global service capacity by increasing efficiency, adding to mobile service, and adding 100 service centers to its current total of more than 150. Tesla is adding 1,400 technicians this year, and the company plans to continue expanding mobile and service center capacity at a similar pace over then next few years. Tesla needs to expand service quickly to be able to handle the increase in sales and as the electric car company transforms itself from a luxury vehicle maker into a competitor with mainstream cars.  Expectations for a smooth roll out are particularly high among investors. Tesla has been challenging General Motors (GM.N) for the title of biggest U.S. automaker by market capitalization, even though its output is a fraction of GM's. The $35,000 Model 3 is designed for easy production, creating lower service needs, the executive said.  Tesla's last launch was the Model X SUV in 2015, which had a number of production issues. Model 3 production began in the last few days and is expected to reach 20,000 per month in December. The first deliveries are expected on July 28. Tesla had fielded 373,000 Model 3 reservations as of April 2016, the latest date at which it announced a figure. The company has learned from previous problems including issues with seatbelt latches, seats and a 53,000-vehicle parking brake recall earlier this year, the executive said. Tesla said it has improved service time by automating paperwork, using cars' wireless connections to diagnose problems, and expanding mobile support. Tesla deployed mobile vans to company charging stations to fix the seatbelt latch and cut the procedure to less than 20 minutes. About 80 percent of fixes on its vehicles do not require a lift and can be done by one of its mobile technicians, which frequently can handle an appointment in less than an hour.

Stainless steel ingredient nickel also gained after Chinese steel prices reached 3-1/2 year highs, while zinc, used to galvanise steel, rose to its highest level since March.  Copper demand is still buoyant. The market over-reacted to increases in inventory,  said ABN AMRO analyst Casper Burgering, adding car sales, construction and manufacturing output in China remained solid. However, Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain said growth in China and the United States in the longer term was likely to slow while interest rate rises would strengthen the U.S. dollar, making metals more expensive for holders of other currencies.

I believe it would be appropriate soon to commence the gradual and predictable process of allowing the balance sheet to run off,  Brainard, a cautious voice on rate increases, said at a central banking conference in New York. The Fed has been buoyed by strong U.S. employment and continued economic growth, and has raised interest rates twice this year compared to once annually the previous two years. With monetary policy normalizing, it has turned its attention to reducing its portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities mostly purchased following the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. A clear outline of its plan was released at the central bank's last policy meeting in June, but no date has been announced for when the process will begin. Minutes from the meeting released last week showed a split among policymakers on when to begin the runoff. Brainard's comments, along with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's pronouncement that the process could begin  relatively soon  supports the view that a decision could be announced at the September policy meeting. Most economists expect the Fed to begin shrinking its balance sheet at its September meeting before raising rates again in December. Brainard did note that once a balance sheet runoff begins she would want to assess progress on inflation before supporting another rate hike.  I will want to monitor inflation developments carefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to help guide inflation back up around our symmetric target,  Brainard said. A shortfall in inflation has vexed policymakers, although Yellen has said the retreat in price pressures is likely temporary. The Fed's next policy meeting is on July 25-26.

Former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily lifted the longstanding economic sanctions for six months in January, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing financial sanctions. The relief could become permanent on Wednesday if Washington decides Sudan has complied with a list of demands that include resolving internal military conflicts in areas such as war-torn Darfur, cooperating on counter-terrorism and improving access to humanitarian aid.  The natural and logical step is that America's economic sanctions are lifted from Sudan because Sudan has implemented what was asked of it entirely,  Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Abdul Ghani al-Naim told Reuters.  The two sides have had monthly joint meetings to follow up on implementation and there doesn't remain anything left to be done. Positive progress was achieved,  Naim said. Sudan this month extended a unilateral ceasefire until the end of October with rebels it has been at war with in the southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur regions. The U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment on whether it planned to lift the sanctions. Sudan is looking to win back access to the global banking system, potentially unlocking badly needed trade and foreign investment that could help it manage soaring inflation of about 35 percent and a shortage of foreign currency that has hampered its ability to purchase from abroad. The economy has been reeling ever since South Sudan, which contains three-quarters of former Sudan's oil wells, seceded in 2011. With revenue drying up, the government last year was forced to usher in austerity measures, announcing cuts to fuel and electricity subsidies. Pariah State The sanction relief would not change Sudan's designation as a state-sponsor of terrorism, and President Omar Hassan al-Bashir remains wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity. At the end of June the United State said it was  very concerned  about Sudan's human rights record, in particular about religious, political and press freedom. This status could still make investors and banks hesitant to do business, at least initially, even if sanctions are permanently lifted, said Magnus Taylor, a Sudan analyst at the International Crisis Group (ICG) conflict prevention think-tank.  There will be an economic impact but it wont be instantaneous,  said Taylor.  It's the beginning of the process of normalisation.  Taylor said that it is likely, but not certain, that the United States will choose sanctions relief on Wednesday.  The State Department wants it to happen and the people working on Sudan within the State Department want it to happen, but ultimately it's kind of a political decision after that,  he said.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 301,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.7 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday. The drop pushed the jobs openings rate to 3.7 percent, the lowest reading this year, from a nine-month high of 3.9 percent in April. Hiring jumped to 5.47 million from 5.04 million the prior month.  There were broad increases in hiring from manufacturing to retail and professional and business services. That narrowed the gap between job openings and hiring, which had raised concerns of a troubling skills mismatch in the economy. The hiring rate climbed two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.7 percent. Economists shrugged off the dive in job openings, which they attributed to the rise in hiring.  The job openings plunge in May shows further evidence that the economy is hitting the wall of full employment,  said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.   As the economy ages there's going to be fewer available jobs out there simply because companies have hired all the workers they need for now.  The so-called JOLTS report is among the data watched by Federal Reserve officials to get a pulse on both the labor market and inflation. Pointing to labor market strength, 3.2 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in May, lifting the quits rate to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in April. This rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, has rebounded from a low of 1.3 percent in late 2009. Despite the labor market nearing full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent, wage growth has remained frustratingly sluggish.  Average hourly earnings have failed to break above 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis. Economists say a growth rate of between 3 and 3.5 percent in wages is needed to bring inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target.  We look to quits rate to gauge workers' willingness to leave current positions in search of higher wages,  said Sarah House, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Coupled with increased hiring across sectors, the equally broad-based increase in the quit rate should bode well for wage gains.   Layoffs were little changed at 1.7 million in May, holding the layoffs rate at 1.1 percent for an eighth straight month.

Access to birth control boosts economic productivity by freeing up women to work, and leads to smaller families with parents able to devote more resources to their children's health and education, Gates told an international summit in London on family planning. Financial commitments announced at the conference were expected to total at least $2.5 billion - of which $1.5 billion has been pledged by countries in Africa and Asia.  Contraceptives empower women. And we know what empowered women do ... they transform societies,  Gates said. She announced the foundation would provide an additional $375 million for family planning over the next four years. The summit comes at a critical time, with U.S. President Donald Trump having said he will end funding to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), the U.N. agency which deals with family planning, sexual and reproductive health. The Trump administration has also reinstated a policy blocking U.S. funding to overseas groups that perform or provide information about abortion. Gates said she was  deeply troubled  by the proposed cuts. Related CoverageFactbox: Why contraceptive access is key to global development If empowering women is more than just rhetoric for the president, he will prove it by funding family planning,  she added. Gates, who is married to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, said contraception allowed her to finish her education, pursue a career in technology and plan when she had her children.  My family, my career, my life as I know it are because I had access to ... contraceptives,  she said. But many women around the world were getting pregnant  too young, too old and too often .  When I went to Malawi, everyone told me they knew a woman who had died in pregnancy,  she said.   I sat in a circle of women in India and asked if anyone had lost a child. Every single hand went up.  Some 214 million women and girls in developing countries cannot get access to contraceptives, experts say. The estimate that meeting that need could help avert 67 million unintended pregnancies a year, thereby preventing the deaths of 76,000 women from pregnancy and childbirth related complications, as well as cutting stillbirths and newborn deaths. Experts say universal access to reproductive health services would also lead to economic benefits of more than $430 billion a year.  At the individual level, contraceptives make lives better. In the aggregate, they transform economies,  Gates said. Priti Patel, Britain's minister for international development, described family planning as  one of the smartest and savviest tools  for poverty reduction.  We cannot tackle the scourge of poverty unless we get on top of this issue,  she added. Patel announced Britain would boost funding for family planning in developing countries to 225 million pounds ($289 million) a year until 2022 - an increase of 25 percent. The new head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, promised to  personally champion the issue of sexual and reproductive rights as a top priority . The summit, held on World Population Day, focused on ramping up access to contraceptives for adolescents, boosting family planning services in humanitarian crises and improving the supply and range of contraceptives available. It comes five years after activists, philanthropists and leaders gathered at an earlier summit and set a goal to empower 120 million additional women and girls in the 69 least developed countries to use modern contraception by 2020. The number has only grown by 30 million since then, meaning the target will be missed unless efforts are accelerated, organizers said.

To qualify as an EU airline carriers have to be majority owned by EU investors. Ryanair was 53.6 percent owned by EU nationals, including UK investors in 2016, according to the airline. And Michael O'Leary said around 20 percent of Ryanair's shareholders are UK-based. The carrier has already been carrying out share buybacks to return cash to shareholders.   Ownership post Brexit is a real issue,  O'Leary told a hearing in the European Parliament.  It might help me to accelerate the share buyback if UK shareholders are forced to sell.   Like other European airlines, Ryanair has clauses in its articles of association that mean it can force non-EU shareholders to sell their shares in order to ensure that EU investors retain the majority.   He reiterated concerns that unless a deal is agreed for Brexit then flights between Britain and the remaining EU 27 countries could be grounded.   There is not a legal mechanism on which airlines can operate in a 'hard Brexit, no deal' outcome. There will simply be no flights,  he said, adding that Ryanair would start cancelling flights six months before the March 2019 date when Britain is due to leave the EU with or without a deal. Aviation is not covered by World Trade Organisation rules which would apply to other industries should Britain fail to agree a deal by March 2019. Willie Walsh, CEO of British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L), said he did not agree with O'Leary's assessment and that he believed there would be a solution. He called on the UK to agree a liberal air transport agreement with the EU. One suggestion is that in the absence of a deal on aviation by March 2019 EU national governments could revert to the old bilateral agreements with the UK governing air traffic rights. O'Leary said, however, that individual EU member states were unlikely to be allowed to negotiate bilaterals independently.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories climbed 0.4 percent. That was the biggest gain since December 2016 and followed a 0.4 percent decline in April. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent in May.  Auto inventories jumped 0.7 percent after declining 1.4 percent in April. The auto sector has been hit by slowing demand, with manufacturers reporting a decrease in sales for four straight months. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.3 percent in May. A report last week showed inventories at factories slipped 0.1 percent in May. Data on retail inventories will be published on Friday. Economists expect inventory investment slowed further in the second quarter and remained a drag on GDP growth during the period. The Atlanta Federal Reserve lowered it second-quarter GDP forecast by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.6 percent annualized rate after the wholesale inventory data. Inventory investment subtracted 1.11 percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter, helping to hold down the economy to a 1.4 percent growth pace.  Inventories had contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters. They have remained lean this year, with businesses cautious amid sluggish domestic demand.  Wholesale stocks of electrical goods fell 0.3 percent in May while professional equipment inventories surged 0.7 percent. Machinery inventories also increased 0.7 percent, the largest gain since November 2014. Petroleum stocks advanced 2.6 percent, the biggest rise since last December. Sales at wholesalers fell 0.5 percent after decreasing 0.3 percent in April. Sales of motor vehicles slipped 0.5 percent in May.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in entering a judgment to enforce the $1.6 billion award, since reduced to about $188 million, announced in October 2014 by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It agreed with Venezuela's argument, which the U.S. government supported, that Exxon should have tried to enforce the award under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which offers more protections for sovereign defendants, rather than be permitted to use streamlined procedures.  Applying the FSIA will facilitate national uniformity in procedure,  Circuit Judge Susan Carney wrote.  Consistency as to enforcement seems to us importantly aligned with the values of predictability and federal control that foreign affairs demands and that the FSIA was designed to promote.  Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based oil company disagreed with the 3-0 decision and is considering its legal options. Venezuela and its U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case arose from Venezuela's seizure of Exxon assets in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba oil development ventures, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry. Exxon had made its investments on a joint-venture basis with the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA. According to court papers, an ICSID annulment committee on March 9 threw out nearly all of the arbitration award that concerned the Cerro Negro project, reducing Venezuela's payout to $188.3 million from $1.6 billion. Tuesday's decision voids a 2015 judgment by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan. The appeals court also said Exxon's petition should be dismissed without prejudice, allowing the company to seek enforcement in compliance with the FSIA.

The contest was held over after the marathon battle between Rafael Nadal and Gilles Muller concluded late on Monday. Djokovic was due to follow Nadal on to Court One but the Spaniard's four hours 48 minutes defeat by Muller did not finish till 8.35 local time, which meant the Serb's match could not be completed before dark.

With more than $7 trillion under management, some of the biggest names in global finance have signed onto the United Nations-backed disclosure effort for information on new risks presented by climate change. Information on banks' climate risks could eventually be reviewed by regulators as part of their financial disclosures, said Simone Dettling, a researcher with the U.N. Environment Programme working on the transparency plan.   The goal is to shift lending away from carbon intensive sectors that are becoming risky toward green technologies that are becoming more attractive,  Dettling told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.  Before banks can change their lending patterns they need to understand how their portfolios will be impacted by climate change. Most currently do not have this information, Dettling said.  They have committed to finding these numbers,  she said of the voluntary scheme.  Once banks have information on their exposure to climate risks they can begin disclosing how these risks will impact investors while looking for new sustainable alternatives, she said.  That disclosure could happen within the next year, she said, although banks and U.N. officials are still hammering out the details.  Information on investments in fossil fuel firms, renewable energy businesses and transportation companies is likely to be among the data disclosed as part of banks' climate-risk assessments, Dettling said. Banks backing the plan for new research into climate risks include ANZ, Barclays, Bradesco, Citi, ItaÃº, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Santander, Standard Chartered, TD Bank Group and UBS, said the U.N. Environment Programme.   The scale and sophistication of climate risk and opportunity continue to grow,  Citi Bank spokesman Ed Skyler said in a statement on Tuesday.   Working together to refine our approaches to enhanced disclosure will help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Muguruza, the 2016 French Open champion who lost to Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final the previous year, had just that bit more control in a hard-hitting baseline duel to follow up her victory over top seed Angelique Kerber on Monday. Muguruza, seeded 14th, saved a tricky break point on her second service game - the only one she faced all match -  but roared back to break to love en route to taking the first set. Another early break in the second piled the pressure on Kuznetsova, the 32-year-old Russian with two grand slam titles to her name who was appearing in the quarter-finals for the first time in 10 years, and she was rarely able to threaten. Muguruza, who has reached the last four for the loss of one set, brought up match point with an ace down the middle and won it courtesy of another big serve to earn a semi-final meeting with Magdalena Rybarikova or Coco Vandeweghe, whose match was delayed by rain. Tuesday's victory also took the Spaniard back into the top 10 after an inconsistent year since her French Open success.  It means a lot after last year losing in (the) second round, to be able to go deep in the tournament still with chances,  she said.

But it's also just knowing how to deal with these important matches, knowing that you're playing in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon but need that combination of not being too anxious, trying to free your mind, just trying to concentrate on the tennis part, not everything else.  Kuznetsova said Muguruza deserved her victory but was less impressed by what she claimed was some  inappropriate  coaching from her rival's courtside team - legal on the women's tour but not at the grand slams.  It's her physio, she was talking to her all the time, we all speak Spanish,  she said.  I know she acts like this all the time.  The Russian was also unimpressed by her quick turnaround from Monday's action.  I finished doubles at 7 o'clock last night. I checked the schedule and I was really mad,  she said.

The company, which makes steel tubes and auto parts for customers including Ford (F.N), Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), posted its third straight annual loss in 2016, prompting ICICI (ICBK.NS), one of its lead lenders, to trigger bankruptcy proceedings early this year. Nearly six months on the proceedings against Innoventive, seen as a test case for the first national bankruptcy law, are raising questions about the efficiency of the new regime that regulators are now compelling lenders to use to recover debts. The new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code aims to move cases of company failure into a single forum, replacing an archaic system of overlapping regulations under which banks, company promoters and other creditors could all initiate competing proceedings in different courts, tribunals and regions. That system left India's Debt Recovery Tribunals vastly overstretched, with court buildings strewn with ever-rising pillars of dusty files, gumming up the flow of credit in the economy and discouraging new investment. The World Bank estimated it took 4.3 years on average in India to resolve insolvency under the old laws, more than twice as long as in China. And average recoveries were just 25.7 cents on the dollar, one of the worst among similar sized economies. The new regime aims to significantly boost recoveries and  put a firm timeline around case resolution in the hope that this will help clean-up bank balance sheets and spur lending.  India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India has already told banks to push 12 of the largest defaulters into insolvency, but experts worry the framework is largely untested and hampered by a shortage of experienced bankruptcy professionals.   I completely understand why they want resolution for large defaulters quickly because the balance sheets have to be cleaned up,  said Ashish Chhawchharia, a partner at accounting and consulting firm Grant Thornton.  You cannot really push too hard, however, because if things go wrong people will start losing faith in the new code.   Flood of Cases Defaulters identified by the RBI are already being taken to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the forum now empowered to rule on these cases. Only a few dozen cases have been taken on by the NCLT so far, but a deluge could be in the offing.     We estimate at least 20,000 to 25,000 bankruptcy cases will come to the NCLT, if not more,  said Nikhil Shah, a managing director at restructuring experts Alvarez & Marsal.  And at that point it would get crushed under the workload.  The new law mandates a 180-day deadline to resolve cases, but the Innoventive case, in which creditors are seeking to recover about $200 million, has already faced multiple delays. Innoventive initially sought to block the matter under a six-decade old state law, and launched appeals in the High Court and an appellate tribunal, while creditors were divided on the terms of an interim financing deal, according to two sources close to the case. The company could appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, forcing lenders to seek an extension and jeopardising the resolution deadline, the sources said. Chandu Chavan, the main backer of Innoventive, could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.  With loan syndicates in India typically comprising a dozen or more state-run and private banks, forging agreement between creditors is not easy. For Innoventive, it was harder to get the 21 lenders in the room to agree on an interim financing package for the firm to operate during the insolvency process than to find a party willing to actually provide the funds, one of the sources said. Bankers often lack authority to take decisions on writedowns and have to revert to their boards for approval, causing further delays, the source added.      Value Erosion Under the new system lenders are mandated to initiate liquidation proceedings if a case cannot be resolved within the 180-day deadline, with a 90-day extension granted only in exceptional circumstances. Such an outcome could result not only in job losses at companies that were still going concerns, but also steep losses for banks that have to sell assets piecemeal.  We've already been in touch with all possible suitors,  said one senior banker, describing the situation lenders often found themselves in when they tried to offload assets from liquidated firms.  It's not like you have a lot people waiting for these assets.  Despite these concerns, M.S. Sahoo, chairman of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, the government body set up to supervise the new code, said he was confident buyers would emerge under the new system.  Nothing develops in a vacuum.  said Sahoo.  Only when something is available will the market develop.   The NCLT would not be hit with a tsunami of cases, he added, as only large defaults will be handed to it. Those involved in cases are also concerned by the lack of experienced insolvency resolution professionals - a domain in its infancy in India and dominated by mom-and-pop firms. Dinkar Venkatasubramanian, a partner at EY, says a lack of professional indemnity insurance for insolvency professionals was a major deterrent for big accounting firms to take up the task.      The risk is significant,  he said.  There exists litigation and reputational risk and the indemnity for IPs in the code is very generic.

(Adds fresh comment, political news; updates prices)     By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss     NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields were flat to slightly higher on Tuesday in choppy trade, tracking modest gains in Europe, as investors focused on upcoming congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that could shed more light on the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes.     Long-dated yields briefly turned lower after President Donald Trump's eldest son released an email chain, which referred to a top Russian government prosecutor as offering the Trump campaign damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.                   This suggests that allegations the Trump campaign colluded with Russia are not yet settled,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York.  At the margin, this draws attention away from President Trump's economic agenda.      The market's focus, however, remained on Yellen.     The Fed chair will deliver her semi-annual monetary policy testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.      Investors will also be looking to Yellen for clues on when the Fed will start unwinding its massive balance sheet.       San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said in Sydney earlier on Tuesday that he still expected one more increase in interest rates from the Fed this year and for the U.S. central bank to start unwinding its massive balance sheet in the next few months.                  Yields, which move inversely to prices, dipped on Monday in what analysts said was a retracement of previous gains that were fueled by last week's robust U.S. non-farm payrolls report for June and recent comments by Fed officials on upcoming rate hikes.       The Treasury market is in a holding pattern as we approach the more meaningful events on the immediate horizon,  said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.     U.S. Treasuries were also trading in tandem with European bonds, with the region's yields drifting slightly higher.                  In midday trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yielded 2.373 percent            , up slightly from 2.371 percent late on Monday.     U.S. 30-year yields             were at 2.925 percent, compared with Monday's 2.923 percent.      Later on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury will auction $24 billion in three-year notes.     Nomura Securities was optimistic about demand for U.S. three-year notes, noting that investors may still want to own some front-end paper  given the languishing wage growth could dampen some optimism in the Fed's outlook.

The 133-year-old store chain is battling to turn round its fortunes after falling out of fashion over the last decade. Its task is being complicated by a squeeze on consumer spending as inflation rises and wage growth falters. Chief Executive Steve Rowe, a 27-year company veteran who took over in April 2016, said his strategy of reducing prices for entry-level clothing ranges, cutting back on clearance sales and promotions, and improving fit, availability and service was working.  We have a plan and we remain convinced it is the right one,  he told shareholders at the firm's annual meeting.  In clothing and homeware, M&S's full-price sales - a key guide to profitability - rose 7 percent in the 13 weeks to July 1, its fiscal first quarter, reflecting 27 fewer promotions in the quarter versus a year earlier and no clearance sale.  I'm delighted with where we are (on clothing) ... We're absolutely on track with what we said (last year},  Rowe told reporters.  We've gained full price market share, volume market share, (and) market share in stores,  he added. However, same-store sales in M&S's upmarket food business fell 0.1 percent, below analysts' average forecast for a 0.6 percent rise, despite an estimated 0.7 percent boost from the timing of Easter.  This is the second quarter of food underperformance versus the industry,  said Investec analyst Kate Calvert, who has a  sell  rating on the company's shares.  (The M&S share price) valuation is not compelling enough given near-term uncertainty on consumer spending and poor earnings visibility,  she added. The share price was down 4.5 percent at 324 pence at 1517 GMT. Unconcerned Rowe brushed aside the concern over food.  We're quite happy about it,  he said. FILE PHOTO: Clothes are displayed on hangers in an Marks & Spencer shop in northwest London, Britain July 8, 2014.Suzanne Plunkett/File PhotoM&S was continuing to win market share, he said, but he acknowledged that the opening of new food stores had affected sales in some nearby outlets, which had weighed on the like-for-like numbers. He maintained the group's financial forecast for the full year. Part of Rowe's turnaround plan is to switch some UK shop floor space from clothing to food. M&S said in November it would close about 30 UK stores selling clothing, homewares and food and downsize or convert another 45 into food stores over five years. Six stores were identified for closure in April and one has closed so far. Like-for-like clothing and homeware sales fell 1.2 percent in the quarter, better than the average of analysts' forecasts  of a 1.3 percent fall and a 5.9 percent decline in the previous quarter. Rowe said the lack of a sale knocked about 2 percent off the like-for-like number, though Easter gave a boost of 0.6 percent.  I would expect to see us start to move a little bit more towards a positive (like-for-like clothing) number later on in the year,  he said. Halfords (HFD.L) boss Jill McDonald will join M&S in the autumn to run its clothing business. Chairman's Parting Comments Presiding over his last annual meeting Chairman Robert Swannell fielded criticism from private investors over M&S's share price, which is little changed from when he started the job in January 2011. â€œSixty percent of our turnover is in food. If you had been invested in any of the other major grocery listed companies you would have done significantly worse than being invested in M&S,â€� he said.  I share your pain.  Swannell, who will retire in September and be succeeded by retail veteran Archie Norman, said M&S had undergone  an astonishing transformation  over the last seven years.  There is practically no part of its basic infrastructure that has not changed,  he said. Editing by Mark Potter, Greg Mahlich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-m-s-outlook-idUSKBN19W0GU"},

Vince Cable, currently the only candidate in a contest to lead the Liberal Democrats, said that historically low interest rates had left the British economy too reliant on cheap money and many people would be hit by rising rates. Britain's two main parties - the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour Party - have thrown their support behind the 2016 referendum vote to exit the European Union, promising to negotiate a good deal with Brussels. The Liberal Democrats have instead argued that Britain may yet change its mind.  There is something here which is not sustainable and it is going to hit us very hard,  Cable, who holds a doctorate in economics, told reporters at a lunch in parliament. He said an economic shock would spread doubt about whether the Brexit vote, which Prime Minister Theresa May has taken to mean a withdrawal from all key EU structures including its single market and customs union, was a sensible decision.  We are getting into an environment where economics comes back to center stage...People didn't vote to be poorer and when they find that that's the environment in which they are in, I think the whole political chemistry around this subject will radically change,  he said. Cable, who last week said he thought Brexit might never transpire because the main political parties are too divided over terms for quitting the EU, said his party would be in a strong position to break through when that happens.  We are not going to advance by small incremental steps - that is not my objective, it is actually to make a breakthrough,  he said.   The electorate is very volatile, they have been offered two alternatives neither of which I think are convincing and plausible and I think if we get the messaging right..., we have an opportunity to break through the (political) middle.  Cable served as business minister from 2010 to 2015 when the Liberal Democrats were the junior partners in a coalition government led by then-Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives. Cameron resigned after a narrow majority rejected his  Remain  campaign in the referendum. The Liberal Democrats' influence has since waned and they now hold just 12 out of 650 seats in parliament. Ahead of last month's election they campaigned to give Britons a second referendum on Brexit once the final deal has been agreed. Cable - credited as predicting the 2008 banking crisis - said he did not think the economic impact of Brexit would be comparable to the global financial crisis as banks were stronger now.  It's different, it's a more longstanding, agonizing problem,  he said, highlighting low levels of productivity as the central underlying problem in the British economy.  It's declining. We are weak relative to other countries ... The underpinnings are weak. All this boastful talk about 'Britain has a terribly strong economy' - I'm sorry it's just not true. There are some fundamental weaknesses.  Editing by Mark Heinrich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-cable-idUSL8N1K24AE"},

A senior executive speaking on behalf of the company told Reuters that Tesla would be able to triple its global service capacity by increasing efficiency, adding to mobile service, and adding 100 service centers to its current total of more than 150. Tesla is adding 1,400 technicians this year, and the company plans to continue expanding mobile and service center capacity at a similar pace over then next few years. Tesla needs to expand service quickly to be able to handle the increase in sales and as the electric car company transforms itself from a luxury vehicle maker into a competitor with mainstream cars.  Expectations for a smooth roll out are particularly high among investors. Tesla has been challenging General Motors (GM.N) for the title of biggest U.S. automaker by market capitalization, even though its output is a fraction of GM's. The $35,000 Model 3 is designed for easy production, creating lower service needs, the executive said.  Tesla's last launch was the Model X SUV in 2015, which had a number of production issues. Model 3 production began in the last few days and is expected to reach 20,000 per month in December. The first deliveries are expected on July 28. Tesla had fielded 373,000 Model 3 reservations as of April 2016, the latest date at which it announced a figure. The company has learned from previous problems including issues with seatbelt latches, seats and a 53,000-vehicle parking brake recall earlier this year, the executive said. Tesla said it has improved service time by automating paperwork, using cars' wireless connections to diagnose problems, and expanding mobile support. Tesla deployed mobile vans to company charging stations to fix the seatbelt latch and cut the procedure to less than 20 minutes. About 80 percent of fixes on its vehicles do not require a lift and can be done by one of its mobile technicians, which frequently can handle an appointment in less than an hour.

Nearly one-in-five said they experienced more severe forms of harassment such as physical threats, stalking and sexual harassment. While men are more likely than women to experience online harassment overall - 44 percent versus 37 percent - women, particularly young women, are more likely to be the targets of sexualized forms of online abuse. Two-in-ten women ages 18 to 29 said they have been sexually harassed online, and just over half said they have been sent explicit images they did not ask for, according to the survey.

Other major countries with significant holes to plug include Ireland and the Netherlands, according to data released for the first time on Tuesday by the European Banking Authority. Under rules passed in 2014, EU member states need to have funds in deposit guarantee schemes equivalent to at least 0.8% of the covered deposits. The aim is to harmonise rules across states and ensure there are funds available to bail out lenders who hit trouble. Countries have until July 2024 to reach the target. All EU bank deposits are guaranteed up to â‚¬100,000, regardless of how much is in a member state's fund. European countries have in the past had different policies for guarantee schemes. Some countries did not have an ex-ante funding in place, so are having to catch up with other countries that had them. The EBA said the national figures may also be distorted by payouts some countries have had to make to depositors in recent years. The EBA data showed Italy, Ireland and the Netherlands had guarantee funds equivalent to just 0.1% of covered deposits at the end of 2016. In Spain the figure was 0.2% and in France and Germany it was about 0.3%, according to IFR calculations of the data. In Britain, the guarantee fund stood at 0.6% of deposits. That means all of those countries have to increase the funds they hold. In Italy, for example, its two guarantee schemes have available funds of â‚¬621m, well short of the â‚¬5.3bn they should have to cover the country's â‚¬668bn of deposits. Member states have another seven years to meet any shortfalls, however, to allow countries that had different funding models to gradually increase the level of cover. That is typically done by raising levies from banks each year, and several countries have levied taxes since 2015 to do so. Some countries were already well above the 0.8% minimum target at the end of last year, including Norway, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, Poland and Romania, according to IFR calculations. The European Commission has said it wants to go further than the national deposit guarantees and set up a European Deposit Insurance Scheme, which would pool the national funds. But that has met stiff opposition, including from Germany, which does not want its funds to guarantee savings in other EU countries. The EBA said it will release the data every year.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 301,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.7 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday. The drop pushed the jobs openings rate to 3.7 percent, the lowest reading this year, from a nine-month high of 3.9 percent in April. Hiring jumped to 5.47 million from 5.04 million the prior month.  There were broad increases in hiring from manufacturing to retail and professional and business services. That narrowed the gap between job openings and hiring, which had raised concerns of a troubling skills mismatch in the economy. The hiring rate climbed two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.7 percent. Economists shrugged off the dive in job openings, which they attributed to the rise in hiring.  The job openings plunge in May shows further evidence that the economy is hitting the wall of full employment,  said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.   As the economy ages there's going to be fewer available jobs out there simply because companies have hired all the workers they need for now.  The so-called JOLTS report is among the data watched by Federal Reserve officials to get a pulse on both the labor market and inflation. Pointing to labor market strength, 3.2 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in May, lifting the quits rate to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent in April. This rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of job market confidence, has rebounded from a low of 1.3 percent in late 2009. Despite the labor market nearing full employment, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent, wage growth has remained frustratingly sluggish.  Average hourly earnings have failed to break above 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis. Economists say a growth rate of between 3 and 3.5 percent in wages is needed to bring inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target.  We look to quits rate to gauge workers' willingness to leave current positions in search of higher wages,  said Sarah House, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Coupled with increased hiring across sectors, the equally broad-based increase in the quit rate should bode well for wage gains.   Layoffs were little changed at 1.7 million in May, holding the layoffs rate at 1.1 percent for an eighth straight month.

Ikaika Erik Kang, 34, an air traffic control specialist who also had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, was arrested by the FBI on Saturday following a year-long undercover probe, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. An FBI affidavit filed in court with the criminal complaint summarized a lengthy sting operation employing several undercover agents and other  confidential human sources  who posed as Islamic State operatives and sympathizers. As described in the affidavit, the sting drew to a climax as Kang swore a pledge of loyalty to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, then proceeded to make training videos for the extremist group, also known as ISIS, which has seized large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. He was taken into custody that same day, the affidavit said. Hours earlier, according to the FBI, he had purchased a GoPro drone aircraft and camera kit that he intended to be sent to the Middle East to help ISIS fighters evade enemy tanks in battle. Kang also is accused of attempting to furnish ISIS with classified and other sensitive military records that would have assisted the group in its combat tactics. But the FBI said none of those documents made it to ISIS.  Kang, a member of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, was assigned to the Army's Schofield Barracks, a major garrison on the island of Oahu. He is believed to be a  lone actor  with no ties to anyone who might pose a threat to Hawaii, the FBI said. He was brought to the FBI's attention by the Army last year, officials said. At a brief court appearance on Monday, he was presented with the charges against him and ordered to remain in federal custody pending a July 13 detention hearing. He entered no plea. Kang's attorney, Birney Bervar, told reporters afterwards that he knew  very little  about the case, having spoken only briefly to his client just before the hearing as he was handed a copy of the complaint. Kang, who attained the rank of sergeant first class, served three overseas tours of duty - one each in South Korea (2002-03), Iraq (2010-11) and Afghanistan (2013-14), his Army service record shows.

Mid-cap Carillion extended losses further. The blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.6 percent at 7,329.76 points at its close, while mid caps were 0.7 percent lower. Defensive firms and dollar earners were among the biggest weights on the index. They included Vodafone, British American Tobacco, AstraZeneca and Diageo , as well as financials Prudential and Lloyds Bank. Education publisher Pearson was the biggest faller, down more than 5 percent and giving up early gains after agreeing to sell a 22 percent stake in book publisher Penguin Random House for around $1 billion in a bid to boost its balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. Investors initially reacted positively to the news but others saw the move as insufficient. Pearson's shares have fallen around 20 percent this year, struggling after a string of profit warnings as the group battles to get to grips with the rise of digital learning.  Pearson is stripping back from their core businesses, and are they selling the family china?  Jonathan Roy, advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments, said.  What this is doing is degenerating their core revenue generation model. So, yes, in the short term you've got some capital, but how are you going to earn money going forward?  Marks & Spencer was also punished after a trading update, tumbling 4.7 percent, on rising concern about food sales. Though the retailer said its recovery plan was on track and it stuck to its guidance for its 2017-18 financial year, analysts were disappointed by a 0.1 percent dip in like-for-like M&S food sales in its fiscal first quarter.  With Clothing & Home in line, the concern now relates to (Marks & Spencer's) Food business, which has underperformed the industry for the second quarter in a row,  analysts at Investec said in a note. Among risers, mining firms Glencore, Anglo American , and Rio Tinto enjoyed gains after the underlying price of copper rose. Among mid-caps, construction company Carillion continued to suffer fallout after its CEO stepped down amidst a full-year profit warning on Monday. It sank another 33.5 percent, taking losses over the past two days to 60 percent as worries around a possible rights issue intensified.  Carillion's share price has reflected balance sheet concerns for some time, but this news is materially worse than expected,  analysts at Numis said in a note.  The scope to address this issue is limited and there are risks which we believe make a major equity issuance a probability.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in entering a judgment to enforce the $1.6 billion award, since reduced to about $188 million, announced in October 2014 by the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It agreed with Venezuela's argument, which the U.S. government supported, that Exxon should have tried to enforce the award under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), which offers more protections for sovereign defendants, rather than be permitted to use streamlined procedures.  Applying the FSIA will facilitate national uniformity in procedure,  Circuit Judge Susan Carney wrote.  Consistency as to enforcement seems to us importantly aligned with the values of predictability and federal control that foreign affairs demands and that the FSIA was designed to promote.  Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said the Irving, Texas-based oil company disagreed with the 3-0 decision and is considering its legal options. Venezuela and its U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case arose from Venezuela's seizure of Exxon assets in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba oil development ventures, when the country was nationalizing its oil industry. Exxon had made its investments on a joint-venture basis with the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA. According to court papers, an ICSID annulment committee on March 9 threw out nearly all of the arbitration award that concerned the Cerro Negro project, reducing Venezuela's payout to $188.3 million from $1.6 billion. Tuesday's decision voids a 2015 judgment by U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan. The appeals court also said Exxon's petition should be dismissed without prejudice, allowing the company to seek enforcement in compliance with the FSIA. The case is Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd et al v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-707.

We sustained losses of 2.8 million pounds ($3.60 million) in 2015 and 4.8 million in 2016, and we expect to lose a similar amount this year.  Related CoverageMotor racing: F1 could look to London now, says Red Bull bossGrant said Silverstone, which has the biggest turnout of any race on the calendar, was the only circuit in Britain that could host the race and hoped a more sustainable deal could be reached over the next three years.   A spokesman for Formula One, owned by U.S.-based Liberty Media, said the decision and the timing of the BRDC's announcement was regrettable.  The week leading up to the British Grand Prix, should be a week of great celebration for F1 and Silverstone,  the spokesman said.  We deeply regret that Silverstone has chosen instead to use this week to posture and position themselves and invoke a break clause that will take effect in three years time.  Our focus is still to preserve the British Grand Prix. We will carry on negotiating with the promoter in good faith and in private to reach a fair and equitable solution.  Silverstone hosted the first world championship grand prix in 1950 and Britain, home to seven of the 10 teams as well as triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, has been on the calendar every year since. Sean Bratches, the sport's new commercial managing director, last week described Silverstone as  one of the jewels in the crown of Grand Prix racing  and Liberty have said repeatedly that they want to safeguard the sport's historic venues. Grant said the BRDC remained fully supportive of the changes Liberty are bringing to the sport but the non-profit members club could  no longer let our passion for the sport rule our heads . The promoter's fee for hosting the race increases by five percent annually, which means it has grown from 11.5 million pounds in 2010 to 16.2 million this year. By 2026, it would have risen to 25 million. The BRDC said it had reached a tipping point and revenue from ticket sales and hospitality was not enough to cover the cost.

The 133-year-old store chain is battling to turn round its fortunes after falling out of fashion over the last decade. Its task is being complicated by a squeeze on consumer spending as inflation rises and wage growth falters. Chief Executive Steve Rowe, a 27-year company veteran who took over in April 2016, said his strategy of reducing prices for entry-level clothing ranges, cutting back on clearance sales and promotions, and improving fit, availability and service was working.  We have a plan and we remain convinced it is the right one,  he told shareholders at the firm's annual meeting.  In clothing and homeware, M&S's full-price sales - a key guide to profitability - rose 7 percent in the 13 weeks to July 1, its fiscal first quarter, reflecting 27 fewer promotions in the quarter versus a year earlier and no clearance sale.  I'm delighted with where we are (on clothing) ... We're absolutely on track with what we said (last year},  Rowe told reporters.  We've gained full price market share, volume market share, (and) market share in stores,  he added. However, same-store sales in M&S's upmarket food business fell 0.1 percent, below analysts' average forecast for a 0.6 percent rise, despite an estimated 0.7 percent boost from the timing of Easter.  This is the second quarter of food underperformance versus the industry,  said Investec analyst Kate Calvert, who has a  sell  rating on the company's shares.  (The M&S share price) valuation is not compelling enough given near-term uncertainty on consumer spending and poor earnings visibility,  she added. The share price was down 4.5 percent at 324 pence at 1517 GMT. Unconcerned Rowe brushed aside the concern over food.  We're quite happy about it,  he said. FILE PHOTO: Clothes are displayed on hangers in an Marks & Spencer shop in northwest London, Britain July 8, 2014.Suzanne Plunkett/File PhotoM&S was continuing to win market share, he said, but he acknowledged that the opening of new food stores had affected sales in some nearby outlets, which had weighed on the like-for-like numbers. He maintained the group's financial forecast for the full year. Part of Rowe's turnaround plan is to switch some UK shop floor space from clothing to food. M&S said in November it would close about 30 UK stores selling clothing, homewares and food and downsize or convert another 45 into food stores over five years. Six stores were identified for closure in April and one has closed so far. Like-for-like clothing and homeware sales fell 1.2 percent in the quarter, better than the average of analysts' forecasts  of a 1.3 percent fall and a 5.9 percent decline in the previous quarter. Rowe said the lack of a sale knocked about 2 percent off the like-for-like number, though Easter gave a boost of 0.6 percent.  I would expect to see us start to move a little bit more towards a positive (like-for-like clothing) number later on in the year,  he said. Halfords (HFD.L) boss Jill McDonald will join M&S in the autumn to run its clothing business. Chairman's Parting Comments Presiding over his last annual meeting Chairman Robert Swannell fielded criticism from private investors over M&S's share price, which is little changed from when he started the job in January 2011. â€œSixty percent of our turnover is in food. If you had been invested in any of the other major grocery listed companies you would have done significantly worse than being invested in M&S,â€� he said.  I share your pain.  Swannell, who will retire in September and be succeeded by retail veteran Archie Norman, said M&S had undergone  an astonishing transformation  over the last seven years.  There is practically no part of its basic infrastructure that has not changed,  he said. Editing by Mark Potter, Greg Mahlich","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/ms-outlook-idUSL8N1K20XQ"},

The comments come as tension mounts in Germany's ruling coalition between Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and Gabriel's Social Democrats (SPD) just over two months before a national election on Sept. 24. Some commentators have criticised Merkel's choice of her birthplace, Hamburg, a seaport with a strong radical leftist tradition, to host the meeting. They say her desire to show her commitment to freedom of speech had backfired. On Monday, members of Merkel's conservatives sought to turn the blame back onto Germany's left-wing parties. Some suggested that Hamburg's SPD mayor, Olaf Scholz, should resign for failing to stem the violence.  Olaf Scholz is not responsible for the staging of this summit,  Gabriel told the Funke newspaper group in an interview for publication on Wednesday.  Whoever wants his resignation ... must also demand the resignation of Angela Merkel.  She carries the political responsibility for the staging and direction of the G20 summit in Hamburg, which had a secret goal: the self-promotion of the CDU leader shortly before the election,  he added. Gabriel's comments drew a sharp rebuke from Andreas Scheuer, general secretary of the Christian Social Union, sister party to the CDU.  Gabriel has blown a fuse,  he told the newspaper Bild.  It is a loutish blow below the belt from a Gabriel in election campaign mode who has lost his wits.  About 20,000 police struggled to contain several hundred demonstrators who torched cars, looted shops and hurled Molotov cocktails and stones during the July 7-8 summit. Almost 500 officers were injured. In a poll published earlier on Tuesday and conducted before the G20, Merkel's CDU was leading at 39 percent, with the SPD down a point to 22 percent. Gabriel said the G20 summit had been a  total failure  with respect to the big topics affecting humanity - war, civil war, flight, hunger and poverty.  But unfortunately today we have to be satisfied if the 20 heads of state of the rich countries can just meet and it doesn't get even worse. So much for a success,  he said.

The capital is hosting a big Formula One promotional event on Wednesday, ahead of the weekend's British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and the sport has long dreamed of racing there. A decision by the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) on Tuesday to activate a break clause in Silverstone's contract has revived such talk, however fanciful it may sound to many observers.  Silverstone is a wonderful track. The teams and the drivers love driving there and (F1 owners) Liberty (Media) has made a commitment that there will be a British Grand Prix,  Horner told reporters at the Red Bull factory.  But with this London event happening tomorrow, if that was a success â€“ which hopefully it should be - one can imagine a London Grand Prix being pretty attractive to the Liberty guys.  It would not be difficult to imagine Liberty thinking 'why donâ€™t we do a street race in the capital?' . John Grant, the BRDC chairman, dismissed that idea.  Most informed observers would say a London event is just not feasible - politically, environmentally or commercially,  he told Reuters.    Silverstone, a former World War Two airfield, hosted the first world championship grand prix in 1950 and with Monza, Monaco and Spa forms part of a core group of historic tracks. Brands Hatch, Aintree and Donington Park have also hosted F1 in Britain but only Silverstone now has the necessary  infrastructure. Horner, who is a member of the BRDC without playing an active role, said the body had clearly got its maths wrong when it signed the original deal with former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and further mistakes were made along the way.  They spent a fortune on the pits and they put them in the wrong place,  he said.  They have created a paddock with zero atmosphere at one of the most historic race tracks in the UK, so there has been some serious misjudgment and management one would say.  Silverstone's future has long been clouded, with Ecclestone regularly berating the BRDC in the past, but Horner expressed amazement that a contract that was secured with so much sweat  had been broken.  It would be shocking to lose Silverstone from the calendar, It would be even more shocking to lose a British GP when you consider 80 per cent of the teams are based within the UK and how much the UK contributes to Formula One,  he said.

The film, starring one of Hindi cinema's most popular actors Akshay Kumar, is to be released on Aug. 11 and will be the world's first feature film focusing on poor sanitation and toilets, and challenging age-old social beliefs on defecation.  Toilet: A Love Story draws its premise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi'sÂ 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' (or  Clean India Campaign ) initiative to improve sanitation across India and the very real problem of open defecation,  said a statement from Sterling Media, the film's public relations agency.       The film is set to make a large impact in India, with the trailer for the film receiving over 25 million viewers in just two days of its release online,  the statement added. Modi has prioritized sanitation since sweeping to power in 2014 and aims to provide toilets for all and end open defecation in the country by 2019. But the task is mammoth.  Around 76 million Indians need improved water sources and 770 million require proper toilets, according to WaterAid. As a result, 68,000 children under five die annually due to diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation. As well as being a major health, hygiene and environmental concern, open defecation also leaves women and girls at risk of sexual assault.   Toilet: A Love Story  is a satirical comedy which follows Keshav (played by Akshay Kumar) and Jaya (played by Bhumi Pednekar), whose new marriage is challenged by lack of a toilet.  Their fight for a toilet inside their home - which is considered unclean according to social norms - quickly becomes a struggle for social change as they campaign for functioning toilets for the local community.  The film's promoters said the movie in particular spotlights women's safety, basic dignity and privacy.   The film is the true story of millions of women in rural India who ... walk a few kilometers away from their homes just to be able to relieve themselves,  said the statement.   At break of dawn or fall of dusk, these women face the risk of rape and/or kidnapping â€“ an inconceivable threat for most of us when routinely going to the toilet,  it added.

Agriculture Minister Marian Jurecka said on Tuesday tests carried out by his ministry and the University of Chemistry and Technology showed products in Czech supermarkets often had less of the main ingredients than the version sold in Germany, such as frozen fish sticks with less fish.  Double standards  in food has become a hot-button issue for the EU's eastern members. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland see it as an example of their second-class status compared with the bloc's western members. They are all pushing the EU executive to prevent companies from using inferior ingredients in products sold in their markets. Bulgaria has also complained. Jurecka, who told Reuters in February that Czechs were tired of being Europe's  garbage can , said at a news conference he would present the test findings at an EU agriculture ministers' meeting next week to prove  the problem exists . The aim is to push forward legislation.  Czech and other consumers in the European Union should be entitled to the same quality of products,  he said. Companies have said they cater to local tastes by using various recipes. The practice is legal in the EU as long as ingredients are declared. For example, Denmark's Tulip Food Co sells canned  luncheon meat  in the Czech Republic that contains mechanically separated chicken meat along with pork. The German version doesn't include the chicken, comparison tests showed. A Tulip spokesman said the two products are similar in design but are different products with different recipes.  The canned meat products from Tulip are popular around the world and come with a lot of different recipes - taking into account the different preferences regarding taste, market demands and prices,  the spokesman said. The ministry and the university overall tested 21 products, including chocolates, canned and frozen food, and also non-food items like laundry soap. In only three cases were the ingredients the same. Consumer groups and media have conducted similar tests showing different ingredient lists that favour western markets. Food is about 25 percent cheaper overall in the Czech Republic than in Germany, according to Eurostat. That partly reflects lower local costs and living standards. But many Czechs also cross the border regularly to shop in Germany or Austria. Reporting by Robert Muller, editing by Larry King","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/czech-food-idUSL8N1K222B"},

MSCI's measure of stock performance world-wide stock initially rose, lifted by expectations of robust global growth. U.S. stocks reversed early gains to edge lower after President Donald Trump's eldest son released an e-mail chain related to a meeting with a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin during last year election campaign.  People are worried that it just means more political uncertainty, and sort of a continuation of the stalemate in Washington, a continuation of the delay in trying to get the Trump agenda passed through Congress,  said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. Europe's main bourses earlier had faltered despite a fresh flurry of M&A activity. The dollar initially edged higher against a basket of currencies on the back of the past fortnight's 25 basis-point rise in the yield of benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Interest rates are on the rise globally as the Fed is expected to tighten further this year, the Bank of Canada will likely raise rates this week, comments suggest tighter European Central Bank policy and chatter from the Bank of England.  For the first time in a very long time, you have a number of central banks directionally tightening their monetary policy. So this is putting upward pressure on interest rates and the U.S. dollar,  said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. A stronger dollar and rising rates are creating a push and pull in equity market leadership, Arone said. Value-oriented equities and more cyclical sectors are doing well, but when these come under question, more growth-oriented stocks, such as technology, or more income-oriented sectors, like utilities and staples, do well, he said.  You have this real tug of war between these two camps and it's unclear right now how we're going to come out of that,  he said. MSCI's all-country world stock index fell 0.11 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares slid 0.71 percent to a provisional close of 1,490.15. Wall Street was down, but well off its lows of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.72 points, or 0.02 percent, to 21,404.8. The S&P 500 lost 4.83 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,422.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.99 points, or 0.03 percent, to 6,178.38. The Japanese yen gained 0.11 percent versus the greenback at 114.16 per dollar. The dollar index reversed course to fall 0.04 percent, while the euro rose 0.26 percent to $1.1429. Euro zone bond yields resumed their march upwards as the focus shifted to the pace of monetary tightening and when the U.S. central bank might start unwinding its massive balance sheet. Germany's 10-year yield edged up 1 basis point to 0.55 percent, reversing some of a near 4 basis point fall on Monday, its biggest daily drop in around a month. Yields across the bloc fell on Monday, retracing some of a sharp rise seen over the last two weeks in which the benchmark German 10-year yield has more than doubled on the growing view that the European Central Bank will begin reining in its ultra-loose policy sooner rather than later. U.S. Treasuries edged higher in quiet trading, tracking modest gains in Europe, as investors focused on a key testimony from Yellen in Congress, which could shed more light on the pace of U.S. monetary tightening. Yellen will deliver her semi-annual monetary policy testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose to 2.383 percent from 2.371 percent late on Monday. Crude oil was higher. Benchmark Brent crude rose 31 cents to $47.19 a barrel.

The emails, released by Donald Trump Jr., are the most concrete evidence yet that Trump campaign officials welcomed Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency and spurred investigations by the Justice Department and Congress. The messages show that the younger Trump was open to the prospect of  very high level and sensitive information  from a Russian attorney that a go-between described as  part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump  ahead of a meeting on June 9, 2016.   If it's what you say I love it,  Trump Jr. responded. He released the messages on Twitter after the New York Times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him. (bit.ly/2uapeCK and bit.ly/2ua9hwg)     In an interview with Fox News, Trump Jr. said that Trump's campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who denies having Kremlin ties. He said Veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about Clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss Russian sanctions.  In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently,  he said.  For me, this was opposition research.  Nevertheless, the correspondence between him and Rob Goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for U.S. investigators probing whether Trump's campaign colluded with the Kremlin.  The crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,  Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. on June 3. Russia does not have a  crown prosecutor  - the equivalent title is prosecutor general.

The conversation will now turn to whether President Trump was personally involved or not. But the question of the campaignâ€™s involvement appears settled now,  Cornell Law School professor Jens David Ohlin said in an interview.  The answer is yes.   Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Trump Jr. said he did not tell his father about the meeting. He said he may have since had contact with other Russians. Part of an email conversation between Donald Trump Jr and publicist Rob Goldstone is seen in a Twitter message posted by Trump Jr. on July 11, 2017.  @DonaldJTrumpJR/Handout via REUTERS I've probably met with other people from Russia, but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything,  he said on Fox News. Financial Markets Jolted The news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administrationâ€™s economic agenda. Stocks and the dollar fell, while U.S. Treasury securities gained ground. Stocks later retraced most of their losses after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to keep lawmakers in Washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare. Along with his younger brother Eric, Trump Jr. oversees the Trump Organization, his father's real-estate and business empire, and does not have a formal role in the White House. Slideshow (4 Images) My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,  Trump said in a statement. The White House referred questions to lawyers for Trump and his son. The emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities. He is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents, according to a Senate source, while the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting, said the panel's top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff.  The American people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the Russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family,  Schiff told reporters. On Fox News, Trump Jr. said he was  more than happy to cooperate with everyone.  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, asked the Trump administration how Veselnitskaya was able to enter the United States even though her authorization had expired. CNN reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, also planned to look into the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence, who has said the campaign had no contacts with Russia, said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting, held before he became Trump's running mate later that summer. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is at times harshly critical of Trump, told reporters:  This is very problematic. We cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody's campaign and say: 'We'd like to help you.'

In the letter dated June 29 and addressed to Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde also said that balance of payments support would require buy-in from traditional donors whose relations with President Joseph Kabila's government have soured recently. Lagarde said that Tshibala wrote to her on June 12 to request discussions with the International Monetary Fund over a so-called rapid credit facility to address the fallout of low commodity prices and high government deficits on Africa's top copper producer. Congo has only enough foreign currency reserves to cover about three weeks of imports and its franc currency has lost 40 percent of its value in the past year. But Western donors are reluctant to aid the government of Kabila, who refused to step down when his mandate expired last December. They also accuse government forces of widespread human rights abuses - charges the authorities deny. Lagarde proposed an Article IV visit by an IMF delegation for the second half of September but cautioned that any assistance would come with strings attached.  Our support will need to be part of a context that permits an improvement of the macroeconomic situation and that involves financing from the principal partners of the DRC,  she wrote.  To fulfill these two conditions, a credible path toward political stability will probably be a prerequisite,  Lagarde added. A spokesman for Tshibala's office said the government was open to the discussions proposed by Lagarde but he did not know if the offer of a September IMF mission had been accepted. Congo's political crisis has shown few signs of easing. The election commission president said on Sunday that a vote to replace Kabila, originally due last November, was unlikely to take place in 2017, because of delays registering millions of voters. Further delays could trigger additional unrest following anti-government street protests last year in which security forces killed dozens of demonstrators. Donors also say greater transparency should be a precondition for any assistance. The IMF suspended its last financial aid to Congo - a $560 million loan programme - in 2012 after the government failed to provide sufficient details on the sale of state mining assets to an offshore company.

The Outlooks are Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS The affirmation of the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDRs and Support Rating Floors (SRFs) of all four banks at 'B+' reflects Fitch's view of a high propensity of the Uzbek authorities to support the banks, in case of need. This view of support is based on (i) the state's majority ownership; (ii) the banks' policy roles (to a lesser extent for MCB) and (iii) the track record of capital support, including from Fund for Reconstruction and Development and Ministry of Finance, which administered recapitalisation programmes of USD500 million and UZS1.2 trillion, respectively, for state banks (including the reviewed ones) in 2017. These injections are made in steps, with some amounts already disbursed and the rest by end-2017. In Fitch's view, the state's ability to provide support is currently solid, considering the moderate size of the banking sector relative to the Uzbek economy (loans/GDP ratio of around 37% at end-2016) and reasonably large foreign-currency reserves. However, it should also be viewed in the context of the banking sector being concentrated and support-dependent and the economy's structural weaknesses, as Uzbek exports are commodities-driven and concentrated on a few countries, and external finances are heavily supported by remittances. The previous government's plan to attract new foreign investors to all four banks through minority stake sale was abandoned in late 2016. Fitch therefore believes that the state is likely to retain majority stakes and operational control in the banks, and its propensity to support them should therefore remain strong. Viability Ratings (VRs) The affirmation of UPSB's and Asaka's VRs at 'b' reflect the banks' reasonable performance and asset quality metrics to date, mostly due to exposure to higher-quality borrowers that is partly covered by state guarantees. Agrobank's and MCB's VRs at 'b-' reflects the banks' weaker asset quality and profitability metrics, as the result of the banks' focus on higher-risk segments. At the same time, all four banks' VRs continue to reflect Uzbekistan's difficult operating environment, the banks' limited commercial franchises, high concentrations in their balance sheets, and potential deficiencies in underwriting policies leading to high credit and operational risks. UPSB and Asaka reported low non-performing loans (NPLs) at end-2016 (below 1% and 2% respectively, fully covered by reserves). This is due to their focus on the export-oriented commodity and auto industries and a high share of state-owned borrowers (UPSB - 85% of loans, Asaka - 60%), with a significant share of larger exposures also being guaranteed by the state (54% of loans at UPSB and 36% at Asaka). Agrobank also has low NPLs (2.5% at end-2016), but its asset quality remains weakened by unreserved problem receivables (UZS261 billion or 7% of total assets), which resulted from a 2010 fraud. MCB's NPL ratio was a high 13% at end-2016, due to financial difficulties in a number of agricultural companies. The unreserved portion of these loans was a significant 35% of end-2016 Fitch Core Capital (FCC), as MCB expects to recover a significant part of them. Positively, the bank has sufficient capital to reserve these loans and remain compliant with regulatory capital ratios. Loan books are more concentrated and dollarised in UPSB (78%) and Asaka (57%), although the risks are mitigated by most borrowers, who have taken foreign-currency loans, being either state-owned/guaranteed or have foreign-currency revenues. Agrobank's and MCB's loans are mostly in local currency and more granular by borrower, albeit concentrated on the agricultural industry and therefore prone to risk of commodity (eg cotton) price fall. Profitability was moderate at UPSB and Asaka in 2016 (return on average equity (ROAE) of around 11% at both banks), and weak at Agrobank (2%) and MCB (negative 11%), reflecting the mostly state-directed nature of banks' operations (at UPSB and Asaka) and rather weak operating efficiency (at Agrobank and MCB). Capitalisation was moderate at UPSB (FCC/risk-weighted assets (RWA) of 15% at end-2016), MCB (FCC/total assets of 13%), modest at Asaka (FCC/RWA of 11%) and weak at Agrobank (FCC/RWA of 6%, adjusted for unreserved problem receivables). Asaka and Agro were also in breach of the minimum regulatory capital requirements at end-5M17 (total capital ratios of 11.6% and 7.8%, respectively, compared with prudential minimum of 12.5%) due to lending expansion, but this should be rectified soon, as all state banks will be recapitalised by end-2017. Fitch expects capital contributions from the state to equal around 6% of end-5M17 RWAs in UPSB, 7% in Asaka, 8% in Agro and 18% in MCB. However, the increased capital buffers are likely to be consumed, as internal capital generation is lagging behind growth at all four banks, and also due to potential further som depreciation after the already high 23% in 1H17 (non-annualised). The banks' funding is mainly sourced from customer deposits and government and quasi-government entities. Depositor concentrations were high at UPSB, Asaka and MCB, with 20 largest depositors accounting for 45%, 70% and 46% of total customer funding, respectively. Agrobank's deposits were more granular (15%). UPSB is the only bank with meaningful borrowings from foreign financial institutions (21% of liabilities). However, UPSB's foreign debt repayments are small (below 5% of total liabilities in 2H17-2018) and linked to loan repayments. Liquidity is comfortable at UPSB and Asaka due to solid buffers (liquid assets net of near-term repayments were about half of customer deposits at end-4M17 at UPSB and 35% at end-5M17 at Asaka), and somewhat tighter at Agrobank and MCB, as these two banks have high reliance on short-term inter-bank placements. All four banks hold large enough foreign currency liquidity buffers to withstand a substantial reduction in foreign-currency-denominated customer funding. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS A change in UPSB's, Asaka's, Agrobank's and MCB's support-driven IDRs could result from a strengthening/weakening of the sovereign's credit profile. A weakening of the state's propensity to support the banks may result in a downgrade of the ratings. VRS All four banks' VRs could be downgraded as a result of deterioration in the banks' asset quality if this is not fully offset by fresh equity injections. Upgrades of the VRs could result from improvements in Uzbekistan's operating environment and strengthening of the banks' commercial franchises, although upgrades of Agrobank's and MCB's VRs would also require improvements in the banks' asset quality and performance.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output by about 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 to reduce a glut and support prices LCOc1. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC states agreed to cut half as much. Including Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the deal, output by all 13 OPEC members in June rose to about 32.47 million bpd, according to the average assessments of secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor its output. The figures were seen by Reuters. That would be up 330,000 bpd from OPEC's published May figure. A jump in output in Nigeria and Libya, where output had been limited by conflict, has weighed on oil prices LCOc1. The recovery has prompted more talk among producers about asking them to join the supply cut deal. nL8N1K12YX Production from the 11 OPEC members with output targets under the agreement has averaged 29.840 million bpd in June, according to the secondary sources. Reuters also saw these figures. That means compliance in June is 97 percent, according to an OPEC calculation. That is lower than in May, as OPEC's published figures for that month point to compliance above 100 percent. [nL8N1JA2SE] OPEC is scheduled to publish the assessment of June output based on secondary sources in its monthly oil market report on Wednesday. The figures could be revised before publication as more secondary-source estimates are added, OPEC sources said. OPEC uses two sets of figures to monitor its output -- figures provided by each country and those provided by secondary sources that include industry media. This is a legacy of old disputes over real production levels. The production cut agreed last year was from levels as assessed by the secondary sources. OPEC's report on Wednesday is also expected to show that  Saudi Arabia told OPEC that it raised production to 10.07 million bpd in June, industry sources said, up from 9.88 million bpd in May. The increase takes Saudi production slightly above its OPEC production target of 10.058 million bpd for the first month this year, although on average in 2017, output remains below the target, an OPEC source said. The six secondary sources used by OPEC are the International Energy Agency, oil-pricing agencies Platts and Argus, â€Žthe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) and industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly (PIW).

The capital is hosting a big Formula One promotional event on Wednesday, ahead of the weekend's British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and the sport has long dreamed of racing there. A decision by the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) on Tuesday to activate a break clause in Silverstone's contract has revived such talk, however fanciful it may sound to many observers.  Silverstone is a wonderful track. The teams and the drivers love driving there and (F1 owners) Liberty (Media) has made a commitment that there will be a British Grand Prix,  Horner told reporters at the Red Bull factory.  But with this London event happening tomorrow, if that was a success â€“ which hopefully it should be - one can imagine a London Grand Prix being pretty attractive to the Liberty guys.  It would not be difficult to imagine Liberty thinking 'why donâ€™t we do a street race in the capital?' . John Grant, the BRDC chairman, dismissed that idea.  Most informed observers would say a London event is just not feasible - politically, environmentally or commercially,  he told Reuters. Silverstone, a former World War Two airfield, hosted the first world championship grand prix in 1950 and with Monza, Monaco and Spa forms part of a core group of historic tracks. Brands Hatch, Aintree and Donington Park have also hosted F1 in Britain but only Silverstone now has the necessary infrastructure. Horner, who is a member of the BRDC without playing an active role, said the body had clearly got its maths wrong when it signed the original deal with former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and further mistakes were made along the way.  They spent a fortune on the pits and they put them in the wrong place,  he said.  They have created a paddock with zero atmosphere at one of the most historic race tracks in the UK, so there has been some serious misjudgement and management one would say.  Silverstone's future has long been clouded, with Ecclestone regularly berating the BRDC in the past, but Horner expressed amazement that a contract that was secured with so much sweat had been broken.  It would be shocking to lose Silverstone from the calendar, It would be even more shocking to lose a British GP when you consider 80 per cent of the teams are based within the UK and how much the UK contributes to Formula One,  he said.

The announcement ends months of talks between the two groups, although it marks a scaling back from the Canal Plus buyout scenario which Orange Chief Executive Stephane Richard floated at the end of last year. It also highlights the challenges of a rapidly-changing sector marked by new competition from providers of on-demand Internet streaming media such as Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O), and the aggressive push in France of telecoms and cable group Altice (ATCA.AS) into sports broadcast rights.  Under the enhanced cooperation, Orange will in coming months distribute Canal Plus's French channels direct to ultra fast broadband customers, the firm said, without giving a price at which it would be offered. It is the first time any entity other than Canal Plus has been able to charge directly for Canal Plus-owned TV content.  It's the most attractive Canal Plus offer in France,  the pay TV's chief executive Maxime Saada said. Canal Plus also has a distribution partnership with Orange's rival Iliad (ILD.PA). Orange boss Richard told reporters there were 900,000 Orange customers who also subscribed to Canal Plus, adding that the company aimed to double this number by 2020 via the new deal, which includes a significant guaranteed minimum order value.  There's obviously a guaranteed minimum that is binding for us and Canal Plus,  Richard said, without providing any figure.  It's an ambitious project, so the guaranteed minimum matches (this ambition).  Orange Content, the new specialist unit within the group, would also consider acquiring distribution rights. Earlier this year, Orange said it was interested in working with Canal Plus on acquiring sports rights rather than trying to buy a stake in the pay TV business. Orange is also planning to spend 100 million euros ($114 million) over 5 years to produce TV series, the company added. Pressure has been mounting on Vivendi and Orange after big-spending Altice, owner of France's second-biggest telecoms operator SFR (SFRGR.PA), won the rights to broadcast European Champions League soccer matches until 2021 in France. Competition is also fierce for original TV content.  Orange announced in March a new multi-year contract with U.S. broadcaster HBO, the owner of hit serial  Game of Thrones , allowing it to become HBO's sole distributor in France.

The Mercy James Institute for Paediatric Surgery and Intensive Care located in Blantyre, Malawi's second-largest city, is the first such facility built in the country by Madonna's charity Raising Malawi.  We will ensure that not only will it be a world-class children's hospital, but also a superior centre of learning. This is as much about healing as it is about empowerment,  Madonna said at the hospital's official opening. The singer adopted Malawian children David Banda and Mercy James in 2006 and 2009 respectively and twins Esther and Stella Mwale earlier this year. She has two other children, Lourdes and Rocco, from previous relationships. Speaking at the event, Mercy James drew applause and ululation from the crowd after saying:  Many kids and many lives will be saved. Thank you mum, you're the bomb.  Madonna established the non-profit Raising Malawi charity in 2006 to provide health and education, particularly for girls. The charity has built 10 schools in Malawi, according to its website. Madonna criticised Malawi's slow pace of law reform, saying it nearly prevented her from adopting Mercy James.  It was not an easy battle,  said Madonna as her voice cracked with emotion as she stood near her daughter.  The judge refused me because I was recently divorced. We hired lawyers, went to the Supreme Court. But I never gave up, I never backed down,  added the 58-year-old, who previously stirred anger among some Malawians as they felt the government allowed her to skirt laws that ban non-residents from adopting.  I fought for Mercy and won. We fought for this hospital and won. Love conquers all.  Madonna then danced to a local song with Malawi's first lady Gertrude Mutharika. Mutharika, who attended the hospital's launch, said  Madonna is a symbol of a motherly spirit  and that the hospital was Malawi's  national pride . The health minister Peter Kumpalume said the hospital will help save lives of newborns in a country where infant mortality is still one of the highest in the world, but steadily declining.  For our part, we will fully support the facility, we are bringing in doctors and drugs,  Kumpalume told Reuters. Malawi's infant mortality rate declined to 42 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016 from 135 deaths in 1992, government data shows.

A Siemens source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that Siemens was rethinking some of its business connections in Russia because of the episode, in which it said its Russian customer had acted in bad faith. Siemens, Germany and the European Union are under pressure to show they take potential sanctions-busting seriously after Reuters disclosed that Russia had moved the turbines to Crimea and that a firm part-owned by Siemens had been hired to help install them. Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, a move the European Union denounced as a breach of international law. It then imposed sanctions on Russia which ban EU firms such as Siemens from selling energy technology to Crimea.      Moscow needs the turbines for two Crimean power plants the Kremlin wants to get up and running to fulfill a promise, made by President Vladimir Putin, to ensure a stable power supply for the region's residents. Crimea used to rely on the Ukrainian power grid but is now dependent on Russia for electricity.    The German industrial group originally supplied four turbines for a project in Russia, but said on Monday that at least two of them had been moved to Crimea without its knowledge and against its will. Siemens filed the lawsuit, which court documents show was brought in the Moscow city arbitration court, against Russian state firm Technopromexport which originally bought them for use in a power station in Taman, southern Russia.  Technopromexport is also building two power stations in Crimea for which the Siemens-made turbines are intended, according to three sources close to the project. Technopromexport did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. Power Machines, a Russian partner in     Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies LLC, a St Petersburg-based joint venture in which Siemens has a majority stake, declined to comment. ZAO Interautomatika, another Siemens Russian joint venture which sources have told Reuters was involved in the installation and commissioning of the turbines in Crimea, did not respond to a request for comment. Siemens said on Monday that Interautomatika had confirmed in writing Siemens' insistence that all relevant activities with respect to Crimea be immediately terminated. Relations to Russia The Siemens source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Tuesday, referring to the turbines scandal:  We have to think what this means for our relations to Russia.   The source asked not to be named because of the delicacy of the matter.  We can't simply go back to business as usual.   One has to keep a cool head but act responsibly,  the person said on Tuesday.  There must be a certain effect on particular connections.  A spokesman for Siemens declined to comment. Germany's ambassador to Moscow said that Russia will have seriously hurt its prospects for investment if it is confirmed that the Siemens-made turbines have been delivered to Crimea, the Interfax news agency reported. Siemens had said on Monday it would press criminal charges over the moving of its turbines from Russia to Crimea, and would seek to have them returned to Taman, their original destination.   Siemens insists categorically on full compliance with all export control restrictions for itself and also at its partners and customers. In addition, Siemens is evaluating what additional actions are possible,  it said. An EU spokesman said that implementation and enforcement of the EU sanctions was a matter for the bloc's member states.   The (European) Commission is in touch with the German competent authorities on this particular case,â€� he said.  The German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, which represents German industry in the area, defended Siemens. â€œThe sanctions restrictions were strictly followed by the German side,â€� the committeeâ€™s head, Michael Harms, told Reuters. â€œNo German company can afford to be suspected of evading the requirements of the sanctions. Siemens is doing everything to make sure that the restrictions are respected.â€� Siemens made about 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in sales in Russia last year, roughly 2 percent of its total revenue. It is active there primarily in energy and transportation and has said it indirectly employs 48,000 people in the country. Chief Executive Joe Kaeser met President Vladimir Putin several times in his first year after becoming CEO in 2013, and attracted wide criticism for a visit just after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. At the time, he reaffirmed his commitment to Russia, where Siemens has been present for almost 170 years and has invested about a billion euros ($1.14 billion) in the past decade, saying the relationship would not be sidetracked by  short-term turbulence .

The group, whose more than 120 members include International Business Machines Corp, Cisco Systems Inc, the Bank of England and JPMorgan Chase & Co, said on Tuesday that it had released the first version of Hyperledger Fabric, a type of distributed ledger code.  The developers involved in the project believe Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 is strong and secure enough to be used by corporations to start building blockchain-based business applications, the group said.      Application diagram explaining Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric Community members/Handout via REUTERS    Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of data that is maintained by a network of computers, without requiring a trusted third party to validate the veracity of the information.  Banks and other large corporations have been investing hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the technology in the hopes it can help them simplify some of their most cumbersome and costly processes, such as settling securities trades.  More than 150 engineers from 29 organizations contributed to the project.   These kinds deep revolutions take some time, but I am confident that competent development teams inside organizations can start to look at that [Hyperledger Fabric] and go all the way to running it in production,  Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger's executive director, said in an interview.  To speed the development of blockchain, many organizations have formed or joined industry groups. Earlier this year JPMorgan, Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and others formed a blockchain group called the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, while many of the world’s largest banks invested $100 million in blockchain consortium R3.  Despite the excitement, blockchain has yet to be deployed in a large scale project by large companies, and skeptics have cautioned that its benefits may be overblown.  Hyperledger Fabric, for example, does not yet scale to handle as many transactions per second as the payment network of a major credit card company, Behlendorf said.  Proponents note, however, that it is still early days for the technology, likening the current landscape to the early days of the internet.   If this were the web, what year would we be in?  Behlendorf said.  I've felt that we were in 1995, but with this release I am ready to say we are in 1996, when you started to see enterprises saying 'Now it is not just a research project.'

A Siemens source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that Siemens was rethinking some of its business connections in Russia because of the episode, in which it said its Russian customer had acted in bad faith. Siemens, Germany and the European Union are under pressure to show they take potential sanctions-busting seriously after Reuters disclosed that Russia had moved the turbines to Crimea and that a firm part-owned by Siemens had been hired to help install them. Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, a move the European Union denounced as a breach of international law. It then imposed sanctions on Russia which ban EU firms such as Siemens from selling energy technology to Crimea.      Moscow needs the turbines for two Crimean power plants the Kremlin wants to get up and running to fulfill a promise, made by President Vladimir Putin, to ensure a stable power supply for the region's residents. Crimea used to rely on the Ukrainian power grid but is now dependent on Russia for electricity.    The German industrial group originally supplied four turbines for a project in Russia, but said on Monday that at least two of them had been moved to Crimea without its knowledge and against its will. Siemens filed the lawsuit, which court documents show was brought in the Moscow city arbitration court, against Russian state firm Technopromexport which originally bought them for use in a power station in Taman, southern Russia.  Technopromexport is also building two power stations in Crimea for which the Siemens-made turbines are intended, according to three sources close to the project. Technopromexport did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. Power Machines, a Russian partner in     Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies LLC, a St Petersburg-based joint venture in which Siemens has a majority stake, declined to comment. ZAO Interautomatika, another Siemens Russian joint venture which sources have told Reuters was involved in the installation and commissioning of the turbines in Crimea, did not respond to a request for comment. Siemens said on Monday that Interautomatika had confirmed in writing Siemens' insistence that all relevant activities with respect to Crimea be immediately terminated. Relations to Russia The Siemens source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Tuesday, referring to the turbines scandal:  We have to think what this means for our relations to Russia.   The source asked not to be named because of the delicacy of the matter.  We can't simply go back to business as usual.   One has to keep a cool head but act responsibly,  the person said on Tuesday.  There must be a certain effect on particular connections.  A spokesman for Siemens declined to comment. Germany's ambassador to Moscow said that Russia will have seriously hurt its prospects for investment if it is confirmed that the Siemens-made turbines have been delivered to Crimea, the Interfax news agency reported. Siemens had said on Monday it would press criminal charges over the moving of its turbines from Russia to Crimea, and would seek to have them returned to Taman, their original destination.   Siemens insists categorically on full compliance with all export control restrictions for itself and also at its partners and customers. In addition, Siemens is evaluating what additional actions are possible,  it said. An EU spokesman said that implementation and enforcement of the EU sanctions was a matter for the bloc's member states.   The (European) Commission is in touch with the German competent authorities on this particular case,â€� he said.  The German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations, which represents German industry in the area, defended Siemens. â€œThe sanctions restrictions were strictly followed by the German side,â€� the committeeâ€™s head, Michael Harms, told Reuters. â€œNo German company can afford to be suspected of evading the requirements of the sanctions. Siemens is doing everything to make sure that the restrictions are respected.â€� Siemens made about 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in sales in Russia last year, roughly 2 percent of its total revenue. It is active there primarily in energy and transportation and has said it indirectly employs 48,000 people in the country. Chief Executive Joe Kaeser met President Vladimir Putin several times in his first year after becoming CEO in 2013, and attracted wide criticism for a visit just after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. At the time, he reaffirmed his commitment to Russia, where Siemens has been present for almost 170 years and has invested about a billion euros ($1.14 billion) in the past decade, saying the relationship would not be sidetracked by  short-term turbulence .

The Crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,  said the June 3, 2016, email to Donald Trump Jr. from publicist Rob Goldstone. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., agreed to meet with a Kremlin-linked lawyer during the 2016 election campaign after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton, the New York Times reported on Sunday.  I think people are worried that it just means more political uncertainty, and sort of a continuation of the stalemate in Washington, a continuation of the delay in trying to get the Trump agenda passed through Congress,  said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York.

And poor-quality sleep over time was associated with higher levels of tau, a different Alzheimerâ€™s-associated protein, in the cerebrospinal fluid, Dr. Yo-El Ju of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and colleagues found. â€œThe worse someoneâ€™s sleep quality, the more their amyloid beta and tau increase, and both amyloid beta and tau are involved in Alzheimerâ€™s over the long-term,â€� Ju told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. â€œI donâ€™t think people should worry about Alzheimerâ€™s disease after one bad night. I do think chronic sleep disruption increases the risk of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.â€� Amyloid-beta and tau make up the plaques and tangles in the brain that are the hallmark of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Past studies have shown that amyloid beta levels drop during sleep and rise during wakefulness, and that just one night of sleep deprivation increases amyloid beta levels, Juâ€™s team writes in the journal Brain. But it hasnâ€™t been clear exactly what aspect of sleep disruption caused the build-up of the protein. They hypothesized that it was the interruption of slow-wave sleep - the deepest stage of dreamless sleep, when brain cells are at rest - because that is when amyloid-beta levels normally drop. â€œBecause brain cells release amyloid beta during activity, we think if the brain cells canâ€™t rest the way theyâ€™re supposed to and get that deep sleep, they produce a relative excess of amyloid,â€� Ju said. In the study, 17 healthy men and women aged 35 to 65 years took part in two sets of procedures, about a month apart. Both involved an overnight sleep study while wearing headphones, followed by a spinal tap in the morning to draw cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. In one sleep session, researchers monitored brain activity and when the person was entering slow-wave sleep, a tone was delivered through the headphones to prevent it. In the second session, slow-wave sleep was not interrupted. The study team found that disrupted slow-wave sleep was followed by higher levels of amyloid-beta in cerebrospinal fluid in the morning.  â€œTau takes much longer to get from the brain down to the lower back where the spinal fluid is measured, so for tau we looked at sleep in the preceding week as we had measured it with an actigraph,â€� Ju said. â€œWe found that the worse the sleep quality in the preceding week, the higher the tau.â€� The study doesnâ€™t prove whether or how disrupted sleep contributes to the risk of developing Alzheimerâ€™s disease. But Alzheimerâ€™s is associated with disrupted sleep â€œin a bi-directional manner,â€� the researchers note, so the results shed light on one possible mechanism.   The team is now investigating whether treating obstructive sleep apnea - which is associated with multiple sleep interruptions each night, as well as an increased risk of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and much earlier dementia onset - can reduce levels of amyloid beta and tau, and potentially Alzheimerâ€™s risk. â€œThere are things that we can all improve upon to get the best sleep that we are capable of,â€� Ju said. â€œIf someone suspects that they have sleep apnea, they should really seek evaluation and treatment.â€� â€œThis is yet another piece of information that suggests that sleep disruption certainly can be a risk for development of subsequent Alzheimerâ€™s disease,â€� said Dr. Andrew Varga, a neuroscientist and neurologist at The Mount Sinai Integrative Sleep Center in New York City who studies sleep and Alzheimerâ€™s. The findings raise the question of whether improving sleep quality and increasing slow wave sleep, even in people without sleep disorders, could lead to lower levels of amyloid-beta and tau, and possibly slow or prevent the development of Alzheimerâ€™s, said Varga, who wasnâ€™t involved in the study. While certain drugs and even sound stimuli have been used experimentally to promote slow-wave sleep, he noted, â€œnot just the presence but the timing of the slow waves may be really important.â€� SOURCE: bit.ly/2tE8PFH Brain, online July 10, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sleep-amyloid-alzheimers-idUSKBN19W1WR"},

I was in great form and the team were really strong around me as well. It is disappointing. I think after seeing the crash it was lucky that I came away with the injuries that I have.  Porte, who had been tipped as a potential race leader and a serious rival to defending champion Chris Froome, will not rush his comeback.  I don't think I will be back on my bike for a good while now, but I think the team is good with that.

This is the final step of the ratification process through which the EU and Ukraine commit to a close, long-term relationship in all main policy areas,  it said in a statement. Many provisions of the deal were already operating on a provisional basis, it said, adding that the its conclusion would bring a  new impetus to the cooperation . Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will meet Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for the 24-hour summit, starting with a dinner on Wednesday in Kiev. Poroshenko voiced confidence on Tuesday that the second-biggest ex-Soviet state would move closer to membership of the EU and the NATO defense alliance -- although neither body sees that as remotely likely in the coming years.  I am confident we will win,  Poroshenko said in a statement.  Ukraine will definitely be in the family of European nations, both in the European Union and in NATO.  A senior EU official said that the summit was expected to be upbeat in tone:  This is a very positive moment in our relationship,  he said, noting that a long-standing ambition for Ukrainians to have visa-free access to the EU had become a reality last month for those with modern, biometric passports. However, Ukraine still has much to do to reform Soviet-era administration and infrastructure to bring it closer into line with its western neighbors and to curb corruption, he added. The summit agenda covers Ukrainian reforms and the implementation of the trade and association pact, security in Ukraine - notably the peace process with Russia over the conflict in the east - and regional and foreign policy matters. The EU and Ukraine have been concerned that President Donald Trump could scale back U.S. support for Ukraine in the interests of improving ties with Russia. But EU officials and Poroshenko welcomed as a sign of support Trump's appointment at the weekend of a special envoy for Ukraine as well as a visit to Kiev on Sunday by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.[nL8N1K00IY] Poroshenko welcomed NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Monday and said Kiev would work on a membership plan, something Moscow said would not promote stability.

The planned labor reform, which investors see as critical to boost long-term economic growth, is expected to clear a final Senate vote later in the day.      Traders said the vote will serve as a gauge of lawmaker's support for Temer's reform platform, which came under pressure in recent months after he was caught on tape allegedly condoning bribes to silence a key witness in Brazil's largest-ever corruption scandal.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.4 percent, as rising prices of crude and iron ore lifted shares of state-controlled oil company PetrÃ³leo Brasileiro SA and miner Vale SA.     Shares of planemaker Embraer SA also advanced following strong second-quarter delivery figures.     The Brazilian real seesawed, in line with other Latin American currencies amid a lack of major market-moving data.     Investors have closely followed U.S. economic indicators in search of clues over the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes next year.

The deal marks EQT's second major investment in the U.S. healthcare sector, and highlights the continued appetite for companies that help drugmakers with their research and development processes. News of the deal was first reported by Reuters.  Princeton, New Jersey-based Certara provides technology and consulting services aimed at helping pharmaceutical companies obtain approval for their treatments. It offers a novel technology that allows drugmakers to model the performance of drugs, in some cases reducing the need for costly and potentially dangerous clinical testing.  Certara also operates a consulting arm aimed at assisting drug makers with submissions to regulators.   Today, Certara is the global leader in an exciting and rapidly developing market, uniquely positioned to transform the field of drug development,  Eric Liu, a partner at EQT, said in a statement.   Last year, Stockholm, Sweden-based EQT made its first major U.S. healthcare investment, buying Press Ganey Holdings Inc, a provider of patient satisfaction surveys, for around $2.35 billion.  EQT has made more than $8 billion in healthcare investments in the past three years, including in companies such as prosthetics maker Ottobock and Sivantos Group, one of the world's leading manufacturers of hearing aids. There has been a flurry of private equity investments in the pharmaceutical services sector in recent years, as the sector benefits from pharmaceutical companies' drive to cut costs, reduce clinical trial times and expand their research and development presence around the world. Recent deals include INC Research Holdings Inc's $7.4 billion merger with inVentiv Health Holdings and Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc's $17.6 billion merger with IMS Health Holdings Inc.

During the 1970s and 1980s, blood products supplied to the NHS was contaminated with viruses such as HIV or hepatitis C and infected thousands of people with hemophilia or other bleeding disorders. Health minister Philip Dunne said many documents were publicly available which gave a comprehensive picture of events and decisions made at the time.  However, I recognise for those affected these steps do not go far enough to provide the answers that they want to get to the truth of what happened,  he told parliament.  In light of these concerns and a report of new evidence and allegations of potential criminality, we think it is important to understand the extent of what is claimed and the wider issues that arise.  Families of victims will be consulted to decide what form the inquiry would take. A report by lawmakers in 2015 said the Department of Health estimated that more than 30,000 people might have been infected with hepatitis C between 1970 and 1991 when Britain imported some blood products from the United States but just 6,000 had been identified.  A further 1,500 were infected with HIV between 1978 and 1985. The inquiry comes after leaders from all of Britain's main political parties, except the ruling Conservatives, wrote a joint letter to May demanding an investigation into the issue.  For decades people with bleeding disorders and their families have sought the truth,  said Liz Carroll, Chief Executive of The Haemophilia Society.  Instead, they were told by the government that no mistakes were made while it repeatedly refused to acknowledge evidence of negligence and a subsequent cover up. Finally, they will have the chance to see justice.  Reporting by Michael Holden, editing by Pritha Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-health-blood-idUSKBN19W1JF"},

Yields across the bloc fell on Monday, retracing some of the sharp rise seen over the last two weeks in which the benchmark German 10-year yield has more than doubled on the growing view that the European Central Bank will begin reining in its ultra-loose policy sooner rather than later. They remained under upward pressure after ECB director Benoit Coeure said on Tuesday that a weaker euro is neither a means nor a goal of the central bank's massive bond purchases. Analysts said they were also looking ahead to a speech by Fed Governor Lael Brainard on the topic of normalising central banks' balance sheets, while Fed chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony to Congress follows on Wednesday. San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said earlier on Tuesday in Sydney that he expected the Fed to start unwinding its massive balance sheet in the next few months and for it to raise rates one more time this year.  Given the recent sensitivity to central bank talk about unwinding emergency stimulus, today's speech by the Fed's Brainard... looks like a compelling read before Yellen's testimony moves into focus tomorrow,  said Padhraic Garvey, global head of debt and rates strategy at ING. Germany's 10-year yield was up 2 basis points on Tuesday at 0.56 percent, reversing some of a near 4 basis point fall on Monday, which was the biggest daily drop in around a month. That drop appears to have been just a pause in a sell-off that has seen Germany's 10-year yield more than double from the 0.25 percent it was at on June 27, the day ECB President Mario Draghi hinted at the possibility of tweaking the central bank's aggressive stimulus in a speech in Sintra, Portugal. The yield remains within touching distance of an 18-month high of 0.583 percent hit in early trading on Monday. Other euro zone bond yields were up 1-4 bps on the day.  The concerted global pivot toward reduced monetary policy stimulus has left investors needing to balance the improved attractiveness of government bond yields after the recent selloff with anxiety over portfolio vulnerability to renewed selling pressures as central banks scale back liquidity,  said Lena Komileva, managing director at G+ Economics.

The regulator noted Orange's dominance in the French corporate market and said small and medium-sized (SMEs) companies needed to have a  real choice  in fibre, which offers higher Internet speeds than the copper-based ADSL alternatives.  The development of a fibre mass market for micro enterprises and SMEs is a vital part of the French economy's digitisation,  Arcep said.  Arcep has noted Orange's very strong position in the business market,  it added. New measures will include imposing an obligation on Orange to allow alternative service providers to re-sell its  products to the business market, and controlling pricing for wholesale offers to businesses to avoid  excessive  and  predatory pricing . Orange Chief Executive Stephane Richard told a business conference in Paris that the change would increase the competitive pressures it faced, but expressed relief at having avoided a tougher regulatory regime elsewhere.  For us the main thing is there is no asymmetric regulation of Orange in fibre-optics. That has been respected,  he said. The regulatory changes are set to be implemented from January 2018 onwards, and will be formally adopted after a public consultation, with the final decisions due before the end of November, Arcep said. Orange, formerly the state-owned monopoly France Telecom, has invested heavily in developing a  fibre to the home  (FTTH) network in France, becoming the market leader in this service. But rivals SFR Group and Iliad have also entered the race and are spending billions building their own fibre networks.

The buyout firms sweetened their takeover offer by 25 cents per share to â‚¬66.25, approximately â‚¬16m above the â‚¬5.3bn prior offer that fell through. The private equity groups also lowered their acceptance threshold to 63%, after the last offer failed to win the backing of the 67.5% they had targeted, getting just 65.52%, Stada said. Underwriting banks are now working out a syndication strategy for selling down the debt financing and a decision will be made within the next couple of weeks, the sources said. â€œLaunch now or wait until September? A decision needs to be made in the next couple of weeks as if it gets too late into July then the banks will probably have to wait until the end of August or September,â€� a senior banker said. If the banks decide to sell before the outcome of the takeover is known, the financing could launch to the market before the summer break, the sources said. The other option is for banks to launch the financing when there is more clarity on the takeover process, but this involves the banks holding large amounts of debt on their balance sheets for a longer period. Another advantage of launching sooner rather than later is that Europeâ€™s leveraged loan and bond markets are very receptive to new supply at the moment, despite a recent uptick in new deals. Stada is expected to gain lots of attention, given its size and the opportunity for investors to put meaningful money to work in sizeable tickets, the sources said. â€œThere is an awful lot of debt to raise in quite a short space of time, in a market that is busy. However, whenever Stada comes it is big enough to command attention and it is a deal that people must look at,â€� a leveraged finance head said. Structure The financing is expected to comprise a â‚¬1.95bn seven-year senior secure term loan B facility; â‚¬485m of seven-year senior secured fixed rate bonds; â‚¬340m of eight-year senior unsecured fixed rate notes; and a â‚¬400m seven-year revolver. The size and shape of the financing could alter slightly, given the revised offer, the sources said. Banks also need to decide if they will apply the same timetable to the loans and bonds or alter their plans between the two asset classes, the sources said. Whenever the deal syndicates, loan investors will be offered a ticking fee, which pays a proportion of the interest until the acquisition closes and the deal funds, while the bonds will fund into escrow, the sources said. Banks will be eager for the takeover to be approved as they are set to receive â‚¬60m of fees altogether -- around â‚¬7.5m each -- based on a 2% underwriting fee, sources said. A fee of this size is unprecedented so far this year after a flood of unprofitable and time consuming repricings and refinancings. Barclays, Citigroup, Commerzbank, Jefferies, JP Morgan, Nomura, Societe Generale and UBS have underwritten the financing. Barclays, Nomura and UBS are leading the TLB financing, Citi is leading the secured bond and JP Morgan is leading the unsecured bond. Bain and Cinven were not immediately available to comment.

In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan said the FDIC could try to show it still had legal standing to sue as the receiver for Austin-based Guaranty Bank, despite having transferred its claims to a  resecuritization trust  when it sold the debt in March 2010. The FDIC, whose full name is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, had accused the three banks in its lawsuits of failing, as bond trustees, to monitor the underwriting and servicing of mortgages backing $2.7 billion of securities that Guaranty bought. The FDIC has estimated that Guaranty's failure in August 2009 could cost its deposit insurance fund $3 billion. Carter's decision, dated on Monday, said the FDIC could invoke a federal rule allowing the resecuritization trust, which the regulator said does have standing, to ratify its claims.  Defendants do not contest that ratification is an option for plaintiff under the resecuritization agreements,  Carter wrote. He gave the FDIC 90 days to file an amended complaint. An FDIC spokesman declined to comment. According to the lawsuits, the securities were issued from 2005 to 2007. Some were sponsored by the EMC unit of Bear Stearns Cos and the others by a unit of Countrywide Financial Corp. The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York are FDIC v.

Sterling hit an 8-month low against the euro as a result. EURGBP= Broadbent's speech in Aberdeen to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry had been keenly watched as a chance to hear the views of a rate-setter who has not commented publicly since the Monetary Policy Committee came unexpectedly close to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade last month. But Tuesday's comments shed little light. Instead, he spoke on how a reduction in trade between Britain and the European Union would harm both economies and causes prices to rise. His trade comments came after businesses last week pressed Prime Minister Theresa May to negotiate a smooth Brexit when Britain leaves the EU in just under two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter trade and investment. If Britain could not trade easily with the EU, it would end up having to produce more of the things it is less efficient at creating and currently imports, Broadbent said.  All else equal, the first shift - i.e. away from services exports - would tend to lower UK income, the second to raise certain costs - that is, of food and machinery,  he said.  Trade really is mutually beneficial and less of it costs us all,  he added. But it was his views on interest rates that were missing. BoE VOTES The MPC split 5-3 in favor of keeping rates at a record-low 0.25 percent, and since then both BoE Governor Mark Carney and chief economist Andy Haldane -- who backed keeping rates on hold -- have shown some willingness to consider a rate rise this year. Several analysts have said the views of Broadbent -- who is deputy governor for monetary policy -- will be key to assessing the chances of a first BoE rate hike in a decade. Broadbent has yet to dissent against the views of Carney since taking up his post as deputy governor in 2014. Newcomer Silvana Tenreyro, who replaced hike advocate  Kristin Forbes this month, has also not spoken publicly.  You have to scrape the barrel to get Broadbent's views ahead of the August MPC. If scraping I would say (this) points to a 'no change' vote given recent weak exports data,  said Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, on Twitter. Previously, Broadbent has sounded cautious about the outlook for economy as Britain negotiates its departure from the EU. In March he said British exporters cannot count on enjoying the  sweet spot  which was created by the Brexit vote last year for long. Last week MPC members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders said they were upbeat about the ability of exports and investment to help offset a slowdown in consumer spending.

At this stage, it seems quite clear that it will be necessary to relocate a certain number of jobs to the euro zone,  Oudea told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Paris, attended by French prime minister Edouard Philippe and banking executives from JP Morgan (JPM.N), HSBC (HSBA.L), BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Amundi (AMUN.PA). Oudea said the possible move of jobs after Brexit would affect 300-400 investment banking jobs out of 2,000 it has overall for that business in London. The new French government has stepped up efforts to attract London banks to Paris after Brexit, pledging to cut labor costs and ensure they do not face tougher regulations than European rivals. It also aims to transform the French capital into Europe's new top financial center, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of the French bank Societe Generale is seen in front of the bank's headquarters building at La Defense business and financial district in Courbevoie near Paris, France, April 21, 2016.Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo In this scenario, in the light of the decisions taken by the government, we will concentrate the relocations in France,  added Oudea. President Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker, has a hard task to convince the investment community that France does not see the financial sector as an  enemy  - a phrase once used by former socialist President Francois Hollande.  We look at the decisions that mark a very clear change in the position,  Oudea said.  When the government says...it considers it (finance) is the important economic sector, a sector of excellence for France, and that this government wants to encourage finance . French banks have said that Brexit was not a big issue for them, given that they have Paris trading hubs and all the necessary licenses to operate in the region.

That was courtesy of whoever warranted 86,950 tonnes of metal in LME sheds. It was the fourth time since December that LME copper stocks have been rocked by huge inflows. All four  arrivals events  have been unprecedented in scale, and the cumulative inflow has been in excess of 500,000 tonnes. The London aluminium market has grown accustomed to huge tonnages appearing and disappearing in the LME warehouse network. But prior to last December the largest concentrated warranting in the copper market took place in February 2015, when 32,750 tonnes showed up on a single day. These running stock shocks have obscured any coherent market narrative behind a lot of smoke and several mirrors. Copper is a market that is collectively trying to work out whether it is in supply surplus or shortfall. Opinions are divided. The median forecast in the latest quarterly Reuters base metals poll of analysts was for a 17,000-tonne deficit for 2017. Well, good luck trying to discern such a small market balance from LME stocks right now. Don't despair, however. There's a bigger stocks picture which is generating a better signal of copper's supply-chain dynamics. It's just that the LME's part in that picture appears to be changing. Scream if You Want to Go Faster This latest  arrivals event  is just another whirl of a copper stocks merry-go-round that has been spinning for many months. The previous three spins took place in May, March and last December. There was a precedent in August 2016 as well, although the warranting action in that month was more dispersed. There are two common themes to all these stocks shocks. What enters the system does so primarily at Asian locations. Cumulative  arrivals event  inflows have been concentrated on the ports of Busan in South Korea, Singapore, Kaohsiung in Taiwan and Port Klang in Malaysia. The only exception has been Rotterdam, which has seen significant inflows over the same days. And what enters the system doesn't stay around for long. May's  arrivals event  saw 126,150 tonnes warranted in just three days, boosting headline stocks to a six-month high of 354,650 tonnes. By the time of the most recent surge, however, they had fallen back to 243,300 tonnes. What's going on? A big bull-bear battle is what's going on. One rooted in physical flow, warehousing and arbitrage dynamics. Metal is being relentlessly shuffled between LME and off-market storage and between geographic locations. Reading the game is hard because most of it is taking place in the physical market shadows. This feud has also become a battle of market narrative, each player using LME stocks to express an opposing view. The problem is that the smoke of battle has hopelessly distorted any stocks' pricing signal, bullish or bearish. An LME copper stocks chart right now looks like a badly drawn zig-zag. And it's getting worse, because this merry-go-round seems to be turning ever faster. The Bigger Picture There is some good news, though. Firstly, it's questionable just how much these games with LME stocks have impacted price. LME three-month copper has held station in a broad $5,420-6,205 range since the start of December. Time-spreads, which should be more sensitive to stocks shocks, have largely held steady over the same period. The benchmark cash-to-three months spread CMCU0-3 was valued at $28-per tonne contango at the close of Monday. Secondly, LME stocks are only one third of the visible copper stocks picture. The other two components are the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and CME (COMEX). Taking all three together, as of last Friday the cumulative net change so far this year was a build of 114,040 tonnes. It's not an outlandish signal, factoring in both this year's increased scrap availability and lower Chinese imports. Nor is it dramatically out of line with the latest market balance assessment from the International Copper Study Group. According to the ICSG, the global refined market recorded a supply surplus of 164,000 tonnes or, seasonally adjusted, 72,000 tonnes in the first quarter of this year. The bigger picture is clearer because the other two components have acted in different ways to mitigate the volatility emanating from the LME stocks battleground. First, ShFE stocks have tended to move inversely to those registered with the LME. The net stocks change across the two exchanges over the first half of 2017 was a decline of just 3,528 tonnes. This is not coincidental since China sits at the centre of the Asian physical and arbitrage markets, placing it at the heart of the ongoing tug-of-war between bull and bear. ShFE stocks have become a second, more distant front in the same struggle. Second, without anyone paying too much intention, COMEX warehouses are filling up to levels not seen in many, many years. Total deliverable stocks currently stand at 164,184 imperial tons, equivalent to 148,947 tonnes, of which all but 1,447 tons are on warrant. It's the highest count since May 2004. Even with the latest  arrivals event  in the LME system, it is the 68,026-tonne rise in COMEX stocks that has generated most of the global exchange stocks increase this year. Realigning the Lens The COMEX warehouse system has only U.S. good delivery points so should, in theory, be largely reflective of domestic market availability. But this stocks build has been running for 11 straight months and suggests something more structural than cyclical. It's possible we're seeing a reaction to the threat of U.S. trade tariffs. The prospect has caused a shift in physical market flows in several industrial metals as merchants look to build  just in case  inventory in the United States. It's also possible that rising exchange inventories are in some way related to rising trade activity on the CME copper contract, although disentangling cause and effect is an impossible task. CME copper volumes rose by 18.5 percent in the first seven months of this year and, equally significantly, open interest at the end of June was up by 59 percent. It's all part of an increasingly complex global trading environment for old  Dr Copper . Trading is no longer concentrated just on the LME but is dispersing in still-evolving ways across all three major time zones. Copper stocks may be starting to mirror that new landscape. Certainly, the COMEX warehouse system is no longer a marginal part of the global stocks picture. COMEX copper stocks currently account for 23 percent of global exchange stocks. They have been the key driver of the overall rise in visible inventory this year, a trend that has been lost in the noise of the LME system and the echo from the ShFE system. So, if you're finding LME stocks a bit of a confusing read right now, take a step out of the optical illusion machine and focus on the bigger picture.

May wants to signal that it is business as usual for her government after an ill-judged election gamble damaged her authority and eliminated her governing Conservatives' majority in parliament, emboldening the main opposition Labour Party. The review into employment practices, which she ordered after becoming prime minister a year ago, is viewed as a bid to show that her promise to help poorer Britons who are  just about managing  is more than just a slogan. The review, compiled by Chief Executive of The Royal Society of Arts Matthew Taylor, says many of those Britons working for companies such as taxi app Uber and takeaway food courier Deliveroo should receive more benefits such as the minimum wage. May said her government would consider the findings of the report, but stopped short of promising to implement it in full.  What's clear from Matthew's report is that our response to the changing world of work cannot be to try to stop the clock,  May said.  While avoiding overbearing regulation, we will make sure people have the rights and protections they need.  Related CoverageFactbox - UK report on 'gig economy' :principles and proposalsShe also urged her political rivals to  contribute, not just criticise  her plans - a move reflecting both her need for help to push reforms through parliament and her resolve to press ahead despite questions about her future as leader. App Workers More and more people are working for apps in fast-growing sectors such as takeaway delivery and taxi services. While wanting the flexibility such work offers, some say they are left without the protections that traditional jobs offer. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street, London, Britain July 11, 2017.Peter NichollsLast year, judges sided with two self-employed drivers at Uber who had argued that they deserve workers' rights such as the minimum wage. The move would add to the San Francisco-based firm's costs and this prompted it to appeal.  Responding to the review on Tuesday, Uber said it would welcome greater clarity in the law, while Deliveroo said any attempt to limit job flexibility could undermine the gig economy and that any new measures should avoid restricting their ability to expand. In Britain, the self-employed have no entitlement to employment rights beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination laws. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street, London, Britain July 11, 2017.Peter NichollsBut the review proposes renaming workers such as those operating in the gig economy as  dependent contractors , with many of them becoming entitled to annual leave, rest breaks and the minimum wage. Firms would have to prove that an average person, working  averagely hard , is able to earn the national living wage, which stands at 7.50 pounds ($9.65) an hour for the over-25s, with a 20 percent margin of error, it said.   The best way to achieve better work is not national regulation but responsible corporate governance, good management and strong employment relations within the organization.  But Britain's biggest union Unite said the government needed to make sure entitlements were upheld.  May hopes the report will woo working class voters, but the Labour opposition said it did little more than highlight the Conservatives' record of  failing working people .  If they were serious about workers' rights they are welcome to borrow from Labour's manifesto,  said Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour's business spokeswoman.

Top executives at five of the largest banks in the capital told Reuters a staggered deal on leaving the European Union is only likely to be agreed late on in talks with Brussels, meaning they have already begun relocating staff.   And a more conciliatory government tone towards business, having largely refrained from engaging with corporate leaders about Brexit ahead of last month's election, may be too late.        The timeframe for when we wanted a transitional deal has already passed,  an executive at one global bank said, adding it had taken a decision to move hundreds of roles to continental Europe regardless of what the government does. Finance minister Philip Hammond said last week that Britain should push for a transitional deal to help businesses, while the government held its first high level meeting with corporate leaders in months to discuss Brexit.     But James Bardrick, the UK head of U.S. bank Citi (C.N), said the government has been too slow to get any early deals with Europe and banks will have to be ready by September 2018.  There's been a lot of talk and not a lot of action for a long time. I am anxious it is all a bit late,  Bardrick said.     Executives say the timetable to relocate staff and operations is tighter than it looks because it could take longer than eighteen months to set up new buildings, get licenses, hire or relocate staff and build up the capital of EU divisions.      The chairman of one of Britain's largest banks told Reuters he recently resisted pressure from staff to enact his company's contingency plan, but he will probably have to give the go-ahead by the end of the summer.        Every single day I have people coming into my office asking me to press the button on contingency plans,  he said.

Carney has asked banks to show by Friday how they can avoid their customers being abruptly cut off after Brexit, which bankers say may inadvertently speed up the departure of jobs from Britain.     The Department for Exiting the European Union did not immediately respond to a request for comment.       FILE PHOTO: A worker arrives at his office in the Canary Wharf business district in London February 26, 2014.Eddie Keogh/File PhotoThe British government is yet to ask for a transitional deal and any plans are likely to face opposition from eurosceptic British lawmakers who view it as delaying exiting the EU.     Executives are pessimistic about Britain getting a bridging period until late in the talks - if at all - because they say it must first agree with the EU its exit terms, notably the rights of expatriate citizens and any money it owes. An executive at a large British bank said many Britons are not prepared to pay an exit bill, which is likely to lead to a protracted row that will delay agreement on other measures. Only then can Britain move on to discuss a future deal and possible transitional arrangements and any deal is likely to be complicated because Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the authority of the European Court of Justice.      Jobs are moving out of the City by the day. Even by the turn of the year, a transition agreement will be too late.         James Palmer, a senior partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, said many banks have accelerated plans to relocate parts of their businesses after the inconclusive results of last month's general election because it has increased the likelihood that Britain walks away without a deal.       Therefore getting a transition committed now is absolutely fundamental,  Palmer said, adding that if politicians did not take this on board they  will have failed, and will have failure on their tombstones as their legacies .

The greenback was up 0.32 percent to 114.4 yen, after hitting 114.47 yen, its highest since March 15, earlier in the session.  The dollar is enjoying an increased yield appeal relative to the Japanese yen,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth FX in Washington. Investors have dumped euro zone government bonds over the last two weeks on expectations the European Central Bank (ECB) would unwind extraordinary stimulus sooner rather than later. The resulting surge in euro zone yields also helped the benchmark Treasury yield climb to two-month highs on Friday. Japanese government bond (JGB) yields had also tracked the rise in their U.S. and euro zone counterparts. Last week, however, the Bank of Japan stepped in and halted the move through a special debt-buying operation, intent on keeping yields anchored close to zero. With U.S. yields free to rise, the spread between 10-year Treasury and JGB yields is the widest it has been in about two months, contributing to the dollar's strength against the yen. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.06 percent to 96.082. Investors were waiting for U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress on Wednesday and U.S. consumer inflation data on Friday, for the next big cue for currency markets.

Sterling slipped to a near two-week low against the dollar and the euro after a speech by Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent left the outlook for interest rates unanswered.

The group, whose more than 120 members include International Business Machines Corp, Cisco Systems Inc, the Bank of England and JPMorgan Chase & Co, said on Tuesday that it had released the first version of Hyperledger Fabric, a type of distributed ledger code.  The developers involved in the project believe Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 is strong and secure enough to be used by corporations to start building blockchain-based business applications, the group said.      Application diagram explaining Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric Community members/Handout via REUTERS    Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of data that is maintained by a network of computers, without requiring a trusted third party to validate the veracity of the information.  Banks and other large corporations have been investing hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the technology in the hopes it can help them simplify some of their most cumbersome and costly processes, such as settling securities trades.  More than 150 engineers from 29 organizations contributed to the project.   These kinds deep revolutions take some time, but I am confident that competent development teams inside organizations can start to look at that [Hyperledger Fabric] and go all the way to running it in production,  Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger's executive director, said in an interview.  To speed the development of blockchain, many organizations have formed or joined industry groups. Earlier this year JPMorgan, Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and others formed a blockchain group called the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, while many of the world’s largest banks invested $100 million in blockchain consortium R3.  Despite the excitement, blockchain has yet to be deployed in a large scale project by large companies, and skeptics have cautioned that its benefits may be overblown.  Hyperledger Fabric, for example, does not yet scale to handle as many transactions per second as the payment network of a major credit card company, Behlendorf said.  Proponents note, however, that it is still early days for the technology, likening the current landscape to the early days of the internet.   If this were the web, what year would we be in?  Behlendorf said.  I've felt that we were in 1995, but with this release I am ready to say we are in 1996, when you started to see enterprises saying 'Now it is not just a research project.'

Sterling hit an 8-month low against the euro as a result. EURGBP= Broadbent's speech in Aberdeen to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry had been keenly watched as a chance to hear the views of a rate-setter who has not commented publicly since the Monetary Policy Committee came unexpectedly close to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade last month. But Tuesday's comments shed little light. Instead, he spoke on how a reduction in trade between Britain and the European Union would harm both economies and causes prices to rise. His trade comments came after businesses last week pressed Prime Minister Theresa May to negotiate a smooth Brexit when Britain leaves the EU in just under two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter trade and investment. If Britain could not trade easily with the EU, it would end up having to produce more of the things it is less efficient at creating and currently imports, Broadbent said.  All else equal, the first shift - i.e. away from services exports - would tend to lower UK income, the second to raise certain costs - that is, of food and machinery,  he said.  Trade really is mutually beneficial and less of it costs us all,  he added. But it was his views on interest rates that were missing. BoE VOTES The MPC split 5-3 in favor of keeping rates at a record-low 0.25 percent, and since then both BoE Governor Mark Carney and chief economist Andy Haldane -- who backed keeping rates on hold -- have shown some willingness to consider a rate rise this year. Several analysts have said the views of Broadbent -- who is deputy governor for monetary policy -- will be key to assessing the chances of a first BoE rate hike in a decade. Broadbent has yet to dissent against the views of Carney since taking up his post as deputy governor in 2014. Newcomer Silvana Tenreyro, who replaced hike advocate  Kristin Forbes this month, has also not spoken publicly.  You have to scrape the barrel to get Broadbent's views ahead of the August MPC. If scraping I would say (this) points to a 'no change' vote given recent weak exports data,  said Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, on Twitter. Previously, Broadbent has sounded cautious about the outlook for economy as Britain negotiates its departure from the EU. In March he said British exporters cannot count on enjoying the  sweet spot  which was created by the Brexit vote last year for long. Last week MPC members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders said they were upbeat about the ability of exports and investment to help offset a slowdown in consumer spending.

In February the European Commission proposed extending for an indefinite period an exemption for flights into and out of the EU from having to buy credits under its carbon emissions trading system after the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) struck a deal in October on a global market-based measure for offsetting airline emissions. The EU had ordered carriers to buy credits for foreign flights under its emissions trading system (ETS) in 2012 but backtracked when countries said it violated their sovereignty and China threatened to cancel plane orders from Airbus Group. It agreed to exempt international flights until the start of 2017 to give ICAO time to strike a global deal.  It is sensible that we extend the exemption for international flights to and from the EU until there is greater clarity on the ICAO scheme,  said Julie Girling, member of the European Parliament, who is steering the legislation through the EU legislature.  However, unlike the European Commission, I believe this exemption must be time limited so that we can be sure that the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) will deliver its objectives,â€� Girling said after MEPs voted on the proposal in the Environment Committee. Before the extension of the exemption becomes law, the Parliament will have to find a compromise with EU member states in the Council of the EU, which backed the Commission's proposal to extend it indefinitely. The ICAO deal was immediately criticised by environmental campaigners and MEPs who say it does not go far enough to curb aviation emissions. Aviation accounts for approximately 2.1 percent of global CO2 emissions and these are expected to be about seven to 10 times higher in 2050 compared with 1990 levels, according to ICAO. The extension will have to be agreed by March 2018, when airlines will be required to surrender carbon emission  allowances. Airlines back the ICAO deal, which will not be mandatory until 2027, as they want to avoid having to navigate a disparate number of national and regional schemes. The fate of the emissions trading system (ETS) covering flights within Europe will also be assessed before the ICAO deal comes into effect, with the EU Parliament calling for it to be merged with the global system, while airlines would prefer to see it dismantled.

The lawsuit, brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York and joined by seven individual Twitter users, claims Trump blocked a number of accounts whose owners replied to his tweets with comments that criticized, mocked or disagreed with the president. Trump's blocking of those accounts amounts to an unconstitutional effort to suppress dissent, the lawsuit claims. Because Trump frequently turns to Twitter to make policy statements, his account qualifies as a public forum from which the government cannot exclude people on the basis of their views, the suit alleges. Twitter users are unable to see or respond to tweets from accounts that block them. The White House could not be immediately reached for comment. Last month White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump's tweets were considered  official statements by the president of the United States.  The complaint follows a letter from the Knight Institute sent to Trump last month that warned of a suit if users were not unblocked.  Everyone being able to see the president's tweets feels vital to democracy,  Joseph Papp, one of the seven Twitter users involved in the suit, said in a statement. Papp, an author, said he had been a registered Republican for 10 years and did not join the suit for political reasons, but that he  felt a deep sense of unease  when he was blocked. Trump's Twitter use has drawn media attention for his unvarnished commentary about his agenda and attacks on critics. His tweets often lead to tens of thousands of retweets and comments and can shape the news. Independent free speech and internet law scholars have said the Knight Institute's arguments may have merit, in part because Trump's tweets are used to announce policy decisions or can influence legislation. Previous cases involving politicians blocking users on Facebook may bolster its case. The federal suit, case number 1:17-cv-05205, was filed in the Southern District of New York.

In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan said the FDIC could try to show it still had legal standing to sue as the receiver for Austin-based Guaranty Bank, despite having transferred its claims to a  resecuritization trust  when it sold the debt in March 2010. The FDIC, whose full name is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, had accused the three banks in its lawsuits of failing, as bond trustees, to monitor the underwriting and servicing of mortgages backing $2.7 billion of securities that Guaranty bought. The FDIC has estimated that Guaranty's failure in August 2009 could cost its deposit insurance fund $3 billion. Carter's decision, dated on Monday, said the FDIC could invoke a federal rule allowing the resecuritization trust, which the regulator said does have standing, to ratify its claims.

The deal with privately held Bruin E&P Partners LLC focuses HalcÃ³n on the most-active area in the U.S. oil industry and marks a stunning turnaround for Chief Executive Floyd Wilson, who formed the company in 2011 before having to usher it through bankruptcy in 2016 after oil prices plunged. The news sent HalcÃ³n shares up more than 35 percent in morning trading. The deal also highlights the ability of U.S. shale producers to survive and reinvent themselves, despite sliding crude prices in the past two years.  The sale of our Williston Basin operated assets transforms HalcÃ³n into a single-basin company focused on the Delaware Basin where we have more than 41,000 net acres,  Wilson said in a statement. Houston-based HalcÃ³n will sell its operated North Dakota assets, which produce about 29,000 barrels per day (bpd). HalcÃ³n will keep its non-operated interest in wells across the state and said it may sell them in the future. After the sale, HalcÃ³n will produce about 7,500 bpd and run two drilling rigs in the Permian. By the end of the year, HalcÃ³n expects to pump about 13,000 bpd. The deal is expected to close by August. If it collapses, HalcÃ³n would pay Bruin $42 million. Bruin E&P Partners, which is backed by private equity firm Arclight Capital Partners LLC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. HalcÃ³n entered the Permian in January in several deals worth more than $1.2 billion, acquiring acreage in the western part of the region known as the Delaware Basin. Focusing on the Permian could help Wilson achieve his long-held dream of selling HalcÃ³n to the highest bidder. Investors and analysts have been eager to see if Wilson can replicate the feat he pulled off in 2011 when he sold Petrohawk Energy to BHP Billiton Plc for $12.1 billion, a 65 percent premium over the share price before the sale was announced. Wilson had predicted in 2012 that a sale of HalcÃ³n would take place by 2015. But in 2013, with HalcÃ³n's debt load mounting, he changed that time frame, saying any potential sale could come within  a few years.

Trump this year reinstated a policy that requires foreign NGOs which receive U.S. global family planning funds to certify that they do not perform abortions or provide abortion advice as a method of family planning. Known by critics as the  global gag  rule, Trump broadened its scope to include all global health assistance in his Jan. 23 executive order, withholding at least half a billion dollars in U.S. funds. Sweden's international aid agency Sida said that funding agreements for sexual and reproductive issues with organizations which go along with the U.S. presidential order could be canceled and support phased out.  The American policy is at loggerheads with the Swedish position,  Sida Director-General Carin Jamtin said.  This is about women themselves having the right to decide when, and if, they want to have children and how many they want to have.  The State Department said in April it was ending U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund, the body's agency focused on family planning and maternal and child health. Sweden has spoken out against the presidential order in the past and earlier this year became one of eight countries to join an initiative to raise millions of dollars to replace shortfalls caused by the U.S. ban. Sida is an aid agency that works under the directives of the Swedish government and parliament. It administers about half of Sweden's total development aid budget while the rest is distributed through the foreign ministry.

During the 1970s and 1980s, blood products supplied to the NHS was contaminated with viruses such as HIV or hepatitis C and infected thousands of people with hemophilia or other bleeding disorders. Health minister Philip Dunne said many documents were publicly available which gave a comprehensive picture of events and decisions made at the time.  However, I recognise for those affected these steps do not go far enough to provide the answers that they want to get to the truth of what happened,  he told parliament.  In light of these concerns and a report of new evidence and allegations of potential criminality, we think it is important to understand the extent of what is claimed and the wider issues that arise.  Families of victims will be consulted to decide what form the inquiry would take. A report by lawmakers in 2015 said the Department of Health estimated that more than 30,000 people might have been infected with hepatitis C between 1970 and 1991 when Britain imported some blood products from the United States but just 6,000 had been identified.  A further 1,500 were infected with HIV between 1978 and 1985. The inquiry comes after leaders from all of Britain's main political parties, except the ruling Conservatives, wrote a joint letter to May demanding an investigation into the issue.  For decades people with bleeding disorders and their families have sought the truth,  said Liz Carroll, Chief Executive of The Haemophilia Society.  Instead, they were told by the government that no mistakes were made while it repeatedly refused to acknowledge evidence of negligence and a subsequent cover up.

In February the European Commission proposed extending for an indefinite period an exemption for flights into and out of the EU from having to buy credits under its carbon emissions trading system after the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) struck a deal in October on a global market-based measure for offsetting airline emissions. The EU had ordered carriers to buy credits for foreign flights under its emissions trading system (ETS) in 2012 but backtracked when countries said it violated their sovereignty and China threatened to cancel plane orders from Airbus Group. It agreed to exempt international flights until the start of 2017 to give ICAO time to strike a global deal.  It is sensible that we extend the exemption for international flights to and from the EU until there is greater clarity on the ICAO scheme,  said Julie Girling, member of the European Parliament, who is steering the legislation through the EU legislature.  However, unlike the European Commission, I believe this exemption must be time limited so that we can be sure that the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) will deliver its objectives,â€� Girling said after MEPs voted on the proposal in the Environment Committee. Before the extension of the exemption becomes law, the Parliament will have to find a compromise with EU member states in the Council of the EU, which backed the Commission's proposal to extend it indefinitely. The ICAO deal was immediately criticised by environmental campaigners and MEPs who say it does not go far enough to curb aviation emissions. Aviation accounts for approximately 2.1 percent of global CO2 emissions and these are expected to be about seven to 10 times higher in 2050 compared with 1990 levels, according to ICAO. The extension will have to be agreed by March 2018, when airlines will be required to surrender carbon emission  allowances. Airlines back the ICAO deal, which will not be mandatory until 2027, as they want to avoid having to navigate a disparate number of national and regional schemes. The fate of the emissions trading system (ETS) covering flights within Europe will also be assessed before the ICAO deal comes into effect, with the EU Parliament calling for it to be merged with the global system, while airlines would prefer to see it dismantled.

Seven Afghan soldiers have been selected to compete against peers from 17 different countries in the Games, an international paralympic-style event for military personnel wounded in action. Thirteen nations taking part were in the NATO-led coalition that has supported the Kabul government since the U.S.-led campaign to oust the Taliban in 2001. Locked in an intractable battle with Taliban and Islamic State insurgents, Afghan security forces have struggled to handle high casualties, including at least 13,000 soldiers and police wounded last year. Esa, 24, said that despite his disability, he had never lost hope and was very excited to represent his country on the world stage.  I was so shattered when I lost my legs but now I am happy that I am back to life and want to achieve something through sport,  Esa said from a army gym in Kabul where he was going through exercises for wheelchair volleyball and powerlifting, the two events he will be competing in.

The name -  Invictus  means unconquered in Latin -  symbolizes the way that sport can help wounded soldiers overcome trauma suffered in combat. Esa lost his legs to a roadside bomb during a security patrol in northern Baghlan province two years ago, one of tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers and police to have been wounded since the U.S.-led campaign to oust the Taliban in 2001.

The group, whose more than 120 members include International Business Machines Corp, Cisco Systems Inc, the Bank of England and JPMorgan Chase & Co, said on Tuesday that it had released the first version of Hyperledger Fabric, a type of distributed ledger code.  The developers involved in the project believe Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 is strong and secure enough to be used by corporations to start building blockchain-based business applications, the group said.      Application diagram explaining Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric Community members/Handout via REUTERS    Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of data that is maintained by a network of computers, without requiring a trusted third party to validate the veracity of the information.  Banks and other large corporations have been investing hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the technology in the hopes it can help them simplify some of their most cumbersome and costly processes, such as settling securities trades.  More than 150 engineers from 29 organizations contributed to the project.   These kinds deep revolutions take some time, but I am confident that competent development teams inside organizations can start to look at that [Hyperledger Fabric] and go all the way to running it in production,  Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger's executive director, said in an interview.  To speed the development of blockchain, many organizations have formed or joined industry groups. Earlier this year JPMorgan, Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and others formed a blockchain group called the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, while many of the world’s largest banks invested $100 million in blockchain consortium R3.  Despite the excitement, blockchain has yet to be deployed in a large scale project by large companies, and skeptics have cautioned that its benefits may be overblown.  Hyperledger Fabric, for example, does not yet scale to handle as many transactions per second as the payment network of a major credit card company, Behlendorf said.  Proponents note, however, that it is still early days for the technology, likening the current landscape to the early days of the internet.   If this were the web, what year would we be in?  Behlendorf said.  I've felt that we were in 1995, but with this release I am ready to say we are in 1996, when you started to see enterprises saying 'Now it is not just a research project.'

The support services and construction company is preparing to meet investors after losing more than half of its value following the departure of its chief executive and a profit warning announced on Monday. One of Britain's most heavily shorted stocks, Carillion shares traded 31 percent lower at 80.5 pence by 1445 GMT, valuing the company at around 350 million pounds ($450 million). The FTSE-250 company is looking to raise 125 million pounds by exiting some business in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt and will save 80 million pounds by suspending 2017 dividends. Carillion booked an 845 million pound writedown on Monday against accounts receivables -- customer payments owed that it wasn't sure it would be able to collect. Carillion's bonds due 2019 JE114029661= fell sharply on Tuesday along with the shares. The yield-to-maturity, or the interest earned by an investor holding the bonds until they mature, spiked higher to 7.65 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That was double the yield on offer last Friday. The bonds were last trading well below par value at 88.25 pence on the pound. Stifel, one of the last remaining brokers with a  buy  rating on the stock cut its rating to  hold  warning that its rating  requires belief that assets and liabilities are now fairly stated . Andrew Gibbs, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, suggested any capital shortfall would require a rights issue of more than 500 million pounds in the near term. Average net borrowing in the first half of the year rose to 695 million pounds from 586.5 million over 2016. Several analysts said they struggled to see how the proceeds from sales and dividend cut would be enough to reduce net debt significantly and cover the cost of any restructuring.  None of these are anything like sufficient in the context of the about 900 million pounds second-half average net debt,  Liberum analysts wrote in a note, calling the balance sheet  a mess  and adding that it was  hard to see a solution without equity . The equity research team at UBS also suggested Carillion would have to sell more assets, convert debtholders to equity,  raise capital or rely on a combination of all three. Their counterparts at Morgan Stanley said the group had limited  trophy assets that can realize value.  On Monday, Carillion interim Chief Executive Keith Cochrane said that the company was considering  all options  to reduce debt, but played down the need for a cash call to cover restructuring costs.  I think the restructuring will cost money, but in the overall schemes of things I'm not sure that'll be a particularly material sum albeit we need to work through the exact nature of form the restructuring takes,  Cochrane told analysts.

Eager to attract banking jobs leaving London, Philippe has pledged to reduce the cost of employing financial services staff in France and also committed to keeping the regulatory burden on finance companies competitive.  The message I want to share with you is clear and it is simple: the French government is committed to boost Paris' attractiveness by all means,  Philippe told a banking conference in Paris, presenting the package of reforms which includes a cut to payroll tax on high-earning bankers.   We want Paris to become Europe's new number one financial hub after Brexit,  Philippe said, speaking in English to an audience of financial executives. Since the election in May of former investment banker Emmanuel Macron as president, the French government is pushing hard to catch up with Frankfurt to attract finance jobs moving from London to retain EU single market access after Brexit. Paris, Frankfurt and other big European cities are all trying to woo banks based in the City of London financial center and some have already made plans to move. In addition to the new measures aimed at the finance industry, the government also has plans to reduce the scope of France's wealth tax to just real estate, while also setting a tax on all capital income at a flat rate of 30 percent. In other business-friendly measures, the government has committed to cutting France's corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 33 percent over time and aims to overhaul its labor code in the coming months. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe delivers a speech at the Paris Europlace International Financial Forum in Paris, France, July 11, 2017.Gonzalo FuentesBank executives welcomed such measures, but France has its work cut out to convince businesses that these changes are for the long term after decades of high taxes and strict labor laws.

HSBC's Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver, also speaking at the conference, welcomed Philippe's latest measures as a positive step  if enacted , but also wondered whether they would stay at least through two five-year presidential cycles.  It's very early within the presidency and people still have the impression in their minds of president Hollande declaring finance is the enemy, there were demonstrations, there was a very high tax rate,  Gulliver said.  Are we now on the verge of 10 years, because large companies like ours need to plan for a long period time,  Gulliver said, questioning in particular whether the labor law reform would stick. Dimon said that JP Morgan would probably use its existing bank in Frankfurt to domicile its European operations in the EU, but that jobs could be spread among Paris, the Netherlands and other cities.

At a conference in Croatia on Tuesday, Lagarde said convoluted fiscal and monetary policy proposals use terminology  hardly anybody understands  and often lose the public's attention.  We are in an era where some political leaders communicate almost exclusively using 140 characters,  Lagarde said, referring to the Twitter limit.  We too in the financial community ... need to have in the back of our mind those 140 characters.  Financial policymakers, and central bankers in particular, can be famously opaque, steering sophisticated investors by the mere dropping of a word. But this is a world far removed from ordinary people.  Smart communication, funny communication, alternative, not fake communication, around what you are about to do is, in my view, critically important,  she said.  Because that battle is going to be lost or won depending on how early you prepare and how efficiently you communicate in simple, easy to understand terms, with funny to ready, funny to listen to, media supported tools.

The review, compiled by Chief Executive of The Royal Society of Arts Matthew Taylor, proposes an employment category called  dependent contractor  and says those Britons working for companies such as taxi app Uber and takeaway food courier Deliveroo should receive more benefits.  May said she would consider the review, but stopped short of promising to implement its recommendations. Seven Steps The Taylor Review outlines a seven-point plan: 1. The report says Britain should work towards  good work for all , which includes:  a)  There should be a fair balance of rights and responsibilities, everyone should have a baseline of protection and there should be routes to enable progression at work.  b) More consistency in the taxation of labor, and improved rights and entitlements for the self-employed. c) An appreciation of the impact of technology and the need to adapt to it, as well as the  new opportunities for smarter regulation, more flexible entitlements and new ways for people to organize.  2. The report notes the opportunities that  platform based  working for the likes of Uber and Deliveroo offer, saying the unconventional arrangement can provide desirable flexibility.  These should be protected while ensuring fairness for those who work through these platforms and those who compete with them,  the report says.  Worker (or â€˜Dependent Contractorâ€™) status should be maintained but we should be clearer about how to distinguish workers from those who are legitimately self-employed.  3. The report says the law should help workers exercise their rights, but costs associated with taking someone on as an employee are high and should not be increased.   'Dependent contractors' are the group most likely to suffer from unfair one-sided flexibility and therefore we need to provide additional protections for this group and stronger incentives for firms to treat them fairly.   4.  The best way to achieve better work is not national regulation but responsible corporate governance, good management and strong employment relations within the organization, which is why it is important that companies are seen to take good work seriously and are open about their practices and that all workers are able to be engaged and heard,  the report says. 5. The report says it is  vital  for people to feel they have attainable ways to strengthen future work prospects and engage in informal and formal learning. 6.  The shape and content of work and individual health and well-being are strongly related,  the report says, calling for  a more proactive approach to workplace health . 7.  The National Living Wage is a powerful tool to raise the financial base line of low-paid workers,  the report says.  It needs to be accompanied by sectoral strategies engaging employers, employees and stakeholders to ensure that people â€“ particularly in low paid sectors â€“ are not stuck at the living wage minimum or facing insecurity but can progress in their current and future work.  Next Steps on the Gig Economy The report says that  those employers who decide to demand more insecure forms of work from large sections of their workforce should consider the impact this may be having, and adds that people  deserve the opportunity to plan for the future and where they commit to regular work, employers who can, should be obliged to reciprocate . To tackle the issue of what it calls  one-sided flexibility , it proposes the following steps: -  Task the Low Pay Commission with examining how a higher minimum wage rate might apply to non-guaranteed hours. - Develop legislation to make it easier for all working people to receive basic details about their employment relationship up front as well as updating the rules on continuous employment to make it easier to accrue service. - Reform holiday pay entitlements to make it easier for people in very flexible arrangements to receive their entitlements in real time as well as extending the pay reference period to 52 weeks for those who do not.     - Develop legislation that allows agency workers and those on zero hours contracts the ability to request to formalize the reality of the working relationship .

Televisa late on Monday reported a 1.5 percent fall in revenues, with advertising revenue slumping 9.8 percent as the world's largest maker of Spanish-language content wrestled with a global trend toward content delivered over the Internet instead of traditional television.  We have had a difficult first half of the year. We're not pleased with the results,  Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia told analysts on a conference call.  I think the second half will be better, but we have limited visibility.  Televisa plans to restructure its sales team, overhaul the way it has sold advertising for several decades, and streamline the cost of creating content, executives said on the call. Its stock fell 2.6 percent on Tuesday, to 90.62 pesos while its U.S.-traded shares lost 2.47 percent to $25.29. Like its U.S. peers, Televisa is under pressure as younger viewers shun cable bundles in favor of cheaper streaming options including Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), and as advertisers redirect spending to online ads.   The content division's performance leads to concerns about the commercial strategy and the company's prices,  Santander wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Televisa's stock has gained 3 percent in 2017, underperforming a rise of 11 percent in Mexico's benchmark S&P/BMV IPC index .MXX. Known for its  telenovela  soap operas, Televisa added subscribers to its voice, data and video cable services during the quarter, compared with the prior three months. However, compared with the second quarter of 2016, its total number of video subscribers was down 3 percent.    Televisa reported a net profit of 1.453 billion pesos ($80.1 million), up 2.6 percent from a year earlier and helped by lower financial costs. It recently won a court order blocking the sale of Roku streaming devices in Mexico on grounds that the gadgets are used by criminals to illegally sell pirated television content.

The deal with privately held Bruin E&P Partners LLC focuses HalcÃ³n on the most-active area in the U.S. oil industry and marks a stunning turnaround for Chief Executive Floyd Wilson, who formed the company in 2011 before having to usher it through bankruptcy in 2016 after oil prices plunged. The news sent HalcÃ³n shares up more than 35 percent in morning trading. The deal also highlights the ability of U.S. shale producers to survive and reinvent themselves, despite sliding crude prices in the past two years.  The sale of our Williston Basin operated assets transforms HalcÃ³n into a single-basin company focused on the Delaware Basin where we have more than 41,000 net acres,  Wilson said in a statement. Houston-based HalcÃ³n will sell its operated North Dakota assets, which produce about 29,000 barrels per day (bpd). HalcÃ³n will keep its non-operated interest in wells across the state and said it may sell them in the future. After the sale, HalcÃ³n will produce about 7,500 bpd and run two drilling rigs in the Permian. By the end of the year, HalcÃ³n expects to pump about 13,000 bpd. The deal is expected to close by August. If it collapses, HalcÃ³n would pay Bruin $42 million. Bruin E&P Partners, which is backed by private equity firm Arclight Capital Partners LLC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. HalcÃ³n entered the Permian in January in several deals worth more than $1.2 billion, acquiring acreage in the western part of the region known as the Delaware Basin. Focusing on the Permian could help Wilson achieve his long-held dream of selling HalcÃ³n to the highest bidder. Investors and analysts have been eager to see if Wilson can replicate the feat he pulled off in 2011 when he sold Petrohawk Energy to BHP Billiton Plc for $12.1 billion, a 65 percent premium over the share price before the sale was announced. Wilson had predicted in 2012 that a sale of HalcÃ³n would take place by 2015. But in 2013, with HalcÃ³n's debt load mounting, he changed that time frame, saying any potential sale could come within  a few years.

Any further tightening, however, is likely to mirror the tentative first steps taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve. In the space of a fortnight, markets have ratcheted up their expectations for a rate hike in the euro area following comments from the ECB and other major central banks. Forward Eonia bank-to-bank rates, a closely followed gauge of the market's rate expectations, dated for the ECB meeting next July stand at minus 0.25 percent, well above the Eonia spot rate of minus 0.36 percent ECBWATCH. Rounded, that gap implies markets are fully pricing in a 10 basis point hike in the ECB's currently minus 0.40 percent deposit rate by next July -- a move that was not anticipated a month ago. But over the next two years, only between two to three hikes are expected, leaving rates still in negative territory. Martin van Vliet, a senior rates strategist at ING, notes that contracts that show where one-month Eonia rates are expected to be in two years' time suggest that three hikes are priced in by mid-2019. Analysts said another measure derived from Euribor money market futures <0#FEI:> suggests only two hikes are fully priced into the market by June 2019.   It is clear the market is pricing in a very sluggish tightening cycle, if you can call it that,  said ING's Martin van Vliet.  It's basically what the Fed did in the first two years of the current cycle.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken 18 months to raise rates four times to a level still well below historical averages. Even the rate trajectory mapped out by markets is too aggressive for many analysts given the outlook for subdued inflation and expectations that an unwinding of the ECB's bond-buying scheme is likely to take place before rates change.  HSBC expects the ECB's deposit rate to remain unchanged next year, while ABN AMRO expects the first hike in September 2018.  I don't think the ECB's going to hike in 2018 at all and even 2019 seems questionable to me,  said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

In an interview, Gernot Erler, a government coordinator for relations with Russia, central Asia and eastern Europe, expressed satisfaction that President Donald Trump had met Russia's Vladimir Putin at a G20 summit in Hamburg last week. He also applauded a U.S.-Russia brokered ceasefire for southwestern Syria and the appointment of former NATO ambassador Kurt Volker as Washington's envoy to Ukraine. But Erler said it was unclear whether the Trump administration could tackle complex, intractable conflicts in Ukraine and Syria while sending contradictory signals about its Russia policy and grappling with a continuous trickle of leaks on the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.  We are witnessing an indecisive back and forth in America's policy toward Russia,  said Erler.  There is no clear direction, and above all it has become hostage to the domestic debate in America. This situation is not going to end anytime soon.  When Trump took office six months ago, one of the biggest worries in Berlin was that he would deliver on his campaign promise to cozy up to Putin, unilaterally lift sanctions against Russia and possibly even recognize its 2014 annexation of Crimea. FILE PHOTO: German deputy Foreign Minister Gernot Erler gestures during an interview with Reuters in Berlin May 31, 2006.Alexandra Beckstein/File PhotoBut in recent months, the concerns have shifted 180 degrees: German officials have grown alarmed at the prospect of a breakdown in dialogue between Washington and Moscow at a time when U.S. diplomatic engagement is seen as crucial for Ukraine and Syria. They were pleased therefore when Trump's meeting with Putin in Hamburg went well and the ceasefire was announced.  All of a sudden we had movement in this conflict. And it is not an exaggeration to say that it was a result of Trump's meeting with Putin in Hamburg,  Erler said. Hours later however, a series of confounding tweets by Trump about cyber-security cooperation with Russia and a New York Times report that his son had met with a Russian lawyer to get dirt on his father's election rival Hillary Clinton, jolted the Germans and their European partners back to reality. Erler welcomed Rex Tillerson's post-G20 trip to Kiev, where the U.S. Secretary of State made clear that the United States expected Russia to make the first move in de-escalating the conflict in eastern Ukraine. But he said Germany was still having trouble figuring out what, and whom, to believe in the new U.S. administration.  The question lingers: what do we recognize as fact? Is it what Tillerson says, what the president says or what (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) Nikki Haley says?  Erler said.  We have so many voices and they all sound different.

The support services and construction company is preparing to meet investors after losing more than half of its value following the departure of its chief executive and a profit warning announced on Monday. One of Britain's most heavily shorted stocks, Carillion shares traded 31 percent lower at 80.5 pence by 1445 GMT, valuing the company at around 350 million pounds ($450 million). The FTSE-250 company is looking to raise 125 million pounds by exiting some business in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt and will save 80 million pounds by suspending 2017 dividends. Carillion booked an 845 million pound writedown on Monday against accounts receivables -- customer payments owed that it wasn't sure it would be able to collect. Carillion's bonds due 2019 JE114029661= fell sharply on Tuesday along with the shares. The yield-to-maturity, or the interest earned by an investor holding the bonds until they mature, spiked higher to 7.65 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That was double the yield on offer last Friday. The bonds were last trading well below par value at 88.25 pence on the pound. Stifel, one of the last remaining brokers with a  buy  rating on the stock cut its rating to  hold  warning that its rating  requires belief that assets and liabilities are now fairly stated . Andrew Gibbs, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, suggested any capital shortfall would require a rights issue of more than 500 million pounds in the near term. Average net borrowing in the first half of the year rose to 695 million pounds from 586.5 million over 2016. Several analysts said they struggled to see how the proceeds from sales and dividend cut would be enough to reduce net debt significantly and cover the cost of any restructuring.  None of these are anything like sufficient in the context of the about 900 million pounds second-half average net debt,  Liberum analysts wrote in a note, calling the balance sheet  a mess  and adding that it was  hard to see a solution without equity . The equity research team at UBS also suggested Carillion would have to sell more assets, convert debtholders to equity,  raise capital or rely on a combination of all three. Their counterparts at Morgan Stanley said the group had limited  trophy assets that can realize value.  On Monday, Carillion interim Chief Executive Keith Cochrane said that the company was considering  all options  to reduce debt, but played down the need for a cash call to cover restructuring costs.  I think the restructuring will cost money, but in the overall schemes of things I'm not sure that'll be a particularly material sum albeit we need to work through the exact nature of form the restructuring takes,  Cochrane told analysts.

May wants to signal that it is business as usual for her government after an ill-judged election gamble damaged her authority and eliminated her governing Conservatives' majority in parliament, emboldening the main opposition Labour Party. The review into employment practices, which she ordered after becoming prime minister a year ago, is viewed as a bid to show that her promise to help poorer Britons who are  just about managing  is more than just a slogan. The review, compiled by Chief Executive of The Royal Society of Arts Matthew Taylor, says many of those Britons working for companies such as taxi app Uber and takeaway food courier Deliveroo should receive more benefits such as the minimum wage. May said her government would consider the findings of the report, but stopped short of promising to implement it in full.  What's clear from Matthew's report is that our response to the changing world of work cannot be to try to stop the clock,  May said.  While avoiding overbearing regulation, we will make sure people have the rights and protections they need.  Related CoverageFactbox - UK report on 'gig economy' :principles and proposalsShe also urged her political rivals to  contribute, not just criticise  her plans - a move reflecting both her need for help to push reforms through parliament and her resolve to press ahead despite questions about her future as leader. App Workers More and more people are working for apps in fast-growing sectors such as takeaway delivery and taxi services. While wanting the flexibility such work offers, some say they are left without the protections that traditional jobs offer. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street, London, Britain July 11, 2017.Peter NichollsLast year, judges sided with two self-employed drivers at Uber who had argued that they deserve workers' rights such as the minimum wage. The move would add to the San Francisco-based firm's costs and this prompted it to appeal.  Responding to the review on Tuesday, Uber said it would welcome greater clarity in the law, while Deliveroo said any attempt to limit job flexibility could undermine the gig economy and that any new measures should avoid restricting their ability to expand. In Britain, the self-employed have no entitlement to employment rights beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination laws. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street, London, Britain July 11, 2017.Peter NichollsBut the review proposes renaming workers such as those operating in the gig economy as  dependent contractors , with many of them becoming entitled to annual leave, rest breaks and the minimum wage. Firms would have to prove that an average person, working  averagely hard , is able to earn the national living wage, which stands at 7.50 pounds ($9.65) an hour for the over-25s, with a 20 percent margin of error, it said.   The best way to achieve better work is not national regulation but responsible corporate governance, good management and strong employment relations within the organization.  But Britain's biggest union Unite said the government needed to make sure entitlements were upheld.  May hopes the report will woo working class voters, but the Labour opposition said it did little more than highlight the Conservatives' record of  failing working people .  If they were serious about workers' rights they are welcome to borrow from Labour's manifesto,  said Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour's business spokeswoman.

He said on July 6 heavy fighting erupted in the area.  The three fled Mathiang along with other humanitarian actors and were detained in Pagak upon arrival,  he said. Last month South Sudan's government said it may prevent aid workers from traveling to some rebel-held areas on security grounds. Irwin did not say who the agency believed had detained the workers but said UNICEF was pursuing efforts to  establish the exact location of the contractors, their state of health and to secure their freedom.  Africa's youngest nation was plunged into civil war in 2013 after President Salva Kiir, who hails from the Dinka tribe, sacked his deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer.

Televisa late on Monday reported a 1.5 percent fall in revenues, with advertising revenue slumping 9.8 percent as the world's largest maker of Spanish-language content wrestled with a global trend toward content delivered over the Internet instead of traditional television.  We have had a difficult first half of the year. We're not pleased with the results,  Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia told analysts on a conference call.  I think the second half will be better, but we have limited visibility.  Televisa plans to restructure its sales team, overhaul the way it has sold advertising for several decades, and streamline the cost of creating content, executives said on the call. Its stock fell 2.6 percent on Tuesday, to 90.62 pesos while its U.S.-traded shares lost 2.47 percent to $25.29. Like its U.S. peers, Televisa is under pressure as younger viewers shun cable bundles in favor of cheaper streaming options including Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), and as advertisers redirect spending to online ads.   The content division's performance leads to concerns about the commercial strategy and the company's prices,  Santander wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Any further tightening, however, is likely to mirror the tentative first steps taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve. In the space of a fortnight, markets have ratcheted up their expectations for a rate hike in the euro area following comments from the ECB and other major central banks. Forward Eonia bank-to-bank rates, a closely followed gauge of the market's rate expectations, dated for the ECB meeting next July stand at minus 0.25 percent, well above the Eonia spot rate of minus 0.36 percent ECBWATCH. Rounded, that gap implies markets are fully pricing in a 10 basis point hike in the ECB's currently minus 0.40 percent deposit rate by next July -- a move that was not anticipated a month ago. But over the next two years, only between two to three hikes are expected, leaving rates still in negative territory. Martin van Vliet, a senior rates strategist at ING, notes that contracts that show where one-month Eonia rates are expected to be in two years' time suggest that three hikes are priced in by mid-2019. Analysts said another measure derived from Euribor money market futures <0#FEI:> suggests only two hikes are fully priced into the market by June 2019.   It is clear the market is pricing in a very sluggish tightening cycle, if you can call it that,  said ING's Martin van Vliet.  It's basically what the Fed did in the first two years of the current cycle.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken 18 months to raise rates four times to a level still well below historical averages. Even the rate trajectory mapped out by markets is too aggressive for many analysts given the outlook for subdued inflation and expectations that an unwinding of the ECB's bond-buying scheme is likely to take place before rates change.  HSBC expects the ECB's deposit rate to remain unchanged next year, while ABN AMRO expects the first hike in September 2018.  I don't think the ECB's going to hike in 2018 at all and even 2019 seems questionable to me,  said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

Manifa is one of state-run Aramco's biggest oilfields and latest expansions, with a production capacity of 900,000 barrels per day. Aramco brought the field online in two phases. The industry publication reported that it was unclear how much production was removed as a result of corrosion of the water injection system used to maintain pressure in the reservoir.

The offshore oilfield - made of rigs on manmade islands linked by 41 km (25 miles) of causeways and bridges over the Gulf - was discovered in the 1950s.

The pilgrims were on their way back from the Amarnath shrine deep in the Himalayas when their bus got caught up in the crossfire near the town of Anantnag, police said.  Twelve pilgrims were wounded in the fighting triggered after the militants attacked a police bunker and another police party at a checkpoint.  The attack has stirred the ire of hardline Hindu groups tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party who have long sought tough action against militants fighting Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir. In the Hindu-dominated Jammu region of the Indian state, saffron-clad members of the right-wing Bajrang Dal group stopped cars to enforce a strike in memory of the pilgrims. Protests also took place in the country's financial capital of Mumbai and the industrial city of Ahmedabad in the west.  Pained beyond words on the dastardly attack on peaceful Amarnath pilgrims in Jammu and Kashmir,  Modi said on social network Twitter.  The attack deserves strongest condemnation from everyone,  he added, saying he had spoken to the state's governor and chief minister to assure them of all possible help. Hundreds of thousands of Hindus visit the Amarnath cave, 12,000 feet (3,658 m) above sea level in the picturesque Lidder Valley, in the months of July and August every year.

Police superintendent Altaf Khan said the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba was behind the attack aimed at sowing sectarian discord.  But the militant group rejected the allegation, calling the attack  reprehensible , and accusing India of trying to sabotage the freedom struggle of the Kashmiris.  Slideshow (5 Images)Separatist leaders also condemned the attack.   This incident goes against the very grain of Kashmiri ethos,  separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Farooq and Yasin Malik said in a joint statement.  The annual Amarnath yatra has been going on peacefully for centuries and is part of our yearly rhythm and will remain so.   Militants battling Indian rule in Kashmir have largely spared the pilgrimage, even during the most violent phases of their 28-year armed revolt. About 150,000 pilgrims have already completed the journey to Amarnath and tens of thousands more are expected to do so by the time it ends in late August. India has been struggling to restore normality in Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim in full but rule in part.

Last week Munich prosecutors arrested an Audi employee in connection with  dieselgate , the latest setback to Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) luxury car arm and main profit driver, after the German government a month earlier had accused Audi of cheating on emissions tests. On Tuesday Audi shifted the focus back to its products with its top management hosting 2,000 guests in Barcelona to unveil the new A8, whose Level-3 self-driving technology enables the car to completely control driving at up to 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour, beating the Mercedes S-Class and the BMW 7-Series. Having slipped behind its two German rivals on global sales last year, Audi has risked stalling without innovation and needed a new prestige product, said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.  Innovation is key in premium car-making,  Bratzel said.  The new A8 will polish the brand's image and line-up at a critical time.  Even Audi acknowledged that amid ongoing investigations, persistent pressure on its chief executive for his crisis management and analysts' criticism of Audi's ageing vehicle design, the new A8 creates an opportunity for a clean break.  It's gratifying that we are able to set a positive sign for real 'Vorsprung durch Technik', advancement through technology,  R&D chief Peter Mertens said. Mercedes and BMW have accelerated their autonomous-driving development programs with Mercedes owner Daimler joining forces with car parts maker Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] in April and BMW collaborating with other firms including U.S. parts maker Delphi and chipmaker Intel.

A source at Audi said development of the A8, which took about five years, suffered from changes at the brand's research and development department, though assiduous work by division heads helped ensure that delays were kept in check. The A8 will reach German dealerships in the fourth quarter. Slideshow (21 Images)Audi is on its third development chief since dieselgate broke in late 2015, with Mertens, who took office in May, the brand's fifth R&D boss since 2012.  The top brass at VW group and Audi are so preoccupied with the diesel issue that the company's management is lastingly distracted,  said Christian Strenger, a supervisory board member at Deutsche Bank's retail asset management arm DWS. With the new A8's retail price up almost 8 percent on its  predecessor at 90,600 euros ($103,000), Audi will also struggle to narrow the gap with its traditional rivals, research firm IHS Markit said. A8 sales in the core markets of Europe, China and the Americas may climb 3.2 percent to 35,571 cars by 2025 from 34,468 next year, IHS said. By comparison, IHS expects deliveries of BMW's 7-Series to fall 7.6 percent to 52,238 cars by 2025 and deliveries of Mercedes' S-Class to jump 24 percent to 85,389 cars.

A two-year war between Houthi rebels aligned with Iran and a Western-backed Saudi-led coalition has led to a  system-wide collapse in the economy  and health system, said Jamie McGoldrick, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. Some 313,533 suspected cholera cases and 1,732 deaths have been recorded since the outbreak began in late April, according to the latest U.N. figures that show a  spike , he said.   This epidemic is spreading further and faster than anything we've seen before,  McGoldrick, speaking from Amman, told a Geneva news briefing.  What will happen is that this cholera outbreak will in fact exacerbate the conditions and the threat of famine in more places than ever in the country,  he said. Hamanat al-Asimah, Hajjah, Amran and al-Hodeidah are the four heaviest-hit areas hit by cholera, a disease spread by faeces contaminating water or food, he said.  The United Nations has warned of mass starvation in Yemen, northeastern Nigeria, Somalia, and South Sudan.  McGoldrick, asked how many faced famine in Yemen, replied:  Some estimates say 500,000 would be a target that could happen if the conditions prevail. But it could be more than that if the situation gets worse.  FILE PHOTO: A man lies on the bed of a cholera treatment center in Sanaa, Yemen, May 15, 2017.Khaled Abdullah/File PhotoChildren under age 15 account for about 40 percent of Yemenis infected with cholera and a quarter of the deaths. A funding shortage is compounding difficult aid operations. The United Nations has received only a third of the $2.1 billion it sought to provide food to 12 million people facing famine in Yemen. Its $250 million funding appeal to combat cholera has yielded just $47 million.  As a result of that, organizations who are in areas where cholera has broken out have had to use resources that they would have otherwise programmed for something like food insecurity or malnutrition,  McGoldrick said.     What we are doing right now is robbing Peter to pay Paul.  Plans to use a cholera vaccine have been  set-aside , he said.  The government at this point is deciding whether or not to use them,  said Christian Lindmeier, spokesman of the World Health Organization (WHO).  There is a likelihood they would not be used anymore in Yemen and therefore re-routed to other areas/countries that may need them more urgently right now,  he said.

Reformist lawmaker Mustafa Nayyem said hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians had been robbed of the right to cheap air travel.

The agreement was signed in a ceremony in Tehran attended by Saeed Mohammadzadeh, head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways, and Renato Mazzoncini, CEO of Italyâ€™s state rail company Ferrovie dello Stato (FS). A framework of  cooperation agreement  was signed in April 2016, when former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi visited Tehran seeking a strong foothold in a nation hungry for infrastructure investment as it emerges from financial isolation. Iran rejoined the global trading system in 2016 after a deal with world powers to lift crippling sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear activities. Tehran has announced plans to invest $25 billion over the next 10 years in the modernization and expansion of its railway network.  One percent of oil and gas sales has been dedicated to rail development in Iran's sixth development plan,  Mohammadzadeh was quoted as saying by Fars. Iran is seeking to expand its rail network to 25,000 km (15,500 miles) from 10,000 km currently, with 7,500 km already under construction.

The government-backed study, proposing better rights for gig workers and changes to tax, hits some helpful notes. It stops short, though, of calling for business to bear more of the cost of a highly flexible workforce. That is a realistic reflection of the United Kingdomâ€™s weaker bargaining power. The review, headed up by Chief Executive of the Royal Society of Arts Matthew Taylor, was commissioned late last year by Theresa May. The British prime minister, then more secure in her own job, was concerned about working conditions at companies such as Sports Direct and Uber and the quality of work in Britain in general, despite record low levels of unemployment. More prosaically, a trend towards less heavily taxed forms of work is having an impact on government finances. Many of the reportâ€™s recommendations are laudable, including greater clarity around employment categories and new protections for â€œdependent contractorsâ€�. These workers, such as restaurant takeaway couriers for Deliveroo, are most at risk of â€œone-sided flexibilityâ€�. And calls to tax different types of work more equally support the Treasuryâ€™s aborted attempt earlier this year to close a gap in national insurance contributions that make it more attractive, on that score, to be self-employed. But business has gotten off lightly. Rather than banning the use of zero-hours contracts that donâ€™t guarantee a minimum amount of work and are now held by 2.8 percent of those in employment, the report defends the flexibility they offer. Although it recommends a higher minimum wage for hours not guaranteed in a contract, the review stops short of proposing that companies relying heavily on loose work arrangements pay a premium for that labour. With one of the most flexible labour markets in the world and corporation tax ticking down to 18 percent by 2020, Britain theoretically has scope to ask companies for more. But the need to appear as business-friendly as possible on leaving the European Union makes it unlikely that the government will do so in any big way. The Taylor review kicks off an important debate about the winners and losers from more flexible work arrangements. For now, it looks like business wonâ€™t be picking up the tab.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Legend, owner of computer group Lenovo Group Ltd, has been in discussions to buy around 90 percent of the private bank from Precision Capital, an investment vehicle of Qatar royal family members including former Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, the person said.  People familiar with the industry said they would expect BIL to fetch a price of 1-1.5 billion euros ($1.14 billion - $1.71 billion). Chinese companies have become increasingly interested in European banks, despite the sector's struggles with low profitability and increasing regulatory burden. Â  In May, China's HNA became the largest direct shareholder in Deutsche Bank, while Fosun holds a 24 pct stake in Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium BCP.[nL8N1I51DM] The deal is likely to be finalised in the coming weeks and Legend is not looking to buy the remaining 10 percent of BIL which is owned by the Luxembourg government, the source said.  Another source close to Sheikh Hamad said Precision was in advanced talks to sell its controlling stake to a potential buyer but a final agreement had not yet been reached. The source declined to comment on whether Precision was talking to Legend. The sources could not be identified as the talks are not public. A spokeswoman at Legend and a spokesman for Sheikh Hamad's office in Doha declined to comment as did BIL. Precision and the Luxembourg government did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. Overseas Ambitions Beijing-based Legend, also parent of private equity firm Hony Capital and venture capital firm Legend Capital, is looking to diversify beyond the sluggish PC business into overseas financial services. By teaming up with its part-owned investment firms, Legend has dipped its toe into a variety of industries from food production and car rental to dentistry and start-up incubation.  If the BIL deal goes through, Legend would clinch its first major European transaction after securing a minority interest in Britain's Pension Insurance Corporation (PIC) last year. [nL5N1892PD] Legend also made it to the final stages of the auction for Madrid-based mutual fund platform Allfunds but lost the bid to funds GIC and Hellman & Friedman in that deal earlier this year.[nL8N1G83WP] [nL5N1GK1BE]  Legend had also looked at an investment in Austrian bank Bawag, but was unable to negotiate a deal, people close to matter said have said in the past. Precision agreed to buy BIL in 2011 for 730 million euros when Franco-Belgian financial group Dexia, BIL's parent company, needed a state-led bail out by France, Belgium and Luxembourg and was required to sell off all of its active businesses. Analysts said at the time that the price Precision paid was well below market value. BIL, founded in 1856 as the oldest private bank in Luxembourg, is supervised by the European Central Bank together with Luxembourg's Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. It employs some 2,000 people worldwide and had some 37.7 billion euros of assets under management at the end of 2016.  In 2016, BIL's net income fell to 110 million euros from 134 million in 2015, mainly due to writedowns and restructuring expenses, according to its annual report.

Oman Oil has signed a revolving credit facility (RCF) of $1.15 billion, with a five-year maturity, and has slightly amended the terms of an existing $850 million revolving loan that matures in 2019, the source said. The $850 million loan was part of a dual-tranche $1.85 billion financing the company raised in 2014. The new $1.15 billion revolver refinances the $1 billion tranche of the 2014 loan, which was due for redemption this year. The loan was self-arranged, the source said, meaning the borrower coordinated the transaction by putting together a group of banks. The consortium includes Credit Agricole, Deutsche Bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank, HSBC, Natixis, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, banking sources told Reuters last May. Oman Oilâ€™s revolving loan is just one of a number of fundraising exercises. In a joint venture with Kuwait Petroleum International, Oman Oil is raising billions of dollars for the development of the Duqm Refinery, a project expected to have a processing capacity of 230,000 barrels of crude oil per day. It is also considering a secured loan which could go up to $1.5 billion, bankers said. One of the companyâ€™s subsidiaries, Oman Oil Facilities Development Company, has recently closed a $640 million loan for Salalah LPG, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) extraction project. That loan, with a 15-year maturity, was provided by a group of banks comprising Ahli Bank of Oman, Ahli United Bank, Apicorp, Bank Muscat, Bank Sohar, Qatar National Bank, Societe Generale and Standard Chartered, bankers said.

This year's race, the halfway point in the season, takes place on Sunday with a big Formula One promotional event planned in London on Wednesday.  This decision has been taken because it is not financially viable for us to deliver the British Grand Prix under the terms of our current contract,  British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) chairman John Grant told a news conference at the track.  We sustained losses of 2.8 million pounds ($3.60 million) in 2015 and 4.8 million in 2016, and we expect to lose a similar amount this year.  Related CoverageMotor racing: F1 could look to London now, says Red Bull bossGrant said Silverstone, which has the biggest turnout of any race on the calendar, was the only circuit in Britain that could host the race and hoped a more sustainable deal could be reached over the next three years.   A spokesman for Formula One, owned by U.S.-based Liberty Media, said the decision and the timing of the BRDC's announcement was regrettable.  The week leading up to the British Grand Prix, should be a week of great celebration for F1 and Silverstone,  the spokesman said.  We deeply regret that Silverstone has chosen instead to use this week to posture and position themselves and invoke a break clause that will take effect in three years time.  Our focus is still to preserve the British Grand Prix. We will carry on negotiating with the promoter in good faith and in private to reach a fair and equitable solution.  Silverstone hosted the first world championship grand prix in 1950 and Britain, home to seven of the 10 teams as well as triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, has been on the calendar every year since. Sean Bratches, the sport's new commercial managing director, last week described Silverstone as  one of the jewels in the crown of Grand Prix racing  and Liberty have said repeatedly that they want to safeguard the sport's historic venues. Grant said the BRDC remained fully supportive of the changes Liberty are bringing to the sport but the non-profit members club could  no longer let our passion for the sport rule our heads . The promoter's fee for hosting the race increases by five percent annually, which means it has grown from 11.5 million pounds in 2010 to 16.2 million this year. By 2026, it would have risen to 25 million. The BRDC said it had reached a tipping point and revenue from ticket sales and hospitality was not enough to cover the cost.

Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen starts two days of testimony on Wednesday as it prepares to unwind the massive hoard of bonds it bought to ease the financial crisis.  We've got Yellen's testimony tomorrow, there may be a little bit of nervousness ahead of that ... the semi-annual monetary policy testimony has often been a big deal for the markets,  Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories climbed 0.4 percent. That was the biggest gain since December 2016 and followed a 0.4 percent decline in April. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent in May. Auto inventories jumped 0.7 percent after declining 1.4 percent in April. The auto sector has been hit by slowing demand, which has seen manufacturers reporting a decrease in sales for four straight months. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.3 percent in May. A report last week showed inventories at factories slipped 0.1 percent in May. Data on retail inventories will be published on Friday. Economists expect inventory investment slowed further in the second quarter and remained a drag on GDP growth during the period. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 2.7 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. Inventory investment subtracted 1.11 percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter, helping to hold down the economy to a 1.4 percent growth pace. Inventories had contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters. They have remained lean this year, with businesses cautious amid sluggish domestic demand. Wholesale stocks of electrical goods fell 0.3 percent in May while professional equipment inventories surged 0.7 percent. Machinery inventories increased 0.7 percent, the largest gain since November 2014. Petroleum stocks advanced 2.6 percent, the biggest rise since last December. Sales at wholesalers fell 0.5 percent after decreasing 0.3 percent in April. Sales of motor vehicles slipped 0.5 percent after rising 1.3 percent in April. At May's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.29 months to clear shelves, up from 1.28 months in April. The ratio has declined from 1.36 months in January last year, which was the highest since January 2009.

Africa's largest economy is in its first recession in 25 years, and had planned to borrow extensively from overseas to fund a record budget aimed at helping the country spend its way out of its economic doldrums. But plans for lenders like the World Bank and African Development Bank to loan at least $2 billion to Nigeria have been stalled for over a year as international organizations' frustrations mounted at the country's refusal to impose key fiscal reforms such as allowing its foreign exchange rate to float freely. Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun's comments, made while speaking at a business forum in the capital of Abuja, suggest that Nigeria will no longer seek such loans, or an additional $1.5 billion it had planned to raise from international debt markets.  We cannot borrow anymore, we just have to generate funds domestically enough to fund our budget. Mobilize revenue to fund the necessary budget increase,  she said. In May, the head of Nigeria's budget office said the country has a shortfall of $7.5 billion for its 2017 budget expenditure, and said that would be addressed with $3.5 billion from the aforementioned loans and debt. The government also planned to raise $4 billion from the local debt market, he said at the time. Nigeria's presidency signed off on its record 7.44 trillion naira ($24.39 billion) budget for 2017 in June, after numerous delays. The plan projects a deficit of 2.21 trillion naira, implying a deficit equivalent to 2.18 percent of Nigerian gross domestic product.

Fresh data published on Tuesday by eBay shows the number of million euro businesses selling on eBay grew to 1,095 from 731 in Germany last year since 2013 while million pound-plus businesses rose to 663 from 443 in Britain over the same time period.      EBay's two big European markets were collectively responsible for 30 percent of eBay's total net revenue of nearly $9 billion last year, although reported revenue in both markets dipped amid currency declines against the U.S. dollar.    Two examples in the north of England are MusicMagpie.co.uk, which buys used CDs, DVDs and electronics from consumers for resale on eBay in more than 140 countries, and cycling accessory seller MaxGear, now a 3.5 million pound ($4.51 million) a year business.     While the company founded 22 years ago started out as an online auction site for consumers to trade second-hand goods, 80 percent of merchandise now sold via eBay is new, largely fixed-price items, the company reported in the first quarter of 2017.     Commercial sellers in eBay's five main European markets - Germany, Britain, Italy, France and Spain - export, on average, to 20 different countries a piece, said Phuong Nguyen, eBay's senior Director of seller growth, highlighting the international focus for many of its small and medium-sized export businesses.     The third largest country in Europe for millionaire businesses is Italy, where million euro-plus businesses rose 55 percent to 93 from 60 in the four years ending in 2016. More detailed data can be found at inside-ebay.eu/. The United States grew 6.7 percent to $3.87 billion in 2016, making up 43 percent of total eBay revenue, while the rest of Europe and other international markets gained 9 percent in U.S. dollar terms for the remaining 27 percent of company revenue.     Other major international markets include Australia, South Korea and its cross-border business in greater China, eBay said.     EBay is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on July 20, when it is expected to report a 3.6 percent rise in net revenue to $2.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell as global oversupply encouraged several banks to cut their forecasts for crude for this year and 2018.                  U.S. crude        prices were down 0.25 percent at $44.29 a barrel.     The U.S. dollar        ground higher against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength, helped by the past fortnight's 25 basis-point rise in 10-year U.S. government bond yields.                  At 9:42 a.m. ET (1342 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2915 to the greenback, or 77.43 U.S. cents, down 0.2 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2886 to C$1.2926. On Friday, the loonie had touched its highest in nearly 10 months at C$1.2860 after stronger-than-expected domestic jobs data boosted chances of a rate increase this week.      Chances of a hike on Wednesday sit at 88 percent, data from the overnight index swaps market shows. A nearly 80-percent chance of a second hike has been implied by December.                After years of being warned that borrowing costs would have to rise eventually, debt-happy Canadians may be about to face a reckoning if the Bank of Canada hikes.

Setting out plans for spectrum needed to increase internet speeds, communications regulator Ofcom said it would cap the amount that could be won by market leader BT/EE and by Vodafone in a bid to maintain competition in the sector. However Three, owned by Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings , said the proposals needed to go further and it would consider its response as a matter of urgency. The company, the fourth biggest provider in Britain, had previously threatened legal action over the auction plans, echoing a dispute that delayed the auction for 4G services in recent years.  Ofcom's proposal is a kick in the teeth for all consumers,  said Dave Dyson, Chief Executive of Three UK.  By making decisions that increase the dominance of the largest operators, Ofcom is damaging competition, restricting choice and pushing prices up for the very consumers that it is meant to protect.  In its proposals Ofcom said it would hold an auction later this year to offer 190 MHz of spectrum in two bands, increasing the airwaves available for mobile devices by almost one third. The first offer of 40 MHz in the 2.3 GHZ band will be usable immediately while the second offer of 150 MHz in the 3.4 GHz band is expected to be used by future devices running on a 5G network when that is available. Ofcom said under its plans no mobile operator would be allowed to own more than 37 percent of all the mobile spectrum expected to be usable in 2020, capping how much the biggest spectrum owners such as BT and Vodafone can win in the upcoming auction. Ofcom believes these restrictions will free up the other two providers, Three and Telefonica's O2, to snap up spectrum, but Three said the proposals did not go far enough. BT/EE currently owns 42 percent of immediately usable spectrum, while Vodafone owns 29 percent, O2 has 14 percent and Three owns 15 percent. Mark Evans, CEO of Telefonica UK, said Ofcom's plan fell short of its expectations but it urged the industry to now press ahead with the auction. Vodafone and EE also said they looked forward to being able to move on and develop their networks.  Spectrum is a vital resource that fuels the UK's economy,  Philip Marnick, Ofcom's Spectrum Group Director, said.  We've designed this auction to ensure that people and businesses continue to benefit from strong competition for mobile services.

In a report examining humanitarian conditions in the territory, which Hamas took over in June 2007 after a brief conflict with forces loyal to the Palestinian Authority, the United Nations concludes the situation in Gaza is deteriorating  further and faster  than was forecast only a few years ago.  Across the board we're watching de-development in slow motion,  Robert Piper, the UN Coordinator for Humanitarian Aid and Development Activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.  Every indicator, from energy to water to healthcare to employment to poverty to food insecurity, every indicator is declining. Gazans have been going through this slow motion de-development now for a decade.  Immediately after Hamas took power, Israel moved to isolate the militant group by restricting the flow of goods and people in and out of Gaza, limiting access to the sea and working with Egypt to enforce a blockade. At the same time, Hamas has been in near-constant dispute with the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, prompting the PA to limit financial transfers to Gaza and, in recent weeks, asking Israel to cut back electricity supplies. The upshot is that Gaza's population, which is projected to grow by another 10 percent in the next three years, is being squeezed on all sides, even as resources become more scarce.  I see this extraordinarily inhuman and unjust process of strangling gradually two million civilians in Gaza that really pose a threat to nobody,  said Piper.  Asked who was doing the strangling, he replied:  Everyone's having a go,  mentioning internal Palestinian political strife, Israeli security policies that leave Gazans caught in the middle, and regional dynamics including pressure on Qatar, a major donor to Hamas, from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Robert Piper, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the West Bank and Gaza and a deputy secretary general, gestures as he speaks during an interview with Reuters in Jerusalem July 11, 2017.Ronen Zvulun That's the message in this report, the fundamental message: Someone has got to step back and put the interests of civilians at the top of the queue for a change,  Piper said.   We talk about the unlivability of Gaza. When you're down to two hours of power a day and you have 60 percent youth unemployment rates... that unlivability threshold has been passed quite a long time ago.  Gaza is a narrow wedge of land on the eastern Mediterranean, barely 40 km long and around 10 km wide, with most people living in densely packed, low concrete tower blocks, and many areas damaged in past bouts of fighting between Hamas and Israel. Slideshow (5 Images)Small Steps Can Help One of the most pressing challenges is power. Gaza needs at least 450 megawatts of electricity a day, but is now receiving 120 MW, partly because of the dispute between Hamas and the PA and a lack of internal power-generating capacity. By 2020, if growth picks up, Gaza will require up to 850 MW a day, but supplies are unlikely to top 360 MW. Piper sees ways in which conditions could quickly be improved without significant risk to Israel's security, including expanding the fishing zone off Gaza to 20 nautical miles from six currently. A freer flow of goods, including water pumps, elevators, wood, steel, cables and other electrical equipment, would also help.  Resolving the struggle between Hamas and the PA is essential in the long-run, but Piper says improving Gaza's health, education, sanitation and growth is critical for Israel as well.  In the media, in the NGO community, and even in the Defence Ministry, you'll find plenty of thoughtful Israelis that will recognise that, firstly, the current trajectory is threatening for Israel's security and that a stable and prosperous Gaza... is also good for Israeli security,  he said.

However, the audit's findings remain troubling, in particular that at least $500 million had gone missing. Although the fallout from the debt, which was not cleared through parliament, has hammered one of the world's poorest economies, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde singled out the deals as  clearly concealing corruption .

Snap shares were trading at $16.04, after closing below its $17 IPO price for the first time on Monday. The Snapchat owner's market debut in March was the hottest U.S. technology listing in years. The downgrade comes ahead of the expiry of the stock's lock-up period on July 29. In an unusual move for an IPO's lead underwriter, Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the Snapchat parent to  equal-weight  from  outperform , and also slashed its price target to $16 from $28. The brokerage's price target now sits below Snap's median price target of $19.50. Dipping below an IPO price is seen on Wall Street as a setback to be avoided by chief executives and their underwriters, but it is not uncommon for Silicon Valley companies. Snapchat has gained popularity among people under 30, but many on Wall Street have been critical of Snap's lofty valuation and slowing user growth. The company faces increasing competition from Facebook, which once made a $3 billion bid for Snapchat. The social media giant has made the camera a central piece of its apps and offers features similar to Snap on its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp. In June, Instagram said its Stories feature had 250 million users, compared with 166 million users for Snapchat at the end of the first quarter. Besides rising competition from Instagram, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak also said user growth trends have been modestly weaker than expected.  We have been wrong about Snap's ability to innovate and improve its ad product this year and user monetization as it works to move beyond 'experimental' ad budgets into larger branded and direct response ad allocations,  Nowak said in the note. Morgan Stanley cut its estimates for Snap's 2017 revenue by 6.9 percent to $897 million, and daily active user expectations by 1.6 percent to 182 million. Goldman Sachs, another lead underwriter, still has a  buy  and an unchanged $27 price target. Up to Monday's close, Snap has lost about 42 percent since its early highs after its IPO.

Orange will in coming months distribute Canal Plus's French channels to ultrafast broadband customers, the company said, without elaborating on the price that will be offered. This means Orange will directly charge those within this client category (fiber optic offers) who wish to add Canal Plus's channels to their Orange contract, two sources close to the matter told Reuters. Until now, Canal Plus was the only entity able to charge customers for the TV content it owns. Orange boss Richard told reporters there were 900,000 Orange customers that also subscribe to Canal Plus, adding that the company aimed to double this number by 2020 via the new deal. Orange Content, the new specialist unit within the group, will also consider acquiring distribution rights. Earlier this year, Orange said it was interested in working with Canal Plus on acquiring sports rights rather than trying to buy a stake in the pay TV business. Orange is also planning to spend 100 million euros ($114 million) over 5 years on TV series, the company added. Pressure has been mounting on Vivendi and Orange lately after Altice, owner of France's second-biggest telecoms operator SFR and with deep pockets in terms of spending power, won the rights to broadcast European Champions League soccer matches until 2021 in France. SFR also bought English soccer's Premier League rights for three seasons starting in 2016. Competition is also fierce regarding original TV content. Orange announced in March a new multi-year contract with U.S. broadcaster HBO, the owner of hit-show  Game of Thrones , allowing it to become HBO's sole distributor in France. For its part, Altice signed exclusive distribution deals last year with Discovery Communications and NBCUniversal for all SFR platforms. $1 = 0.8771 euros Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/orange-vivendi-canal-plus-idUSP6N1JP000"},

The text of the 2013 accord, whose existence was known but whose contents have never before been made public, was first published by CNN on Monday and later released on social media by Saudi officials. In a joint statement, Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said the publication of the accord, meant to settle a dispute between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors,  confirms beyond any doubt Qatar's failure to meet its commitments and its full violation of its pledges . Amid fresh tension with Qatar, the four slapped sanctions on Doha on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism, cozying up to Iran, backing the Muslim Brotherhood - the world's oldest Islamist organization - and interference in  their affairs. The four say Qatar pledged to desist from interfering in its neighbors' politics in the 2013 agreement. Related CoverageEgypt says Arab foreign ministers boycotting Qatar to meet Tillerson on WednesdayVisiting Doha, Tillerson calls Qatari position 'reasonable'Qatar has rejected the charges and said the four countries are trying to impose their own views on its foreign policies. The document surfaced as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in the region to help Washington's allies hammer out a way out of the crisis. In response, Qatar accused Saudi Arabia and the UAE of breaking the spirit of the Riyadh agreement and engaging in an  unwarranted and unprecedented attack on Qatar's sovereignty .

Kuwaiti mediation efforts hit a snag last week when the four Arab states said they were disappointed with Qatar's response to their list of 13 demands. Muslim Brotherhood Qatar said the demands, which included ending support for militant groups, the closure of the Al Jazeera TV channel, shutting down a Turkish military base in Qatar and downgrading ties with Iran, were an infringement of its sovereignty. QNA reported Sheikh Saif Bin Ahmed Al-Thani, director of Qatar's government communications, as saying the 13 demands bore no relation to the Riyadh accord and the latest crisis was the result of a coordinated media campaign against Qatar.  Some of the allegations and demands of the siege countries have no basis, while others were an unwarranted and unprecedented attack on the sovereignty of the state of Qatar in violation to all international and regional agreements.   The 2013 agreement, reached at a meeting in Riyadh hosted by the then Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, was signed by the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, while an implementation mechanism was signed by the six GCC foreign ministers. In the document, the parties agreed to refrain from backing any  political currents that pose a threat to any member country of the (Gulf Cooperation) Council , and provided for Muslim Brotherhood leaders who are non-GCC citizens to leave the area.

The Srebrenica massacre by Bosnian Serb forces near the end of Bosnia's war was declared a genocide by two United Nations courts and leaders including General Ratko Mladic have been prosecuted at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The 2014 killings at Sinjar of thousands of Yazidis by IS militants who buried some alive and took thousands of women as slaves have also been called a genocide by a U.N. commission but activists are seeking wider recognition and prosecutions.   We have endured horrific abuse and persecution -- the Bosnian Muslims at the hands of Serbs and Yazidis at the hands of the Islamic State (IS) -- and we share the memories and recognize each others' feelings,  said Hussam Abdukah, a Yazidi lawyer who is documenting the IS crimes and is a member of a peacebuilding program in northern Iraq.  Tuesday's commemoration of the killings at Srebrenica 22 years ago included the burials of 71 newly identified victims at a cemetery near the eastern town, bringing the total number interred there to 6,575.  More than 1,000 men and boys are still missing. The Serb forces dumped the victims' bodies in pits and subsequently dug them up and scattered them in a systematic effort to conceal the crime, Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.  Yazidis will commemorate the Sinjar massacre in August.  A Woman cries near coffins of her relatives, who are newly identified victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, which are lined up for a joint burial in Potocari near Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 11, 2017.Dado RuvicThe activists attending the Srebrenica anniversary, who also  included two Iraqis, said they hoped to use the Srebrenica families' experiences to help build cases against IS fighters that can eventually be used in international criminal courts.   We urge the international community that just like in Srebrenica it helps open mass graves and build cases because we fear that traces of the crime might stay hidden,  said Basma Naji, who fled Sinjar just hours before the attack. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was jailed last year for 40 years by The Hague tribunal while his military chief Mladic is still being tried on genocide charges.  Slideshow (13 Images)Dozens of Bosnian Serb lower-ranking officials were jailed over the Srebrenica atrocity by the Bosnian war crimes court.  Most Serbs strongly deny the massacre was genocide, however, and regard Karadzic and Mladic as national heroes. That divide continues to hinder reconciliation and stifle Bosnia's progress toward integration with Western Europe.  Among those buried on Tuesday was Munib Salkic, who was 15 when he was killed at Srebrenica.   For more than 20 years I had hoped my brother was alive,   his sister Emina Kuranovic said through tears beside a green-draped coffin holding Salkic's remains.

Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress will be on Wednesday and Thursday.

The sale - the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data - will help strengthen Wanda's case for a mainland listing after its property unit delisted from Hong Kong last year. For Sunac, it would mean ownership of a wide portfolio of tourism developments at a time when it is  spending billions on property and technology assets. Wanda said it would offload 91 percent of thirteen cultural tourism projects, which usually include theme parks and leisure complexes, and 76 hotels to the acquisitive Tianjin-based developer Sunac for 63.18 billion yuan. After the sale, Wanda will, however, continue to play a role in operating and managing the projects. Wanda, which also has interests in films and sports, had plans to build at least 20 cultural projects around China. Its billionaire owner Wang Jianlin had last year said his  wolf pack  of parks would beat U.S. rival Walt Disney Co (DIS.N).  This (deal) signifies a retreat from Wanda's previous strategy in cultural tourism, and marks a pivot to an asset-light strategy,  said Qin Gang, senior researcher at State Information Center, a government-linked think tank. Beijing has been encouraging development of cultural theme parks as part of a local tourism drive, tapping consumers' growing budget for entertainment. There are over 300 such facilities in China, with most struggling to turn a profit. Wanda's parks are still under construction, except three that have been completed. Two that opened in Nanchang and Hefei last year do not rank in the top 20 by attendance for Asia Pacific, consultancy AECOM's 2016 theme park index shows.  The firm, which had earmarked a more than 300 billion yuan ($44 billion) investment for its cultural and tourism projects, did not give a reason for the sale to Sunac, but local business magazine Caixin quoted Wang as saying the deal would ease the debt burden on Wanda's property unit.  Through this asset transfer, Wanda Commercial's debt ratio will be greatly reduced, all the proceeds will be used to repay loans. Wanda Commercial plans to repay most of the bank loans this year,  Wang told Caixin. Analysts said the lower debt load could help Wanda's plans to list the unit in Shanghai and to attract a higher valuation. S&P downgraded Wanda Commercial in December citing rising financial leverage and slower-than-expected asset disposal at China's largest commercial developer. Another downgrade would push the rating into  junk  category. FILE PHOTO: A sign of Dalian Wanda Group in China glows during an event announcing strategic partnership between Wanda Group and FIFA in Beijing, China March 21, 2016.Damir Sagolj/File PhotoThe group has been investing heavily in entertainment, leisure and financial businesses and the buying spree has drawn the attention of Chinese regulators, who ordered lenders last month to assess exposure to overseas deals by Wanda, HNA Group, Anbang Insurance [ANBANG.UL] and FosunÂ (0656.HK). Wanda has been very active globally, with deals for U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N), Hollywood film studio Legendary Entertainment, Infront Sports & Media AG and Spanish soccer team Atletico Madrid.  Sunac Drive Sunac too has been shopping. Slideshow (2 Images)In the past year, boss Sun Hongbin has led the group on an acquisition spree, including $2.1 billion for the real-estate assets of Legend Holdings, parent of PC-maker Lenovo, and $2.2 billion for a stake in Leshi Internet (300104.SZ), a unit of LeEco - a Chinese Netflix-to-Tesla-like conglomerate.  The stake in Wanda cultural and tourism projects will cost Sunac 29.58 billion yuan. The price tag for the hotels is 33.6 billion yuan. The firms are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month.  Sunac will pay for this from its cashpile that stood at over 90 billion yuan at the end of June, Caixin quoted Sun as saying.  It had total liabilities of 168.6 billion yuan at the end of 2016, versus 64.5 billion yuan the year before.  Shares in Wanda Hotel Development (0169.HK) surged more than 150 percent after news of the deal, though none of the hotels being sold are included under this entity. Wanda said Sunac will be responsible for all the loans for the projects, but the brand name and design will be unchanged. Sunac, whose shares in Hong Kong were suspended from trading ahead of what it said would be a  very substantial acquisition  announcement, declined to comment further. Shares in the developer have more than doubled in value this year, but analysts worry Sunac could have bitten off too much. It has a negative outlook rating from Moody's, which said in April Sunac's leverage had deteriorated significantly due to large amounts of debt it had raised to support acquisitions.

A further 1,500 were infected with HIV between 1978 and 1985. The inquiry comes after leaders from all of Britain's main political parties, except the ruling Conservatives, wrote a joint letter to May demanding an investigation into the issue.

Giulio Regeni was found murdered in Cairo in February 2016 after the head of a Cairo street vendors' union reported him to police a few weeks before his death. The 28-year-old, who was conducting postgraduate research into Egyptian trade unions, was last seen by friends on Jan. 25, 2016. His body, showing signs of extensive torture, was found in a roadside ditch outside Cairo on Feb. 3. Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in Regeni's death. Security and intelligence sources told Reuters in April that he had been arrested in Cairo on Jan. 25, and taken into custody.  President Sisi stressed the need to continue close cooperation between investigators in the two countries,  his office said in a statement.  The president reiterated Egypt's full commitment to working on disclosing the circumstances surrounding the incident so as to determine the perpetrators and bring them to justice.  Egypt's top prosecutor gave the green light in January to experts from Italy and a German company that specializes in salvaging closed-circuit TV footage to examine cameras in Cairo as part of the investigation into Regeni's death. Italy has complained that the investigation is taking too long, and withdrawn its ambassador to Cairo. Egypt has said its police carried out checks on Regeni's activities following concerns raised by the union chief, but found nothing of interest. Human rights groups have said torture marks indicated Regeni died at the hands of the security forces, an allegation Cairo denies.

The breakout follows one by five lions in May, raising alarm bells in South Africa, which contains its big, dangerous wildlife in fenced reserves to prevent conflict with rural communities and livestock.   The lion population has grown exponentially and is a contributing factor to young males looking to new territories,  South African National Parks (SANParks) said in a statement.  This is as a result of naturally occurring factors like drought which we have seen in the last two years, allowing for an abundance of animals for predators like lions to feed on, and an increase in their population,  it said. South Africa was scorched by a drought in 2015/16, which hit crop production and caused many of the water holes in Kruger to dry up, providing predators with a bonanza in dead and dying prey species. An abundance of young males would create lethal conflict in the park as coalitions of older males would drive them away, leading them to take escape routes through gaps in Kruger's fencing. South Africa launches large operations to return or eliminate alpha animals when escapes occur. Four of the five that escaped in May were eventually recaptured. The current batch of felines on the run is believed to be in a rugged, mountainous and thickly wooded area south of the park, making capture efforts difficult but also providing relief as the cats are not an immediate threat to humans or livestock.

They began with several molecules, but finally settled on one, called 4-1BB, because it seemed to prime the human immune system to attack blood cancer more aggressively than others.    Our first tests convinced us these T cells were special,  Campana, now a scientist at the National University Cancer Institute in Singapore, told Reuters by email this week.  I had never seen any drug killing leukemic cells so rapidly and specifically.  Come Wednesday, it will be showtime for his molecule, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration publicly reviews Novartis' investigational drug, CTL019, for safety and effectiveness against ALL in children.  Campana's 4-1BB is the key ingredient of the Swiss drugmaker's therapy, which involves T cells being extracted from patients, genetically re-engineered, and then unleashed to kill leukemia cells growing out of control.  Of 68 desperately ill children who started Novartis's pediatric ALL trial 17 months ago when other treatments had failed, 57 are alive. Novartis' chief drug developer Vas Narasimhan thinks Campana's molecule is a big reason why.  This might be part of the reason we see the profile that we do in terms of long-lasting remissions with CTL019,  he said. The chimeric antigen receptor therapy developed by Novartis, called CAR-T, is poised to become the first of its kind to secure FDA approval, ahead of Kite Pharma and Juno Therapeutics. The Swiss drugmaker eventually expects more than $1 billion in annual sales, including from the treatment of other forms of cancer in adults. Paternity Dispute The discovery of 4-1BB by Campana, an Italian, and his Japanese colleague Chihaya Imai, during their tenure at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, had gone relatively unheralded. Instead, the University of Pennsylvania, including its cancer immunotherapy pioneer Carl June that borrowed the molecule from Campana in the early 2000s for his own work, has won most of the accolades. Around the time Novartis struck a multi-million deal with Penn to commercialize CTL019 in 2012, St. Jude's sued the university, alleging patent violations.  Moreover, Campana's and Imai's names were left off the Penn team's publications.  But the patent dispute was finally settled in 2015, when Novartis agreed to pay $12.25 million, plus royalties.  The scientific record has been set straight too. Last year, June's team updated three New England Journal of Medicine publications that had previously ignored Campana's contribution. Despite the initial snub, Campana is rooting for Novartis' drug.  Many scientists have contributed in different ways to the development of this technology,  said Campana, a founder of Boston-based cancer immunotherapy company Unum Therapeutics.   It is wonderful that it works.    Editing by Alexander Smith","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-novartis-cancer-idUSKBN19W1I0"},

LTC, which will formally change its name to the London EV Company later this year, is undergoing a rapid expansion since it was bought by China's Geely in 2013, opening a central English plant in Coventry, earlier this year. By the turn of the decade it hopes to sell to overseas markets 50 percent of the roughly 10,000 vehicles to be produced each year, including a van which could begin production in 2019, and has been showing the new electric plug-in hybrid taxi in a number of European cities. Chief Executive Chris Gubbey said the firm had picked the Netherlands as its first export market due to its receptiveness to new technology and the new model's compatibility with the needs of disabled people, including its ramp and high roof.   It is a city that is very progressive in terms of protecting and improving its air quality,  he told Reuters.   They just recognise what the product can do for their market: the accessibility, the ease of getting in and out,  he said. Dutch firm RMC is buying 225 vehicles which Amsterdammers will not be able to hail but will be instead used as a part of a service to transport the elderly and disabled, including to and from hospital, and could soon also be used in Rotterdam.  The TX model will go into full production later this year, ready to reach the first customers in around November, with a third of components British and the rest built abroad, including a Korean battery and Chinese engine.  The British car industry has boosted local content in recent years, reaching 44 percent, but the level remains short of the 55 percent stipulated in the kinds of bilateral trade agreements Britain will need to strike as it leaves the European Union.  The country is currently deficient in battery and electric vehicle production capacities compared with other major markets but ministers are pushing to boost infrastructure and could shortly approve its first electric car battery hub.  Gubbey, who was at an industry event in May where the proposals were made to Britain's business minister, said the firm could source batteries locally if such schemes came to fruition.  There are opportunities to move batteries towards the UK,  he told Reuters.  The government is very focussed on that, even local to us, with the technology park that they are talking of putting in a manufacturing capability,  he said.   As the firm grows and with fellow Geely-owned brand Volvo raising 5 billion Swedish crowns ($590 million) from a group of investors in a step towards a share market flotation, Gubbey told Reuters there were no plans at present for the cab-maker to also move in the direction of a share listing.   We have no definitive timing or plan to pursue an IPO at this stage,  he said.    In the future, if that proves the right thing to do, I'm sure it's what Geely will look at.

Visualizing the time left until retirement and seeing how certain spending habits affect your goal are the purpose of the new Pretirement app. pretirement.amokrunner.com   When we are saving money, itâ€™s not obvious that you canâ€™t buy something,  said Danny Murphy, the app's designer. Pretirement asks for basic retirement parameters: how much you already have saved, how much more you plan to save on an annual basis and how much you think you will spend when you are retired. Then it calculates how long you will have to keep working to generate the income you say you will need when you retire - down to the seconds, which keep ticking away.  The app uses default assumptions about your investment growth rate, inflation and a safe withdrawal rate of 4 percent, which you can change if you wish. With additional input, Pretirement will also tell you how much more or less time you will need if you spend more or save more. You can keep adding and subtracting until you get a time frame that pleases you.   Reuters spoke with Murphy, a 32-year-old civil engineer from Auburn, California, about the challenges of using dynamic visualization to try to change behavior.  Q: What is your own time horizon for retiring?  A: Iâ€™m on a 17-to-20-year horizon.  I really should use the term financial independence rather than retiring. I have no real intention of retiring early. But I want the option to functionally retire.  It would mean that working would be entirely because I wanted to do it rather than that I had to do it. I have no complaints with my job, but I love the idea of being free to make decisions when I want to make them.   Q: What kind of feedback have you been getting about the countdown aspect?  A: The number one response is:  That sounds depressing.  They donâ€™t want to know.  And the other thing that has been enlightening is how many people Iâ€™ve had demo it have no idea what they have in the bank and what their potential costs are, what interest rates are. The general public hasn't had a lot of insight into their financial picture.  One person said: 'Unfortunately, Iâ€™m not going to be able to retire until Iâ€™m 92.'  Q: What is your ideal scenario of how this app can help?  A: I hope that people get a better grasp on the little things. Itâ€™s one thing to spend the time to crunch the numbers when you are buying a new car, but it's the small things, like a music service subscription for $12 a month, that provide significant difference.  Some have small benefit to you â€“ instantaneous, like a cup of coffee â€“ but are really costly long-term.  Q: Has your own behavior changed since learning how your spending affects your goals?

While parts of Canada's hot housing market have started to cool, June's homebuilding activity pushed the six-month starts average to its highest in nearly five years. The strong growth is one reason the Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of starts rose to 212,695 in June from May's upwardly revised 194,955. Economists had expected a rise to a 200,000 annual rate.  Strength in residential investment was a reason for a strong first quarter, and the recent readings in starts suggests that homebuilding will continue to be a solid growth contributor for 2017 as a whole,  CIBC World Markets economist Nick Exarhos said in a research note. While Toronto home sales fell in June for the third consecutive month on fears that a long boom had passed its peak, cities in that province, Ontario, continued to fuel the overall national rise in housing starts. Ontario starts soared 47 percent, while those in Quebec gained 30 percent. A recent cooling in British Columbia continued, with starts down 19 percent, noted Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial.  Canadaâ€™s real estate market remains hot despite tighter rules implemented by governments at both the federal and provincial levels,  Rangasamy said in a research note.  The rebound in June housing starts to well-above demographic needs is a case in point.  In that context, tomorrowâ€™s expected tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of Canada is welcome.  Economists expect the central bank to raise interest rates as early as Wednesday after cutting them twice in 2015 to counter an oil price shock that sideswiped Canada's economy. The recent dramatic drop in home sales in Toronto, Canada's largest housing market, has triggered fears of a housing crash but other markets are showing strength, and Vancouver, the second-largest market, has recovered after a softening in mid-2016. Still, Exarhos said housing starts were bound to cool in the year ahead after defying expectations for a slowdown for years.  A softening in (building) permit activity, and a smaller backlog of unused permits, signal that there won't be much upside for starts from here,  Exarhos said.

They began with several molecules, but finally settled on one, called 4-1BB, because it seemed to prime the human immune system to attack blood cancer more aggressively than others.    Our first tests convinced us these T cells were special,  Campana, now a scientist at the National University Cancer Institute in Singapore, told Reuters by email this week.  I had never seen any drug killing leukemic cells so rapidly and specifically.  Come Wednesday, it will be showtime for his molecule, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration publicly reviews Novartis' investigational drug, CTL019, for safety and effectiveness against ALL in children.  Campana's 4-1BB is the key ingredient of the Swiss drugmaker's therapy, which involves T cells being extracted from patients, genetically re-engineered, and then unleashed to kill leukemia cells growing out of control.  Of 68 desperately ill children who started Novartis's pediatric ALL trial 17 months ago when other treatments had failed, 57 are alive. Novartis' chief drug developer Vas Narasimhan thinks Campana's molecule is a big reason why.  This might be part of the reason we see the profile that we do in terms of long-lasting remissions with CTL019,  he said. The chimeric antigen receptor therapy developed by Novartis, called CAR-T, is poised to become the first of its kind to secure FDA approval, ahead of Kite Pharma and Juno Therapeutics. The Swiss drugmaker eventually expects more than $1 billion in annual sales, including from the treatment of other forms of cancer in adults. Paternity Dispute The discovery of 4-1BB by Campana, an Italian, and his Japanese colleague Chihaya Imai, during their tenure at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, had gone relatively unheralded. Instead, the University of Pennsylvania, including its cancer immunotherapy pioneer Carl June that borrowed the molecule from Campana in the early 2000s for his own work, has won most of the accolades. Around the time Novartis struck a multi-million deal with Penn to commercialize CTL019 in 2012, St. Jude's sued the university, alleging patent violations.  Moreover, Campana's and Imai's names were left off the Penn team's publications.  But the patent dispute was finally settled in 2015, when Novartis agreed to pay $12.25 million, plus royalties.  The scientific record has been set straight too. Last year, June's team updated three New England Journal of Medicine publications that had previously ignored Campana's contribution. Despite the initial snub, Campana is rooting for Novartis' drug.  Many scientists have contributed in different ways to the development of this technology,  said Campana, a founder of Boston-based cancer immunotherapy company Unum Therapeutics.   It is wonderful that it works.    Editing by Alexander Smith","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/novartis-cancer-idUSL8N1K215L"},

The Japanese conglomerate confirmed it was in talks with suitors, but did not name them, noting it had been unable to reach an agreement by a self-imposed June 28 deadline with its preferred bidder - a group that includes state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS). A representative for Western Digital declined to comment, and a representative for Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), was not immediately available for comment. Talks with the preferred consortium have stalled over what sources say are proposals by SK Hynix that it helps fund a deal through convertible bonds - a step that could eventually give it an equity interest in the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips. Toshiba doesn't want its South Korean rival to have an equity or management influence in the chip business - a stance it has taken to satisfy a Japanese government keen to keep Toshiba's technology under domestic control. Toshiba told its creditor banks at a meeting on Tuesday that it had begun talks with alternative bidders because talks with the consortium had stalled, the banking sources said. They didn't want to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. FILE PHOTO: A Western Digital Corporation hard drive is pictured here in Encinitas, California April 19, 2011.Mike Blake/File Photo Toshiba had no option but to say it's in talks with other suitors because the preferred consortium is falling through,  said another official involved in the talks, who also requested anonymity as those negotiations are sensitive. Toshiba needs to sell its chip business to plug a hole in its balance sheet by the fiscal year-end in March, to avoid an automatic delisting of its shares from Tokyo's stock market. The 140-year-old laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate was still recovering from a $1.3 billion accounting scandal in 2015 when it was hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse in December.  Sources have said that INCJ and DBJ, said to be wary of SK Hynix, could back a deal with Western Digital. Toshiba executives, though, have been reluctant to consider a deal with Western Digital, with sources saying ties between the two companies have been strained since Western Digital bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner, in May last year. Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent Toshiba selling the chip unit without its consent. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Friday. In July 7 court documents, Western Digital said it matched rival bidders' offers to buy the flash memory unit - though the actual dollar figure of the bid was redacted.

Artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based the portraits on a range of possible facial variations generated by software that analyzed DNA samples sent her by the former intelligence analyst when she was behind bars. Manning, 29, was released in May from a U.S. military prison in Kansas where she had been serving time for passing secrets to the WikiLeaks website in the biggest breach of classified data in the history of the United States. Other than one mugshot, photos of Manning were prohibited while she was in custody.  The exhibition by Dewey-Hagborg and Manning at the Fridman Gallery in Manhattan shows portraits of her with different color eyes or skin tone. Manning seems more masculine in some of the depictions, and in others more feminine in the show titled  A Becoming Resemblance.   I'm hoping people will walk in and see a portrait that resonates with them and feel kind of that connection with her,  Dewey-Hagborg said at the gallery, where the exhibit opens on Aug. 2.  We are all Chelsea Manning and we all stand there with her.  Artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg poses with 3-D printed masks created from DNA extracted from cheek swabs and hair clippings she received from formerly imprisoned U.S. Army Private Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, ahead of the August 2, 2017 opening of   A Becoming Resemblance , an exhibition at the Fridman gallery in New York City, July 7, 2017.Mike SegarDewey-Hagborg, who has previously created art pieces produced using DNA samples, worked with Manning for more than two years on the project. It began when a magazine contacted the artist to ask whether she could create an image to accompany a feature profile of Manning. Dewey-Hagborg said she found the former soldier to be optimistic and  incredibly brave  during all of their interactions. Slideshow (17 Images)Manning said she trusted the artist and gave her free reign to produce the images, according to Dewey-Hagborg, asking only that the artist did not make her appear too masculine. â€œPrisons try very hard to make us inhuman and unreal by denying our image, and thus our existence, to the rest of the world.  Manning said in a statement on the gallery's website. Dewey-Hagborg said the exhibition was meant to show that DNA does not necessarily tell you what gender a person is. She also hoped that showing 30 different DNA-generated versions of Manning's face drew attention to the fact DNA-based imaging is not completely accurate.

Visualizing the time left until retirement and seeing how certain spending habits affect your goal are the purpose of the new Pretirement app. pretirement.amokrunner.com   When we are saving money, itâ€™s not obvious that you canâ€™t buy something,  said Danny Murphy, the app's designer. Pretirement asks for basic retirement parameters: how much you already have saved, how much more you plan to save on an annual basis and how much you think you will spend when you are retired. Then it calculates how long you will have to keep working to generate the income you say you will need when you retire - down to the seconds, which keep ticking away.  The app uses default assumptions about your investment growth rate, inflation and a safe withdrawal rate of 4 percent, which you can change if you wish. With additional input, Pretirement will also tell you how much more or less time you will need if you spend more or save more. You can keep adding and subtracting until you get a time frame that pleases you.   Reuters spoke with Murphy, a 32-year-old civil engineer from Auburn, California, about the challenges of using dynamic visualization to try to change behavior.  Q: What is your own time horizon for retiring?  A: Iâ€™m on a 17-to-20-year horizon.  I really should use the term financial independence rather than retiring. I have no real intention of retiring early. But I want the option to functionally retire.  It would mean that working would be entirely because I wanted to do it rather than that I had to do it. I have no complaints with my job, but I love the idea of being free to make decisions when I want to make them.   Q: What kind of feedback have you been getting about the countdown aspect?  A: The number one response is:  That sounds depressing.  They donâ€™t want to know.  And the other thing that has been enlightening is how many people Iâ€™ve had demo it have no idea what they have in the bank and what their potential costs are, what interest rates are. The general public hasn't had a lot of insight into their financial picture.  One person said: 'Unfortunately, Iâ€™m not going to be able to retire until Iâ€™m 92.'  Q: What is your ideal scenario of how this app can help?  A: I hope that people get a better grasp on the little things. Itâ€™s one thing to spend the time to crunch the numbers when you are buying a new car, but it's the small things, like a music service subscription for $12 a month, that provide significant difference.  Some have small benefit to you â€“ instantaneous, like a cup of coffee â€“ but are really costly long-term.  Q: Has your own behavior changed since learning how your spending affects your goals?  A: The biggest thing weâ€™ve done differently is cooking more at home and eat out less often. Food is our second-biggest expense.

America beverage pricing up 1 pct, Frito-Lay up 3 pct July 11 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc's quarterly profit beat estimates as higher pricing of sodas and snack foods in North America paid off and as the company sold its minority stake in British bottler Britvic Plc. PepsiCo said on Tuesday that sales in its North America beverage unit, the company's largest, rose 2 percent to $5.24 billion in the second quarter ended June 17. While volume sales were flat, net pricing was up 1 percent. PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola Co have focused on selling smaller, higher-margin packs in developed markets while pulling back on promoting large discount packs as they look to cushion the impact of falling demand for fizzy drinks. Revenue from PepsiCo's Frito-Lay North America business rose 3 percent, helped by a 1 percent rise in volume and a 3 percent rise in net pricing. The company said in May it would sell its 4.5 percent stake in British bottler Britvic for an undisclosed amount. Net income attributable to PepsiCo rose to $2.11 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $2.01 billion, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 2.1 percent to $15.71 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.40 per share on revenue of $15.60 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, gross margins fell 50 basis points in the quarter, compared with a 115 basis points expansion in the year-earlier quarter. The company had said in April it expected margins to remain under pressure in the second quarter as it passes on higher commodity prices to consumers. PepsiCo raised its adjusted profit forecast for 2017 to $5.13 per share from $5.09, citing lower impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. PepsiCo's shares were little changed in premarket trading on Tuesday.

Scott Thiel, BlackRock's Deputy Chief Investment Officer for global fundamental fixed income, said the money manager was buying option  calls , which entitle it to buy at around current levels rather than through spot purchases.   We remain constructive on sterling around current levels as we believe it is fairly valued, though given the headline risks around Brexit negotiations, our positioning is through buying call options,  Thiel told Reuters on Tuesday. He declined to specify at what rates BlackRock was buying the options, beyond saying it was at  around current levels . Very low global market volatility has also made buying options on the pound far cheaper than they were last year, when sharp price swings were the norm. GBP1MO=   The pound fell by as much as 20 percent in the aftermath of last year's shock vote to leave the European Union, trading as low as $1.15, but it has steadied in recent months and was trading at around $1.2906 on Tuesday.  However, there are still considerable nerves around the currency with surveys showing that major companies have curbed investment plans and consumers spent less on credit cards in anticipation of a rough economic period ahead. A threat by the Bank of England to raise interest rates is also broadly seen as reflecting concerns over the pound's value.  RBC strategists recommended a  short  sterling trade against the U.S. dollar this week, targeting $1.2635, while the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data for the week ending July 3 point to still sizeable short bets against the pound.

All trading systems at the NSE, including price quotations for individual stocks, were operating, with share volumes recovering and the broader NSE index rising as much as 0.6 percent to a second consecutive record high. But brokers said the disruption, the biggest to hit the country's exchanges, had dented confidence in the NSE at a time when its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) had already been halted by a regulatory investigation into whether it provided unfair access to its servers to some brokers. In a letter to employees on Tuesday, NSE Chairman Ashok Chawla acknowledged the exchange had suffered a number of challenges this year, and called the technical glitch on Monday  one more straw on the camel's back . However, he defended the company's response as appropriate, without providing further details on what caused the disruption. Chawla described Monday's problem as a  black swan  event, or something very unusual and difficult to predict.  It unfortunately puts the NSE in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. We have handled this effectively, which is indeed our responsibility as the largest exchange of the country,  Chawla wrote in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The NSE said in a statement trading had been normal on Tuesday and it would  continue to work to improve the systems to avoid any recurrence of such eventualities in the future . The NSE, which is expected to release a detailed report explaining the reason for the disruption, faces criticism for the length of time it took to resolve it, and the conflicting messages to brokers as the exchange tried several times to restart trade. Opportunity for Rivals Some traders said they were looking to open trading accounts with rival BSE Ltd, even though its trading volumes are only a fraction of the NSE's. A third stock exchange, the Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India, widely referred to with its former acronym MCX, has negligible volumes.  It was a matter of great concern,  said Anupam Singhi, chief operating officer of financial firm William O'Neil India.  The onus is now on NSE and how they look into such issues,  he added.  This is an opportunity for BSE and MCX to create some business for themselves.  Others said the exchange needed to be better prepared for disruptions. Reshmi Khurana, managing director at Kroll, said the NSE should respond by conducting a thorough investigation into what went wrong and work to prevent any recurrence including establishing a contingency plan and setting up a crisis team.  The onus is on a company to respond to a crisis,  she said.  Companies need to be more proactive than reactive in order to avoid getting caught out on similar crisis situations.  The NSE - owned by domestic financial institutions such as State Bank of India and units of foreign firms such as Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc - is already under intense regulatory scrutiny. Securities and Exchange Board of India Chairman Ajay Tyagi has said the regulator is seeking to appoint a forensic auditor to investigate whether NSE employees could have colluded with brokers to allow them early access to its brokers. $1 = 64.5600 Indian rupees Additional reporting by Savio Shetty and Aby Jose Koilparambil; Editing by Jacqueline Wong, Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/india-nse-stocks-idUSL4N1K23AX"},

The EU wants an agreement on how the  Brexit bill  will be calculated before launching talks on a free trade agreement. It puts Britain's financial settlement at tens of billions of euros and includes covering a share of future EU budget commitments made while it was a member. Asked by a lawmaker in parliament if the EU should be told to  go whistle  if it wants money from Britain to leave the bloc, Johnson said:  I think that the sums that I have seen ... seem to me to be extortionate and I think go whistle is an entirely appropriate expression.  The phrase means to ask for something with little chance of obtaining it. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she could walk away from the EU without a Brexit agreement if she believed the deal on offer was worse than not reaching any arrangement. Johnson said this was unlikely as it was in the interests of both sides to reach an understanding, but asked to spell out what  no deal  would mean, he said:  There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.

In a speech that focused on the benefits of globalisation, Broadbent warned that less trade with the EU would damage Britain's comparative advantage in exports of financial and business services. At the same time, Britain would end up having to produce more of the things it currently imports from the EU and is less good at creating. Broadbent's comments come after businesses last week pressed Prime Minister Theresa May and her government to negotiate a smooth Brexit when Britain leaves the EU in just under two years' time, saying an abrupt departure would deter trade and investment.  All else equal, the first shift - i.e. away from services exports - would tend to lower UK income, the second to raise certain costs - that is, of food and machinery,  Broadbent said in a speech in Aberdeen to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry.  Trade really is mutually beneficial and less of it costs us all,  Broadbent said.

The decade-long financial crisis left European banks holding nearly 1 trillion euros of non-performing loans (NPLs), reducing their ability to lend and slowing down Europe's economic recovery. The amount of NPLs has slightly decreased over the last months, but at too a slow pace, European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference after the  finance ministers agreed a new plan to tackle the problem.  We need to accelerate our actions , he said, welcoming the ministers' plan.  EU states asked the Commission, which is responsible for proposing legislative changes at EU level, to consider tweaks to banking rules that would increase supervisors' powers and force lenders to raise capital buffers against the risk that loans could turn sour. Dombrovskis said the strategy will include giving bank supervisors more powers to  actively encourage banks to address the problem . Under the plan, the European Central Bank could force banks to increase their buffers against existing NPLs when it deems they are not sufficient. Banks could also be obliged to automatically set aside more capital for new loans when they expect the level of NPLs to grow beyond acceptable levels. Banks warned against measures that could be excessive and unduly increase costs.  Supervisors already have wide-ranging powers to address perceived deficiencies in the banks they supervise,  AFME, a financial lobbying group, said in a statement, arguing that there is no evidence supervisory powers need to be increased. Bad Loan Prices Ministers also proposed measures to improve secondary markets for NPLs, which are currently underdeveloped and provide little incentive for banks to unload their bad credit. Just 80 billion euros of NPLs were sold last year.  Ministers hope that a better-functioning market would push up the price of NPLs, which are currently sold at small percentages of their nominal values, creating huge holes in the balance sheets of banks which offload them. An earlier plan to set up an EU  bad bank  that could have absorbed big chunks of bad debt at higher prices was dropped, in part because EU states with healthier banks, like Germany, are not keen to use taxpayers' money to help lenders in the mostly southern European countries where the bad loan problem is worst. But ministers agreed on Tuesday a more prudent blueprint to set up national  asset management companies  (AMCs) that could help develop the market for bad loans.  Asset management companies set up in Spain and Ireland during the 2008-2012 financial crisis bought bad loans from banks at around 50 percent of their nominal value.  This would be a higher price than the market is ready to pay in Italy, the EU country with the highest level of NPLs in absolute terms, where UniCredit (CRDI.MI), the country's biggest bank, has sold this year 17.7 billion euros of bad loans at average 13 percent of their gross nominal value. But EU officials said the price of bad loans depends on national conditions and recovery time and can vary widely among countries. The commission will set by the end of the year  asset valuation rules  for AMCs.  AMCs could also be turned into national bad banks that acquire bad loans at prices much closer to their nominal value. But this would constitute state aid and would entail strict conditions, the restructuring of the banks that offloaded the bad loans and losses for banks' shareholders and junior bondholders, EU officials said.   Ministers also pushed for changes to national insolvency regimes that would speed up the recovery of bad loans from debtors.

The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States rose to 763 last week, the highest in more than two years, showing that despite oil trading below $50 a barrel, shale oil explorers are still ramping up activity. Halliburton's Mark Richard, senior vice president for global business development and marketing, sees that count rising above 1,000 by the end of the year, but not beyond that.  I think it might level off then. If our customers put too much out there, it's costing too much and putting too much demand on service companies to provide equipment and people,  he told Reuters at an industry event in Istanbul. Oil services companies cut back dramatically when demand for their products fell oil prices started falling in 2014 and it has taken them longer to readjust their output. Richard said he sees 800-900 rigs as a more sustainable level in the medium term. The increase in shale activity has been a boon for companies like Halliburton which supply equipment to the sector and Richard said he had been able to raise prices in the U.S. because of rising demand, but declined to give details. However, appetite for oil and gas equipment is still weak outside of the Americas, Richard said.  We've hit the bottom in the first half of this year. Our customers are getting excited about things but we don't yet see a lot of activity increasing.  Richard denied Halliburton was under additional pressure following the acquisition of rival Baker Hughes, which it failed to buy last year after regulatory opposition, by GE Oil & Gas last week. GE-Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) will leapfrog Halliburton to become  the world's second-biggest oil services company after Schlumberger (SLB.N).  We're number 1 or 2 in every product line we work in today.

In an interview, Meirelles told Valor that he would discuss with lawmakers any aspect of the proposal to create the so-called TLP lending interest rate, but that he will not water down the plan - as BNDES Chief Executive Officer Paulo Rabello de Castro had recently suggested. Last week, two senior BNDES vice presidents quit after Rabello called for adjusting the TLP based on the consumer price index and not the yield on inflation-indexed government debt, as the original plan defends. Meirelles told Rabello by phone on Monday that the plan will stay unchanged, Valor said. Press representatives for the finance ministry and the BNDES did not have an immediate comment. Rabello told Valor that he is  perfectly aligned  with Meirelles on the plan. Replacing the existing TJLP rate with the TLP rate should keep a lid on credit subsidies financed with taxpayer money, potentially cutting borrowing costs as a whole. Furthermore, the TLP could entice capital markets activity and facilitate the pricing and securitization of BNDES loans. The decision to replace the TJLP benchmark was a key step by President Michel Temer's administration to reverse decades of subsidies that have cost taxpayers trillions of reais without a significant effect on long-term growth. BNDES is the largest source of long-term corporate loans in Brazil. The TJLP rate runs below the benchmark overnight lending rate, partly because of an effort by politicians to boost growth and create jobs - costing taxpayers an average 1.5 percent of gross domestic product in recent years. Planning Minister Dyogo Oliveira told Reuters on Monday that the government was not discussing potential changes to the planned TLP rate.

The idea is that as big sell-side houses cut coverage of niche areas, smaller ones can hone in on them.  The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID-II, comes into force in Europe in less than six months and one of the main impacts will be putting an explicit price on research rather than bundling payments along with trading costs. As a result, many brokers are jostling for position on buy-side clients' research lists -- which are likely to shrink as asset managers adapt to paying directly for research.  The equity research environment is bloated -- we are going to find out who the really good houses are,  said Michael Horan, head of trading services at agency broker Pershing Limited. Although there is still significant uncertainty over the impact, most market participants believe there will be significant churn in research analyst staffing levels and a reduction in coverage of small and mid-cap companies in particular. But several houses specializing in mid-caps are responding to this threat by drilling down into their specialty areas in the hope that large brokers retreat from the field, leaving a lucrative gap to fill. For example, private bank Berenberg has added six new analysts to its UK mid-cap team and plan to increase that further by the end of the year. Similarly, British mid-cap specialist house Numis has added two analysts to its team, and European peer Kepler Cheuvreux said it would hire more sector specialists in the coming months.  So far as we are concerned, if small and mid cap coverage thins out a little bit in our core markets, that is just more of an opportunity for us,  said David Mortlock, head of Europe and head of investment banking at Berenberg. Niche or Nothing MiFID research  unbundling  regulations aim to shift the model from  push  -- where brokers relentlessly bombard fund managers with research, hoping some of it sticks -- to  pull . That's when asset managers pick brokers to receive research from, and risk fines if any other analysis lands in their inbox.  Brokerages, as a result, are under pressure to stand out.  â€œThereâ€™s a tremendous contraction of research provider lists going on already,â€� said the head of account management at a European broker. Many have predicted that MiFID will negatively impact coverage of the smaller end of the market, with brokers preferring to concentrate on large stocks which frequently change hands, generating more cash for them. â€œIn those niche areas, we believe that if youâ€™re not in the top two or three (brokers) then you may no longer get onto broker lists,â€� said Hester White, MiFID II spokesperson at Peel Hunt, a UK-focused broker.  Brokers' decisions to increase their focus on small and mid-cap companies could therefore seem counter-intuitive.  But a deeper focus on small- and medium-sized companies is also a response to demand from active asset managers looking to cement their performance so far this year by digging deeper into lesser-known companies and sectors, where bargains are more likely than among extensively covered large cap stocks. Active asset managers are being squeezed by a rapid surge in the popularity of passive index-tracking funds and ETFs, and many say the mid- and small-cap area offers the greatest opportunities to find value as they seek to justify higher fees.  â€œI think managers are going to focus their research dollars where they can make more than they have previously,â€� said Berenberg's Mortlock. Furthermore, unbundling will enable investors to reward brokers specifically for high-quality research, for the first time. Gemma Hurtado de San Leandro, head of Spanish equities at Mirabaud Asset Management, said the regulation would enable her to use large brokers to execute trades fast and efficiently, while rewarding specialized brokers for their research.   There are brokers that have a lot of volume in the market and help me with the execution of trades, but their research doesnâ€™t add value for me at all,â€� she said.  Asset managers see research on these areas as crucial to their ability to bounce ideas off analysts in the know, and be introduced to new companies and investment propositions. Some also set such research apart from global investment bank analyses which they see as too consensual. For small, regional brokers long battling against larger rivals which have enjoyed economies of scale thanks to  bundled  payments, the new rules are a chance to claw back market share. â€œWhat we really like are local brokers,â€� said Thomas Brown, head of the European opportunities fund at Miton. â€œItâ€™s very hard to get a differential view on a stock where thereâ€™s already 36 analysts covering it.â€�  Reporting by Helen Reid Editing by Jeremy Gaunt","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-brokers-mifid-idUSKBN19W18B"},

This shows how Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, aims to retain market share in Asia, the region with the world's strongest demand growth. Saudi Arabia has been cutting exports to Europe and the United States to comply with a production cut deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC countries such as Russia. For August,  there is no (supply) cut  even for heavier grades such as Arab Medium and Heavy crude to south Asian customers, one of the sources said. At least one of the North Asian buyers will also receive full supply of Arab Heavy crude that it has requested. This marks a change from supply cuts to these buyers in the first half this year as Saudi Aramco cut output of cheaper heavy crude to meet its OPEC quota. Saudi Aramco is selling Arab Heavy crude in August at the narrowest discount in more than three years. The OPEC cuts drove up prices of Middle East heavy-sour crude, or grades with a high sulfur content, pushing Asian refiners to seek substitutes from Russia, Africa and the United States.

Western-backed rebels had also hit another Syrian military jet last month, causing it to crash. It was not clear if the plane hit on Tuesday had crashed, said Saad al-Haj, spokesman for Jaish Osoud al-Sharqiya rebel group.  The men targeted the plane, they saw smoke coming out of it,  he said.  It withdrew backwards toward the regime's areas.  There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group, said that the plane was damaged and was forced to come down in the al-Sin military air base in rural Damascus, but that it did not crash.  Ousoud al-Sharqiya is one of the main rebel groups operating in the sparsely populated, southeast Syrian desert known as the Badia, which stretches to the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. A day earlier, Syrian troops and Iranian-backed militias launched an assault on Bedouin villages in the southeast to consolidate control of a swathe of desert stretching to the Iraqi border, Western-backed rebels said.

The mills in Hartlepool employ 140 people and have a production capacity of over 250,000 tonnes a year. Tata Steel, Britain's largest steelmaker, has been selling off parts of its UK business since last year, when it announced talks to merge its British and European steel assets with those of Germany's Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE).  With this sale, Tata Steel UK will complete its portfolio restructuring to focus on the strip products supply chain linked to Port Talbot,  said Bimlendra Jha, CEO of Tata Steel UK.  The sale is also an important step towards developing a more sustainable future for the rest of our UK business.  In February, Tata signed a 100 million pound deal to sell its specialty steel business to Liberty House, saving 1,700 jobs, mostly in South Yorkshire, northern England. Under Tuesday's deal, Tata retained ownership of a tube mill in Hartlepool that is supplied with steel coils from the European steel assets that it wants to retain and merge with Thyssenkrupp. Tata, whose UK business is centered on the steelworks in Port Talbot, Wales, said it will invest 1 million pounds ($1.29 million) in the Hartlepool tube mill, which employs 270 people. Privately-owned Liberty, which plans to list some of its businesses in 2018, has been snapping up distressed steel assets in Britain and around the world, including in the United States and Australia.  This step will inspire investments not only in Hartlepool but also in our upstream plate mill at Dalzell (Scotland), and potentially ... at Whyalla in Australia in due course, to give us a fully-integrated world class capability to supply pipeline projects,  Liberty's Executive Chairman Sanjeev Gupta. The Hartlepool pipe mills make heavy-duty steel pipe for the oil and gas sector.  Liberty, which operates together with energy and commodities business SIMEC under the $9.4 billion Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, said it is in talks to secure a support package to  recruit more staff for the pipe mills business.  Gupta's Liberty House is one of the largest industrial employers in the UK with a workforce of nearly 5,000 people. Following Tuesday's deal, Tata remains the largest UK steelmaker with a workforce of 8,500 people. The UK steel sector is emerging from a crisis that saw some 5,000 jobs, a fifth of the workforce, axed in 2015/16. It is estimated that for every steel job saved, four jobs are retained in related industries.  Gupta first hit the headlines last year when he offered to rescue all the distressed UK steel plants owned by Tata, but the Indian group eventually decided against selling its entire UK business in favor of a tie-up with Thyssenkrupp. Editing by David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tata-steel-divestiture-libertyhouse-idUSKBN19W0XT"},

This shows how Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, aims to retain market share in Asia, the region with the world's strongest demand growth. Saudi Arabia has been cutting exports to Europe and the United States to comply with a production cut deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC countries such as Russia. For August,  there is no (supply) cut  even for heavier grades such as Arab Medium and Heavy crude to south Asian customers, one of the sources said. At least one of the North Asian buyers will also receive full supply of Arab Heavy crude that it has requested. This marks a change from supply cuts to these buyers in the first half this year as Saudi Aramco cut output of cheaper heavy crude to meet its OPEC quota. Saudi Aramco is selling Arab Heavy crude in August at the narrowest discount in more than three years. The OPEC cuts drove up prices of Middle East heavy-sour crude, or grades with a high sulfur content, pushing Asian refiners to seek substitutes from Russia, Africa and the United States.  Last week, India bought its first ever U.S. crude and its refiners plan to buy more. Saudi continues to supply slightly more light oil to Japan, one of the sources said. Saudi Arabia has increased its market share in Japan, its biggest Asian market, in the first half this year.

With the expectations fuelled by increasingly robust-looking global growth, MSCI's 47-country All World share index was up for a third day running, though it was forced to cling on as Europe's main bourses faltered despite a fresh flurry of M&A activity. They were unsettled by some heavy falls among defensive consumer staples and property stocks, a dip in the commodity sector as oil stumbled and as futures markets pointed to flat start to U.S. trading for Wall Street. Treasuries and benchmark European bond yields resumed their march upwards, having paused on Monday, as the focus shifted back to the pace of monetary tightening in the world's largest economies. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen starts two days of testimony on Wednesday as it prepares to unwind the massive hoard of bonds it bought to ease the financial crisis, while top ECB and Bank of England policymakers were due to speak in Europe on Tuesday. Germany's 10-year yield edged up 2 basis points to 0.56 percent having more than doubled over the last few weeks. The South African rand, Turkish lira and Russia rouble all dropped around 1 percent as some unusually concentrated selling resumed to emerging markets too. Roger Webb, Head of European Credit at Aberdeen Asset Management said slightly stronger-than-expected global growth numbers recently had boosted expectations of higher interest rates.  I think the increased hawkishness we have seen from the central banks has led to a fear that we could see a mini-taper tantrum,  he said.  I don't think there is too much alarm. I think the move to slightly higher yields in Europe and the U.S., UK and elsewhere is probably understandable.  The dollar ground higher against most major currencies, including to a four-month high of 114.43 yen as traders played the past fortnight's 25 basis-point rise in U.S. government bond yields against the Bank of Japan's vow to keep its stimulus flowing. The New Zealand dollar fell to its lowest in over two weeks meanwhile after an 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country's south island. The Canadian dollar was down slightly too as investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision on Wednesday which could be its first hike since the financial crisis. Forecasters are still divided on whether it will pull the trigger, but money markets seem convinced it will and are also 80 percent priced for a follow-up rise by December. Fine China vs Toxic Trio In commodities, crude oil slipped back after pushing higher overnight in Asia. Increased drilling activity in the United States and uncertainty over Libyan and Nigerian production cuts clouded the future supply outlook, leaving U.S. crude down a third of a dollar at $44.13 a barrel and Brent at $46.57. BNP Paribas slashed its forecasts for Brent by $9 to $51 a barrel for 2017 and by $15 to $48 for 2018. Barclays also cut its 2017 and 2018 Brent forecasts to $52 a barrel. Gold edged lower to $1,212.13 an ounce as it headed back towards a four-month low and copper dipped too as the prospect of a strike at one of Chile's big mines failed to offset data showing a rapid build-up of inventories. Stainless steel ingredient nickel, however, gained after Chinese steel prices reached their highest in 3-1/2 years. That came as bluechip Chinese stocks also hit an 18-month high as investors chased firms with stronger fundamentals and the central bank resumed liquidity injections having kept the taps closed for last 12 sessions. Other emerging markets heavyweights were on the ropes though. South Africa's rand hit a two-month low while Turkey's lira and Russia's rouble both lost almost 1 percent to trade just off recent respective 2-1/2 month and six-month lows. They have become a new 'toxic trio' for traders having been hammered over the last few weeks despite other major EM currencies, such the Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Polish zloty, all faring relatively well.  We have been emphasising the fundamental weakness of the South African macro story for some time, and believe that market pricing on ZAR (the rand) showed a degree of complacency that in part was explained by low G3 bond yields,  analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note.  It is thus not much of a surprise that it is the worst-performing EM currency now that liquidity conditions look less supportive.

The mills in Hartlepool employ 140 people and have a production capacity of over 250,000 tonnes a year. Tata Steel, Britain's largest steelmaker, has been selling off parts of its UK business since last year, when it announced talks to merge its British and European steel assets with those of Germany's Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE).  With this sale, Tata Steel UK will complete its portfolio restructuring to focus on the strip products supply chain linked to Port Talbot,  said Bimlendra Jha, CEO of Tata Steel UK.  The sale is also an important step towards developing a more sustainable future for the rest of our UK business.  In February, Tata signed a 100 million pound deal to sell its specialty steel business to Liberty House, saving 1,700 jobs, mostly in South Yorkshire, northern England. Under Tuesday's deal, Tata retained ownership of a tube mill in Hartlepool that is supplied with steel coils from the European steel assets that it wants to retain and merge with Thyssenkrupp. Tata, whose UK business is centered on the steelworks in Port Talbot, Wales, said it will invest 1 million pounds ($1.29 million) in the Hartlepool tube mill, which employs 270 people. Privately-owned Liberty, which plans to list some of its businesses in 2018, has been snapping up distressed steel assets in Britain and around the world, including in the United States and Australia.  This step will inspire investments not only in Hartlepool but also in our upstream plate mill at Dalzell (Scotland), and potentially ... at Whyalla in Australia in due course, to give us a fully-integrated world class capability to supply pipeline projects,  Liberty's Executive Chairman Sanjeev Gupta. The Hartlepool pipe mills make heavy-duty steel pipe for the oil and gas sector.  Liberty, which operates together with energy and commodities business SIMEC under the $9.4 billion Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance, said it is in talks to secure a support package to  recruit more staff for the pipe mills business.  Gupta's Liberty House is one of the largest industrial employers in the UK with a workforce of nearly 5,000 people. Following Tuesday's deal, Tata remains the largest UK steelmaker with a workforce of 8,500 people. The UK steel sector is emerging from a crisis that saw some 5,000 jobs, a fifth of the workforce, axed in 2015/16. It is estimated that for every steel job saved, four jobs are retained in related industries.  Gupta first hit the headlines last year when he offered to rescue all the distressed UK steel plants owned by Tata, but the Indian group eventually decided against selling its entire UK business in favor of a tie-up with Thyssenkrupp. Editing by David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/tata-steel-divestiture-libertyhouse-idUSL4N1K23M5"},

Olympic values are our values. They are threatened, called into question by many today, so it's the best moment to defend them,  Macron told reporters after the city presented its bid to the International Olympic Committee. Paris is competing against Los Angeles, publicly backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom Macron has criticised for taking his country out of the Paris accord on climate change. Macron was the first head of state to attend the formal presentation of Olympic bids; Trump was not present. Paris, which hosted the 1900 and 1924 Games, failed with bids to host the 1992, 2008 and 2012 Olympics.  You are right to remember that we lost three times. We don't want to lose a fourth one,  Macron said.  I decided from the very beginning of my mandate to back this project and give the maximum to promote this candidature.  The IOC was due to vote later on Tuesday on whether to ratify its executive board's recommendation to award both the 2024 and 2028 Games at the same time, on Sept. 13. Paris is seen as the favourite to land the 2024 Olympics, with Los Angeles having hinted it would accept 2028. Los Angeles, like Paris, has already hosted the Olympics twice - in 1932 and 1984.  I am here to convey a message that the French people are ready,  said Macron.  I would not be here if they were not ready.  Paris is proposing a compact Games with almost every venue temporary or already in place. But it still needs to build an athletes' village, the biggest project of the bid. Macron said Paris would not be leaving any  white elephants  behind.

The German industrial group supplied the turbines for a project in Russia but said on Monday that at least two of them had been moved to Crimea without its knowledge and against its will, confirming an exclusive Reuters report. Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 in what the European Union considers a breach of international law.  We have to think what this means for our relations to Russia,  the company source said, asking not to be named because of the delicacy of the matter.  We can't simply go back to business as usual.   One has to keep a cool head but act responsibly,  the person said on Tuesday.  There must be a certain effect on particular connections.  The source declined to say whether this could affect Siemens' joint venture with Russian Power Machines, Siemens Gas Turbine Technologies LLC, which built the turbines that have ended up in Crimea. A spokesman for Siemens declined to comment. Germany's ambassador said that Russia will have seriously hurt its prospects for investment if it is confirmed that the Siemens-made turbines have been delivered to Crimea, Interfax news agency reported. Siemens said on Monday it would press criminal charges over the moving of its turbines from Russia to Crimea, and would seek to have them returned to Taman, their original destination.  Siemens insists categorically on full compliance with all export control restrictions for itself and also at its partners and customers. In addition, Siemens is evaluating what additional actions are possible,  it said. Siemens made about 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in sales in Russia last year, roughly 2 percent of its total revenue. It is active primarily in energy and transportation and has said it indirectly employs 48,000 people in the country. Chief Executive Joe Kaeser met President Vladimir Putin several times in his first year after becoming CEO in 2013, and attracted wide criticism for a visit just after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. At the time, he reaffirmed his commitment to Russia, where Siemens has been present for almost 170 years and has invested about a billion euros ($1.14 billion) in the past decade, saying the relationship would not be sidetracked by  short-term turbulence .

Government policymakers and industry executives will meet on Tuesday in Brasilia to decide on a final version before sending it for congressional approval. They must agree on a deadline for homebuyer refunds and fines on cancellations of low-income homes. JosÃ© Carlos Martins, president of Brazilian building lobby group CBIC, termed the current draft as  the closest that both the government and homebuilders have been in terms of an accord on this, but the hurdle to it remains the ongoing political crisis.  Homebuilders have suffered from soaring cancellations during Brazil's worse recession on record. Without legislation, courts have sometimes ruled in favor of giving buyers a refund of all or part of the down payment if they cancel a purchase. The meeting, scheduled for 11:00 a.m. local time (1400 GMT), comes as a Brazilian lower house committee is examining a corruption charge against President Michel Temer and could vote this week to put him on trial. A full house vote would follow. The office of Temer's chief of staff did not comment. The charge, the first leveled against a sitting president in Brazil, marked another twist in a three-year probe that has revealed massive corruption in Latin America's largest economy. Temer, a third of his cabinet, two past presidents and dozens of lawmakers are either on trial or face charges for corruption. Details Under preliminary terms, the government would back a 20 percent fine on cancellations plus broker fees for homes worth up to 300,000 reais ($92,000), groups said. Builders want a lower threshold, of 235,000 reais. The fines cannot top 5 percent of the value of the contract. For homes worth above that threshold, a 50 percent fine plus fees could be imposed, Martins said. Fines cannot surpass 10 percent of the value of a contract.

Citing three people with knowledge of the email, the paper said publicist Rob Goldstone indicated in the message to U.S. President Donald Trump's eldest son that the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information. Trump Jr did not indicate in a statement on Sunday that he had been told the lawyer might be a proxy for the Kremlin. The email is likely to be of interest to investigators examining whether any Trump associates colluded with the Russian government to sway last year's election, the Times said. Trump Jr. hired a lawyer on Monday to represent him in the Russia-related investigations as prominent Republicans voiced concern about the meeting between the president's son and a Russian. Allegations of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia have cast a shadow over the Republican president's first months in office and sparked investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel, Robert Mueller, into whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with the Trump campaign.  Moscow denies interfering and Trump, who became president on Jan. 20, says there was no collusion.  Itâ€™s a very serious development,  Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC of the Times report.  It all warrants thorough investigation. Everyone who was in that meeting ought to come before our committee.  Trump Jr. hired New York lawyer Alan Futerfas, who specializes in criminal defense and whose clients have included alleged organized crime figures, a Russian computer hacker and white-collar criminals.  I look forward to assisting Donald Jr. and, quite frankly, there is nothing to all of the media buzz about the June 9th, 2016 meeting,  Futerfas told Reuters.  That will be proven to be the case.  Futerfas would not say when he was retained or whether he played any part in the statements Trump Jr. made during the weekend about his June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, during the presidential election campaign. FILE PHOTO: Donald Trump Jr. gives a television interview at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio U.S. July 19, 2016.Mark Kauzlarich/File photoTrump Jr. said he agreed to meet Veselnitskaya, described by the New York Times as having links to the Kremlin, after being promised damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.     Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Trump's then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also attended, the Times said. It called the encounter the first confirmed private meeting of members of Donald Trump's inner circle with a Russian national during the campaign. A Republican member of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Susan Collins, called on Trump Jr. to testify before the panel, which is looking into accusations of Russian meddling in the election.  Our intelligence committee needs to interview him and others who attended the meeting,  she told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. Slideshow (4 Images)Panel May Speak to Trump Jr. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, said it  absolutely  wanted to speak to Trump Jr. about the meeting. Warner said he and the Republican committee chairman, Richard Burr, would decide later whether to ask Trump Jr. to testify in public or in a classified setting. Burr would not say if the committee would talk to Trump Jr., but he told reporters the panel would look into the purpose of the meeting, who set it up and how the process unfolded before making a decision on who to interview.  The committee will see everybody we think has value,  Burr said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said there was nothing inappropriate about the meeting with lawyer Veselnitskaya.  Don Junior took a very short meeting from which there was absolutely no follow-up,  Sanders told reporters. In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday the Kremlin did not know the identity of the Russian lawyer.  No, we don't know who it is and, certainly, we cannot track down all movements of all Russian lawyers both within Russia and abroad,  Peskov said.                    Goldstone said he arranged the meeting at the request of singer and businessman Emin Agalarov, a Moscow-based client of his. He told Trump Jr. the meeting was with a Russian lawyer who apparently claimed to have information regarding illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee.

Temasek joined bigger state fund GIC [GIC.UL] and Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] in flagging intense competition from global funds for deals, which is pushing up valuations and threatening to drag down returns.  Looking ahead, we remain cautiously positive on global growth. But we are also cognizant of risks in valuations, liquidity and politics,  Michael Buchanan, Temasek's head of strategy, said at an annual news conference on Tuesday. Temasek's assets rose 14 percent to S$275 billion ($199 billion) in the year ended March, after falling 9 percent a year ago. Its long-held investments in financials, such as China Construction Bank (0939.HK), DBS Group (DBSM.SI) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L), paid off last year as equity markets surged. MSCI's Asia shares ex-Japan index .MIAPJ0000PUS jumped about 15 percent last year. Temasek's one-year total shareholder return swung to 13.4 percent, from a negative 9 percent for the prior year. However, given  the valuation consideration as well as perhaps more competition for transactions, we reduced our pace of investments quite a fair bit , said Chia Song Hwee, joint head of Temasek's investment group. Temasek invested S$16 billion in the year that just ended, versus S$30 billion in each of the past two years, and divested S$18 billion - resulting in a net divestment position for the first time since the year to March 2009. Its investments are mostly in equities and it is the top investor in a third of companies in Singapore's benchmark index .STI. The city-state and China represent the largest share in Temasek's portfolio by underlying exposure. Under CEO Ho Ching, the wife of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Temasek has expanded to become a global investor. In the last few years, it has poured cash into faster-growing sectors such as technology, life sciences and healthcare.  Stretched Valuations It invested $800 million in Verily Life Sciences and expanded its investment in Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (STEL.SI) over the year to March 2017. Among divestments, Temasek sold its S$2.3 billion stake in shipper Neptune Orient Lines. It also pared its stakes in China Construction Bank (0939.HK), Alibaba (BABA.N) and Univar but retains significant exposure to these companies. Company executives said they expect to clinch more private and negotiated deals. Currently, unlisted assets account for about 40 percent of Temasek's portfolio. Temasek, however, struck a cautious note and said high market valuations meant it was finding it tougher to strike deals that would make enough returns to hit internal targets, echoing a similar view from GIC earlier this week. GIC, which reported a higher portfolio return over the five years to March 31, expects returns to slow over the next decade, due to high valuations, uncertainty over monetary policy and modest economic growth. CIC also cited rising uncertainties of global politics and policies as potential risks to the outlook for this year.  For most of the markets, the forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently pretty close to the historical 5-year maximum levels, suggesting that valuations are a bit stretched relative to their recent history,  said Temasek's Buchanan.

The bank said in a statement its first-half net profit hit a record 6.7 billion Qatari riyals ($1.8 billion), up about 7 percent from 6.25 billion a year earlier as loans grew 11 percent. The results were the first since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt on June 5 decided to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and impose economic sanctions on it. The bank did not say anything new about the rift. On June 14, QNB said it had seen no significant outflows of deposits since the rift started, adding it had a  robust  liquidity position. The bank reported a net profit of around 3.5 billion riyals in the three months to June 30, compared with 3.38 billion riyals in the corresponding period of 2016, according to its detailed results. Three analysts polled by Reuters had on average forecast a quarterly net profit of 3.027 billion riyals. Net impairment losses on loans and advances to customers fell to 221.68 million riyals, from 1.057 billion riyals a year earlier. Qatar's biggest bank said it was able to attract more deposits in the first half, which boosted customer funding by 15 percent from a year earlier. The loan to deposit ratio hit 98.3 percent compared with 101.7 percent in June 2016.  This clearly demonstrates the success of QNBâ€™s strategy to diversify its funding sources,  it said. The statement could reassure investors concerned about Qatari banks' dependence on foreign funding. Thirty-six percent of commercial banks' total liabilities in May were to foreigners, including others in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), although analysts say QNB's funding sources are more diversified than others. Moody's Investors Service last week changed the outlook on QNB's deposit ratings to negative from stable following a shift in the outlook for the government. Moody's cited a weakening domestic operating environment, particularly for bank funding, and a reduced capacity of the Qatar government to support banks as reasons for the change.

Last week Munich prosecutors arrested an Audi employee in connection with  dieselgate , the latest setback to Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) luxury car arm and main profit driver, after the German government a month earlier had accused Audi of cheating on emissions tests. On Tuesday Audi shifted the focus back to its products with its top management hosting 2,000 guests in Barcelona to unveil the new A8, whose Level-3 self-driving technology enables the car to completely control driving at up to 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour, beating the Mercedes S-Class and the BMW 7-Series. Having slipped behind its two German rivals on global sales last year, Audi has risked stalling without innovation and needed a new prestige product, said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.  Innovation is key in premium car-making,  Bratzel said.  The new A8 will polish the brand's image and line-up at a critical time.  Even Audi acknowledged that amid ongoing investigations, persistent pressure on its chief executive for his crisis management and analysts' criticism of Audi's ageing vehicle design, the new A8 creates an opportunity for a clean break.  It's gratifying that we are able to set a positive sign for real 'Vorsprung durch Technik', advancement through technology,  R&D chief Peter Mertens said. Mercedes and BMW have accelerated their autonomous-driving development programs with Mercedes owner Daimler joining forces with car parts maker Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] in April and BMW collaborating with other firms including U.S. parts maker Delphi and chipmaker Intel. Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler presents the new Audi A8 at the Audi Summit in Barcelona, Spain July 11, 2017.Albert GeaFeaturing a more distinctive design and a foot massager for rear-seat passengers, the new A8 heralds the start of a series of redesigns and new model launches at Audi including an electric sport-utility vehicle (SUV) to take on Tesla's Model X, the all-new Q4 and Q8 SUVs and redesigned A6 and A7 model lines. A source at Audi said development of the A8, which took about five years, suffered from changes at the brand's research and development department, though assiduous work by division heads helped ensure that delays were kept in check. The A8 will reach German dealerships in the fourth quarter. Slideshow (21 Images)Audi is on its third development chief since dieselgate broke in late 2015, with Mertens, who took office in May, the brand's fifth R&D boss since 2012.  The top brass at VW group and Audi are so preoccupied with the diesel issue that the company's management is lastingly distracted,  said Christian Strenger, a supervisory board member at Deutsche Bank's retail asset management arm DWS. With the new A8's retail price up almost 8 percent on its  predecessor at 90,600 euros ($103,000), Audi will also struggle to narrow the gap with its traditional rivals, research firm IHS Markit said. A8 sales in the core markets of Europe, China and the Americas may climb 3.2 percent to 35,571 cars by 2025 from 34,468 next year, IHS said. By comparison, IHS expects deliveries of BMW's 7-Series to fall 7.6 percent to 52,238 cars by 2025 and deliveries of Mercedes' S-Class to jump 24 percent to 85,389 cars. S-Class and 7-Series prices start at 88,447 euros and 78,100 euros respectively, according to company data.

A sharp drop in crude prices since mid-2014 has forced the oil industry to cut costs and look for ways to boost efficiency amid competition from new producers such as U.S. shale firms. The move by ADNOC, regarded as one of the most conservative among Middle East oil producers, is part of a wider shake-up at the state-run firm, which is seeking to become more competitive under a new management appointed last year. On Monday, ADNOC said it could float some of its services businesses and partner global investors to help it secure better market access at a time when its budget is being stretched by low oil prices. Four industry sources told Reuters ADNOC had held talks over the past year with oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Total as well as the world's biggest trading house Vitol on setting up a joint venture to trade oil and products. Shell, Total and Vitol declined to comment. ADNOC declined official comment on plans for ventures. Increasingly, Middle Eastern producers are looking into the viability of running their own trading firms. In May, trading sources told Reuters Iraq's state oil marketer SOMO had teamed up with Russia's LUKOIL in a venture in Dubai to market crude.  ADNOC is exploring a potential establishment of a trading arm but the structure is yet to be decided,  one industry source familiar with discussions said. ADNOC has been studying whether to set up a unit such as Saudi Arabia's Aramco Trading, which markets refined products, base oils and bulk petrochemicals, or follow the model of Oman, which trades both crude and products, industry sources said.  It all fits with the ongoing transformation of the organisation to try to make it much more commercially focused to drive revenue and profit,  the first source said. Discussions, which have continued for several months, are focusing on the best trading model with majors and traders asking for an equity stake in a venture similar to a model used by Iraq and Oman. The other option would be to split profits without giving a foreign partner equity stakes.  Western companies are less keen on profit sharing as there is no guarantee of profits in the first years of operations,  a second source familiar with discussions said. Oman was the first Middle Eastern producer to set up trading with a 50/50 venture with Vitol last decade. The venture, Oman Trading International, was ultimately bought out by the government and is currently fully owned by Oman Oil. Last year, ADNOC reshuffled its leadership, in a major shake-up after the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber as chief executive. It consolidated the operations of two oil companies into a new entity, and its shipping, marine and services companies into one firm in order to increase efficiency.

Temasek joined bigger state fund GIC [GIC.UL] and Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] in flagging intense competition from global funds for deals, which is pushing up valuations and threatening to drag down returns.  Looking ahead, we remain cautiously positive on global growth. But we are also cognizant of risks in valuations, liquidity and politics,  Michael Buchanan, Temasek's head of strategy, said at an annual news conference on Tuesday. Temasek's assets rose 14 percent to S$275 billion ($199 billion) in the year ended March, after falling 9 percent a year ago. Its long-held investments in financials, such as China Construction Bank (0939.HK), DBS Group (DBSM.SI) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L), paid off last year as equity markets surged. MSCI's Asia shares ex-Japan index .MIAPJ0000PUS jumped about 15 percent last year. Temasek's one-year total shareholder return swung to 13.4 percent, from a negative 9 percent for the prior year. However, given  the valuation consideration as well as perhaps more competition for transactions, we reduced our pace of investments quite a fair bit , said Chia Song Hwee, joint head of Temasek's investment group. Temasek invested S$16 billion in the year that just ended, versus S$30 billion in each of the past two years, and divested S$18 billion - resulting in a net divestment position for the first time since the year to March 2009. Its investments are mostly in equities and it is the top investor in a third of companies in Singapore's benchmark index .STI. The city-state and China represent the largest share in Temasek's portfolio by underlying exposure. Under CEO Ho Ching, the wife of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Temasek has expanded to become a global investor. In the last few years, it has poured cash into faster-growing sectors such as technology, life sciences and healthcare.  Stretched Valuations It invested $800 million in Verily Life Sciences and expanded its investment in Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (STEL.SI) over the year to March 2017. Among divestments, Temasek sold its S$2.3 billion stake in shipper Neptune Orient Lines. It also pared its stakes in China Construction Bank (0939.HK), Alibaba (BABA.N) and Univar but retains significant exposure to these companies. Company executives said they expect to clinch more private and negotiated deals. Currently, unlisted assets account for about 40 percent of Temasek's portfolio. Temasek, however, struck a cautious note and said high market valuations meant it was finding it tougher to strike deals that would make enough returns to hit internal targets, echoing a similar view from GIC earlier this week. GIC, which reported a higher portfolio return over the five years to March 31, expects returns to slow over the next decade, due to high valuations, uncertainty over monetary policy and modest economic growth. CIC also cited rising uncertainties of global politics and policies as potential risks to the outlook for this year.  For most of the markets, the forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently pretty close to the historical 5-year maximum levels, suggesting that valuations are a bit stretched relative to their recent history,  said Temasek's Buchanan.

The issue ratings on Kenya's senior unsecured foreign-currency bonds are also affirmed at 'B+'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'BB-' and the Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'B'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'B+' ratings reflect Kenya's solid growth record, strong medium-term growth potential, and favourable business environment. However, the ratings are constrained by Kenya's low GDP per capita, sizeable current account and budget deficits, and political risks. Fitch forecasts GDP growth to slow to 5.4% in 2017, down from the 5.8% outturn in 2016. In 1Q17, growth slowed to 4.7% year on year, as the agricultural sector contracted 1.1% due to drought conditions. Slowing credit growth and uncertainty around the August elections are also weighing on the economy. However, Fitch continues to assess Kenya's medium-term growth potential as strong, sustained by improved security that has fuelled a recovery in tourism and high public spending that supports the construction sector. Fitch's baseline scenario envisages some limited disruption around the 8 August general elections, in which incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta and his ruling Jubilee coalition will face opposition candidate Raila Odinga, who leads the newly constituted National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition. Odinga has been a candidate for the presidency three times previously, including in 2007 when protests of the outcome of the election triggered widespread ethnic and political violence. We do not foresee violence at the level of 2007; however, the opposition's frequent disputes with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Committee raise the prospect that an NASA loss could lead to protests. In addition to presidential and parliamentary elections, Kenyans will also go to the polls to select governors and representatives for the 47 counties established by Kenya's 2010 Constitution. The devolution of a greater share of fiscal and political power to the counties could be a touchpoint for an increase in violence at the local level. Fiscal consolidation has yet to begin. Fitch estimates that the general government deficit in the fiscal year that ended in June 2017 widened to 8.3% of GDP, above both the government's revised target of 6.9%, published in the Medium Term 2017 Budget Policy Statement and the 7.5% outturn in FY16. The deterioration in the fiscal deficit relative to the prior year was largely due to an increase in execution of capital expenditure to fund ongoing infrastructure projects, including the just-completed Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway, and election-related current expenditure. General government expenditure was an estimated 29.4% of GDP in FY17, up from an average of 25.2% in the previous five years. Kenya's FY17/18 Budget signals that the government plans to shrink the deficit and prioritise public debt sustainability. Fitch forecasts the fiscal deficit to narrow to 6.4% of GDP in FY18, as expenditure falls closer to average historical levels and improvements to revenue administration and collection begin to show results. Fitch's forecast is more conservative than the government's budget target of 6% of GDP, reflecting downside risks from slower-than- expected growth and lower revenue collection. General government debt reached 56% of GDP at FY17 (measured by the nominal value of debt), a level comparable to 'B' rated peers; however, debt servicing costs consume an outsized portion of Kenya's revenue. Both total debt and interest payments as a percentage of revenue, at 262% and 16.5% respectively, are higher than the 'B' medians of 227% and 9.6%. The key downside risk to public debt sustainability would be the government's inability to implement the fiscal consolidation envisaged in the FY17/18 Budget and the Medium Term Expenditure Framework. Over the medium term, the failure to translate newly built infrastructure into private sector growth and higher tax revenue would also be a threat to fiscal consolidation and to debt sustainability. The drop in agricultural output has contributed to higher food prices and pushed inflation higher so far in 2017. Headline inflation peaked at 11.7% in May, before falling to 9.2% in June, well above the Central Bank of Kenya's (CBK) 5%/-2.5% inflation target. The CBK will likely hold off on further monetary easing until inflationary pressures subside. Fitch forecasts the current account deficit will widen slightly to 5.8% of GDP in 2017 from 5.6% in 2016, but will remain well below the average of 9.2% recorded in 2011 to 2015. Lower oil prices, higher remittance flows and stabilising capital imports have all contributed to the narrowing current account deficit. Kenya's continued compliance with its IMF stand-by arrangement, which would make up to USD1.5  billion available in the event of a negative balance of payments shock. The Kenyan banking sector is highly fragmented, with large domestic banks characterised by healthy funding and balance-sheet liquidity and small banks, into which we have little insight. Asset quality has deteriorated, with non-performing loans rising to 10% of total loans as of end-April 2017 from 6% at end-2015. Additionally, the full effects of the interest rate cap that was instituted in September 2016 have yet to become clear, but initial indications show evidence of credit rationing. Initial results suggest that the cap has had a marginal downward effect on credit growth, particularly in credit to SMEs and other high-risk segments of the credit market. Overall private sector credit growth has slowed further, to 3.3% at end-March 2017, continuing a trend in place since 2015 when it grew 17.8%. Kenya has continued to improve its rank in the World Bank's Doing Business Index, rising to 92 in the 2017 ranking from 113 in the previous year. However, structural factors constrain the rating. The country is in the 22nd percentile of the UN Human Development Index. Kenya's governance indicators are weaker than the 'B' range median. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Kenya a score equivalent to a rating of 'B+' on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee did not adjust the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year-centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that could individually, or collectively, trigger a downgrade are: - Failure to implement planned fiscal consolidation and stabilise government debt/GDP; - Deterioration in the political or security environment undermining Kenya's long-term growth performance; - Widening of the current account deficit that stresses macroeconomic stability and leads to significant foreign exchange reserves drawdown. The Outlook is Negative. Consequently, Fitch does not currently anticipate developments with a high likelihood of leading to positive rating action. Developments that could, individually or collectively, result in the Outlook to being revised to Stable include: - Effective implementation of fiscal consolidation plans and stabilisation of government debt/GDP; - A longer track record of prudent economic management and successful implementation of structural reforms that foster an improved business environment and faster economic growth.

The idea is that as big sell-side houses cut coverage of niche areas, smaller ones can hone in on them.  The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID-II, comes into force in Europe in less than six months and one of the main impacts will be putting an explicit price on research rather than bundling payments along with trading costs. As a result, many brokers are jostling for position on buy-side clients' research lists -- which are likely to shrink as asset managers adapt to paying directly for research.  The equity research environment is bloated -- we are going to find out who the really good houses are,  said Michael Horan, head of trading services at agency broker Pershing Limited. Although there is still significant uncertainty over the impact, most market participants believe there will be significant churn in research analyst staffing levels and a reduction in coverage of small and mid-cap companies in particular. But several houses specializing in mid-caps are responding to this threat by drilling down into their specialty areas in the hope that large brokers retreat from the field, leaving a lucrative gap to fill. For example, private bank Berenberg has added six new analysts to its UK mid-cap team and plan to increase that further by the end of the year. Similarly, British mid-cap specialist house Numis has added two analysts to its team, and European peer Kepler Cheuvreux said it would hire more sector specialists in the coming months.  So far as we are concerned, if small and mid cap coverage thins out a little bit in our core markets, that is just more of an opportunity for us,  said David Mortlock, head of Europe and head of investment banking at Berenberg. Niche or Nothing MiFID research  unbundling  regulations aim to shift the model from  push  -- where brokers relentlessly bombard fund managers with research, hoping some of it sticks -- to  pull . That's when asset managers pick brokers to receive research from, and risk fines if any other analysis lands in their inbox.  Brokerages, as a result, are under pressure to stand out.  â€œThereâ€™s a tremendous contraction of research provider lists going on already,â€� said the head of account management at a European broker. Many have predicted that MiFID will negatively impact coverage of the smaller end of the market, with brokers preferring to concentrate on large stocks which frequently change hands, generating more cash for them. â€œIn those niche areas, we believe that if youâ€™re not in the top two or three (brokers) then you may no longer get onto broker lists,â€� said Hester White, MiFID II spokesperson at Peel Hunt, a UK-focused broker.  Brokers' decisions to increase their focus on small and mid-cap companies could therefore seem counter-intuitive.  But a deeper focus on small- and medium-sized companies is also a response to demand from active asset managers looking to cement their performance so far this year by digging deeper into lesser-known companies and sectors, where bargains are more likely than among extensively covered large cap stocks. Active asset managers are being squeezed by a rapid surge in the popularity of passive index-tracking funds and ETFs, and many say the mid- and small-cap area offers the greatest opportunities to find value as they seek to justify higher fees.  â€œI think managers are going to focus their research dollars where they can make more than they have previously,â€� said Berenberg's Mortlock. Furthermore, unbundling will enable investors to reward brokers specifically for high-quality research, for the first time. Gemma Hurtado de San Leandro, head of Spanish equities at Mirabaud Asset Management, said the regulation would enable her to use large brokers to execute trades fast and efficiently, while rewarding specialized brokers for their research.   There are brokers that have a lot of volume in the market and help me with the execution of trades, but their research doesnâ€™t add value for me at all,â€� she said.  Asset managers see research on these areas as crucial to their ability to bounce ideas off analysts in the know, and be introduced to new companies and investment propositions. Some also set such research apart from global investment bank analyses which they see as too consensual.

A Joint Investigation Team (JIT), set up by the Supreme Court to investigate corruption allegations that surfaced following the Panama Papers leak, spent two months looking into the family's wealth and gave its finding to the court on Monday. In their report, which has been leaked to media, the team alleges Sharif's family accumulated wealth far above its earnings, and says his children, including heir-apparent Maryam Sharif, signed falsified documents designed to mask the truth. Opposition leader Imran Khan said Sharif had  lost all moral authority  and must resign immediately. But Sharif's allies dismissed all the allegations against him and the report.  It's trash,  said Defence Minister Asif Khawaja, adding that the report was  full of flaws . Sharif, the son of an industrialist, has denied wrongdoing and said his family's wealth was acquired legally. In April, the Supreme Court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to remove Sharif from office - by a split 2-3 verdict - but it ordered further investigations, which the JIT was set up to carry out. Sharif's daughter Maryam was not available for comment but she also dismissed the report in a post on Twitter.  JIT report REJECTED. Every contradiction will not only be contested but decimated in SC,  she wrote, referring to the Supreme Court. The investigation has spooked investors in Pakistan's equity market, with the benchmark index in retreat since June over fears Sharif's removal would plunge Pakistan back into chaos after years of relative stability. The index opened sharply lower on Tuesday and fell 4.65 percent by the close to end at 44,120.58.  After this JIT report, the prime ministerâ€™s position has weakened and becomes unpredictable. He may have to leave,  Talat Masood, a political analyst, told Reuters. Maryam Nawaz daughter of Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif leaves along with her brothers Hussain Nawaz (L) and Hussan Nawaz (2nd L) after appearing before a Joint Investigation Team (JIT)  investigating Sharif family's wealth in Islamabad, Pakistan July 5, 2017.Faisal Mahmood'Volatility Expected' Pakistan has for decades been plagued by rivalry between the military and civilian politicians and by pervasive graft. Sharif was originally nurtured by the military and served as prime minister twice in the 1990s before he himself was ousted in a 1999 coup leading to a decade of exile. He won a third term as prime minister in a 2013 election. Since then, periods of tension between him and the powerful military have led to questions about his prospects. His brother, Shabaz Sharif, is chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous and economically and politically most important province. The team in its 254-page report alleges the family's businesses alone are not enough to explain its wealth, which includes upscale London flats. The team recommended the anti-corruption National Accountancy Bureau (NAB) file a case against Sharif, according to a copy of the report seen by Reuters, as well as reporting by Dawn newspaper and other media. That would likely undermine investor confidence even more.  The market has taken the suggestions of an NAB investigation and the overall JIT report as a negative,  said Saad Hashmey, research director at brokerage Topline Securities.  We expect volatility,  he said. The Supreme Court will decide how to proceed and whether to call for a trial. Sharif's term expires in June 2018 and elections are expected two months later. If he were forced to step down, his ruling PML-N party can appoint a new prime minister until the elections. The JIT team is made up of civilians and members of military agencies, including the military's main Inter-Services Intelligence agency.

The Outlooks are Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Kazakhmys Ins's capital position is strong for the rating level and the insurer has a track record of profitability. Offsetting factors include the low average credit quality of its investment portfolio, aggressive growth strategy and high dependence on outwards reinsurance. Based on Fitch's Prism factor-based model (Prism FBM), Kazakhmys Ins's capital score improved to  extremely strong  at end-2016, from  strong  at end-2015. The company maintained low net premium volumes, which together with considerable reinsurance utilisation, led to stable target capital. In addition capital injections from shareholders increased the available capital and contributed to the strengthened capitalisation. The capital injections have also created an extensive buffer in the insurer's regulatory solvency margin, which grew to 411% at end- 2016. However, due to subsequent considerable top-line gross premium growth and changes in the solvency reporting calculation basis the regulatory solvency margin decreased to, albeit a still comfortable level of, 133% at end-5M17. Kazakhmys Ins has a track record of positive financial results over the last five years. In 2016 the company reported moderate net income of KZT355 million compared with the 2015 result of KZT994 million. Unlike 2015, the net result in 2016 was mainly supported by a strong gross investment component of KZT907 million and by rather modest underwriting income. Adversely, a considerable impairment loss of KZT417 million and an FX loss on investments of KZT240 million negatively impacted earnings, and led to a net investment result of KZT240 million. In 5M17 the company reported a modest net income of KZT23 million based on regulatory statutory reporting, supported by investment returns as was the case for 2016 results. In 2016 Kazakhmys Ins's underwriting result turned positive at KZT153 million compared with an underwriting loss of KZT308 million in 2015, with the combined ratio improving to 96% from 115%.  The loss ratio decreased to 35% in 2016 from 40% in 2015, with compulsory motor-third party liability insurance being the main contributor. Fitch views Kazakhmys Ins's investment portfolio to be of weak credit quality. Bank deposits accounted for 67% of Kazakhmys Ins's total investments at end-2016 compared with 79% at end-2015, before falling further to 50% at end-5M17. All deposits are held in local banks mainly rated in 'B' category. Fitch notes the weak average credit quality of these banks, which is mainly attributable to the poor financial standing of the local banking system. The company reported significant growth in 2016, with gross written premiums increasing by 160% from 2015 levels. Growth on a net premium basis was lower at 83% in 2016. Net growth was largely driven by compulsory motor third-party liability (MTPL) policies and, to a lesser extent, by the general third-party liability (TPL) business. As a result, the share of MTPL in the company's underwriting portfolio grew to 62% in 2016 from 52% in 2015. Kazakhmys Ins's reinsurance utilisation ratio was very high and increased to 89% in 2016 from 84% in 2015 with a five-year average of 81%. The company uses reinsurance primarily for fronting purposes on property, third-party liability, and health risks for big commercial accounts, including Kazakhmys Corporation. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be upgraded if Kazakhmys Ins improves the average asset credit quality of investments and successfully implements its growth strategy, with sustainable underwriting profitability and diversification of the portfolio. The ratings could be downgraded if the regulatory solvency margin falls below 110% on a sustained basis or if shareholders fail to support Kazakhmys Ins's growth strategy.

The New Zealand dollar fell to its lowest since June 22, with dealers pointing to a sluggish report on credit card spending after a brief dip following news of an earthquake off the country's South Island. The dollar index rose 0.1 percent to 96.124, broadly flat against the euro and around a quarter of a percent higher at 114.32 yen. It reached as high as 114.475 in early trade in Europe - its strongest since mid-March.  The real story at the moment is the rise in U.S. real yields,  said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with currency fund Millennium Global in London.  That does look like being the theme for the moment. Dollar yen is properly supported, and I don't think there is even that much participation yet (in that trade).  Joel Kruger, an analyst with LMAX Exchange in London said a mix of poor local data and broader positioning looked to be behind the kiwi dollar's fall. It was down 0.8 percent at $0.7215 by 1130 GMT.  There is a confluence of softer local developments - last week's negative GDT auction followed up by today's weaker credit card spending,  he said. Central bank events this week will again dominate market attention. The Bank of Canada, which is widely expected to raise interest rates after strong signals from its main policymakers over the past month, meets on Wednesday. U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen gives two days of testimony to lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday while Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent was due to speak at 1230 GMT on Tuesday. The data since late last week has painted a grim picture of the UK economy, undermining the hints from others at the Bank that a rise in interest rates is likely later this year. Canadian bank RBC have a weaker pound against the dollar as their trade of the week.  A more measured speech by Broadbent and softer employment and wage numbers tomorrow would reinforce our view that the sterling correction from $1.3042 should extend further,  they said in a note on Tuesday. Sterling was roughly stable at $1.2887 and 88.37 pence per euro respectively.

Athens' largest creditor, the European Stability Mechanism, said on Monday that Greece should develop a strategy to end a three-year exile from markets before its current bailout program expires in mid-2018. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos met with investors in London last month and one of those funds, BlueBay Asset Management, said the volume of calls they are receiving from bankers about a potential deal suggest it's very close.  Over the last few months we would get one call on this every couple of weeks (from bankers), but over the last 10 days it seems to be every day I'm getting a call asking about this particular topic,  BlueBay's Mark Dowding told Reuters.  One senses we are getting to a point where this feels more imminent. We could well expect to see a deal in the next couple of weeks before investors depart for their summer holidays.  Dowding said BlueBay holds Greek bonds and would buy a new bond issue if the price was attractive. Tsakalotos also met investors including the world's biggest bond fund PIMCO and U.S.-based asset manager Standish, sources close to those meetings told Reuters. PIMCO declined to comment. The Greek finance ministry was not immediately available for comment. A senior Greek government official told Reuters last week that no decision had yet been made on the timing of a deal. Right Now A banker advising Greece on its market return told Reuters on condition of anonymity:  They (Greece) are monitoring the market and they are trying to do something right now, so I wouldn't rule out a deal within the next week or two.   I think they would like to send a signal that they don't depend solely on the Troika anymore for funding. It's more like a political statement, they are being driven politically to do a deal,  the banker said. A second banker said a sale in the next few weeks was possible although it may yet be pushed back until after German elections in September. He said Greece could expect to raise at least 3 billion euros in the debt sale.   Greek economy minister Dimitri Papadimitriou, who recently visited the United States and Britain, said in an interview with a local newspaper on Sunday that some investors have shown great interest in the timing of Greece's return to markets. Reuters first reported in May that Greece was eyeing a sovereign bond issue as early as July. A Greek government official said it would likely be a new five-year bond, some of which could be swapped for debt maturing in 2019. Greece will return to markets once its benchmark borrowing costs drop below 5 percent, sources separately told Reuters last month, a level it is fast approaching GR10YT=TWEB. Greece last ventured into international bond markets with two issues in 2014, a year before it plunged into crisis via a tense standoff between lenders and Greece's newly elected left-wing government which vowed to end bailout-induced austerity. That part of the crisis ended with the country signing up to a new bailout, its third since 2010.

Sadiq Khan said the city, with a population of 8.7 million, faces a  mammoth task  to rectify a failure to deal with decades of poorly planned growth, and begin building the 50,000 new homes Londoners need each year.  Today, we face another wave of growth, the likes of which we've not seen for a century,  Khan said in a speech at the London School of Economics (LSE) on Monday to launch his 'Good Growth by Design' program.    In recent years, too much focus has been dedicated to developing the high-price, high-rise central London market. These expensive developments... haven't delivered the genuinely affordable homes ordinary Londoners desperately need.  Tony Travers, director of LSE's research center for London, said the city's population is predicted to rise by 100,000 a year, exceeding 10 million by 2030.  Across London, average property prices have risen 90 percent in the past decade, and a report by the mayor's office in February said a lack of affordable housing is depriving Londoners of the security of home ownership. Khan said the team of 50 design advisers, including Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye and fashion designer Wayne Hemingway, are the first of a new generation he will bring in to guide the city toward inclusive growth. A new scheme aims to fast-track talented designers and planners from across the city into year-long placements in local authorities. Khan said the new program would reverse the drain of urban design expertise from local councils, after a massive fall in the proportion of architects employed in the public sector since the 1970s. Khan said the explosion in the number of skyscrapers and drastic changes to the city skyline under his predecessor Boris Johnson had failed to provide the homes regular Londoners need. Such growth has left Londoners with a housing crisis where rapid gentrification forces diverse communities from the city and strains local services, according to Khan.  Allowing this kind of unbalanced, unfocused and unsustainable growth is leaving many Londoners feeling excluded and left behind,  he said.      In 2015, the year before Khan took office, 13 percent of houses built were  affordable  - which can cost up to 80 percent of market rates - down from one third in 2007, according to London Annual Monitoring Report.  Khan said he would aim for more than 35 percent.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. The hospital said in a short statement that Liu was being  actively rescued  and was suffering from septic shock, an infection in his abdominal cavity and was on dialysis. On Monday, the hospital said he was receiving the same level of treatment and suffered from kidney problems, a swollen stomach, partial intestinal obstruction and falling blood pressure. Calls have grown from rights groups and Western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife, Liu Xia, to be treated abroad.     Jared Genser, a U.S. attorney who represents Liu, urged the Chinese government to allow a transfer, noting that additional treatment abroad could extend Liu's life for several weeks. Pro-democracy activists stage a sit-in protest demanding the release of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 10, 2017.Bobby Yip By denying him treatments that would extend his life, the Chinese government is intentionally hastening his death,  Genser said in a statement late on Monday. China has previously told diplomats that Liu cannot travel because he is too ill to be moved. Vehicles pass in front of building number 1 of the First Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang where friends of sick dissident Liu Xiaobo say he is being treated, in Shenyang, China July 10, 2017.Christian ShepherdExpert doctors from the United States and Germany visited Liu on Sunday and released a statement saying he had expressed his wish to get treatment overseas and that he could be moved abroad safely, though the move must happen quickly. Videos later appeared on YouTube, which is blocked in China, showing the German doctor seeming to praise China's care and saying that Liu could not receive better care in Germany. The German embassy in Beijing later said in a statement the recordings were made against the expressed wishes of the German side.     Asked about the Germany statement on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he did not know anything about the issues it raised, and reiterated that countries should respect China's judicial sovereignty and not interfere in its internal affairs. China's state-backed Global Times, a tabloid published by the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, said in an English-language editorial calls for Liu to move abroad were  political  and designed to cast China as  inhuman .

London-based financial services firms have been making plans to set up operations in the EU to maintain access to its single market after Brexit and there is fierce competition among major European cities to attract them.  As a result, the EU regulator is concerned about the risks of new  letter-box  companies springing up in the EU that delegate key operations to parents in London.  It has said that any countries offering such flexible solutions to attract business could undermine stability. Any regulatory leeway at the national level  is not a means for lowering standards or for disregarding prudential requirements,  the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said.  Sound supervision demands appropriate location of management and key functions,  EIOPA Chairman Gabriel Bernardino wrote in a statement accompanying a seven-page guidance document.  Empty shells or letter boxes are not acceptable.   EIOPA said regulators should ensure that firms setting up shop in the European Union should exhibit  an appropriate level of corporate substance, proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the planned business.   This includes a reasonable level of local staff, it said. Regulators must also allow sufficient time for the application process and not take shortcuts. EIOPA warned against an automatic recognition of a firm because it was granted by another supervisor in another member state. It also said that companies moving into the EU might be tempted to try to limit the impact of relocation by outsourcing functions and activities. The watchdog said that such outsourcing must not  deplete the corporate substance of the EU entities with repercussions on the adequacy of their management and on the effectiveness of supervision by the EU27 supervisors.

In what will be the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data, acquisitive developer Sunac is buying 13 cultural tourism projects and 76 hotels from property giant Wanda. The companies are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month. After the deal, 50 million square meters of saleable gross floor area will be added to Tianjin-based Sunac's land bank, making it one of the largest property developers in the country by land area, after China Evergrande (3333.HK).  The average cost per square meter for the 13 cultural projects is 600 yuan, if you give a discount for the undisclosed area of non-saleable land for Sunac, it's still only around 1,000 yuan,  said RHB Research analyst Toni Ho in Hong Kong.  The deal will give Sunac access to land across tier-one to tier-four cities in one go.  Ho said the gross margin of the land involved is at around 20-30 percent, higher than Sunac's average of 13 percent.  Sunac's shares surged 13.65 percent, their biggest one-day gain in more than two-and-a-half years, on Tuesday. They resumed trade after being suspended on Monday ahead of news of the pending deal. The Hang Seng Index .HSI gained 1.5 percent. The developer has more than doubled in market value this year to HK$65.7 billion ($8.41 billion).  This cooperation will add a large number of prime land reserves and property assets for the company at a reasonable cost,  Sunac said in a statement on Tuesday, citing reasons for the deal. FILE PHOTO: A sign of Dalian Wanda Group in China glows during an event announcing strategic partnership between Wanda Group and FIFA in Beijing, China March 21, 2016.Damir Sagolj/File PhotoSunac, though, would surpass Evergrande as the most indebted developer in China after the deal, analysts said. RHB's Ho estimated Sunac's gearing ratio will be around 300 percent at the end of year, compared to 208 percent in 2016. Evergrande, which is actively de-leveraging by repaying all its perpetual bonds, is expected to drop below 300 percent.  Such acquisition is radical and risky as it will stretch Sunacâ€™s financial position to the extreme given the low return and slow asset turnover of the projects,  BOCI analyst Gurney Liu in Beijing said in a report. Liu, who estimated Sunac's net gearing could surge to over 400 percent after the deal, said large-scale development projects and hotels generate lower return than regular property business, and they also lock up significant financial resources for a long investment cycle.   After the payment, Sunac's cash on hand would dip to 30 billion yuan, which is less than its borrowings maturing in one year at 38.7 billion yuan as reported in its 2016 annual report,  she said. Sunac declined to comment on its leverage position.  In the statement, Sunac disclosed Wanda would provide a three-year loan of 29.6 billion yuan, which is almost the same amount as the price for the 13 cultural projects, at a three-year benchmark interest rate.     After the deal, Wanda will still be responsible for the operation of the properties, and Sunac will pay an annual management consulting fee for the 13 theme parks of 50 million yuan each to Wanda for a contract term of 20 years.

Athens' largest creditor, the European Stability Mechanism, said on Monday that Greece should develop a strategy to end a three-year exile from markets before its current bailout program expires in mid-2018. Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos met with investors in London last month and one of those funds, BlueBay Asset Management, said the volume of calls they are receiving from bankers about a potential deal suggest it's very close.  Over the last few months we would get one call on this every couple of weeks (from bankers), but over the last 10 days it seems to be every day I'm getting a call asking about this particular topic,  BlueBay's Mark Dowding told Reuters.  One senses we are getting to a point where this feels more imminent. We could well expect to see a deal in the next couple of weeks before investors depart for their summer holidays.  Dowding said BlueBay holds Greek bonds and would buy a new bond issue if the price was attractive. Tsakalotos also met investors including the world's biggest bond fund PIMCO and U.S.-based asset manager Standish, sources close to those meetings told Reuters. PIMCO declined to comment. The Greek finance ministry was not immediately available for comment. A senior Greek government official told Reuters last week that no decision had yet been made on the timing of a deal. Right Now A banker advising Greece on its market return told Reuters on condition of anonymity:  They (Greece) are monitoring the market and they are trying to do something right now, so I wouldn't rule out a deal within the next week or two.   I think they would like to send a signal that they don't depend solely on the Troika anymore for funding. It's more like a political statement, they are being driven politically to do a deal,  the banker said. A second banker said a sale in the next few weeks was possible although it may yet be pushed back until after German elections in September. He said Greece could expect to raise at least 3 billion euros in the debt sale.   Greek economy minister Dimitri Papadimitriou, who recently visited the United States and Britain, said in an interview with a local newspaper on Sunday that some investors have shown great interest in the timing of Greece's return to markets. Reuters first reported in May that Greece was eyeing a sovereign bond issue as early as July. A Greek government official said it would likely be a new five-year bond, some of which could be swapped for debt maturing in 2019. Greece will return to markets once its benchmark borrowing costs drop below 5 percent, sources separately told Reuters last month, a level it is fast approaching GR10YT=TWEB. Greece last ventured into international bond markets with two issues in 2014, a year before it plunged into crisis via a tense standoff between lenders and Greece's newly elected left-wing government which vowed to end bailout-induced austerity. That part of the crisis ended with the country signing up to a new bailout, its third since 2010.

Firms including Microsoft Corp and California life sciences company Verily are forming partnerships with public health officials in several U.S. states to test new high-tech tools. In Texas, Microsoft is testing a smart trap to isolate and capture Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, known Zika carriers, for study by entomologists to give them a jump on predicting outbreaks. Verily, Alphabet's life sciences division based in Mountain View, California, is speeding the process for creating sterile male mosquitoes to mate with females in the wild, offering a form of birth control for the species.  While it may take years for these advances to become widely available, public health experts say new players brings fresh thinking to vector control, which still relies heavily on traditional defenses such as larvicides and insecticides.      It's exciting when technology companies come on board,  said Anandasankar Ray, an associate professor of entomology at the University of California, Riverside.  Their approach to a biological challenge is to engineer a solution.  Smart Traps The Zika epidemic that emerged in Brazil in 2015 and left thousands of babies suffering from birth defects has added urgency to the effort. While cases there have slowed markedly, mosquitoes capable of carrying the virus  - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus - are spreading in the Americas, including large swaths of the southern United States. (For a map of U.S. mosquito territory, see tmsnrt.rs/2tqlJHa) The vast majority of the 5,365 Zika cases reported in the United States so far are from travelers who contracted the virus elsewhere. Still, two states  â€“ Texas and Florida â€“ have recorded cases transmitted by local mosquitoes, making them prime testing grounds for new technology. In Texas, 10 mosquito traps made by Microsoft are operating in Harris County, which includes the city of Houston.  Roughly the size of large birdhouses, the devices use robotics, infrared sensors, machine learning and cloud computing to help health officials keep tabs on potential disease carriers. Texas recorded six cases of local mosquito transmission of Zika in November and December of last year. Experts believe the actual number is likely higher because most infected people do not develop symptoms. Pregnant women are at high risk because they can pass the virus to their fetuses, resulting in a variety of birth defects. Those include microcephaly, a condition in which infants are born with undersized skulls and brains. The World Health Organization declared Zika a global health emergency in February 2016.     Most conventional mosquito traps capture all comers - moths, flies, other mosquito varieties - leaving a pile of specimens for entomologists to sort through. The Microsoft machines differentiate insects by measuring a feature unique to each species: the shadows cast by their beating wings. When a trap detects an Aedes aegypti in one of its 64 chambers, the door slams shut.  The machine  makes a decision about whether to trap it,  said Ethan Jackson, a Microsoft engineer who is developing the device. The Houston tests, begun last summer, showed the traps could detect Aedes aegypti and other medically important mosquitoes with 85 percent accuracy, Jackson said. Researcher Ethan Jackson places the Project Premonition mosquito trap in the wild in this handout photo obtained by Reuters June 30, 2017. Microsoft/Handout via REUTERSThe machines also record shadows made by other insects as well as environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The data can be used to build models to predict where and when mosquitoes are active.  Mustapha Debboun, director ofÂ Harris Countyâ€™s mosquito and vector control division, said the traps save time and give researchers more insight into mosquito behavior.  For science and research, this is a dream come true,  he said. The traps are prototypes now. But Microsoft's Jackson said the company eventually hopes to sell them for a few hundred dollars each, roughly the price of conventional traps. The goal is to spur wide adoption, particularly in developing countries, to detect potential epidemics before they start.  What we hope is (the traps) will allow us to bring more precision to public health,  Jackson said.       Sorting Mosquitoes With Robots    Slideshow (4 Images)Other companies, meanwhile, are developing technology to shrink mosquito populations by rendering male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes sterile. When these sterile males mate with females in the wild, their eggs don't hatch.  The strategy offers an alternative to chemical pesticides. But it requires the release of millions of laboratory-bred mosquitoes into the outdoors. Males don't bite, which has made this an easier sell to places now hosting tests.     Oxitec, an Oxford, England-based division of Germantown, Maryland-based Intrexon Corp, is creating male mosquitoes genetically modified to be sterile. It has already deployed them in Brazil, and is seeking regulatory approval for tests in Florida and Texas. MosquitoMate Inc, a startup formed by researchers at the University of Kentucky, is using a naturally occurring bacterium called Wolbachia to render male mosquitoes sterile. One of the biggest challenges is sorting the sexes.  At MosquitoMate's labs in Lexington, immature mosquitoes are forced through a sieve-like mechanism that separates the smaller males from the females. These mosquitoes are then hand sorted to weed out any stray females that slip through.  That's basically done using eyeballs,  said Stephen Dobson, MosquitoMate's chief executive. Enter Verily. The company is automating mosquito sorting with robots to make it faster and more affordable. Company officials declined to be interviewed. But on its website, Verily says it's combining sensors, algorithms and  novel engineering  to speed the process. Verily and MosquitoMate have teamed up to test their technology in Fresno, California, where Aedes aegypti arrived in 2013. Officials worry that residents who contract Zika elsewhere could spread it in Fresno if they're bitten by local mosquitoes that could pass the virus to others. â€œThat is very much of a concern because it is the primary vector for diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and obviously Zika,â€� said Steve Mulligan, manager of the Consolidated Mosquito Abatement District in Fresno County. The study, which still needs state and federal approval, is slated for later this summer. Editing by Marla Dickerson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-mosquitoes-idUSKBN19W0C9"},

The New Zealand dollar fell to its lowest since June 23 after a report of a large earthquake hitting off its South Island, although there were no immediate reports of damage. The dollar index rose just over 0.1 percent to 96.138 , gaining 0.1 percent against the euro and around a third of a percent to 114.43 yen, its strongest since mid-March.  The real story at the moment is the rise in U.S. real yields,  said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with currency fund Millennium Global in London.  That does look like being the theme for the moment. Dollar yen is properly supported, and I don't think there is even that much participation yet (in that trade).  Central bank events this week will again dominate market attention. The Bank of Canada, which is widely expected to raise interest rates after strong signals from its main policymakers over the past month, meets on Wednesday. U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen gives two days of testimony to lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday while Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent speaks later on Tuesday. The data since late last week has painted a grim picture of the UK economy, undermining the hints from others at the Bank that a rise in interest rates is likely later this year. Canadian bank RBC have a weaker pound against the dollar as their trade of the week.  A more measured speech by Broadbent and softer employment and wage numbers tomorrow would reinforce our view that the sterling correction from $1.3042 should extend further,  they said in a note on Tuesday.

The issue ratings on Congo's senior unsecured foreign-currency bond are also affirmed at 'CCC'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'B+' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'C'. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Republic of Congo's rating reflects large fiscal and external deficits caused by a limited policy response to the fall in oil prices, increasing constraints on deficit financing, rapidly accumulating debt, high domestic and external arrears, and poor public finance management with a weak track record of debt repayment. While talks about IMF credit facility are on-going, an agreement on and implementation of a programme remain uncertain. Fitch expects the tight financing conditions brought about by the drop in oil prices in 2014 to persist over the coming two years. As a result of wide budget deficits, averaging at 15% of GDP in 2014-2016, financing needs are substantial while the main financing sources have dried up and there is a high concentration of debt maturities in 2017-2020. Reflecting the erosion of fiscal buffers, deposits with Banque des Etats d'Afrique Centrale (BEAC, the central bank of the CEMAC region) and commercial banks have dropped to 5% of GDP in 2016, from 19.6% in 2014. In parallel, statutory advances from BEAC reached their ceiling and have been frozen under a decision taken by the CEMAC heads of States in December 2016. Access to new external bilateral loans, including from China, has reportedly been tightened. The authorities have explored alternative sources of financing. A XAF150 billion (3.2% of GDP) bond was issued on the regional market in November 2016 and a USD250 million (3.1% of GDP) loan was granted to Congo by the African Export-Import bank in 1Q17. However, the limited absorption capacity of the regional market is poised to reduce further, as BEAC has embarked on a gradual tightening of the monetary policy to ease pressures on the exchange rate peg. While public debt remains mostly concessional, continued recourse to high-cost market financing would aggravate the strain on public finances. Support by regional multilateral institutions could also wane if Congo continues to lag other CEMAC members in entering an IMF programme. Although an IMF credit facility would ease financing constraints and could crowd-in support from other creditors, the prospect for Congo to conclude an agreement remains uncertain. The fund's negotiations with Congo are continuing, while IMF support programmes for Cameroon and Gabon have been approved in June 2017. A failure to reach an agreement with the IMF, or low compliance with programme targets in case an accord is reached would aggravate the strain on liquidity and compound the weaknesses of public finances over the medium term. The partial recovery in oil revenues over the coming two years will provide only limited relief to public finances. Fitch forecasts oil receipts to average 15% of GDP in 2017-2018, up from 9% in 2016, but still well below the 31% registered in 2010-2014. This improvement is due to the moderate increase in oil prices and to new oil fields coming online, with Moho Nord production having started in March 2017. The government predicts oil production growth of 13% in 2017 and 24% in 2018. As oil production has systematically under-achieved against forecasts during the last few years, Fitch assumes an increase of just 10% in 2017 and 23% in 2018 and a gradual decline starting in 2019. The willingness of the authorities to implement fiscal consolidation sufficient for a substantial narrowing of the budget deficit is uncertain. Despite the drop in oil revenue, public investment remained elevated in 2016, at 12% of GDP, although down from the staggering 23% average recorded in 2012-2015. This has resulted in the general government deficit only narrowing to 13.5% of GDP in 2016 according to official figures and 16.5% according to Fitch's estimates based on the use of financing sources. We forecast the deficit to shrink to 3.5% of GDP in 2017 on a commitment basis and 7% on a cash basis, as oil revenues recover while investment spending targets are revised downwards due to funding constraints. According to Fitch's estimates, general government debt (GGD) rose to 85% of GDP in 2016 and will edge up further to 86% in 2017, more than quadrupling since Congo reached the completion point under the HIPC initiative in 2010. This figure includes official estimates for domestic and external arrears worth XAF595.7 billion, equivalent to 12.6% of GDP and the estimate may be revised upwards. The high level of arrears illustrates the structural shortcomings of public finance management, which Fitch regards as a major credit weakness, with a poor payment track record, high susceptibility to oil price fluctuations, and low data quality and transparency. Weak public finance management has resulted in a temporary failure to pay interest and principal of USD17 million on a Eurobond mid-2016, amid severe cash strain for the government. Macroeconomic performance is weak, with real GDP dropping 2.7% in 2016 and expected to decline again in 2017. Non-oil activity is in recession due to lower public investment, shortages caused by the disruption of the transport network between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire following the destruction of major bridges by armed rebels, and high public arrears weighing on private-sector financing conditions. However, the spill-over from the oil sector should lead to a gradual recovery in 2018. The poor quality and limited availability of national accounting data remain an obstacle to an accurate assessment of economic activity. The current account deficit (CAD) is forecast to narrow to 10% of GDP in 2017 from 29% in 2016, as oil revenue recover and imports moderate in line with public investment. Consequently, foreign exchange reserves should gradually increase, contributing to the stabilisation of reserves on the regional level. However, this improvement is highly dependent on the recovery in oil revenue, which have accounted for 70% of current external receipts since 2010, as well as on the authorities' willingness to exercise restraint on public investment. Congo ranks among the lowest of Fitch-rated sovereigns in terms of governance and development indicators. A challenging institutional framework and poor business climate are weighing on foreign investment in the non-oil sector and impeding the diversification of the economy, with the country's high potential in agriculture and mining remaining untapped. Political risks are high as tensions flared around the re-election of President Sassou N' Guesso in March 2016. Parliamentary elections are due in July 2017. Ongoing fighting between the government and armed rebels in the Pool region is disrupting economic activity, displacing thousands of citizens, and pose a continued threat to political stability. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns the Republic of Congo a score equivalent to a rating of 'CCC' on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee did not adjust the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year-centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Long-Term IDRs do not have an Outlook. Developments that could result in a downgrade include: -Intensified economic and financial stress leading to heightened risk of non-payment on principal or interest due on debt securities issued in public markets. Developments that could, individually or collectively, result in an upgrade, include: -Material and sustained improvement in the liquidity of the government, resulting from rising budget revenue, a sustained reduction of investment spending or improving deficit financing options; -A sustained improvement in fiscal balances leading to a marked decline of the government debt-to -GDP ratio; -Evidence of a material improvement in public finance management capacity. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch assumes no break-up of the CEMAC monetary zone and no devaluation of the CFA franc. Global economic trends and commodity prices are expected to develop as outlined in Fitch's Global Economic Outlook. Fitch assumed that Brent crude will average USD52.5/barrel in 2017, USD55/barrel in 2018 and USD60/barrel in 2019.

Over the last year, there has been a large number of police operations targeting people suspected of links to the U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating the failed putsch on July 15. In the latest operations focused on IT employees in both the private and public sectors, police have so far detained 52 people out of the 105 targeted by arrest warrants across eight provinces, including former staff from Turkey's scientific research council TUBITAK and a telecommunications authority, Anadolu said. It said the suspects were believed to be users of ByLock, an encrypted messaging app the government says was used by Gulen's followers. Gulen has denied involvement in the attempted military takeover. On Monday authorities issued arrest warrants for 72 university staff, including a former adviser to Turkey's main opposition leader who staged a mass rally on Sunday to protest against a crackdown in the last year. Last week police detained 10 people, including the local head of rights group Amnesty International at a meeting on an island near Istanbul. Their detentions were extended for another seven days on Tuesday, a source close to the matter said. In total, about 50,000 people have been arrested and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers have been suspended under the emergency rule imposed in late July. Rights groups and government critics say Turkey has been drifting toward authoritarianism for years, a process they say has accelerated since the coup bid and a referendum in April granting President Tayyip Erdogan sweeping new powers. The government says the crackdown and constitutional changes are necessary to address security threats. More than 240 people were killed in last year's coup attempt.

London-based financial services firms have been making plans to set up operations in the EU to maintain access to its single market after Brexit and there is fierce competition among major European cities to attract them.  As a result, the EU regulator is concerned about the risks of new  letter-box  companies springing up in the EU that delegate key operations to parents in London.  It has said that any countries offering such flexible solutions to attract business could undermine stability. Any regulatory leeway at the national level  is not a means for lowering standards or for disregarding prudential requirements,  the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said.  Sound supervision demands appropriate location of management and key functions,  EIOPA Chairman Gabriel Bernardino wrote in a statement accompanying a seven-page guidance document.  Empty shells or letter boxes are not acceptable.   EIOPA said regulators should ensure that firms setting up shop in the European Union should exhibit  an appropriate level of corporate substance, proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the planned business.   This includes a reasonable level of local staff, it said. Regulators must also allow sufficient time for the application process and not take shortcuts. EIOPA warned against an automatic recognition of a firm because it was granted by another supervisor in another member state. It also said that companies moving into the EU might be tempted to try to limit the impact of relocation by outsourcing functions and activities. The watchdog said that such outsourcing must not  deplete the corporate substance of the EU entities with repercussions on the adequacy of their management and on the effectiveness of supervision by the EU27 supervisors.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government in May decreed that markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as plowing and dairy production, on the grounds of stopping cruelty to animals. The slaughter of cows, considered holy in Hinduism, was already banned in most parts of India, but Hindu hardliners and cow vigilante groups have been increasingly asserting themselves since Modi's government came to power in 2014. Muslims, who make up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people, said the May government decree against the beef and leather industry employing millions of workers, was aimed at marginalizing them. The Supreme Court, in issuing its decision, stressed the hardship that the ban on the trade of cattle for slaughter had imposed.  The livelihood of people should not be affected by this,  Supreme Court Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar told a court packed with lawyers and representatives of the beef industry.  India's meat and leather industries are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales. After the decision, the government told the court it would modify and reissue its May order, Additional Solicitor General P.S. Narasimha said. The government could exclude buffalo from the ban - buffalo are not considered sacred - and buffalo meat constitutes the bulk of India's  beef  exports. The crackdown on the beef industry has become highly emotive with a wave of attacks on Muslims suspected of either storing meat or transporting cattle for slaughter. An estimated 28 people have been killed in cow-related violence since 2010. Late last month, after months of silence on the violence, Modi condemned lynchings. A cow walks past a closed slaughterhouse in Allahabad, India March 28, 2017.Jitendra PrakashMedia has reported at least two cases of attacks on Muslims since Modi spoke out. 'Huge Relief' Abdul Faheem Qureshi, the head of the Muslim All India Jamiatul Quresh Action Committee that supports meat sellers, welcomed the court decision.  We have to now restore the confidence of cattle traders that they can resume their business. It' a victory for us,  said Faheem Qureshi, who had lodged a petition with the Supreme Court against the government ban. India exported 1.33 million tonnes of buffalo meat in the 2016/17 fiscal year to March 31, worth about $3.9 billion. The previous year, it exported 1.31 million tonnes. The Supreme Court order was also a boost for the leather industry which supplies brands such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks.  The order has brought huge relief,  said Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based shoe exporter Dawar Footwear Industries. Apart from Muslims, the leather industry also employs lower-caste Hindus, mostly in menial jobs in tanneries. But a cow protection group said the government should have been more forceful in making its case in court.  The government should have stood its ground by fighting for the implementation of the ban,  said Pawan Pandit, chairman of the India Cow Protection Group.  Modi must respect the sentiments of millions of Hindus, who have supported his government,  Pandit said. Additional reporting by Krishna N.

In what will be the second-biggest real estate deal ever in China according to Reuters data, acquisitive developer Sunac is buying 13 cultural tourism projects and 76 hotels from property giant Wanda. The companies are expected to sign an agreement by the end of this month. After the deal, 50 million square meters of saleable gross floor area will be added to Tianjin-based Sunac's land bank, making it one of the largest property developers in the country by land area, after China Evergrande (3333.HK).  The average cost per square meter for the 13 cultural projects is 600 yuan, if you give a discount for the undisclosed area of non-saleable land for Sunac, it's still only around 1,000 yuan,  said RHB Research analyst Toni Ho in Hong Kong.  The deal will give Sunac access to land across tier-one to tier-four cities in one go.  Ho said the gross margin of the land involved is at around 20-30 percent, higher than Sunac's average of 13 percent.  Sunac's shares surged 13.65 percent, their biggest one-day gain in more than two-and-a-half years, on Tuesday. They resumed trade after being suspended on Monday ahead of news of the pending deal. The Hang Seng Index .HSI gained 1.5 percent. The developer has more than doubled in market value this year to HK$65.7 billion ($8.41 billion).  This cooperation will add a large number of prime land reserves and property assets for the company at a reasonable cost,  Sunac said in a statement on Tuesday, citing reasons for the deal. FILE PHOTO: A sign of Dalian Wanda Group in China glows during an event announcing strategic partnership between Wanda Group and FIFA in Beijing, China March 21, 2016.Damir Sagolj/File PhotoSunac, though, would surpass Evergrande as the most indebted developer in China after the deal, analysts said. RHB's Ho estimated Sunac's gearing ratio will be around 300 percent at the end of year, compared to 208 percent in 2016. Evergrande, which is actively de-leveraging by repaying all its perpetual bonds, is expected to drop below 300 percent.  Such acquisition is radical and risky as it will stretch Sunacâ€™s financial position to the extreme given the low return and slow asset turnover of the projects,  BOCI analyst Gurney Liu in Beijing said in a report. Liu, who estimated Sunac's net gearing could surge to over 400 percent after the deal, said large-scale development projects and hotels generate lower return than regular property business, and they also lock up significant financial resources for a long investment cycle.   After the payment, Sunac's cash on hand would dip to 30 billion yuan, which is less than its borrowings maturing in one year at 38.7 billion yuan as reported in its 2016 annual report,  she said. Sunac declined to comment on its leverage position.  In the statement, Sunac disclosed Wanda would provide a three-year loan of 29.6 billion yuan, which is almost the same amount as the price for the 13 cultural projects, at a three-year benchmark interest rate.     After the deal, Wanda will still be responsible for the operation of the properties, and Sunac will pay an annual management consulting fee for the 13 theme parks of 50 million yuan each to Wanda for a contract term of 20 years.

For four years he wrote short stories inspired by his own life, his struggle to be open about his sexuality, his despair and frustration that nearly drove him to suicide - quietly breathing life into Mohanaswamy, the hero of his stories. Just days before his book was first published in 2013, under a pseudonym in Kannada, the regional language of the southern state of Karnataka, he plucked up the courage to tell his sister that he was gay.  And with me and Mohanaswamy, many of my readers embraced their truth,  the award winning Kannada writer said, adding that when he finally did reveal his identity, gay men from across Karnataka started calling him, sharing stories with him, crying, laughing and talking.  Many readers who called me, from villages and small towns, do not read English and for them the Mohanaswamy series was a way to rediscover themselves and find solace in the fact that they were not alone,  he said. The acclaimed series, which was recently translated in English, will also be published in other Indian languages, including Telugu and Malayalam in the coming months.  Gay men don't only live in an urban setting. Thousands are growing up in villages and towns, with no way to access information on sexuality, most of which is available only in English,  Vasudhendra, who goes by just one name, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  More has to be written and it has to be written in the language people are familiar with.  Since the stories were published gay women have approached him to write about their lives, frustrated that they cannot even find magazine articles that reflect their situation.  For women it is so much tougher because saying 'no' to a marriage is never an option,  he said.  What they go through is something I cannot imagine because at least I got away by refusing to marry.  There is no official data on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) population in India, but the government in the past has submitted in the Supreme Court that there are an estimated 2.5 million gay people in the country.  Those numbers reflect only those who have self declared to the Health Ministry and will be far higher as many individuals conceal their identity fearing discrimination, campaigners say. Healing Process  In Kannada literature, homosexuality has been portrayed in a very negative way, pushing it to the margins,  said Vasudhendra, who came out in his early 40s.  It took me a long time because I also feared discrimination and lacked courage. Many go through their life keeping their sexuality a secret.  The software engineer turned author vividly recalls a telephone call from an elderly man after the Mohanaswamy stories were published.  The man said he had regretted his marriage every single day,  said Vasudhendra, 48.  And when he read my book he relived his own struggle with his sexuality and the lie his life had been. I realised then that my story had resonated with people who live in small towns and villages, just like the one I grew up in.  The series of 11 stories of homosexual love and lives explore sexuality, urbanization and class. Mohanaswamy talks about losing his partner to a woman, mentions an imaginary girlfriend to a fellow passenger on a plane while picturing the man he is in love with, losing friends, being shown around a flat by a real-estate agent who assumes he has a wife and children.  Mohanaswamy dreams of living a simple, dignified life that would allow him to leave, even forget, the humiliation and fears of adolescence, the slurs his mind still carries and the despair that made him crave to conform,  is how the stories are described on the book jacket. While city readers have told the author these are  once upon a time in India  stories, rural readers say they are ahead of their time.  Being gay is not easy, especially in small communities, where talking about it is taboo. It gives you many sleepless nights, there is constant pressure to get married and many friendships get ruined,  said Vasudhendra.  Writing the stories was a healing process for me and for many of my readers, it was a book they understood.

John Moscow, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, described Futerfas as a  top-flight lawyer  who is both  high-powered and low-key.  Here are some facts about Futerfas: He became a top mob defense lawyer early on Miami-born Futerfas joined the law firm of veteran criminal defense lawyer Gerald Shargel after graduating from Yeshiva University's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York in 1987, and quickly became a partner. He left to form his own firm in 1994. In one of his biggest cases from that period, Futerfas won a new trial in 1997 for mob captain Anthony Russo after it was revealed that a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent may have  leaked information to fuel an organized crime war in the early 1990s. He expanded into white-collar cases Futerfas encountered Moscow in the early 2000s case against former Tyco International chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski. Futerfas represented Christine Berry, Kozlowski's art consultant, in the sales tax avoidance investigation that led to the larger case over Kozlowski's corporate  looting.  In 2010, he represented hedge fund group HFV Management in connection with a wide-ranging probe by the New York attorney generalâ€™s office into corruption in the stateâ€™s pension fund. Â  He has also handled cybercrime cases Futerfas is defending Ziv Orenstein, one of three Israelis charged by federal prosecutors with hacking into JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and the Wall Street Journal (NWSA.O), among other rtargets, as part of a massive  pump and dump  scheme. Orenstein pleaded not guilty.  Another client of Futerfas was Nikita Kuzmin, a Russian national who agreed last year to pay $6.9 million for creating computer malware that made users' bank accounts vulnerable to cyber criminals. He worked one summer for a longtime lawyer to Donald Trump In the summer of 1985, while he was in law school, Futerfas worked for lawyer Jay Goldberg, who went on to become Trump's divorce lawyer.  Futerfas said he did not come to Trump Jr. through Goldberg. He studied at Juilliard Futerfas earned his undergraduate degree from the prestigious performing arts school. He still plays bass trombone for the Park Avenue Chamber Symphony.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co, the teen brand with a 125-year heritage, became the latest to demonstrate that on Monday, ending talks about a potential sale after failing to agree terms with potential suitors. Successful deals in the mercurial world of U.S. fashion are rare, and now look even less likely to succeed as sales dip across the board. Cost savings can be counterproductive if it means squeezing money out of marketing and design, and buyers are taking a risk on a style that can easily go out of favor. As a result, established brands like Abercrombie are having problems finding a savior.  Often, as well as spending the money to buy the brand or business, you then have to spend more to do something strategic that will propel growth, and that means paying out twice before getting a return,  said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. Five of the 20 companies involved in the biggest private equity apparel deals of the last decade have been restructured or gone bankrupt. All struggled under the debt load of a leveraged buyout. The biggest acquisition, Apollo Global Management's roughly $3.1 billion leveraged buyout of Claire's Stores Inc, restructured in 2016. The second-largest acquisition, J. Crew Group Inc, which TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners bought for about $3 billion, is now being restructured. Gymboree Corp filed for bankruptcy last month, seven years after Bain Capital's $1.8 billion purchase. Mounting Pressure Many U.S. fashion bosses are finding they have no option but to consider a sale as pressure mounts from more affordable fast-fashion chains from Europe such as Zara and H&M , and customers abandon malls in favor of Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers. Outerwear brand Eddie Bauer, for example, is exploring a sale while also seeking relief from its debt load, sources have told Reuters. Teen brand American Apparel explored a sale last year before ultimately filing for bankruptcy. As Abercrombie's experience shows, finding a willing buyer at the right price is difficult.  Public company board members are reticent about green-lighting large-scale mergers and acquisitions because it's hard to find a good example of a business that has been rewarded by the equity market for doing so,  said Rohit Singh, who specializes in retail at UBS Investment Bank, not speaking specifically about Abercrombie. Struggling retailers are a tough sell to potential acquirers. Merging with another company risks double the trouble â€“ more brands falling flat and more stores bereft of customers. Most fashion retailers are locked into store leases, and as landlords watch their malls empty out, they are increasingly unwilling to give their tenants an easy path out.  Perhaps the reason the Abercrombie deal didnâ€™t get done was that theyâ€™ve got way too many stores in way too many malls that donâ€™t make any money, and the cost to unwind those pieces and get out of those stores is just too great to compensate for the upside,  said Mark Belford, a retail specialist at KPMG Corporate Finance. After failing to strike a deal, Abercrombie now has no choice but to go it alone. On Monday, the New Albany, Ohio-based retailer said it will focus on its growing surf-wear brand Hollister and try to reposition its flagship brand, which has reported falling quarterly sales since 2014. Sinking Rocks The most successful acquisitions have been those of younger brands, which have room for growth and have yet to develop expensive supply chains and costly, little-used store bases. Gap Inc's $150 million purchase of athletic and yoga clothing line Athleta Inc in 2008, for example, gave it a foothold in a growing fashion trend. The acquisition helped save Gap when sales of its jeans slowed as shoppers shifted to leggings. Apparel retailers that bought rivals in the hope of finding growth or eliminating competition have found little payoff. â€œOftentimes, the companies themselves aren't growing, so it doesn't solve the underlying challenge,  said Josh Chernoff, managing director, retail at consultant Parthenon-EY.  If you tie two rocks together, they sink just as fast or faster.  The changing winds of fashion derailed Wolverine Worldwideâ€™s $1.2 billion acquisition of boat shoe maker Sperry and other brands in 2012, several of which Wolverine tried to sell this year. Shoppersâ€™ addiction to discounting crushed Men's Wearhouse Inc's $1.8 billion acquisition of rival Jos. A. Bank, the value of which was almost written off. The suit retailer's sales plunged after it abandoned its famous  buy-one-get-three-free  specials in the wake of the 2014 merger. Ascena Retail Group Inc, one of the few serial acquirers in U.S. apparel, has been laid low by its roughly $2.1 billion acquisition of Ann Inc, parent of work-wear line Ann Taylor. The 2015 acquisition was meant to give it a full portfolio of womenswear brands and enable it to cut $150 million over three years in costs as it centralized the different linesâ€™ internet infrastructure, distribution and manufacturing. But sales for all its brands have dropped, most recently a combined 8 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Ascena's market value is now $400 million, roughly 85 percent lower than before the deal.  Fashion is not something you can solve with math,  said Belford.  Fashion â€“ you either get it or you donâ€™t, and it either sells or it sits on the shelf.

The firm, which will formally change its name to the London EV Company later this year, is undergoing a rapid expansion since it was bought out of bankruptcy by China's Geely in 2013, opening a new plant in Coventry, central England, earlier this year. By the turn of the decade it hopes to sell to overseas markets 50 percent of the roughly 10,000 vehicles to be produced each year, including a yet to be launched van, and has been showing the new electric plug-in hybrid taxi in a number of European cities. Chief Executive Chris Gubbey told Reuters the firm had picked the Netherlands as its first export market due to its receptiveness to new technology and the new model's compatibility with the needs of disabled people, including its ramp and high roof.  It is a city that is very progressive in terms of protecting and improving its air quality,  he told Reuters.  They just recognise what the product can do for their market: the accessibility, the ease of getting in and out,  he said. Amsterdammers will not be able to hail the taxi in the street but instead it will be available as part of a municpal contract hire service provided by Dutch firm RMC to transport the elderly and disabled, including to and from hospital, he said. RMC's chief operating officer told Reuters the firm had yet to decide whether the 225 vehicles it is acquiring would be painted black colour but said she was confident London cabs would prove a hit in the city and could also be used later in Rotterdam.  This car takes away all the boundaries and all the differences because it is possible to transport everybody, give everybody the same experience in a beautiful car and because it is purpose-built,  Rohany Amat told Reuters.  And it is a sustainable car. That is very important,  she said. (Reporting by Costas Pitas; Editing by Greg Mahlich)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-autos-taxi-idUSL8N1K221Z"},

The deal would mark EQT's second major investment in the U.S. healthcare sector, and highlight the continued appetite for companies that help drugmakers with their research and development processes. The negotiations are advanced and a deal could be announced as soon as this week, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. EQT and Certara declined to comment. Arsenal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Princeton, New Jersey-based Certara provides technology and consulting services aimed at helping pharmaceutical companies obtain approval for their treatments. It offers a novel technology that allows drugmakers to model the performance of drugs, in some cases reducing the need for costly and potentially dangerous clinical testing. Certara also operates a consulting arm aimed at assisting drug makers with submissions to regulators. There has been a flurry of private equity investments in the pharmaceutical services sector in recent years, as the sector benefits from pharmaceutical companies' drive to cut costs, reduce clinical trial times and expand their research and development presence around the world. Recent deals include INC Research Holdings Inc's $7.4 billion merger with inVentiv Health Holdings and Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc's $17.6 billion merger with IMS Health Holdings Inc. Last year, Stockholm, Sweden-based EQT made its first major U.S. healthcare investment, buying Press Ganey Holdings Inc, a provider of patient satisfaction surveys, for around $2.35 billion. EQT has made more than $8 billion in healthcare investments in the past three years, including in companies such as prosthetics maker Ottobock and Sivantos Group, one of the world's leading manufacturers of hearing aids.

Minutes of a June 29 meeting of the WTO's committee on regional trade agreements, published on Tuesday, record Russia's representative as saying the EU-Ukraine free trade agreement was  an exemplary case of a situation where a free trade area worsened trade conditions for other trading partners . That meant it was a breach of the WTO rules, which say that free trade areas should encourage trade between the signatories without raising new barriers with other countries, the Russian representative said. Russia has launched six trade disputes within its first five years as a WTO member, all of them against Ukraine or the EU. Its most recent complaint, in May this year, accused Ukraine of  a universe of restrictions, prohibitions, requirements and procedures  that discriminated against Russia. Russia's representative at the WTO committee on regional trade agreements said the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States had harmonized trade legislation with Ukraine since the 1990s, and signed a treaty in 2011 on coordinating the removal of technical barriers to trade.  To sum up, there were dozens of bilateral and multilateral agreements in the field of trade and investment that linked Ukraine with the CIS countries. Many of Ukraine's commitments were inconsistent with its obligations under the EU-Ukraine Agreement,  the minutes of the meeting said. Russia's representative also said Ukraine's 2015 law on the natural gas market required the operator of Ukraine's gas pipelines to be a person with at least five years' experience from the European Energy Community or the United States. The Energy Community, which aims to extend the EU's internal energy market to the Balkans and Black Sea region, excludes Russia.  The Russian representative at the WTO meeting asked how excluding pipeline experts from other countries could be justified and how it could correspond with the WTO rules that say free trade agreements should not diminish other countries' rights.  She also said that Russia's share in Ukrainian imports had fallen significantly since Ukraine began implementing its Association Agreement with the EU, while the EU's share had grown. The chairman of the WTO committee invited follow-up written questions, which Ukraine and the EU were asked to respond to by July 20.

Hit by a sharp downturn in its biggest markets, Pearson has sold off some of its best known assets in recent years including the Financial Times and the Economist to enable it to invest in its core business of education.  The 173-year-old group said on Tuesday it would now reduce its stake in the world's biggest consumer book publisher to 25 percent from 47 percent, enabling it to free up cash to return to shareholders and bolster its balance sheet. Shares in the group initially jumped more than 3 percent on the news but were down 6 percent by 0900 GMT as analysts processed what the deal would mean for future dividends, with many estimates coming in below expectations.   Today's deal enables us to realize a significant amount of the value that we've helped to create (at Penguin Random House) whilst continuing to be part of what is the world's biggest and best trade publisher,  said Chief Executive John Fallon. Related CoverageBertelsmann has no plans to buy remaining 25 percent of Random House We'll be using the proceeds to maintain our strong balance sheet, to invest in the ongoing digital transformation of Pearson and return 300 million pounds in excess capital to shareholders.   Established as a joint venture between Pearson and Bertelsmann in 2013, Penguin Random House has an enterprise value of $3.55 billion and a list of authors including John Grisham, Arundhati Roy and Paulo Coelho. Bertelsmann CEO Thomas Rabe said the company had achieved its goal of securing a 75 percent majority holding, with Pearson pledging to retain its 25 percent stake for at least 18 months. As part of the deal, Pearson will receive $968 million plus future dividends including a payout of $66 million in April 2018. The two shareholders will take further dividends in future by increasing the book publisher's leverage to two times net debt to core earnings. Analysts said Pearson had extracted a good price without overly diluting its future earnings. However the sale did not change the underlying pressures facing the group's sprawling education business.  Employing 35,000, Pearson provides everything from textbooks to school testing, college courses and online degrees around the world. Having grown rapidly for years, it started to lose its way in 2015 when the U.S. economy recovered, encouraging more people to take jobs rather than go into higher education. Since then, students have moved to ditch expensive text books for second-hand copies and digital services, hammering Pearson's income and forcing it to cut costs across the business after it reported five profit warnings in four years.  This is the last piece of the family silver to be sold off, after the FT and the Economist, so there's not much scope for Pearson management to pull any more rabbits out of the hat,  said Roddy Davidson, media analyst at Shore Capital. Pearson's shares, down 30 percent in the last year, fell a further 6 percent after the company suggested its future dividend would be in the mid-teens, below market expectations of nearer 27 pence.  Since this would give just over a 2 percent dividend yield, that is likely to mean the stock loses its appeal to income funds, which had held it because of its formal dividend yield (from 2016),  said Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker, a long-time critic of the company with a  sell  rating on the stock.   That could put pressure on the stock moving forwards.

The partnership will also enable Santander, the euro zone's largest bank, to better deliver supply chain finance digitally to its existing clients, the companies said on Tuesday.  The joint offering, which is expected to be rolled out globally next year, will be initially available to the bank's UK clients in late 2017, the companies said.   Santander and Tradeshift hope their collaboration will make it easier for businesses small and large to access affordable working capital, or the cash that businesses need to fund the execution of contracts and orders.   Founded in 2010, Tradeshift has developed a cloud-based platform that allows large companies to keep track of their entire supply chain, by connecting them to the often thousands of companies that they directly or indirectly do business with.   The platform also lets companies interact with each other, including purchasing and invoicing. Tens of billions of dollars are transacted monthly across the Tradeshift platform, according to the company.  Tradeshift's platform makes it easier for banks to track the full supply chain of a large corporation in order to decide whether to offer financing to one of its suppliers.  For example, it could connect the suppliers of aluminum and other metals to the business that builds smartphones for a large technology corporation.     Our goal is to be able to finance each transaction within the supply chain,  Alejandro Romanos, Santander's global head of innovation in supplier finance, said in an interview.  The partnership is the latest joint effort between a large bank and a financial technology startup focused on modernizing finance through more user friendly and efficient technology.  In a bid to stay on top of the changes being driven by the fintech sector, banks have been partnering with young companies or backing them through dedicated corporate venture capital arms. Collaboration has been accelerating over the past year, with startups realizing the benefits of tapping into the banks' vast distribution networks.  Tradeshift inked a similar partnership with HSBC Holdings PLC earlier this year, and received funding from Santander's venture capital arm in December.   We are starting to see the emergence of the first platforms where there is more than one financial institution providing its services  Christian Lanng, Tradeshift's chief executive and co-founder said in an interview.

While the $879 million flotation by the integrated petrochemical producer was still the largest in Malaysia in five years, its lackluster debut may cast a shadow on the other listings lined up for the year. Lotte Chemical Titan, part of the South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, fell 1.8 percent to end at 6.38 ringgit on its first day of trade, giving it a market value of 14.7 billion ringgit ($3.4 billion). The company last week had to cut the size of its offering after its books were undersubscribed and its shares later priced at the bottom of their indicative price range of 6.50-8.00 ringgit per share.  The lackluster performance of the stock is from the revision of the final retail price ... creating a negative perception that the stock's growth was fully priced in previously,  said Mabel Tan, a Public Investment Bank analyst. Tan said Lotte Chemical Titan's valuation was now attractive as it was cheaper than its peers. It is trading at around 10 times its forward price-to-earnings ratio, compared to its regional peers' average of 12.2, she added.  The proceeds raised from our IPO will be used to drive our expansion plan in the ASEAN region to further improve operations and capacity,  said Lotte Chemical Titan CEO Lee Dong Woo said. The funds would be used to construct a polypropylene plant in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, develop an integrated petrochemical facility in Indonesia and upgrade the company's existing naphtha cracker, he added. In contrast to Lotte Chemical Titan's weak debut, rival Petronas Chemicals (PCGB.KL), with a market value of about 55 billion ringgit, rose 1.5 percent on Tuesday. Poor market conditions, weak oil prices and a volatile ringgit have been a deterrent for IPOs in recent years, but the Malaysian market has seen a revival of sorts with several offerings planned for the year. Other IPOs reportedly in the pipeline for this year include fast food operator QSR Brands, which is looking to raise about $500 million, and Edra Energy [IPO-EDRA.KL] which is targeting $500 million to $1 billion. Lotte Chemical Titan had originally planned the IPO for last year but postponed it after South Korean authorities began investigating Lotte Group for alleged wrongdoing. Reporting by Liz Lee and A.

Singh,US,USA,M,A,FASHION,Mergers / Acquisitions / Takeovers,Company News,Apparel and Accessories Retailers (TRBC),Western Europe,Corporate Events,Spain,Fashion,Sweden,Europe,Apparel and Accessories (TRBC),Deals,United States","sector":"Business","content":" (This version of the story was refiled to fix typo in paragraph 13) By Lauren Hirsch NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions for fashion retailers are like a crop top t-shirt: a risk best braved by a select few and avoided after a certain age. Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N), the teen brand with a 125-year heritage, became the latest to demonstrate that on Monday, ending talks about a potential sale after failing to agree terms with potential suitors. Successful deals in the mercurial world of U.S. fashion are rare, and now look even less likely to succeed as sales dip across the board. Cost savings can be counterproductive if it means squeezing money out of marketing and design, and buyers are taking a risk on a style that can easily go out of favor.  As a result, established brands like Abercrombie are having problems finding a savior.   Often, as well as spending the money to buy the brand or business, you then have to spend more to do something strategic that will propel growth, and that means paying out twice before getting a return,  said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. Five of the 20 companies involved in the biggest private equity apparel deals of the last decade have been restructured or gone bankrupt. All struggled under the debt load of a leveraged buyout. The biggest acquisition, Apollo Global Management's roughly $3.1 billion leveraged buyout of Claire's Stores Inc, restructured in 2016.  The second-largest acquisition, J. Crew Group Inc, which TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners bought for about $3 billion, is now being restructured. Gymboree Corp filed for bankruptcy last month, seven years after Bain Capital's $1.8 billion purchase. Mounting Pressure Many U.S. fashion bosses are finding they have no option but to consider a sale as pressure mounts from more affordable fast-fashion chains from Europe such as Zara (ITX.MC) and H&M (HMb.ST), and customers abandon malls in favor of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other online retailers.  Outerwear brand Eddie Bauer, for example, is exploring a sale while also seeking relief from its debt load, sources have told Reuters. Teen brand American Apparel explored a sale last year before ultimately filing for bankruptcy.  As Abercrombie's experience shows, finding a willing buyer at the right price is difficult.   Public company board members are reticent about green-lighting large-scale mergers and acquisitions because it's hard to find a good example of a business that has been rewarded by the equity market for doing so,  said Rohit Singh, who specializes in retail at UBS Investment Bank, not speaking specifically about Abercrombie. Struggling retailers are a tough sell to potential acquirers. Merging with another company risks double the trouble â€“ more brands falling flat and more stores bereft of customers.  Most fashion retailers are locked into store leases, and as landlords watch their malls empty out, they are increasingly unwilling to give their tenants an easy path out.  Perhaps the reason the Abercrombie deal didnâ€™t get done was that theyâ€™ve got way too many stores in way too many malls that donâ€™t make any money, and the cost to unwind those pieces and get out of those stores is just too great to compensate for the upside,  said Mark Belford, a retail specialist at KPMG Corporate Finance.  After failing to strike a deal, Abercrombie now has no choice but to go it alone. On Monday, the New Albany, Ohio-based retailer said it will focus on its growing surf-wear brand Hollister and try to reposition its flagship brand, which has reported falling quarterly sales since 2014.  Sinking Rocks The most successful acquisitions have been those of younger brands, which have room for growth and have yet to develop expensive supply chains and costly, little-used store bases.  Gap Inc's (GPS.N) $150 million purchase of athletic and yoga clothing line Athleta Inc in 2008, for example, gave it a foothold in a growing fashion trend. The acquisition helped save Gap when sales of its jeans slowed as shoppers shifted to leggings. Apparel retailers which bought rivals in the hope of finding growth or eliminating competition have found little payoff. â€œOftentimes, the companies themselves aren't growing, so it doesn't solve the underlying challenge,  said Josh Chernoff, managing director, retail at consultant Parthenon-EY.  If you tie two rocks together, they sink just as fast or faster.  The changing winds of fashion derailed Wolverine Worldwideâ€™s $1.2 billion acquisition of boat shoe maker Sperry and other brands in 2012, several of which Wolverine tried to sell this year.  Shoppersâ€™ addiction to discounting crushed Men's Wearhouse Inc's $1.8 billion acquisition of rival Jos. A. Bank, the value of which was almost written off. The suit retailer's sales plunged after it abandoned its famous  buy-one-get-three-free  specials in the wake of the 2014 merger. Ascena Retail Group Inc (ASNA.O), one of the few serial acquirers in U.S. apparel, has been laid low by its roughly $2.1 billion acquisition of Ann Inc, parent of work-wear line Ann Taylor. The 2015 acquisition was meant to give it a full portfolio of womenswear brands and enable it to cut $150 million over three years in costs as it centralized the different linesâ€™ internet infrastructure, distribution and manufacturing. But sales for all its brands have dropped, most recently a combined 8 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Ascena's market value is now $400 million, roughly 85 percent lower than before the deal.   Fashion is not something you can solve with math,  said Belford.  Fashion â€“ you either get it or you donâ€™t, and it either sells or it sits on the shelf.

Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF European Department said central and eastern Europe's economic growth potential has halved in the past decade and the rapid outflow of skilled workers is an increasing drag. He noted at a conference in Dubrovnik that some governments in the region are even questioning the benefits of European integration. With Europe struggling through a decade of crisis and economic malaise, convergence between the core Western countries and the Eastern periphery has slowed or stopped. This has raised  domestic questions about the validity of painful economic and political reform.   This is a timely reminder to all of us not to fool ourselves into believing that governance and institutional progress are inevitable; not to believe that such progress is an unstoppable outcome, a steady evolution. It is not,  Thomsen said.   Going forward, headwinds will grow stronger,  the Danish economist said. Thomsen, who has led IMF programs with countries such as Greece and Portugal, also noted that the exceptional support from a benign global growth environment that benefited the region when it is initially emerged from Communism, was unlikely to be replicated. Meanwhile, the outflow of skilled workers to Western Europe is a top issue for the region. The IMF estimates that 20 million people have left central and eastern Europe in the past decades -- roughly 5-6 percent of the population. Half of Hungarian and a quarter of Polish manufacturing firms now claim that a shortage of workers is limiting production and inhibiting investment, surveys showed.  Eu Tensions On a political note, Thomsen pointed to increased tensions between some of the EU's eastern members and the European Commission as a key concern. The EU is at loggerheads with Poland about rule-of-law issues and has clashed with Hungary over refugees, among other issues. The turmoil of the past decade has also put into doubt the value of EU membership for countries still outside the bloc.  He added that another concern is that given the disappointments of the past decade, some countries may reverse the political and institutional reforms that were meant to solidify democracy and support long term growth.   Some of the threats of (governance) reversal... are evident in some of the most advanced countries of the region,  Thomsen said.  There is clearly one area where we at the Fund are concerned: central bank independence,  Thomsen said.  In a number of countries central bank independence is under threat.

The raw material used to make nuclear fuel and atomic bombs will be stored in a Soviet-era industrial plant where security was once considered so lax that all the highly enriched uranium kept there was removed in a covert U.S. operation in 1994. The International Atomic Energy Agency's goal now is the same as Washington's 23 years ago as it prepares for next month's launch of its Low Enriched Uranium Bank in the city of Oskemen -- to prevent nuclear proliferation. But this time there will be no weapons-grade uranium involved and in the best-case scenario the $150-million bank will never need to be used.  IAEA member states will be able to  draw  low-enriched uranium at market prices if supplies of fuel to a nuclear power plant are disrupted  due to exceptional circumstances , but the bank will be a lender of last resort. The aim is to discourage nations from spending time and money on developing nuclear-enrichment technologies that might be used to purify uranium to weapons-grade levels, and to deter countries from trying to obtain uranium illegally.  The IAEA wants to have a means to avert any new dispute similar to the standoff over Iran's atomicÂ program before world powers reached a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear activities.Â    Does it guarantee that new countries will not create enrichment facilities? Of course not,  Anton Khlopkov, founding director of the Moscow-based Center for Energy and Security Studies, said of the new bank.  But it creates additional incentives for new nations not to set up enrichment facilities.  Â Â Â   Tight Security  Funding to build the low-enriched uranium bank in eastern Kazakhstan, about 1,000 km (620 miles) from the capital Astana, came from several countries including the United States, and U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett contributed $50 million.  Based in a small industrial building on the territory of the Ulba Metallurgical Plant (UMP), set up in the 1940s to produce components for the Soviet arms nuclear arms program, the bank will store up to 90 tonnes of low-enriched uranium -- enough for a light-water reactor to power a large city for three years. Security will be tight. The bank, which has its own railway terminal, is surrounded by a metal netting fence that is about 3.5 meters high and packed with security cameras.  The UMP's outer rim is protected by two three-meter high fences, one of concrete-and-steel and the other of metal netting, and both have barbed wire on the top. National Guard servicemen patrol the territory with dogs. Ulba plant's head of sales Alexander Khodanov walks along mounts for containers with uranium hexafluoride salt, raw material for nuclear reactors, at the Ulba Metallurgical Plant in the northeastern industrial city of Oskemen, Kazakhstan May 26, 2017. Picture taken May 26, 2017.Shamil ZhumatovBack in 1994, three years after the Soviet Union broke up, the United States had feared criminals would be able to steal the 90-91 percent enriched uranium stored in a warehouse at the UMP -- either to sell it to a state trying to become a nuclear power or to use themselves to build a nuclear device.Â Â   In October and November of that year, with the agreement of the Kazakh government, a team of U.S. specialists secured 600 kg of the radioactive material -- enough to make 24 nuclear bombs -- and flew it safely to the United States. The operation known as Project Sapphire helped Kazakhstan,  a former Soviet republic that became independent in 1991, build trust with the international community and paved the way to the IAEA's decision to base its uranium bank there.  Kazakhstan was also a logical choice as host because it is the world's biggest producer of uranium.  Uranium hexafluoride -- a highly toxic, white-gray, waxy solid used in the enrichment process -- will be stored at the bank in 60 cylinder-shaped containers. It cannot immediately be turned into fuel, a process which would take several months. Slideshow (13 Images) Sixty cylinders will contain about 90 tonnes of uranium hexafluoride,  Alexander Khodanov, the UMP sales director, told Reuters at the plant.  This is enough to produce a full fuel load for a standard nuclear reactor... I think half a year would be sufficient time to supply the material and produce the fuel.  Â Â Â   White Elephant?  Countries such as Iran have said they need enrichment facilities to ensure a steady supply of fuel for nuclear power plants, but none has said it is about to buy any uranium from the bank in Oskemen. Russia has operated a similar bank since 2010 in the grounds of the Angarsk Electrolysis Chemical Complex in southern Siberia which was set up in 1954 to enrich uranium for the Soviet Union. But unlike the Angarsk facility, which is owned and operated by Russia and stores 120 tonnes of low-enriched uranium, the Oskemen bank will be owned and operated by the IAEA.    I think the fact that the Russian bank has not been used in almost a decade shows that the market is working,  Khlopkov said.  I hope the Kazakh one will never be needed either.  Critics question whether there is any need for another uranium bank, especially as the one in Angarsk has never been tapped and uranium is not in short supply globally. Some Kazakhs say the Oskemen facility could become a white elephant, as the Kazakh government must pay for its maintenance and security. But UMP's Khodanov said the new bank's creation was an opportunity for Kazakhstan to sell uranium to the IAEA as the facility it builds up its reserves. Hosting it also carries prestige and signals international recognition of Kazakhstan's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.  Advocates of the bank say demand for low-enriched uranium will grow as more countries turn to nuclear power, and that an independently run facility will help reassure countries that would be reluctant to turn to Russia if they needed uranium.

If approved, users in Malaysia will be able to link their local bank accounts to WeChat Pay and pay for goods and services in ringgit.  Malaysia has a large Chinese community,  Grace Yin said on the sidelines of a Hong Kong technology conference, explaining Tencent's choice of test bed. WeChat Pay and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's affiliate Alipay are turning China cashless by enabling payments or money transfers at the convenience of a code scan. The pair are also expanding internationally in tandem with outbound tourism, getting more businesses to accept their services which allow users to make payments using bank accounts in China without complications posed by currency exchange. Licenses for such cross-border payments differ from those required for local payment services. Hong Kong is currently the only location outside mainland China where WeChat Pay and Alipay offer payment services executed entirely in the local currency. Alipay introduced a separate app for the Hong Kong market in May, its first non-yuan payment app. Global Expansion FILE PHOTO: The information about Tencent's WeChat application is display on a screen at its booth at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2017 in Beijing, China April 28, 2017.Jason Lee/File PhotoTencent is China's biggest gaming and social media firm by revenue. It said there are over 600 million monthly active users of its QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay, the latter of which is embedded in WeChat, China's most popular social media app with 938 million active users. Alipay said it has over 450 million active users. WeChat Pay and Alipay dominate China's mobile banking market, which totaled 18.8 trillion yuan ($2.76 trillion) worth of transactions in the first three months of 2017, according to consultancy Analysys. On Monday, Silicon Valley startup Stripe said it had partnered the pair to allow merchants worldwide using Stripe to accept payments from Chinese consumers via WeChat Pay and Alipay. At present, WeChat Pay can be used at over 130,000 shops in 13 foreign markets - including in the United States, Europe and Japan - and supports 10 currencies, Tencent said. Yin, who declined to give target growth figures, said expanding WeChat Pay overseas required additional layers of regulatory approval, as well as efforts to explain the system to local businesses.  We have a large user base in China. It is often the users compelling the vendors or financial institutions to adopt WeChat Pay, so that happens very fast,  she said. Yin said there is no timeline to offer local payment services to more overseas countries, but said  nothing is impossible .  The short-term target is still Chinese tourists,  she said.  The priority is nearby countries most frequented by them, such as those in Southeast Asia.

Tryg, which reported stronger than expected second-quarter results on Tuesday, sold 2,800 cyber insurance policies in the quarter, up from 700 between January and March. The rapid rise in demand was prompted by the ransomware attack, named  Wannacry , that infected more than 300,000 computers in May and last month's global cyber attack that hit across Russia, Ukraine and multinational firms.   We think that for both big and small businesses it will become just as normal to have a cyber insurance as it is to have a fire insurance,  chief executive Morten Hubbe told Reuters in an interview. With cyber insurance still a relatively new business that also poses risks for insurers, Hubbe said Tryg planned to gradually develop new cyber insurance products to adjust policies to the client's needs rather than launching an all-inclusive product from the beginning.  This is virgin territory both for us and our clients,  he said, noting that he expected this business segment to grow the next five years. Tryg's shares rose 3.6 percent, making it one of the biggest gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 , after the profit beat.  Hubbe said the company was looking for opportunities to grow its cyber business through acquisitions, but had yet to spot obvious targets. Tryg produced premium growth of 2 percent in local currencies over the quarter, the strongest growth in five years.  After a few difficult years we now see that our Danish business is doing well as the economy is gaining traction,  Hubbe said.   The opposite is happening in Norway, where the fall in oil prices is impacting the Norwegian market negatively.

Amir Hossein Zamaninia, Iran's deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs, said Iran's gas production would rise to 1 billion cubic metres a day by the end of the year from the current 800 million cubic metres (mcm) per day.  He said volumes available for export should reach 365 mcm a day by 2021, which is higher than the exports of the world's top liquefied natural gas producer Qatar. France's Total (TOTF.PA) signed a deal earlier this month to help Iran increase gas output from the giant South Pars gas field, which the country shares with Qatar. Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake, alongside Chinese state-owned energy company CNPC with 30 percent and National Iranian Oil Co subsidiary Petropars with 19.9 percent. The deal marked the first by a major global energy company signed with Iran since the easing of sanctions against Tehran in January 2016.  With the contracts signed last week, with the Chinese company and Total and the Iranian company, that is also a very good indication that the assessment by international oil companies is that the return of sanctions is very unlikely, if not impossible,  Zamaninia told a conference in Istanbul.

Hit by a sharp downturn in its biggest markets, Pearson has sold off some of its best known assets in recent years including the Financial Times and the Economist to enable it to invest in its core business of education.  The 173-year-old group said on Tuesday it would now reduce its stake in the world's biggest consumer book publisher to 25 percent from 47 percent, enabling it to free up cash to return to shareholders and bolster its balance sheet. Shares in the group initially jumped more than 3 percent on the news but were down 6 percent by 0900 GMT as analysts processed what the deal would mean for future dividends, with many estimates coming in below expectations.   Today's deal enables us to realize a significant amount of the value that we've helped to create (at Penguin Random House) whilst continuing to be part of what is the world's biggest and best trade publisher,  said Chief Executive John Fallon. Related CoverageBertelsmann has no plans to buy remaining 25 percent of Random House We'll be using the proceeds to maintain our strong balance sheet, to invest in the ongoing digital transformation of Pearson and return 300 million pounds in excess capital to shareholders.   Established as a joint venture between Pearson and Bertelsmann in 2013, Penguin Random House has an enterprise value of $3.55 billion and a list of authors including John Grisham, Arundhati Roy and Paulo Coelho. Bertelsmann CEO Thomas Rabe said the company had achieved its goal of securing a 75 percent majority holding, with Pearson pledging to retain its 25 percent stake for at least 18 months. As part of the deal, Pearson will receive $968 million plus future dividends including a payout of $66 million in April 2018. The two shareholders will take further dividends in future by increasing the book publisher's leverage to two times net debt to core earnings. Analysts said Pearson had extracted a good price without overly diluting its future earnings. However the sale did not change the underlying pressures facing the group's sprawling education business.  Employing 35,000, Pearson provides everything from textbooks to school testing, college courses and online degrees around the world. Having grown rapidly for years, it started to lose its way in 2015 when the U.S. economy recovered, encouraging more people to take jobs rather than go into higher education. Since then, students have moved to ditch expensive text books for second-hand copies and digital services, hammering Pearson's income and forcing it to cut costs across the business after it reported five profit warnings in four years.  This is the last piece of the family silver to be sold off, after the FT and the Economist, so there's not much scope for Pearson management to pull any more rabbits out of the hat,  said Roddy Davidson, media analyst at Shore Capital. Pearson's shares, down 30 percent in the last year, fell a further 6 percent after the company suggested its future dividend would be in the mid-teens, below market expectations of nearer 27 pence.  Since this would give just over a 2 percent dividend yield, that is likely to mean the stock loses its appeal to income funds, which had held it because of its formal dividend yield (from 2016),  said Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker, a long-time critic of the company with a  sell  rating on the stock.   That could put pressure on the stock moving forwards.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads the Thai ruling junta, made use of an executive order last month to pave the way for the project, which has been beset by delays, including negotiations on loan terms. The first phase encompasses six railway stations on a 250-km (155-mile) high-speed line linking the Thai capital of Bangkok and the northeastern province of Nakorn Ratchasima.  This project is part of the development of a regional transport network, in particular China's 'One Belt One Road' initiative that will link Europe, Asia and Southeast Asia together,  Korbsak Pootrakool, vice-minister at the Prime Minister's Office, told reporters. The link forms part of Beijing's regional infrastructure drive to connect Chinese cities with Southeast Asia, including Thailand's industrial zones and its eastern deep sea port.   Some analysts see the project as a centerpiece of China-Thailand relations which appear to have deepened following a 2014 coup by the Thai army. Thailand's government has said Thai firms will be responsible for construction while China will be responsible for the railway technology, signal systems and technical training.  The project will use Thai materials but Chinese technology will be used in the construction,  Prayuth said.  We will send people to learn this so that we can operate the rail system ourselves in the future.

Minutes of a June 29 meeting of the WTO's committee on regional trade agreements, published on Tuesday, record Russia's representative as saying the EU-Ukraine free trade agreement was  an exemplary case of a situation where a free trade area worsened trade conditions for other trading partners . That meant it was a breach of the WTO rules, which say that free trade areas should encourage trade between the signatories without raising new barriers with other countries, the Russian representative said. Russia has launched six trade disputes within its first five years as a WTO member, all of them against Ukraine or the EU. Its most recent complaint, in May this year, accused Ukraine of  a universe of restrictions, prohibitions, requirements and procedures  that discriminated against Russia. Russia's representative at the WTO committee on regional trade agreements said the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States had harmonized trade legislation with Ukraine since the 1990s, and signed a treaty in 2011 on coordinating the removal of technical barriers to trade.  To sum up, there were dozens of bilateral and multilateral agreements in the field of trade and investment that linked Ukraine with the CIS countries. Many of Ukraine's commitments were inconsistent with its obligations under the EU-Ukraine Agreement,  the minutes of the meeting said. Russia's representative also said Ukraine's 2015 law on the natural gas market required the operator of Ukraine's gas pipelines to be a person with at least five years' experience from the European Energy Community or the United States. The Energy Community, which aims to extend the EU's internal energy market to the Balkans and Black Sea region, excludes Russia.  The Russian representative at the WTO meeting asked how excluding pipeline experts from other countries could be justified and how it could correspond with the WTO rules that say free trade agreements should not diminish other countries' rights.  She also said that Russia's share in Ukrainian imports had fallen significantly since Ukraine began implementing its Association Agreement with the EU, while the EU's share had grown. The chairman of the WTO committee invited follow-up written questions, which Ukraine and the EU were asked to respond to by July 20.

While the $879 million flotation by the integrated petrochemical producer was still the largest in Malaysia in five years, its lackluster debut may cast a shadow on the other listings lined up for the year. Lotte Chemical Titan, part of the South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, fell 1.8 percent to end at 6.38 ringgit on its first day of trade, giving it a market value of 14.7 billion ringgit ($3.4 billion). The company last week had to cut the size of its offering after its books were undersubscribed and its shares later priced at the bottom of their indicative price range of 6.50-8.00 ringgit per share.  The lackluster performance of the stock is from the revision of the final retail price ... creating a negative perception that the stock's growth was fully priced in previously,  said Mabel Tan, a Public Investment Bank analyst. Tan said Lotte Chemical Titan's valuation was now attractive as it was cheaper than its peers. It is trading at around 10 times its forward price-to-earnings ratio, compared to its regional peers' average of 12.2, she added.  The proceeds raised from our IPO will be used to drive our expansion plan in the ASEAN region to further improve operations and capacity,  said Lotte Chemical Titan CEO Lee Dong Woo said. The funds would be used to construct a polypropylene plant in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, develop an integrated petrochemical facility in Indonesia and upgrade the company's existing naphtha cracker, he added. In contrast to Lotte Chemical Titan's weak debut, rival Petronas Chemicals (PCGB.KL), with a market value of about 55 billion ringgit, rose 1.5 percent on Tuesday. Poor market conditions, weak oil prices and a volatile ringgit have been a deterrent for IPOs in recent years, but the Malaysian market has seen a revival of sorts with several offerings planned for the year. Other IPOs reportedly in the pipeline for this year include fast food operator QSR Brands, which is looking to raise about $500 million, and Edra Energy [IPO-EDRA.KL] which is targeting $500 million to $1 billion. Lotte Chemical Titan had originally planned the IPO for last year but postponed it after South Korean authorities began investigating Lotte Group for alleged wrongdoing. Reporting by Liz Lee and A.

Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF European Department said central and eastern Europe's economic growth potential has halved in the past decade and the rapid outflow of skilled workers is an increasing drag. He noted at a conference in Dubrovnik that some governments in the region are even questioning the benefits of European integration. With Europe struggling through a decade of crisis and economic malaise, convergence between the core Western countries and the Eastern periphery has slowed or stopped. This has raised  domestic questions about the validity of painful economic and political reform.   This is a timely reminder to all of us not to fool ourselves into believing that governance and institutional progress are inevitable; not to believe that such progress is an unstoppable outcome, a steady evolution. It is not,  Thomsen said.   Going forward, headwinds will grow stronger,  the Danish economist said. Thomsen, who has led IMF programs with countries such as Greece and Portugal, also noted that the exceptional support from a benign global growth environment that benefited the region when it is initially emerged from Communism, was unlikely to be replicated. Meanwhile, the outflow of skilled workers to Western Europe is a top issue for the region. The IMF estimates that 20 million people have left central and eastern Europe in the past decades -- roughly 5-6 percent of the population. Half of Hungarian and a quarter of Polish manufacturing firms now claim that a shortage of workers is limiting production and inhibiting investment, surveys showed.  Eu Tensions On a political note, Thomsen pointed to increased tensions between some of the EU's eastern members and the European Commission as a key concern. The EU is at loggerheads with Poland about rule-of-law issues and has clashed with Hungary over refugees, among other issues. The turmoil of the past decade has also put into doubt the value of EU membership for countries still outside the bloc.  He added that another concern is that given the disappointments of the past decade, some countries may reverse the political and institutional reforms that were meant to solidify democracy and support long term growth.   Some of the threats of (governance) reversal... are evident in some of the most advanced countries of the region,  Thomsen said.  There is clearly one area where we at the Fund are concerned: central bank independence,  Thomsen said.  In a number of countries central bank independence is under threat.

(Volksbank) a Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BB+' with a Stable Outlook and a Viability Rating (VR) of 'bb+'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. Volksbank is a second-tier bank in Italy, headquartered in Bolzano, the northern province of Trentino Alto Adige. The bank provides a range of traditional banking services to its core clientele of individuals and SMEs. In 2015, the bank expanded in neighbouring Veneto through the acquisition of a small cooperative bank, Banca Popolare di Marostica (Marostica). In late 2016 the bank transformed into a limited company from its previous status as a cooperative. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS AND VR Volksbank's Long- and Short-term IDRs are driven by standalone intrinsic strength as captured in the VR. The VR reflects the bank's moderate local franchise and a less diversified business model compared with larger domestic players, as well as the stability and experience of the bank's management. The ratings also factor in Volksbank's acceptable risk appetite and capitalisation. While the latter is generally maintained with adequate buffers over regulatory minimums it may not always be fully commensurate with the bank's risks. The VR further reflects weakened asset quality, following the acquisition of Marostica, and undiversified funding sources. Volksbank has maintained an adequate capacity to attract and retain customers, with some pricing power capabilities in its reference territories, and particularly in its home wealthy Province of Bolzano. However, its competitive positioning at the national level is modest, given Volksbank's lack of size and depth compared with higher-rated domestic banks. In more recently entered geographies the bank generally has limited pricing power. We believe that its undiversified business model, revenue sources and geographical presence render the bank more sensitive to changes in the interest rates cycle. The management of Volksbank benefits from depth, stability and experience and its corporate culture is sound. While transparency is solid and the bank's governance has not to date presented significant risk to creditors, overall governance is less developed than higher-rated peers, for example, in respect of board oversight. The bank's strategy is adequately articulated although this may be subject to change based on market opportunities, as evidenced in the Marostica acquisition in 2015. The acquisition has weakened a number of Volksbank's key financial metrics, making execution of financial objectives more vulnerable to changes in the economic cycle. The bank's CET1 and total capital ratios, both at 11.7% at end-2016, are maintained with satisfactory buffers over regulatory minimums. However, Fitch believes that capitalisation may not be fully commensurate with the bank's risks, in particular those stemming from unreserved impaired loans, which accounted for over 80% of Fitch Core Capital (FCC) at end-2016. The absence of non-core capital in its capital structure means total capital levels and buffers over Pillar II requirements are moderate, compared with other second-tier banks with similar capital ratios. Asset quality is a rating weakness for Volksbank. Prior to Marostica's acquisition, the bank's asset quality metrics reflected generally sound underwriting standards and processes, which helped maintain credit risk at manageable levels, particularly in the credit exposure originated in the Province of Bolzano. However, impaired loan levels increased significantly after the acquisition of Marostica to around 16% of gross loans at end-2016, bringing them more in line with domestic averages but worse than our global universe of rated banks. Fitch expects Volksbank to achieve a gradual reduction in its impaired loan ratio. However, since the bank's approach is biased towards gradual workout to protect collateral values, meaningful reductions in the stock of impaired loans will take time to materialise In our opinion profitability is also a rating weakness, having deteriorated since 2015 due to a significant increase in loan impairment charges (LICs). Revenue sources and margins reflect the bank's ability to reduce funding costs so far by accessing cheaper ECB funding, reducing deposit costs of Marostica customers and switching from deposits to current accounts. The bank also has a good track record of keeping operating costs under reasonable control. Fitch believes that the profitability prospects of Volksbank are sensitive to interest rate cycles and might suffer from its limited ability to re-price its liabilities in the coming quarters. Fitch expects LICs to continue to weigh on profitability, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2016. Although customer funding has generally been stable so far, a bias towards current accounts renders it potentially more volatile during periods of market stress. Volksbank's funding structure is heavily reliant on customer deposits, which accounted for about 70% of total non-equity funding at end-2016. The deposit base is rather granular and has a track record of stability, reflecting the strength of Volksbank's relationship with local territories. The diversification of its funding sources is in line with other second-tier domestic peers but less so than larger and higher-rated banks in Italy. Volksbank's liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios are maintained above 100%. Overall liquidity, however, is weaker than at higher-rated banks, which have more developed contingency plans and broader access to funding. The 'B' Short-Term IDR corresponds to a 'BB+' Long-Term IDR, in line with our criteria. SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) The bank's SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that although external sovereign support is possible it cannot be relied upon, given Volksbank's small size and the adoption into Italian law of the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND VR Volksbank's VR and thus Long-Term IDR are sensitive to a further weakening of asset quality and deterioration of capitalisation. The ratings would be downgraded if the bank's impaired loan ratio proves stubbornly high or increases, especially if this weakens the level of capital encumbrance by unreserved impaired loans. The ratings would also be downgraded if Volksbank fails to recover profitability to sustainable levels, after the operating losses reported in 2016. Negative rating pressure could also arise if the bank's funding and liquidity deteriorate or from a change in risk appetite (eg. excessive growth not accompanied by the necessary internal capital generation or evolution in controls). Volksbank's company profile, notably the bank's moderate franchise, means upside for the VR and IDRs is limited. Over time the ratings could be upgraded if the bank shows a consistent record in reducing its impaired loans and the share of unreserved impaired loans in relation to capital. Evidence of stronger and more stable profitability and a more diversified funding profile, for example through more regular access to secured and unsecured institutional markets, would also benefit the ratings. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upgrade of the SR and upward revision of the SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the sovereign's propensity to support Volksbank. While not impossible, Volksbank's small size and bank resolution tools available in Italy mean a change in the bank's SR and SRF is highly unlikely, in Fitch's view.

If approved, users in Malaysia will be able to link their local bank accounts to WeChat Pay and pay for goods and services in ringgit.  Malaysia has a large Chinese community,  Grace Yin said on the sidelines of a Hong Kong technology conference, explaining Tencent's choice of test bed. WeChat Pay and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's affiliate Alipay are turning China cashless by enabling payments or money transfers at the convenience of a code scan. The pair are also expanding internationally in tandem with outbound tourism, getting more businesses to accept their services which allow users to make payments using bank accounts in China without complications posed by currency exchange. Licenses for such cross-border payments differ from those required for local payment services. Hong Kong is currently the only location outside mainland China where WeChat Pay and Alipay offer payment services executed entirely in the local currency. Alipay introduced a separate app for the Hong Kong market in May, its first non-yuan payment app. Global Expansion FILE PHOTO: The information about Tencent's WeChat application is display on a screen at its booth at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2017 in Beijing, China April 28, 2017.Jason Lee/File PhotoTencent is China's biggest gaming and social media firm by revenue. It said there are over 600 million monthly active users of its QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay, the latter of which is embedded in WeChat, China's most popular social media app with 938 million active users. Alipay said it has over 450 million active users. WeChat Pay and Alipay dominate China's mobile banking market, which totaled 18.8 trillion yuan ($2.76 trillion) worth of transactions in the first three months of 2017, according to consultancy Analysys. On Monday, Silicon Valley startup Stripe said it had partnered the pair to allow merchants worldwide using Stripe to accept payments from Chinese consumers via WeChat Pay and Alipay. At present, WeChat Pay can be used at over 130,000 shops in 13 foreign markets - including in the United States, Europe and Japan - and supports 10 currencies, Tencent said. Yin, who declined to give target growth figures, said expanding WeChat Pay overseas required additional layers of regulatory approval, as well as efforts to explain the system to local businesses.  We have a large user base in China. It is often the users compelling the vendors or financial institutions to adopt WeChat Pay, so that happens very fast,  she said. Yin said there is no timeline to offer local payment services to more overseas countries, but said  nothing is impossible .  The short-term target is still Chinese tourists,  she said.  The priority is nearby countries most frequented by them, such as those in Southeast Asia.

The legislative action comes as major automakers are joining forces with auto suppliers and other groups to prod Congress into action. Last month, a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a Republican draft package of 14 bills that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the committee, said on Monday it was likely that legislation would be introduced this week and a formal hearing on the bills would occur next week.  Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta said last month he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. The draft measures would bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from pre-approving self-driving car technologies. Democrats say the NHTSA must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, and the Association of Global Automakers, representing major foreign automakers including Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Corp (005380.KS), are forming the Coalition for Future Mobility to press Congress to act. The group, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, National Federation of the Blind and Securing Americaâ€™s Future Energy, a group of corporate officials and retired military leaders, plans to begin airing radio ads on Tuesday portraying the legislation as  liberating innovation for self-driving vehicles.  GM, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, has said she plans to quickly update those.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital in the city of Shenyang to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. The hospital said in a short statement that Liu was being  actively rescued  and was suffering from septic shock, an infection in his abdominal cavity and was on dialysis. On Monday, the hospital said he was receiving the same level of treatment and suffered from kidney problems, a swollen stomach, partial intestinal obstruction and falling blood pressure. Calls have grown from rights groups and Western governments for China to allow Liu to travel with his wife, Liu Xia, to be treated abroad.     Jared Genser, a U.S. attorney who represents Liu, urged the Chinese government to allow a transfer, noting that additional treatment abroad could extend Liu's life for several weeks.

The groupâ€™s Index of Small Business Optimism USOPIN=ECI fell to 103.6 last month from 104.5 in May, although it remains near its highest level in more than a decade. The index surged following the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last November, and in January hit its highest level since December 2004. The rise was largely attributed to business owners' optimism surrounding Trumpâ€™s promises of deregulation, tax breaks and infrastructure spending. But Congress' inability to deliver on those promises has muted confidence as business operators grow wary of political infighting over the healthcare reform legislation, and prospects for tax reform are uncertain.  As Washington fails to deliver on those two priorities small-business optimism is dropping,  said Juanita Duggan, president of NFIB.  Gridlock is driving down small-business optimism, which will eventually drive down the economy.  With fewer small businesses anticipating improved business conditions, plans to increase employment have also declined, falling 3 percentage points in June to 15 percent of respondents. May's reading of 18 percent matched the highest level since 2006.  In addition, fewer small businesses expressed willingness to hire in June, according to an NFIB jobs report released last week in connection with the government's monthly non-farm payrolls report for June. Forty-four percent of owners said they were hiring or trying to hire in June, down 5 points from the previous month.  Hiring activity remains strong by historical standards, but the drop in June was unmistakable,  said Bill Dunkelberg, NFIBâ€™s chief economist.  Whether this is the start of a negative trend or a one-month blip is something weâ€™ll have to keep an eye on.

Jaishankar said on Tuesday, commenting on recent tension sparked by Chinese road-building. In early June, according to the Chinese interpretation of events, Indian guards crossed into China's Donglang region and obstructed work on a road on a plateau adjoining the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. Troops from the two sides then confronted each other close to a valley controlled by China that separates India from Bhutan - a close Indian ally - and gives China access to the so-called Chicken's Neck, a thin strip of land that connects India to its remote northeastern regions. Delivering a lecture in Singapore, Jaishankar said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's President Xi Jinping reached consensus on two points at a meeting last month on the sidelines of a regional summit in Astana, Kazakhstan.  The two nuclear-armed Asian neighbors must not allow their differences to become disputes, and should ensure their relations were a factor of stability amid global uncertainty, Jaishankar said, summarizing the two points.  This consensus underlines the strategic maturity with which the two countries must continue to approach each other,  he added at an event hosted by the National University of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Asked specifically about the recent confrontation in the Himalayan region, Jaishankar said the neighbors had experience dealing with such situations.  It is a long border,  Jaishankar said.  As you know, no part of the border has been agreed upon. It is likely that from time to time there are differences.  He added,  It is not the first time that has happened. And when such situations arise, how we handle it...is a test of our maturity.  I see no reason why, when having handled so many situations in the past, we would not be able to handle it.  During his lecture, Jaishankar described the evolving India-China relationship as having direct implications for Asia and perhaps the world. Ties between China and India, which fought a brief border war in 1962, have long been frosty over territorial disputes, as well as Beijing's support of Pakistan, and Indian leaders declined to attend China's  Belt and Road  summit in May.

Covered bonds could be an important new source of funding for banks, particularly if growing demand for credit outstrips deposit growth, as deposits provide about 70% of banks' funding. Retail mortgage loans by banks totalled MAD188 billion (USD18 billion) at end-2016, with growth running at about 5% a year, reflecting strong demand. Deposit growth was 6% in 2016. Some banks have told us they looking into issuing their first covered bonds in 1H18 as they hope the necessary legislation will be in place by then, although progress with legislation has been slow, with asset valuation a sticking point due to data limitations. Investor appetite for covered bonds is untested, but Morocco's capital markets are reasonably deep and well developed, and institutional investors already buy long-term senior and subordinated bonds issued by Moroccan banks. Covered bonds would lessen the maturity mismatches between banks' assets and liabilities, reducing liquidity risk - a credit positive. Retail mortgages loans have maturities of 15 to 25 years but most deposits are contractually short-term, albeit with a high degree of stability. Draft legislation for covered bonds has not been published, but media reports indicate that eligible assets for mortgage covered bonds will include primary mortgage loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%. This would mean that most mortgage loans would qualify as collateral. Asset quality in the Moroccan banking sector is weak by international standards, with impaired loans in retail housing loan books at about 8%. We would therefore expect the covered bonds legislation to include high collateralisation requirements. The high impairment levels reflect long debt-servicing delays, a common practice in Morocco. Write-offs are far lower at about 1% a year. Growth prospects for Morocco's retail housing finance market are positive, supported by strong housing demand, banks' appetite for retail lending and relatively low interest rates. Regulation of the mortgage market is becoming tighter, which is credit-positive for banks, and, although property prices can be volatile, there are no signs of a bubble.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads the Thai ruling junta, made use of an executive order last month to pave the way for the project, which has been beset by delays, including negotiations on loan terms. The first phase encompasses six railway stations on a 250-km (155-mile) high-speed line linking the Thai capital of Bangkok and the northeastern province of Nakorn Ratchasima.  This project is part of the development of a regional transport network, in particular China's 'One Belt One Road' initiative that will link Europe, Asia and Southeast Asia together,  Korbsak Pootrakool, vice-minister at the Prime Minister's Office, told reporters. The link forms part of Beijing's regional infrastructure drive to connect Chinese cities with Southeast Asia, including Thailand's industrial zones and its eastern deep sea port.   Some analysts see the project as a centerpiece of China-Thailand relations which appear to have deepened following a 2014 coup by the Thai army. Thailand's government has said Thai firms will be responsible for construction while China will be responsible for the railway technology, signal systems and technical training.  The project will use Thai materials but Chinese technology will be used in the construction,  Prayuth said.

Yellen starts two days of testimony on Wednesday as the Fed prepares to unwind the massive hoard of bonds it bought to ease the financial crisis.      A Fed rate hike can further dampen appetite for emerging markets as it points to further strengthening in the investment environment for developed markets,  said Grace Aller, an analyst with Manila-based AP Securities.     Singapore shares snapped two sessions of gains with most constituents posting losses.      The performance of the STI today could have been due to fund flows by index-tracking funds and products,  said Liu Jinshu, director of research, NRA Capital.      Generally, investors are also waiting for Yellen's testimony this week for clues about 'reverse' quantitative easing.       Global Logistic Properties was the biggest drag with a drop of 5.9 percent, while DBS Group declined 1.1 percent.          Philippine shares closed 0.3 percent higher, helped by industrial and real estate stocks.     Philippine exports rose for a sixth straight month in May, up 13.7 percent from a year earlier, while imports climbed 16.6 percent.     International Container Terminal Services Inc was among the biggest gainers, closing at its highest in nearly a month, after the company signed a memorandum of understanding with contractor Dredging International to co-operate in further deepening of the Congo River. bit.ly/2uchf8U     Property developer Ayala Land closed 1.3 percent higher after rising as much as 1.8 percent to its highest in nearly three weeks.     Vietnam shares came of early losses to close 0.4 percent higher, lifted by real estate and consumer stocks.           Thai, Indonesian and Malaysian shares were largely flat.

Demand for large-scale energy storage is growing as the price of advanced batteries tumble and nations turn to renewable energy such as solar and wind. Pairing big batteries and other storage systems with renewable energy improves reliability without creating climate-changing emissions. The 50-50 joint venture, called Fluence, will sell the lithium-ion battery technologies currently sold by AES and Siemens(AES.N), respectively.  Right now this is a very fragmented market. You're bringing together two of the leaders,  AES Chief Executive Andres Gluski told Reuters. Siemens technology focuses more on projects for individual companies and enterprises, such as universities and hospitals, while AES targets larger arrays that are incorporated into a region's electrical grid. Last week, Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) beat out privately owned Lyon Group, working with AES, and dozens of other companies for a contract to install the world's biggest grid-scale battery in Australia.  The U.S. energy storage market alone is expected to increase tenfold from 2016 to 2022, to $3.2 billion, according to a report this year by the U.S. Energy Storage Monitor. AES and Siemens currently account for about 17 percent of installed energy storage, said Kevin Yates, president of Siemens' energy management division.    The joint venture will be based in Washington, D.C., with offices in Germany and other international locations.  AES subsidiary AES Energy Storage and Siemensâ€™ battery-based energy storage solutions group will be merged into Fluence, which will operate independently of its two owners. Gluski said he could not say who top management would be until the company finishes undergoing regulatory processes later this year. The joint venture will start with about 100 people. Gluski said Fluence expects to maintain the same base of American, Korean and Japanese battery suppliers as AES. The companies expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval.

The legislative action comes as major automakers are joining forces with auto suppliers and other groups to prod Congress into action. Last month, a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a Republican draft package of 14 bills that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the committee, said on Monday it was likely that legislation would be introduced this week and a formal hearing on the bills would occur next week.  Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta said last month he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. The draft measures would bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from pre-approving self-driving car technologies. Democrats say the NHTSA must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, and the Association of Global Automakers, representing major foreign automakers including Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Corp (005380.KS), are forming the Coalition for Future Mobility to press Congress to act. The group, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, National Federation of the Blind and Securing Americaâ€™s Future Energy, a group of corporate officials and retired military leaders, plans to begin airing radio ads on Tuesday portraying the legislation as  liberating innovation for self-driving vehicles.  GM, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, has said she plans to quickly update those.

The billboards and full-page media ads that have appeared across Hungary depict a smiling Soros - a vocal critic of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government - and the caption:  Don't let Soros have the last laugh.  Some Soros billboards have been defaced with graffiti that reads  stinking Jew . Soros, 86, is a Hungarian Jew who emigrated after World War Two, made his fortune in the United States and has long supported groups promoting liberal, democratic and open-border values in eastern Europe. Michael Vachon, spokesperson for Soros, condemned the billboard campaign as  anti-European  and said it also misrepresented the financier's views on migration.  Last week the Fidesz-led government launched a nationwide billboard and television advertising campaign reminiscent of Europe's darkest hours,  Vachon said in an emailed statement.  The Hungarian regime's xenophobia and demonization of refugees are anti-European.  Orban, a rightwing nationalist, has often clashed with the European Union in the past, most recently over his clampdown on foreign-funded NGOs.  Uncontrolled Emotions  The Federation of Hungarian Jewish Federations (Mazsihisz) has urged Orban to halt the campaign.  This campaign, while not openly anti-Semitic, clearly has the potential to ignite uncontrolled emotions, including anti-Semitism,  they said. In a reply to Mazsihisz, Orban said that it was his duty to protect Hungarians - including the country's 100,000-strong Jewish community -- from illegal migration.  The person who uses his wealth, power, influence and a network of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) funded by him to settle millions of migrants in Hungary and the European Union puts our future in jeopardy,  Orban said in a letter posted by state news agency MTI late on Friday.  The billionaire speculator George Soros has made it quite clear repeatedly that this is precisely what he wants to do.  Vachon said the claim that Soros was promoting a scheme to import millions of illegal immigrants into Europe was  fantasy.   Soros's actual position on migration is that the international community should provide more support to the developing countries that today host 89 percent of refugees and that Europe should accept several hundred thousand fully screened refugees through an orderly process of vetting and resettlement,  he said. Orban's government fortified Hungary's southern border in 2015 against a large influx of migrants from the Middle East and Africa into the EU that year. He has also rejected a quota scheme agreed by European Union leaders to distribute migrants among member states and has repeatedly depicted the mostly Muslim migrants and refugees as a threat to Europe's Christian identity and culture. Orban's government has strongly denied that the billboard campaign has anything to do with anti-Semitism. Orban, who faces a national election in April 2018, has long proclaimed zero tolerance for anti-Semitism, though he has more recently risked angering Jews with remarks apparently meant to court far-right voters. Around 100,000 Jews live in Hungary today, down from more than half a million before the Holocaust.

A decade-long financial crisis has left European banks holding around 1 trillion euros of non-performing loans (NPLs), reducing their ability to lend and slowing down Europe's economic recovery.  The European action plan on non-performing loans to be adopted today is a major step to tackle the problem,  the European Commission Vice-President in charge of the issue, Valdis Dombrovskis, told reporters before a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels. Ministers will invite the EU Commission, which is responsible for proposing legislative changes at EU level, to consider tweaks to banking rules that would increase supervisors' powers and force lenders to raise capital buffers against the risk that loans could turn sour. Dombrovskis said the strategy will include giving bank supervisors more powers to  actively encourage banks to address the problem . Under the plan, the European Central Bank could force banks to step up their buffers against existing NPLs when it deems they are not sufficient. Banks could also be obliged to automatically set aside more capital for new loans when they expect the level of NPLs to grow beyond acceptable levels. At this stage ministers are inviting the European Commission to  consider  legislative changes after having assessed their impact. Banks warned against measures that could be excessive and unduly increase costs.  Supervisors already have wide-ranging powers to address perceived deficiencies in the banks they supervise,  AFME, a financial lobbying group, said in a statement, arguing that there is no evidence supervisory powers need to be increased. Ministers will also propose measures to improve secondary markets for NPLs, which are currently underdeveloped and provide little incentive for banks to unload their bad credit. Just 80 billion euros of NPLs were sold last year. Ministers hope that a better-functioning market would push up the price of NPLs, which are currently sold at small percentages of their nominal values, creating huge holes in the balance sheets of banks which offload them. A bolder plan to set up an EU  bad bank  that could have absorbed big chunks of NPLs at higher prices was dropped. EU states with healthier banks, like Germany, are not keen to use taxpayers' money to help lenders in the mostly southern European countries where the bad loan problem is worst. Ministers agreed a more prudent blueprint to set up national  asset management companies  (AMCs) that could help develop the market for bad loans. Governments could participate in AMCs but only under strict state aid rules intended to avoid distortions to the common EU market. States were also invited to amend national insolvency regimes to speed up the recovery of bad loans from debtors.

Gox pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges relating to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins and cash from what was once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange. French national Mark Karpeles filed the plea in response to charges of embezzlement and data manipulation at the Tokyo District Court, according to a pool report for foreign  journalists. Mt. Gox once handled 80 percent of the world's bitcoin trades but filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing some 850,000 bitcoins - then worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash from its bank accounts. In its bankruptcy filing, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox blamed hackers for the lost bitcoins, pointing to a software security flaw.  Mt. Gox subsequently said it had found 200,000 of the missing bitcoins. Karpeles was indicted for transferring 341 million yen ($3 million) from a Mt. Gox account holding customer funds to an account in his name during September to December 2013. The prosecution also alleged Karpeles boosted the balance of an account in his name in Mt. Gox's trading system. In its opening statement to the court, Karpeles' defense team did not dispute that the transfers took place, but denied they amounted to embezzlement.  Karpeles told the court he was an information technology engineer.  I swear to God that I am innocent,  he said in Japanese to the three-judge panel hearing his case, according to the pool report. Mark Karpeles (C), chief executive of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, attends a news conference after a trial on charges of embezzlement in Tokyo, Japan July 11, 2017.Toru HanaiLicensed Exchanges The collapse of Mt. Gox badly damaged the image of virtual currencies, particularly among risk-averse Japanese investors and corporations. But the bankruptcy also prompted Japan's government to decide how to treat bitcoin, and preceded a push by local regulators to license virtual currency exchanges.  Slideshow (6 Images)Japan this year became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level, part of a government effort to exploit financial technology as a means of stimulating the economy. Interest in bitcoin among Japan's legions of individual investors - encouraged by Tokyo's recognition of the virtual currency as legal tender - has spiked in recent months. Still, institutional investors remain wary, say those running virtual currency exchanges in Tokyo. Japanese firms are also unenthusiastic: Only 4 percent of large and mid-sized firms plan to use bitcoin in the near to medium term, showed a Reuters poll last month.  The value of bitcoin is highly volatile. It hit a record high of $2,980 last month. Like other virtual currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple, bitcoin has no central authority and relies instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new units to the system - technology known as blockchain. Bitcoin can be traded on exchanges in the same manner as stocks and bonds. It has also become a mode of payment for some retailers, and a way to transfer funds without the need for a third party.

Shares in Gocompare, which have risen over 40 percent since it demerged with insurer esure and listed in November, were up 5 percent at 109.6 pence at 0845 GMT on the London Stock Exchange. Economic weakness coupled with rising prices have made price comparison websites operated by Gocompare and Moneysupermarket.com increasingly popular as consumers look to tighten their purse strings. British consumers have suffered the longest decline in their spending power since the 1970s, official data published last month showed, amid slowing wage growth and accelerating inflation, caused by the pound's slide since the UK's vote to exit the European Union. One out of five Britons switch household expenditure items or financial services products regularly, while three out of five switch providers at times, Gocompare Chief Executive Officer Matthew Crummack told Reuters. He added that legal changes and a rise in the insurance premium tax could drive up prices and that along with a  pressured  macroeconomic environment could cause consumers to shop around more.  I think it's very early yet for us to say that there is any concrete macro-trend appearing, but certainly our expectation over time is a combination of factors would generally drive a change in consumer behaviour,  Crummack said. Gocompare.com allows customers to compare rates of insurance policies, financial products and energy tariffs. The company's marketing margin is estimated to have risen to 40 percent from 34.5 percent last year, said Peel Hunt analyst Malcolm Morgan. He raised his full-year pretax profit estimate for the company by 8 percent to about 32.6 million pounds and said new campaigns are expected to accelerate Gocompare's second-half revenue growth by more than 12 percent. Gocompare has forecast high single-digit revenue growth in percentage terms for the full year. Crummack said the group had spent a  modest portion  of Gocompare's cash generation to buy a minority stake in robo-adviser Mortgage Gym. Gocompare has also signed a marketing deal with Haymarket Media, the owner of Autocar magazine, to provide insurance quotes and information to readers, in turn driving traffic, Crummack said.  (The deals are) important steps on the group's journey to diversify its revenue base away from insurance,  Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Nicholas Hyett said.

Amir Hossein Zamaninia, Iran's deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs, said Iran's gas production would rise to 1 billion cubic metres a day by the end of the year from the current 800 million cubic metres (mcm) per day.  He said volumes available for export should reach 365 mcm a day by 2021, which is higher than the exports of the world's top liquefied natural gas producer Qatar. France's Total (TOTF.PA) signed a deal earlier this month to help Iran increase gas output from the giant South Pars gas field, which the country shares with Qatar. Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake, alongside Chinese state-owned energy company CNPC with 30 percent and National Iranian Oil Co subsidiary Petropars with 19.9 percent. The deal marked the first by a major global energy company signed with Iran since the easing of sanctions against Tehran in January 2016.  With the contracts signed last week, with the Chinese company and Total and the Iranian company, that is also a very good indication that the assessment by international oil companies is that the return of sanctions is very unlikely, if not impossible,  Zamaninia told a conference in Istanbul.

The company, which is part of the Indian multinational conglomerate Aditya Birla Group, is starting a naphtha trading desk at its Singapore office, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. Swiss Singapore has hired a trader from South Korea, previously employed by South Korean petrochemical firm Daelim Corp, as its first dedicated naphtha trader but the trader has not started work yet, the source added, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak with the media. Aditya Birla did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.  Petrochemical demand is strong, so (the company) is hoping to capture that,  the source said. He also anticipates increased demand from Saudi Arabia once new petrochemical projects come onstream which could prompt imports into the country. Consulting firm FGE said that Saudi Arabia's naphtha demand will likely rise by about 65,000 barrels per day year-on-year once Sadara Chemical Co's 1.5 million tonnes-per-year cracker ramps up production and PetroRabigh-2 starts operations later this year. Still, declining naphtha margins are making it difficult for companies to be profitable, limiting expansion in the sector to just a few companies, a South Korean naphtha trader said. The naphtha margin for refineries in Singapore rose in February to a more than one-year high of $115.18 a tonne but has since dropped to $55.08. NAF-SIN-CRK Swiss Singapore is also planning to hire one derivatives trader to add to its over 70 trading and operations staff in its Dubai office and could start a new office in the United States by end of the year, the first source said. Swiss Singapore was incorporated in Singapore in 1978 but is headquartered in Dubai. It has a turnover of $4 billion and trading volumes of over 15 million tonnes per year, according to the company website. It trades in coal and oil products such as gasoil and jet fuel. The company has been expanding its trading presence in Asia in recent years, winning contracts to supply oil products into Sri Lanka and Pakistan and purchasing term barrels from Middle East refiners.

After the meeting on June 29, Governor Jiri Rusnok had said that if the Czech National Bank (CNB)'s growth forecast was met, it could raise rates in the third quarter, and then again in 2018. The Czech GDP rose by 3.0 percent year on year in the first quarter, surpassing the bank's forecast of 2.5 percent. It would be the first rise in Czech borrowing costs in nearly a decade and the first in the region. Interest rates around the world are at record lows but now a number of central banks are indicating possible rate hikes. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised has borrowing costs twice this year already. The European Central Bank's asset-buying stimulus programme is expected to end later this year. The CNB, which has held its benchmark rate at 0.05 percent since 2012, took its first policy tightening step in April when it abandoned a currency cap put in place three years prior to keep the crown weak. At the June meeting, the central bank voted 6-0 to leave rates unchanged for now, its minutes, published on Tuesday, showed.  The opinion was expressed that before raising interest rates, there was a need to be sure that the inflation pressures arising from the domestic economy were robust enough to outweigh any anti-inflationary shocks stemming from abroad,  the minutes said. Inflation accelerated to 2.4 percent in May from 2.0 percent in April, moving into the upper half of the central bank's target band of 1-3 percent. The bank is also contending with a hot mortgage loan market and rising housing prices and has put higher capital buffer requirements on banks in order to calm the markets down. It is also seeking new legislative powers to deal with this. The crown was 0.2 percent weaker on the day, trading at 26.146 at 0819 GMT, off a post-cap high of 26.048. However, some saw the minutes as showing a weakening in the bank's intention to raise borrowing costs.  The minutes sent a less clear signal regarding rate hikes than the news conference,  ING's chief economist Jakub Seidler said in a note. A hike in the third quarter would come sooner than expected by analysts in a Reuters poll, in which eight out of 14 respondents saw such move in the last quarter of 2017. The market is pricing in higher interest rates later, sometime early in the first quarter of 2018.

The raw material used to make nuclear fuel and atomic bombs will be stored in a Soviet-era industrial plant where security was once considered so lax that all the highly enriched uranium kept there was removed in a covert U.S. operation in 1994. The International Atomic Energy Agency's goal now is the same as Washington's 23 years ago as it prepares for next month's launch of its Low Enriched Uranium Bank in the city of Oskemen -- to prevent nuclear proliferation. But this time there will be no weapons-grade uranium involved and in the best-case scenario the $150-million bank will never need to be used.  IAEA member states will be able to  draw  low-enriched uranium at market prices if supplies of fuel to a nuclear power plant are disrupted  due to exceptional circumstances , but the bank will be a lender of last resort. The aim is to discourage nations from spending time and money on developing nuclear-enrichment technologies that might be used to purify uranium to weapons-grade levels, and to deter countries from trying to obtain uranium illegally.  The IAEA wants to have a means to avert any new dispute similar to the standoff over Iran's atomicÂ program before world powers reached a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear activities.Â    Does it guarantee that new countries will not create enrichment facilities? Of course not,  Anton Khlopkov, founding director of the Moscow-based Center for Energy and Security Studies, said of the new bank.  But it creates additional incentives for new nations not to set up enrichment facilities.  Â Â Â   Tight Security  Funding to build the low-enriched uranium bank in eastern Kazakhstan, about 1,000 km (620 miles) from the capital Astana, came from several countries including the United States, and U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett contributed $50 million.  Based in a small industrial building on the territory of the Ulba Metallurgical Plant (UMP), set up in the 1940s to produce components for the Soviet arms nuclear arms program, the bank will store up to 90 tonnes of low-enriched uranium -- enough for a light-water reactor to power a large city for three years. Security will be tight. The bank, which has its own railway terminal, is surrounded by a metal netting fence that is about 3.5 meters high and packed with security cameras.  The UMP's outer rim is protected by two three-meter high fences, one of concrete-and-steel and the other of metal netting, and both have barbed wire on the top. National Guard servicemen patrol the territory with dogs. Ulba plant's head of sales Alexander Khodanov walks along mounts for containers with uranium hexafluoride salt, raw material for nuclear reactors, at the Ulba Metallurgical Plant in the northeastern industrial city of Oskemen, Kazakhstan May 26, 2017. Picture taken May 26, 2017.Shamil ZhumatovBack in 1994, three years after the Soviet Union broke up, the United States had feared criminals would be able to steal the 90-91 percent enriched uranium stored in a warehouse at the UMP -- either to sell it to a state trying to become a nuclear power or to use themselves to build a nuclear device.Â Â   In October and November of that year, with the agreement of the Kazakh government, a team of U.S. specialists secured 600 kg of the radioactive material -- enough to make 24 nuclear bombs -- and flew it safely to the United States. The operation known as Project Sapphire helped Kazakhstan,  a former Soviet republic that became independent in 1991, build trust with the international community and paved the way to the IAEA's decision to base its uranium bank there.  Kazakhstan was also a logical choice as host because it is the world's biggest producer of uranium.  Uranium hexafluoride -- a highly toxic, white-gray, waxy solid used in the enrichment process -- will be stored at the bank in 60 cylinder-shaped containers. It cannot immediately be turned into fuel, a process which would take several months. Slideshow (13 Images) Sixty cylinders will contain about 90 tonnes of uranium hexafluoride,  Alexander Khodanov, the UMP sales director, told Reuters at the plant.  This is enough to produce a full fuel load for a standard nuclear reactor... I think half a year would be sufficient time to supply the material and produce the fuel.  Â Â Â   White Elephant?  Countries such as Iran have said they need enrichment facilities to ensure a steady supply of fuel for nuclear power plants, but none has said it is about to buy any uranium from the bank in Oskemen. Russia has operated a similar bank since 2010 in the grounds of the Angarsk Electrolysis Chemical Complex in southern Siberia which was set up in 1954 to enrich uranium for the Soviet Union. But unlike the Angarsk facility, which is owned and operated by Russia and stores 120 tonnes of low-enriched uranium, the Oskemen bank will be owned and operated by the IAEA.    I think the fact that the Russian bank has not been used in almost a decade shows that the market is working,  Khlopkov said.  I hope the Kazakh one will never be needed either.  Critics question whether there is any need for another uranium bank, especially as the one in Angarsk has never been tapped and uranium is not in short supply globally. Some Kazakhs say the Oskemen facility could become a white elephant, as the Kazakh government must pay for its maintenance and security. But UMP's Khodanov said the new bank's creation was an opportunity for Kazakhstan to sell uranium to the IAEA as the facility it builds up its reserves. Hosting it also carries prestige and signals international recognition of Kazakhstan's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.  Advocates of the bank say demand for low-enriched uranium will grow as more countries turn to nuclear power, and that an independently run facility will help reassure countries that would be reluctant to turn to Russia if they needed uranium.

The Outlook is Stable. 'AAA(idn)' Long-Term National Ratings denote the highest ratings assigned by Fitch on its national rating scale for that country. This rating is assigned to issuers or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to all other issuers or obligations in the same country. In Fitch's view, CGIF's credit profile is stronger than Indonesia's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR of 'BBB-', which supports assignment of a 'AAA(idn)' IFS rating on the national scale. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings of CGIF consider its sound capitalisation, prudent investment composition, use of reinsurance to support its underwriting capacity and improving operating profitability. CGIF benefits from its operational linkage to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and shares ADB's multilateral supranational status. CGIF continues to cautiously manage its guarantee operation by adopting, when appropriate, ADB's operational policies and risk-management framework. CGIF's capitalisation in terms of net par-to-capital leverage, as measured by the ratio of after-reinsurance notional insured par to capital, remains manageable despite ongoing expansion of its bond guarantee business.  While several transactions are still in the pipeline, the company's net par-to-capital leverage amounted to 1.16x at end-2016. The company entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty in 4Q16 to underpin its underwriting capacity. Premiums are ceded to a panel of reinsurers with strong credit quality.  Fitch expects CGIF to keep its after-reinsurance par-to-capital leverage below 2x as its portfolio further expands. CGIF's investment composition remains conservative as it invests in only cash and deposits, and fixed-income securities with strong credit quality. The company has no exposure to equity or property investment. Eligible fixed-income securities with maturity term of more than one year must be rated at least 'AA-' on an international scale. Fitch expects ongoing business expansion to steadily lead to an improvement in CGIF's operating profitability because the relative share of fixed costs will decline. CGIF's net profit rose by 29.6% in 2016 to USD10 million while its return on equity rose to 1.4% in 2016 from 1.1% in 2015. Offsetting these positive attributes are its relatively short operating history and business focus on a high-risk-insured portfolio. CGIF provides guarantees on local currency-denominated bonds issued by corporations in south-east Asia, which exposes it to issuers with non-investment-grade ratings and uncapped currency risks. CGIF was established in late 2010 to support the development of debt capital markets in Asia by providing financial guarantees on debt issues, primarily corporate issuers. CGIF commenced operations in 2012 and wrote its first bond guarantee in 2013. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: - An upsurge in the net-par-to-capital leverage ratio to consistently higher than 3:1, - Losses developing in the guarantee portfolio that adversely deviate from expectations, - Increased reliance on reinsurance protection with a reduction in the ratio of net to gross notional par insured significantly below 75%, - CGIF's capital contributors failing to pre-fund business growth with capital infusions, and instead allowing the leverage ratio to (even temporarily) exceed planned benchmarks. CGIF's National IFS Rating and National Long-Term Rating are already at the highest possible level and cannot be upgraded.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.6 percent at 7,323.21 points by 0854 GMT, while mid caps were 0.5 percent lower. Defensive firms and dollar earners were among the biggest weights on the index. They included British American Tobacco , AstraZeneca and Diageo, as well as energy firms Royal Dutch Shell and BP.  There's a bit of strength coming through in the pound, which is causing some of the exporters and bond proxy stocks to have some weakness,  Jonathan Roy, advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments, said. Education publisher Pearson was the biggest faller, down 6.7 percent and giving up early gains after agreeing to sell a 22 percent stake in book publisher Penguin Random House for around $1 billion in a bid to boost its balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. Investors initially reacted positively to the news but others saw the move as insufficient. Pearson's shares have fallen nearly 20 percent this year, struggling after a string of profit warnings as the group battles to get to grips with the rise of digital learning.  Pearson is stripping back from their core businesses, and are they selling the family china?  Charles Hanover Investments' Roy said.  What this is doing is degenerating their core revenue generation model. So, yes, in the short term you've got some capital, but how are you going to earn money going forward?  Marks & Spencer was also punished after a trading update, tumbling 3.5 percent, on rising concern about food sales. Though the retailer said its recovery plan was on track and it stuck to its guidance for its 2017-18 financial year, analysts were disappointed by a 0.1 percent dip in like-for-like M&S food sales in its fiscal first quarter.  With Clothing & Home in line, the concern now relates to (Marks & Spencer's) Food business, which has underperformed the industry for the second quarter in a row,  analysts at Investec said in a note. Shares in peers Tesco and Morrison rose 0.9 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. Among risers, mining firms Anglo American, Glencore and Antofagasta enjoyed gains after the underlying price of copper rose. Among mid-caps, construction company Carillion continued to suffer fallout after its CEO stepped down amidst a full-year profit warning on Monday. It was down another 15.5 percent after plunging nearly 40 percent on Monday. Reporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Susan Fenton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-stocks-idUSL8N1K21HH"},

Economic data released in the region on Tuesday showed a rise in Romanian headline and Hungarian core inflation, but most of the region's central banks are not expected to start lifting their interest rates this year.     Euro zone bond yields resumed their rise ahead of speeches by ECB's Benoit Coeure and Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday and Fed chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday.     Hungarian and Polish government bonds tracked the move, with their yields rising by 1-3 basis points. Their respective 10-year yields traded at 3.18 and 3.33 percent.     The rise is caused by international factors rather than the Hungarian June inflation figures, traders and analysts said.     Annual core inflation rose to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent in may, although the headline figure which also includes volatile food and energy prices dropped to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent.      In the shorter run... inflation should remain on the softer side of the central bank's inflation target band (3 percent +/- one percentage point), thus we do not expect any change in the policy rate this and next year,  said Gergely Urmossy, analyst of Erste group.     The Czech crown led a mild weakening of regional currencies, shedding 0.2 percent against the euro, while the forint and the zloty eased 0.1 percent.      Shielded by the region's relative stability and economic growth, they weakened much less than other emerging market units like the lira, the rouble and the rand.     The Czech central bank said in the minutes of its last meeting that the crown's exchange rate  remained a persisting source of uncertainty  as the currency may ease on selling by investors who bought it before the bank removed its cap on the currency's strength in April.     It said its first rate hike in almost a decade might come later than its projection for the third quarter of 2017 as it needed to make sure that  the inflation pressures arising from the domestic economy were robust enough to outweigh any anti-inflationary shocks stemming from abroad .     The Czech Republic is due to release June inflation figures on Wednesday and analysts expect a drop in the annual rate to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent in May.     Romanian data showed a pick-up to 0.9 percent from 0.6 percent, still a lower level than elsewhere in the region, but analysts expect a fast pick-up later this year.

The company, which mainly finds candidates to fill permanent jobs, reported a record second-quarter gross profit that beat expectations, but its shares fell 2 percent to 479.1 pence by 0900 GMT because of a further decline in the British market. Concern about political stability following last month's election had compounded the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote a year ago, Chief Executive Steve Ingham said.  I think we can assume without clarity it will continue to remain a challenging market for as long as it takes and if that's two years, then it's two years,  Ingham told Reuters.  Clearly we're still doing a lot of work, but to assume that we might start to grow, I don't see it myself,  he said, adding he had seen a particular reluctance to hire from multinationals, which accounted for 20 percent of PageGroup's UK business. The group reported a 4.5 percent fall in British gross profit to 36.6 million pounds ($47.2 million) for the three months to June 30, accelerating from a marginal fall in the previous quarter. Britain generates around a fifth of group profit. PageGroup said financial services hiring fell 15 percent in Britain and the Easter holiday in April hurt temporary hiring. No Financial Jobs Bonanza The group had not seen any significant increase in the number of financial jobs in continental Europe, even though a number of financial companies had committed to moving some operations to continue serving clients in the single market.  The large volume back-office restructuring has largely been done and a lot of that has already been moved to places like India or Eastern Europe,  he said.  What companies are talking about is moving registered offices and very small teams of people. At the moment... we've not really seen any significant large volume new initiatives.  Although PageGroup said it also remained cautious due to elections in Germany and Brazil's economic challenges, it forecast full-year operating profit in line with current consensus of 111.5 million pounds. Growth in Americas and continental Europe mean that group gross profit grew 7.7 percent at constant currency to 182 million pounds, topping analysts expectations of 6.4 percent growth.

Global markets face a squeeze in coming months as the U.S. Federal Reserve starts unwinding its balance sheet and raises rates further,l while the euro zone too has hinted at reducing stimulus. That recently lifted Treasury and German yields to two-month highs and six-month highs respectively. While emerging equities are seen as relatively resilient due to firmer growth and earnings, especially in Asia, currencies are likely to be at the sharp end, with the Turkish lira and South African rand regarded as vulnerable due to current account deficits and messy internal politics. The rand hit two-month lows while the lira lost almost 1 percent to trade just off recent 2-1/2 month lows . The rouble, meanwhile shrugged off a slight oil price rise to also lose one percent to a new six-month low.  A couple of things are changing. If you look at most of G10s there is a rise in real yields and it effectively indicates the period of abnormally low interest rates is coming to an end. That's leading to reappraisal of what's good value in G10 as well as emerging markets,  said Peter Kinsella, head of research at Commonwealth Bank of Australia  Second is oil prices - OPEC are talking of further supply cuts which shows they are finding it hard to balance markets. Falling oil prices are net-net positive for G10 and net-net negative for EM.  Kinsella said, however, that while currencies were the first line of defence, emerging equity and debt markets were supported by valuations which are less rich than during the 2013 selloff. Also within emerging currencies, jitters over threats to the South African central bank's independence and a continued crackdown in Turkey on people suspected of involvement in last year's failed coup were exacerbating risks for these markets. Asian currencies on the other hand were relatively solid, with the rupee and Korean won slipping only marginally. JPMorgan said it had turned underweight in many EMEA emerging currencies, but named the rand its  hedge of choice  due to domestic as well as external risks.  The political climate in South Africa is likely to remain excessively noisy till the end of the year, tail risks of local bond ratings downgrades are growing, and investors till now have been too sanguine on the outlook for local markets,  JPM said in a note to clients. However, MSCI's benchmark emerging equity index rose 0.7 percent as shares tracked global stocks higher. In bond markets, Indonesia continued to market bonds, even adding a euro tranche to the two-dollar tranches, quoting its 10-year dollar note at 4.25 percent. Societe Generale strategist Regis Chatellier said he had adjusted his portfolio in favour of shorter-duration emerging debt especially in central Europe, to guard against the rise in core rates.  After such a long rally a reduction in balance sheets is going to hurt a bit,  he said. In the Gulf, stocks were marginally higher , shrugging off a statement from four Gulf states seeking to step up pressure on Qatar.

Thailand's multibillion-dollar seafood sector has come under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food processing factories. The industry, under pressure from decades of overfishing and demand for cheap seafood, turned to slave labor, according to rights groups. Under an agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, Thai Union said it would take steps toward sustainably caught tuna in its supply chain while ensuring all workers are  safe .  Thai Union recognizes that as a leader in the seafood sector, the operational changes and policies we introduce have a positive impact across the entire industry,  its global director of sustainability Darian McBain told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Among its measures, Thai Union pledged to have human or electronic observers on the vessels it sources from, to allow for inspection and reporting of labor abuse. Greenpeace said the company also agreed to introduce a code of conduct to ensure workers are treated  humanely and fairly , while reducing the use of the  fish aggregating devices  - floating objects used to increase catch but that also harm ocean life. Greenpeace and Thai Union will meet every six months to assess progress. Greenpeace, which had confronted vessels supplying Thai Union in protest previously, said it hoped other industry players will follow suit. It said conditions for laborers on more than 400 vessels supplying Thai Union will improve if the reforms are implemented.  This marks huge progress for our oceans and marine life, and for the rights of people working in the seafood industry,  Greenpeace international executive director Bunny McDiarmid said. Thai Union - with brands such as Chicken of the Sea, John West and Petit Navire - has invested $90 million in initiatives to ensure 100 percent of its tuna is sustainably sourced, with a commitment to achieving a minimum of 75 percent by 2020. The company last year said it would eliminate recruitment fees for its workers, a move aimed at preventing laborers from racking up debts to job brokers and from being exploited and abused.

Berlin introduced the law in 2015 after a series of strikes by smaller unions paralyzed air and train travel in Germany, even though other unions within firms such as Deutsche Bahn [DBN.UL] and Lufthansa had already agreed pay deals. The law applies to companies whose employees are represented by different unions and means that only the union with the largest number of employees can agree pay deals with company management.  The court in Karlsruhe said that the law could remain in place, but amendments had to be made to ensure that larger unions were taking into account the interests of smaller unions.  The challenge was brought by airline unions Vereinigung Cockpit and UFO, doctors' union Marburger Bund, as well as major union Verdi.  UFO had said the law contravened Germany's written constitution because it gives only larger unions the right to agree collective labor agreements, meaning that strikes by smaller unions could be ruled as unlawful and open them up to damages. German labor minister Andrea Nahles, from the SPD social democrats, had argued that the aim of the law was for unions to work together on pay demands.

With the expectations fuelled by increasingly robust-looking global growth, MSCI's 46-country All World share index was up for a third day running, although it started to slip as Europe's bourses lost their footing early on. They were unsettled as euro zone bond yields resumed their march upwards, having paused on Monday, as the focus shifted back to the pace of monetary tightening in the world's largest economies. Janet Yellen starts two days of testimony on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve prepares to unwind the massive hoard of bonds it bought to ease the financial crisis, while top ECB and Bank of England policymakers were speaking in Europe on Tuesday. Germany's 10-year yield edged up 2 basis points to 0.56 percent having more than doubled over the last few weeks. The South African rand, Turkish lira and Russia rouble all dropped around 0.8 percent as the emerging market selling resumed too. Roger Webb, Head of European Credit at Aberdeen Asset Management said the slightly stronger-than-expected global growth numbers had boosted expectations of higher interest rates.  I think the increased hawkishness we have seen from the central banks has led to a fear that we could see a mini-taper tantrum.   I don't think there is too much alarm. I think the move to slightly higher yields in Europe and the U.S., UK and elsewhere is probably understandable.  The dollar ground higher against the basket of currencies including hitting a four-month high of 114.43 yen on the back of the past fortnight's 25 basis-point rise in 10-year U.S. government bond yields. The New Zealand dollar fell to its lowest since June 23 meanwhile after an earthquake hit the country's South Island. The Canadian dollar was down slightly too against its U.S. counterpart as investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision on Wednesday. Forecasters are divided on whether the central bank will raise rates, but data from the overnight index swaps market shows that money markets are almost fully priced for an increase, while an 80 percent chance of a second hike has been implied by December. In commodities, crude oil slipped back after pushing higher overnight in Asia. Increased drilling activity in the United States and uncertainty over Libyan and Nigerian production cuts clouded the future supply outlook, leaving U.S. crude down a third of a dollar at $44.13 a barrel and Brent at $46.57. Spot gold edged lower too, dipping to $1,212.13 an ounce and back near a four-month low touched in the previous session.

The step would put the lender among the first of major Japanese firms to review the role of advisors after the government this year called on firms to clarify the status of former executives who stay on company payrolls as consultants. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration has made corporate governance a key policy plank, keen to shake up a business culture that has often been criticised for putting the interests of executives over shareholders. A trade ministry report published in March noted there were concerns that advisors at Japanese firms can exert undue influence over management without being held accountable to shareholders, and it urged companies to shed light on their roles. MUFG, Japan's largest lender by assets, has  less than 10  special advisors at its core banking unit, all of them either a former chairman or president, said one of the sources.  Given heightened public interest in corporate governance, we have to clarify the role of these advisors and make rules for their compensation schemes. And we plan to make public what they do,  the person said, adding that the board plans to reach a conclusion by the end of the financial year ending in March. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly. An MUFG spokesman declined to comment. Waseda University Professor Hideaki Miyajima, an expert on coporate governance, said that while it was difficult to pin down whether special advisors at Japanese companies do tend to exert undue influence over management, it was important that traditional companies like MUFG address these concerns.  I think the move is likely to followed by companies that have overseas operations or a higher percentage of institutional investors as shareholders,  he added. Other Japanese companies that have acted on the issue of advisors include department store operator J.Front Retailing Co Ltd, which abolished the title of corporate counsel in May. Others have sought to justify the rationale behind the practice. Takeda Pharmaceutical CEO Christophe Weber wrote to shareholders in June, making a case for appointing retiring chairman Yasuchika Hasegawa as corporate counsel. The MUFG review is not seeking to do away with advisors, the sources said, adding that they played an important role as they serve on boards of various foundations and attend social functions as well as funerals on behalf of current management. In Japan, it is customary for senior executives to attend funerals of other executives at client companies.  Top executives are too busy to deal with all this. Advisors are shouldering this burden for us,  said an MUFG senior executive.  We cannot just send anybody. Clients want people with some weight and hence the title of special advisor,  he said. Other corporate governance reforms introduced in Japan over the past two years include guidance from the Tokyo bourse for boards to boost numbers of outside directors and to unwind cross-shareholdings.

Western Digital, in court documents filed July 7, said it has made six proposals since February, including a proposal on June 27 matching the best offer. On June 21, Toshiba said its preferred bidder was a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors offering $18 billion. Since February, Toshiba has been scrambling to sell its memory chip business, the second largest in the industry after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, to cover losses from its ailing nuclear reactor division.  But suitor Western Digital sued Toshiba in San Francisco County Superior Court for an injunction to stop the sale, arguing that a joint-venture it has with Toshiba at a plant in Japan means the chipmaker cannot sell without its consent. In a filing on July 7, Mark Long, the chief financial officer of Western Digital, said the company's most recent offer on June 27, made with private equity firm KKR,  is in line with the highest competing bids for (Toshiba's chip unit) that have been reported in the press.   The actual dollar figure of Western Digital's offer is redacted from the document. Western Digital declined to comment. A Toshiba spokeswoman declined to comment on deal details, but said Western Digital  has not participated in the bid processes  since early this year. Western Digital says the bid processes violate their joint venture contracts, and has been making bid offers separately from the processes. Toshiba has asked the court in San Francisco to dismiss Western Digital's attempt to stop the sale, arguing that the U.S. court does not have proper jurisdiction over a business that is based primarily in Japan and that an injunction would cause it irreparable harm.

The military government has increased the defense budget every year since, although most recent defense purchases have been Chinese, including a controversial deal for three submarines that provoked questions over its transparency. Thailand's defense ministry has stressed that it was not buying exclusively from China and is still making purchases from other countries, including the United States, an old ally. The cabinet approved the purchase of eight further jets in the second phase of a 2015 deal in which Thailand bought four jets from South Korea, Prayuth told reporters in Bangkok.   We got the South Korean ones,  Prayuth added.  You can see that we are not tied to one particular country.  On Monday, the army said the deal was worth 8.8 billion baht ($258 million). Last month, Thailand's army chief said the United States planned to sell four Black Hawk helicopters to Thailand after initially suspending their sale following the 2014 coup. The United States has sold Thailand military equipment worth more than $960 million, including Black Hawk helicopters, air-to-air missile systems and multiple naval missile and torpedo systems, over the past decade.

Fresh data published on Tuesday by eBay shows the number of million euro businesses selling on eBay grew to 1,095 from 731 in Germany last year since 2013 while million pound-plus businesses rose to 663 from 443 in Britain over the same time period.      EBay's two big European markets were collectively responsible for 30 percent of eBay's total net revenue of nearly $9 billion last year, although reported revenue in both markets dipped amid currency declines against the U.S. dollar.    Two examples in the north of England are MusicMagpie.co.uk, which buys used CDs, DVDs and electronics from consumers for resale on eBay in more than 140 countries, and cycling accessory seller MaxGear, now a 3.5 million pound ($4.51 million) a year business.     While the company founded 22 years ago started out as an online auction site for consumers to trade second-hand goods, 80 percent of merchandise now sold via eBay is new, largely fixed-price items, the company reported in the first quarter of 2017.     Commercial sellers in eBay's five main European markets - Germany, Britain, Italy, France and Spain - export, on average, to 20 different countries a piece, said Phuong Nguyen, eBay's senior Director of seller growth, highlighting the international focus for many of its small and medium-sized export businesses.     The third largest country in Europe for millionaire businesses is Italy, where million euro-plus businesses rose 55 percent to 93 from 60 in the four years ending in 2016. More detailed data can be found at inside-ebay.eu/. The United States grew 6.7 percent to $3.87 billion in 2016, making up 43 percent of total eBay revenue, while the rest of Europe and other international markets gained 9 percent in U.S. dollar terms for the remaining 27 percent of company revenue.     Other major international markets include Australia, South Korea and its cross-border business in greater China, eBay said.     EBay is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on July 20, when it is expected to report a 3.6 percent rise in net revenue to $2.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

An alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is trying to oust Islamic State from its headquarters in Raqqa. SDF media official Mustafa Bali said the militias had seized the town of al-Ukeirshi, some 15 km (10 miles) downstream from Raqqa on the Euphrates river. The SDF pushed into Raqqa last month after a long offensive, backed up by air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition. A series of recent advances along the southern bank of the Euphrates have allowed the SDF to completely besiege the militants inside Raqqa and to press on south of the city. The SDF alliance, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, has also been waging fierce battles inside the Old City of Raqqa since last week, after U.S.-led coalition jets breached its historic walls. In al-Ukeirshi, Islamic State killed scores of its own forces execution-style in 2015 for desertion or on accusations of treachery, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Islamic State named the training camp it established in the town after Osama bin Laden, the founder of the al-Qaeda militant group killed by U.S. forces in 2011.

Thailand's multibillion-dollar seafood sector has come under fire in recent years after investigations showed widespread slavery, trafficking and violence on fishing boats and in onshore food processing factories. The industry, under pressure from decades of overfishing and demand for cheap seafood, turned to slave labor, according to rights groups. Under an agreement with environmental group Greenpeace, Thai Union said it would take steps toward sustainably caught tuna in its supply chain while ensuring all workers are  safe .  Thai Union recognizes that as a leader in the seafood sector, the operational changes and policies we introduce have a positive impact across the entire industry,  its global director of sustainability Darian McBain told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Among its measures, Thai Union pledged to have human or electronic observers on the vessels it sources from, to allow for inspection and reporting of labor abuse. Greenpeace said the company also agreed to introduce a code of conduct to ensure workers are treated  humanely and fairly , while reducing the use of the  fish aggregating devices  - floating objects used to increase catch but that also harm ocean life. Greenpeace and Thai Union will meet every six months to assess progress. Greenpeace, which had confronted vessels supplying Thai Union in protest previously, said it hoped other industry players will follow suit. It said conditions for laborers on more than 400 vessels supplying Thai Union will improve if the reforms are implemented.  This marks huge progress for our oceans and marine life, and for the rights of people working in the seafood industry,  Greenpeace international executive director Bunny McDiarmid said. Thai Union - with brands such as Chicken of the Sea, John West and Petit Navire - has invested $90 million in initiatives to ensure 100 percent of its tuna is sustainably sourced, with a commitment to achieving a minimum of 75 percent by 2020. The company last year said it would eliminate recruitment fees for its workers, a move aimed at preventing laborers from racking up debts to job brokers and from being exploited and abused.

The LMEprecious suite of gold and silver contracts was developed with a group of backers including banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which then set up EOS Precious Metals to promote trade in the contracts and benefit from a 50:50 revenue-sharing deal with the LME.  The LME launched its contracts at 0000 GMT on Monday, though volumes did not pick up until the start of the European trading day at 0700 GMT. By close of business on Monday, 75,500 ounces (2.3 tonnes) of gold had traded on the LMEprecious spot contract, exchange data showed. That is worth some $91.3 million at current spot prices.  Typical interbank trade between one party and another would be 5,000-10,000 ounces in a single trade,  said Ross Norman, chief executive of bullion trader Sharps Pixley.  It will be nice to see what the trend is -- if (it picks up), you'd begin to think, here we go.  Market makers were quoting prices on spreads between contracts out to June 2022. A source at one of the EOS partners said:  At this early stage players are finding their feet. It may be a while until people start trading in size.  As well as Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the EOS partnership includes banks ICBC Standard Societe Generale and Natixis, proprietary trader OSTC and the World Gold Council, an industry market development body.  All the banks except Natixis are general clearing members of LMEPrecious, along with brokers Marex Financial and BOCI Global Commodities (UK). OSTC, XTX Markets and Morgan Stanley's commodities unit are non-clearing members, while Natixis is an individual clearing member.   London's gold trade is dominated by over-the-counter (OTC) business conducted bilaterally among networks of brokers, banks and traders. The LME's new contracts aim to capitalize on increasing regulatory scrutiny that is raising costs for banks trading gold over the counter. U.S. exchanges CME Group and ICE have also launched London gold contracts this year, hoping to lure business from the traditional OTC market, which is estimated to be worth $5 trillion a year. Liquidity Split?  Both the LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, and ICE are in the running to take over as operators of the global silver benchmark, the LBMA Silver Price, when incumbents Thomson Reuters and CME Group step down. On the gold front, meanwhile, CME Group's introduction of a spot spread contract in London this year and ICE's launch of a futures contract in January have led market participants to suggest that market liquidity could be fractured.   We will be monitoring volumes and comparing with LBMA to see how LME impinges on OTC volume,  Rhona O'Connell, head of research and forecasts at GFMS, told the Reuters Global Gold Forum on Monday.  With the wings of the regulators beating ever closer with respect to transparency, then some OTC business may well move onto the exchange.   Increased scrutiny of London's financial markets since the LIBOR benchmark interest rate scandal has led to tighter regulatory capital requirements, increasing the push for trades that were once routinely carried out between counterparties to be performed on the exchanges.  Clearing, where an exchange acts as an intermediary to settle trades, is seen by some as an inevitable progression for the gold market.   The clearing aspect, especially for the market makers, reduces capital charges,  one market participant said.

The pan-European STOXX 600 edged down 0.3 percent, while euro zone stocks and blue-chips dipped 0.1 percent, in muted trading punctuated by early earnings updates and more corporate deal-making. Consumer staples including food and drink companies and household goods were the biggest drags, with real estate stocks also falling 0.9 percent. Autos stocks were a bright spot, up 0.8 percent, after data showed Chinese passenger car sales rose.  We note that defensive equity sectors earnings have generally weakened while cyclical sectors keep their positive momentum,  said Valentin Bissat, equity analyst at Mirabaud Asset Management.  Overall for the region, the equity risk premium has decreased, which in turn increases companiesâ€™ buybacks, a trend which is likely to continue in the short term as reduced uncertainties and a cyclical recovery decrease the necessity to hold liquidity in cash,  Bissat added. Pearson wiped out early gains to fall to the bottom of the STOXX, down 3.5 percent after selling a 22 percent stake in publisher Penguin Random House. Analysts at Liberum, which has a 'sell' rating on the restructuring education publisher, were sceptical over the details of the deal. Marks & Spencer reported a rise in full-price sales, but its shares fell 1.9 percent, partly on the back of underwhelming food sales, while rivals Tesco and Morrisons rose. Broker notes spurred some of the biggest individual moves, with semiconductor makers STMicro and AMS top gainers after JP Morgan raised STMicro - a supplier to tech giant Apple - to 'overweight'.  We believe that the market is too cautious on STMicro,  wrote European tech analyst Sandeep Deshpande. Deshpande also said Apple suppliers would have a strong second half, calling the market too sceptical and predicting the semiconductor stocks would meet or beat expectations. Among the top individual drags on the STOXX 600 were Randstad and Adecco, targeted by Deutsche Bank in a note on staffing firms. Analysts at Deutsche cut ratings for the world's two largest staffing companies, saying current employment levels in the United States and Europe were associated with peaking 12-month investor returns. British recruitment firm Hays followed its European peers down 2.4 percent. Meanwhile, in the incipient European earnings season, a strong update from Danish insurer Tryg pushed it up 3.5 percent to a two-year high. Berenberg analyst Iain Pearce said a special dividend could be expected at year-end. Steel industrials firm Thyssenkrupp rose 2.3 percent after saying it would cut 2,000 to 2,500 jobs by the end of the 2019/2020 fiscal year.

The country has been for years battling contamination from fertilizer run-offs, heavy metals and untreated sewage. A survey in 2015 showed nearly two thirds of China's underground water and a third of its surface water was unfit for human contact.  To reverse this, China has pledged to lay 126,000 kilometers of new sewage pipes by 2020, enough to circle the globe three times, and raise urban wastewater treatment by 50 million cubic meters a day, equal to 20,000 Olympic-size pools. This has opened the floodgates to sewage specialists, like Israel's Emefcy (EMC.AX), RWL Water - controlled by Ron Lauder from Estee Lauder (EL.N) and France's Veolia (VIE.PA), who want to grab a share of the market with China's annual environmental spend estimated at 3 trillion yuan ($441 billion) over the next five years.  Right now the problem of wastewater from agriculture and the countryside is very serious and wastewater treatment work is a weak link,  said Tong Weidong, vice-chairman of the legal work commission of China's parliament. Recently, there were reports of villages dumping sewage into the reservoir of the Three Gorges Dam, the world's biggest power station spanning the Yangtze River in central Hubei province. But change is afoot, Tong said. Local officials will be forced to improve sewage capacity under new legislation that make them directly responsible for water quality. Cities need to hike treatment rates to 95 percent by 2020 from 92 percent in 2015, while rural regions in central and western China need to reach 50 percent.  The market is massive,  said Wong-Jin Yong, China CEO for Emefcy, which estimates the potential market opportunity in Beijing and nearby provinces at over $1 billion. Foreign players have been in China for a while, such as Veolia that has water projects across the country, but the focus on a large-scale clean-up has gained impetus recently. China's latest five-year plan released in 2016 emphasizes tackling pollution, while in an action plan published in 2015 the government vowed to improve water quality nationwide by 2030, pledging to spend billions of dollars.  Water purification equipment by Emefcy is seen at a school campus in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, China June 20, 2017. Picture taken June 20, 2017.David StanwayLocal authorities, meanwhile, have struggled to fund their plans, opening the door for more private sector involvement. Firms Rush in Emefcy plans to put eight small-scale sewage treatment units into operation in China by the end of this year and is currently building a local factory. It has installed a mobile plant around the size of a van at a school in southern Changzhou and runs another at a sewage works in Wuxi. Emefcy says its small-scale units can treat 20,000 liters a day, take two months to install and have significantly lower energy costs, making them ideal for the rural market.  Water purification equipment by Emefcy is seen at a school campus in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, China June 20, 2017. Picture taken June 20, 2017.David StanwayRWL Water venture is set to merge with Emefcy in July to  accelerate penetration  in China's rural wastewater sector. They will be competing with local players such as state-run Beijing Enterprises Water Group and China Water Investment, and others like Beijing Sound Environment (0967.HK) and Kangda International (6136.HK). Stricter environmental standards are drawing in companies of all sizes, but big state-owned firms still dominate major projects, said Xue Xiaohu, general manager at Jiangsu Greenway that sells water treatment technology to the textiles industry. China has promised to give environmentally friendly projects a leg up by providing banks more incentives to lend and encouraging green financing. Offshore players have the added hurdle of navigating local rules and typically also need to team up with local partners.  There are challenges in dealing with local governments and that's why our partners kick in,  said Yong from Emefcy, which has a number of Chinese partners including Zhejiang Provincial Energy Group and Jiangsu Jinzi.  Technology is our core skill and we will focus on that.

In Doha, a Western diplomat said creation of a  terror finance monitoring mechanism  would feature in the talks, but declined to elaborate. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE and Egypt imposed sanctions last month, accusing Doha of aiding terrorism, something it denies. The State Department said Tillerson, who forged extensive ties in the Gulf as CEO of ExxonMobil, would hold talks with leaders in Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  He was flying from Istanbul where he attended an international petroleum conference. R.C. Hammond, a senior adviser to Tillerson, said he would explore ways to end a stalemate following Qatar's rejection of 13 demands issued as condition for ending sanctions.  The trips to Saudi Arabia and Qatar are about the art of the possible,  said Hammond, who added that the 13 demands  are done  and  are not worth revisiting as a package. Individually there are things in there that could work . The demands included the closing of Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based pan-Arab television network, and a Turkish military base in Qatar. Saudi Arabia and its backers, which accuse Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs, have threatened further sanctions against the emirate. Al Jazeera denies the allegations. Riyadh and its allies accuse Qatar of financing extremist groups and allying with Iran, the Gulf Arab states' regional rival. Qatar denies that it supports militant organizations, and many experts see the blockade as an attempt by Saudi Arabia to rein in Qatarâ€™s increasingly independent foreign policy.

It's a two-way street,  he said.  There are no clean hands here.   We want progress on terrorism financing. The president strongly believes that if you cut off financing, you cut off the ability of terror to take hold in new areas,  Hammond said.

Total vehicle sales hit 2.17 million in June, up 4.5 percent from a year earlier, while sales for the first half of the year rose 3.8 percent to 13.4 million vehicles, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Tuesday. The rise in sales, which industry insiders said was helped by hefty discounting, lends a sheen to the world's largest auto market, but growth overall is struggling to keep pace with 2016 when the market grew at its fastest pace in three years. Overall vehicle demand in China would likely grow just 1-4 percent this year, mainly because consumers made purchases last year to benefit from lower tax rates, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. In January, CAAM predicted sales would rise 5 percent this year, slowing from 13.7 percent in 2016, citing the rollback of a tax incentive for small-engine cars and economic pressures. It stuck with that forecast on Tuesday. June's rise, however, marks an improvement from April and May, when vehicle sales fell 2.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, registering two straight months of declines for the first time since 2015. Peter Fleet, Ford Motor Co's Asia-Pacific chief, told Reuters average vehicle transaction prices in China had fallen about 4 percent in the first half of this year against 2016.  We continue to see negative industry pricing in China,  he said. Ford is among the foreign brands strong in the small sedan segment that have seen China sales slow this year, others being General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG. Buyers in China have shied away since the purchase tax on vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters or below rose to 7.5 percent, from 5 percent, at the start of the year.  However, there is one bright spot: sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) - all-electric battery vehicles and plug-in electric hybrids - that saw a 33 percent bump in June to 59,000 units, the latest CAAM data shows. In the first half of this year, sales volume of such NEVs totaled 195,000 vehicles, up 14.4 percent.

The partnership will also enable Santander, the euro zone's largest bank, to better deliver supply chain finance digitally to its existing clients, the companies said on Tuesday.  The joint offering, which is expected to be rolled out globally next year, will be initially available to the bank's UK clients in late 2017, the companies said.   Santander and Tradeshift hope their collaboration will make it easier for businesses small and large to access affordable working capital, or the cash that businesses need to fund the execution of contracts and orders.   Founded in 2010, Tradeshift has developed a cloud-based platform that allows large companies to keep track of their entire supply chain, by connecting them to the often thousands of companies that they directly or indirectly do business with.   The platform also lets companies interact with each other, including purchasing and invoicing. Tens of billions of dollars are transacted monthly across the Tradeshift platform, according to the company.  Tradeshift's platform makes it easier for banks to track the full supply chain of a large corporation in order to decide whether to offer financing to one of its suppliers.  For example, it could connect the suppliers of aluminum and other metals to the business that builds smartphones for a large technology corporation.     Our goal is to be able to finance each transaction within the supply chain,  Alejandro Romanos, Santander's global head of innovation in supplier finance, said in an interview.  The partnership is the latest joint effort between a large bank and a financial technology startup focused on modernizing finance through more user friendly and efficient technology.  In a bid to stay on top of the changes being driven by the fintech sector, banks have been partnering with young companies or backing them through dedicated corporate venture capital arms. Collaboration has been accelerating over the past year, with startups realizing the benefits of tapping into the banks' vast distribution networks.  Tradeshift inked a similar partnership with HSBC Holdings PLC earlier this year, and received funding from Santander's venture capital arm in December.   We are starting to see the emergence of the first platforms where there is more than one financial institution providing its services  Christian Lanng, Tradeshift's chief executive and co-founder said in an interview.

That's why â€“ 10 years ago â€“ the mother of two joined the country's 400 to 500 deminers, digging up remnants of past and present wars â€“ bombs, unexploded ordnances and landmines. She's one of a growing number of women to take up the risky business, most of them mothers wanting to provide safety for their families.  It's my way of contributing and making this country better,  she said.  I sent my children to Uganda, but I want them to come back one day. It's a sacrifice for me, but a gain for those returning when the war is over.  Landmines have a long history in South Sudan, the world's youngest nation that won independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long and violent liberation struggle. After just two years, a political squabble escalated into renewed civil war in late 2013, fracturing the new nation along ethnic lines. More than four million mines and explosive devices have been found and destroyed in South Sudan over the last decade, says the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS). While some accidents are recorded, UNMAS believes that at least 90 percent go unreported. War Remnants Margret currently works around Kolye village, a 30 minute drive on unpaved bumpy roads from the South Sudanese capital Juba in a lush setting of green fields and mango trees.  The area saw heavy fighting between the Sudanese army and southern rebels during Sudan's long civil war which ended in 2005, paving the way for the South's independence. Deadly anti-personnel fragmentation mines were laid by Khartoum's forces to protect their barracks. More than a decade later, they are still killing civilians.  Soldiers placing mines think carefully about how humans behave, where they go and what they do. That is why mines are found alongside roads, in market places or by water points,  said Jan MÃ¸ller Hansen of DanChurchAid's demining project, the organization that also employs Margret.  While mines are easy to place, they are hard to remove. After an eight-week training course, Margret has dug out hundreds of them throughout her career and â€“ on a good day â€“ she can cover up to 30 square meters (320 square feet).   We can use the safe land to build roads, hospitals and schools and that's what excites me the most,  she smiled. According to UNMAS's demining chief, Tim Lardner, it will take at least another 10 years to clear up the whole country that is roughly the size of France. South Sudan signed the Mine Ban Treaty less than six months after independence in 2011, deeming anti-personnel mines illegal and their removal mandatory. Renewed war has complicated efforts to remove mines from previous conflicts, while rebel forces, without providing evidence, have accused the government of laying new explosives in violation of the treaty, a charge it denies. A Deminer's Day Margret works together with her friend Angaika, a mother of four and deminer since 2006. They start at eight in the morning, with a driver taking the 10-person team out to the field.  Their operation area is well equipped with a briefing tent, several medics and an ambulance. But the nearest hospital is 15 km (9 miles) along dire roads, while the threat of ambush or looting by armed groups makes the work even more dangerous.  Each day we communicate through high frequency radios and satellite phones to find out if conditions are safe. We don't want to become victims of violence,  said Margret, who did not give her full name. Finding explosives is hands-on work and, dripping sweat in their thick uniforms, teams clear the area inch by inch with metal detectors, scissors and garden tools to cut down grass and dig out explosive devices.  My heart still beats faster when my detector beeps. I know that I could be very close to a mine, but I know my work and am not afraid,  said Angaika.  I think about my children in those moments. My work is for them and their future families. That's what makes me strong.  Once the mine is dug up â€“ it can take up to 30 minutes â€“ a controlled explosion is usually carried out on site.  Ongoing Work Newly discovered minefields are still registered monthly in South Sudan.   Local communities often inform us about devices they have seen,  DCA's MÃ¸ller Hansen said.  They recognize them from the awareness training they receive.  Koyle, a once lively community, is now deserted due to the menace of landmines. Farmers have left their green and fertile fields, leaving silence except for birdsong.  After 10 weeks, Margret and Angaika's team is on its final stretch before a week's break. They started in mid-May and have since cleared almost the whole field of about an acre. Ahead of them are red posts and danger signs - marking out their next project.

The reason, she explained, was that no one could tolerate the terrible smell and leakages of urine and faeces caused by obstetric fistula, an agonizing childbirth injury which Amina, now aged 20, developed when she had her baby in her early teens.  But not going to the mosque was the least of her problems.Â  A refugee from Central African Republic who fled marauding gangs and highway henchmen as a 10-year-old with her nomad parents, Amina was married off by her family aged just 13. â€œIt was a forced marriage. They wanted me to marry quickly, though I didnâ€™t want to,â€� she said quietly. After her fistula developed, her husband told her to go and live with her aunt, as her parents were on the move.  â€œHe did not visit me even once,â€� she said.   After a few months, her aunt also kicked Amina out of her home, leaving her to fend for herself in the refugee camp. Suicide by Starving Obstetric fistula is a hole that develops between the birth canal and bladder or rectum, caused by prolonged, obstructed labor, leaving women leaking urine, faeces or both.  Girls who fall pregnant at a young age are particularly susceptible, as their bodies may not be mature enough to cope with the physical strain of bearing a child. The social consequences are often severe. Girls and women are unable to work, becoming isolated and abandoned by their husbands, relatives and children, publicly shamed and even driven from their homes.Â  Instead of getting support and medical help - which is often too far away, too expensive or simply unavailable - many are dubbed witches and shunned.  Some commit suicide. Others do it slowly, starving themselves to death in a desperate bid to stop the leaking. In Cameroon, every year around 2,000 women develop fistula, an average rate of more than 5 new cases each day, said Jean Pierre Tsafack, a health expert with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). But a new program launched this week in eastern Cameroon, funded by the UNFPA and Fondation Orange, the philanthropic arm of the telecoms firm Orange, is offering free surgery to heal fistula victims and help them rebuild their lives. The program in Batouri is the second such initiative in the countryâ€™s East Region, and aims to provide operations for 120 women over two years. In addition, more than 600 women have been successfully treated at the fistula repair center in NgaoundÃ©rÃ©, the capital of Cameroon's Adamawa region, set up in 2013 with UNFPA support. â€œAfter the operation, the women are completely transformed,â€� said Joseph RÃ©nÃ© Boum, head of the UNFPA office in Bertoua in east Cameroon. â€œThey become beautiful, smiling - they start their lives again.â€� Business Training Yet the fistula surgery is only the first step to recovery. The UNFPA also runs reintegration programs for survivors, said Angelique Dikoume, a gender specialist with the agency. First a series of conversations is held with the woman's family and heath workers who explain exactly what fistula is, how it happened - and how it may be prevented from reoccurring.Â  â€œWe can advise families on contraceptive methods, and we also explain to the husband that after the operation, the woman shouldnâ€™t have sex for six months, in order to allow the healing to take place,â€� said Dikoume. On Tuesday, policymakers, donors and advocates will gather in London for a family planning summit that will discuss ways to reach an international goal to provide 120 million more women and girls with access to modern contraception by 2020. The second part of the Cameroon program is economic support for women and girls to identify business opportunities and provide vocational training. â€œRe-integration is very difficult as it often meansÂ starting again from zero,â€� said community health worker Marie Sebo. â€œMany women start by doing some farming, to keep malnutrition at bay.â€� Fifty-year-old widow Sophie Makoro suffered with fistula for a decade - which not only isolated her socially, but also cut off her only source of income selling vegetables at the market.   â€œPeople refused to buy anything off me. They were scared of me because of the smell,â€� she said. To make ends meet, she would sell her crops to neighbors. â€œThat was the only way people would buy my goods,â€� she said. Now, after surgery, she plans to expand her farm. But she is also anxious about the challenges ahead as she gets older.Â  â€œI donâ€™t have anyone to support me - no husband, no children. I rely only on myself,â€� she said. Hospital Ship More free fistula operations are planned for Cameroon.  In September, the world's largest civilian floating hospital, run by international faith-based group Mercy Ships, is due to arrive in the port city of Douala to carry out thousands of critical treatments, including 500 fistula operations. But UNFPA Cameroon head Barbara Sow is also seeking longer-term solutions, such as establishing a foundation for the treatment of obstetric fistula nationwide.  It's so easy to do - to change the life of a woman.  After Amina was abandoned by her husband and her aunt, Aya, a woman in her 60s and a fellow refugee from Central African Republic, met the teenager wandering alone in a camp and took her in to live with her and her daughter. â€œWhy? Because Iâ€™m a mother,â€� she shrugged, holding Amina's hand. Until now, Amina has been home-bound, cooking, while Aya's daughter sells water in plastic bottles collected by her mother. â€œThatâ€™s how we get by,â€� Aya explained, clutching a bag of empty bottles she had just gathered at the hospital.Â  Now that she is recovering, Amina hopes to start her own business. â€œI want to sell clothes,â€� she said. Asked if she would go back to her husband, Amina laughed, shaking her finger. â€œNo way,â€� she exclaimed. â€œNever! Never!â€� â€œI will make new friends and start again,â€� she said.

Â Â Â   I wake up early, light up the fire and rush to the market to buy meat, cooking oil, tomatoes and everything I need for the day,  said the 25-year-old mother ofÂ two. Â Â Â  Shrouded in a cloud of smoke, and with a traditional colourful 'khanga' tied round her waist, Mbiku takes someÂ maizeÂ flour from a sachet and sprinkles it into boiling water while briskly stirring with a stick to make it stiff. Â Â Â   I cook ugali every day because most of my customers like it,  Mbiku told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  It's not a lucrative business, but I get enough to feed my family.  Â Â  Â Â Â  Mbiku is among dozens of food vendors trying to earn a living amid the hubbub of the Dar es Salaam bus terminal, where conductors hoot and yell to attract customers.  She works eight hours and day, earning around 45,000 shillings ($20) to supplement her husband's income as a mason. But unlike licensed hawkers who work from rows of wooden stalls, Mbiku cooks in the open air and is often harassed by the cityÂ militiasÂ for selling food withoutÂ the proper papers. Â Â Â   They often seize my cooking pots and sometimes lock me up. I have to pay some money to be released and get my stuff back,  she said. Â Â Â  Mbiku and other women with unlicensed businesses finally have a glimmer of hope after the Tanzanian governmentÂ last monthÂ announced it would recognize them as part of its broader policy of empowering women. Maria Ezekiel, 31, who has a stall serving chicken soup, chapati and tea along the busy Bagamoyo highway each morning, said the move to formalizeÂ micro-enterprises like hersÂ was an  important milestone for small-scale entrepreneurs. A license would allow her to apply for credit to upgrade her business, she said.  I think it's a very good opportunity for me. As soon as the identity cards are issued I will start processing my bank loan,  Ezekiel told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  I want to borrow at least 500,000 shillings ($225) to modernize my cooking business.  The roadside chef wants to buy better equipment and switch to a gas stove to replace the smoky firewood she now cooks on. Unprotected Operating in the informal sector leaves women without protection and unable to access credit, experts say.  Urban food vending may be aÂ goodÂ tool for creating livelihood security for the urban poor, but to achieve this there has to be better policy initiatives,  said Haji Semboja, economics professor at the University of Dar es Salaam. Presenting theÂ annual budgetÂ in June, Tanzania's finance minister, Philip Mpango, said all food vendors - most of whom are women - would be brought into the mainstream sector.Â  The government would work with regional authorities to identify informal businesses and license them before 2020, he said.  We will issue identity cards and designate special premises for them,  the minister told parliament. Â Â Â  Margareth Chacha, a banker and former chief executive ofÂ Tanzania Women's Bank that supports small-scale women entrepreneurs, said women are held back because of strict loan conditions imposed by banks. Â Â Â   Most of the women can't access the loans because the conditions are too tough,  she said.  But if the government can act as a guarantor, I'm sure the banks will be willing to give loans.  The benefits of thriving women-led businesses are felt throughout the economy, she said. Back at Tegeta bus terminal, Olivia Mbiku says she is now hoping for a more stable, prosperous future.  Â Â Â   I would very much like to get a bank loan and start a big catering business,  she said.

Total vehicle sales hit 2.17 million in June, up 4.5 percent from a year earlier, while sales for the first half of the year rose 3.8 percent to 13.4 million vehicles, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Tuesday. The rise in sales, which industry insiders said was helped by hefty discounting, lends a sheen to the world's largest auto market, but growth overall is struggling to keep pace with 2016 when the market grew at its fastest pace in three years. Overall vehicle demand in China would likely grow just 1-4 percent this year, mainly because consumers made purchases last year to benefit from lower tax rates, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. In January, CAAM predicted sales would rise 5 percent this year, slowing from 13.7 percent in 2016, citing the rollback of a tax incentive for small-engine cars and economic pressures. It stuck with that forecast on Tuesday. June's rise, however, marks an improvement from April and May, when vehicle sales fell 2.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, registering two straight months of declines for the first time since 2015. Peter Fleet, Ford Motor Co's Asia-Pacific chief, told Reuters average vehicle transaction prices in China had fallen about 4 percent in the first half of this year against 2016.  We continue to see negative industry pricing in China,  he said. Ford is among the foreign brands strong in the small sedan segment that have seen China sales slow this year, others being General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG. Buyers in China have shied away since the purchase tax on vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters or below rose to 7.5 percent, from 5 percent, at the start of the year.  However, there is one bright spot: sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) - all-electric battery vehicles and plug-in electric hybrids - that saw a 33 percent bump in June to 59,000 units, the latest CAAM data shows. In the first half of this year, sales volume of such NEVs totaled 195,000 vehicles, up 14.4 percent.  China is the world's largest market for green energy vehicles, with the government aggressively promoting the segment, including spending billions in subsidies, in a bid to fight intense urban air pollution.

The new auction, which is expected to take place later this year, will limit the amount of spectrum companies such as BT and EE Ltd (IPO-EEL.L) could win to 85 MHz in the 3.4 GHz band, restricting the companies' overall share of mobile spectrum. Vodafone would be able to gain a maximum of 160 MHz of spectrum across the 2.3 GHZ and 3.4 GHz bands under these restrictions. The regulator, however, has not placed restrictions on any other bidder, based on current spectrum holdings. Licences to use 190 MHz of spectrum would be auctioned in two frequency bands, increasing airwaves available for mobile devices by almost a third. Ofcom said 40 MHz of spectrum would be auctioned in the 2.3 GHz band, which is already supported by mobile device makers such as Apple, Samsung Electronics and HTC , and could be used immediately to provide extra capacity leading to faster browsing and download speeds. The remaining 150 MHz of the spectrum would be auctioned in the 3.4 GHz band, which is currently being used for 4G wireless broadband to fixed devices in countries such as UK, Canada and Spain. Ofcom has set reserve prices of 10 million pounds per 10 MHz lot of the 2.3GHz band, and 1 million pounds for a 5 MHz block in the 3.4GHz band.

Tryg, which reported stronger than expected second-quarter results on Tuesday, sold 2,800 cyber insurance policies in the quarter, up from 700 between January and March. The rapid rise in demand was prompted by the ransomware attack, named  Wannacry , that infected more than 300,000 computers in May and last month's global cyber attack that hit across Russia, Ukraine and multinational firms.   We think that for both big and small businesses it will become just as normal to have a cyber insurance as it is to have a fire insurance,  chief executive Morten Hubbe told Reuters in an interview. With cyber insurance still a relatively new business that also poses risks for insurers, Hubbe said Tryg planned to gradually develop new cyber insurance products to adjust policies to the client's needs rather than launching an all-inclusive product from the beginning.  This is virgin territory both for us and our clients,  he said, noting that he expected this business segment to grow the next five years. Tryg's shares rose 3.6 percent, making it one of the biggest gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 , after the profit beat.  Hubbe said the company was looking for opportunities to grow its cyber business through acquisitions, but had yet to spot obvious targets. Tryg produced premium growth of 2 percent in local currencies over the quarter, the strongest growth in five years.  After a few difficult years we now see that our Danish business is doing well as the economy is gaining traction,  Hubbe said.   The opposite is happening in Norway, where the fall in oil prices is impacting the Norwegian market negatively.

The step would put the lender among the first of major Japanese firms to review the role of advisors after the government this year called on firms to clarify the status of former executives who stay on company payrolls as consultants. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration has made corporate governance a key policy plank, keen to shake up a business culture that has often been criticised for putting the interests of executives over shareholders. A trade ministry report published in March noted there were concerns that advisors at Japanese firms can exert undue influence over management without being held accountable by shareholders, and it urged companies to shed light on their roles. MUFG, Japan's largest lender by assets, has  less than 10  special advisors at its core banking unit, all of them either a former chairman or president, said one of the sources.  Given heightened public interest in corporate governance, we have to clarify the role of these advisors and make rules for their compensation schemes. And we plan to make public what they do,  the person said, adding that the board plans to reach a conclusion by the end of the financial year ending in March. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly. An MUFG spokesman declined to comment. Other Japanese companies that have acted on the issue of advisors include department store operator J.Front Retailing Co Ltd, which abolished the title of corporate counsel in May. Others have sought to justify the rationale behind the practice. Takeda Pharmaceutical CEO Christophe Weber wrote to shareholders in June, making a case for appointing retiring chairman Yasuchika Hasegawa as corporate counsel. The MUFG review is not seeking to do away with advisors, the sources said, adding that they played an important role as they serve on boards of various foundations and attend social functions as well as funerals on behalf of current management. In Japan, it is customary for senior executives to attend funerals of other executives at client companies.  Top executives are too busy to deal with all this. Advisors are shouldering this burden for us,  said an MUFG senior executive.  We cannot just send anybody. Clients want people with some weight and hence the title of special advisor,  he said. Other corporate governance reforms introduced in Japan over the past two years include guidance from the Tokyo bourse for boards to boost numbers of outside directors and to unwind cross-shareholdings.

China's oil majors and about 150 brokerages have also registered, but the strong interest by 'mom-and-pop' investors looks set to mark out China's crude futures from western counterparts, which are dominated by institutional investors. Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will run China's contract, says it is finalizing technical issues. The contract has faced years of delays and there is still no set date, but INE and also trading participants now say a launch this year is almost certain.  The INE is striving to launch the crude oil futures within this year,  a spokeswoman said, adding that the exchange has conducted four trials to ensure it is technically ready. Oil futures trading volume is small during Asian hours despite the region's role as the world's top consumer. Shanghai's crude futures are aimed at giving China more clout in pricing crude in Asia and a share of the trillions of dollars in oil futures trade. The INE hopes to attract foreign investors, and locally registered entities of JPMorgan and UBS are among those registered, although international players have raised concerns, including denomination in yuan, that may dampen early take-up. Most oil trades are priced off two crude derivatives, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and London's Brent, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group.  Earlier attempts to establish an Asian derivative crude contract by Singapore and Tokyo foundered. The only liquid crude futures in the region is the Oman contract on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange. Retail Interest Successful crude derivatives would be the jewel in the crown in China's push to ramp up futures trading on products from dates to steel to open up markets and offer new avenues for investors.  While Chinese banks are barred from futures trading, the new market is expected to attract interest from deep-pocketed private equity firms and funds, while state-owned oil majors, like PetroChina and Sinopec will provide liquidity. PetroChina is set to register two accounts and Sinopec is setting up a trading outfit in Shanghai dedicated to the contract, said senior company sources. Independent refiners like Shandong Chambroad Group have also joined, while retail interest is strong. Individuals already account for 80 percent of turnover on China's $8 trillion equity markets, and day traders have whipsawed commodities from eggs to iron ore in China over the past year. Jin Changyi, a 40-year-old former hotel owner from eastern China, who began dabbling in Brent crude oil futures last year, has opened a 500,000-yuan ($75,000) account with a Shanghai-based brokerage and plans to act as a mini-broker for friends.  The way it's designed it won't fluctuate wildly. Compared to trading Brent, the risks are more manageable,  he told Reuters. International Concerns International interest at first may be more muted. Executives at international banks and traders who have reviewed the contract rules and specifications warn of concerns including Beijing's clamp-down on capital outflows, unusually small price limits and China's heavy handed intervention in commodity markets last year.  Everybody is staring at everybody else,  said an official with a western investment bank who declined to be named due to company policy. Reflecting a regulatory aim to stave off price volatility, the Shanghai contract has a 4 percent daily price fluctuation limit, half the limit for Chinese coking coal. China's crude futures also do not have a mechanism to reset limits after a big price move, which means Shanghai trading could freeze while prices still move elsewhere. For WTI, for example, a $10 a barrel move activates circuit breakers to pause trade briefly until a new limit of another $10 is set. Industry players also worry about delays in issuing rules over storage and grades for deliveries.  The INE has yet to finalize details of warehouse tanks, including locations, rules over fuel blending and price differentials between grades, all key for helping industry participants decide on whether or not to take deliveries. The INE spokeswoman said it is working on approved crude oil delivery points, which are located in the peninsulas of Liaodong and Shandong, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. Local traders hope the contract will take off.  The contract will initially track Brent and WTI markets,  said a derivatives trading manager with a Chinese state oil company, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media.

China's oil majors and about 150 brokerages have also registered, but the strong interest by 'mom-and-pop' investors looks set to mark out China's crude futures from western counterparts, which are dominated by institutional investors. Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will run China's contract, says it is finalizing technical issues. The contract has faced years of delays and there is still no set date, but INE and also trading participants now say a launch this year is almost certain.  The INE is striving to launch the crude oil futures within this year,  a spokeswoman said, adding that the exchange has conducted four trials to ensure it is technically ready. Oil futures trading volume is small during Asian hours despite the region's role as the world's top consumer. Shanghai's crude futures are aimed at giving China more clout in pricing crude in Asia and a share of the trillions of dollars in oil futures trade. The INE hopes to attract foreign investors, and locally registered entities of JPMorgan and UBS are among those registered, although international players have raised concerns, including denomination in yuan, that may dampen early take-up. Most oil trades are priced off two crude derivatives, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and London's Brent, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group.  Earlier attempts to establish an Asian derivative crude contract by Singapore and Tokyo foundered. The only liquid crude futures in the region is the Oman contract on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange. Retail Interest Successful crude derivatives would be the jewel in the crown in China's push to ramp up futures trading on products from dates to steel to open up markets and offer new avenues for investors.  While Chinese banks are barred from futures trading, the new market is expected to attract interest from deep-pocketed private equity firms and funds, while state-owned oil majors, like PetroChina and Sinopec will provide liquidity. PetroChina is set to register two accounts and Sinopec is setting up a trading outfit in Shanghai dedicated to the contract, said senior company sources. Independent refiners like Shandong Chambroad Group have also joined, while retail interest is strong. Individuals already account for 80 percent of turnover on China's $8 trillion equity markets, and day traders have whipsawed commodities from eggs to iron ore in China over the past year. Jin Changyi, a 40-year-old former hotel owner from eastern China, who began dabbling in Brent crude oil futures last year, has opened a 500,000-yuan ($75,000) account with a Shanghai-based brokerage and plans to act as a mini-broker for friends.  The way it's designed it won't fluctuate wildly. Compared to trading Brent, the risks are more manageable,  he told Reuters. International Concerns International interest at first may be more muted. Executives at international banks and traders who have reviewed the contract rules and specifications warn of concerns including Beijing's clamp-down on capital outflows, unusually small price limits and China's heavy handed intervention in commodity markets last year.  Everybody is staring at everybody else,  said an official with a western investment bank who declined to be named due to company policy. Reflecting a regulatory aim to stave off price volatility, the Shanghai contract has a 4 percent daily price fluctuation limit, half the limit for Chinese coking coal. China's crude futures also do not have a mechanism to reset limits after a big price move, which means Shanghai trading could freeze while prices still move elsewhere. For WTI, for example, a $10 a barrel move activates circuit breakers to pause trade briefly until a new limit of another $10 is set. Industry players also worry about delays in issuing rules over storage and grades for deliveries.  The INE has yet to finalize details of warehouse tanks, including locations, rules over fuel blending and price differentials between grades, all key for helping industry participants decide on whether or not to take deliveries. The INE spokeswoman said it is working on approved crude oil delivery points, which are located in the peninsulas of Liaodong and Shandong, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. Local traders hope the contract will take off.  The contract will initially track Brent and WTI markets,  said a derivatives trading manager with a Chinese state oil company, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media.  It won't be an immediate success, but we're hopeful.

Nestle, Europe's most valuable public company, announced a 20 billion Swiss franc ($21 billion) share buyback program last month coupled with a plan to increase leverage and prioritize acquisitions in high-growth areas as it battles slowing demand for packaged food. The move came just two days after the billionaire hedge fund manager urged Nestle to more aggressively improve returns as his Third Point fund revealed a $3.5 billion stake that made it Nestle's eighth-largest shareholder. But Nestle's plan did not address Loeb's calls for it to exit its $26 billion stake in French cosmetics giant L'Oreal (OREP.PA) or set a formal margin target of 18 to 20 percent by 2020, up from 15.3 percent in 2016. Unilever (ULVR.L) and Danone (DANO.PA) have recently set their own respective 2020 margin targets of 20 percent and more than 16 percent. Some analysts now expect Nestle to set, or at least imply, a long-term margin target at its Sept. 26 investor seminar, when new chief executive Mark Schneider will lay out his plans.  Third Point's stake may add urgency to margin delivery and sharpens focus on the September investor days,  Liberum analysts said.     Loeb's move on Nestle comes months after Unilever fended off a surprise $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz (KHC.O). Both events highlight the magnitude of the trouble rocking the packaged food sector, as a new generation of consumers flock to smaller brands, leaving companies racing to improve profits through cost cuts. Nestle has a cost-savings program but has not said how much of this will go toward raising its margins, which are at the low end of its peer group. Improved productivity was first on Third Point's wish list, and the source, who declined to be identified, said it was the most important.  Loeb, dubbed a  constructivist  for his increasingly cooperative approach, first met Schneider on June 2, the source said, adding that no other meetings are currently planned before the September seminar, which Third Point plans to attend. Third Point generally agrees with the direction Nestle is heading in under its new CEO, the first outside leader in nearly a century, said the source, but it wants to see greater urgency. A Nestle company logo is pictured on a bar of Milky Bar chocolate in Manchester, Britain April 25, 2017.Phil NobleAside from the share buyback, Schneider, who became CEO in January, has already scrapped a long-term sales model and announced a review of Nestle's U.S. confectionery business.  Maybelline for Maggi   Third Point, which has not commented publicly on Nestle's plans, may give an update in its quarterly letter due later this month, the source said, adding that its plan was to keep sharing its views and talking to the company.  It has suggested that Nestle review its portfolio, which includes more than 2,000 brands including Maggi, Gerber, Perrier and Nescafe. It wants a divestiture of the L'Oreal stake, and has floated an exchange offer whereby Nestle shareholders are offered shares of L'Oreal, maker of Maybelline make-up. Nestle has not commented on this, but behind closed doors, its board does not seem keen, the source said, confirming what another source had previously told Reuters. Nestle, which has owned the stake for more than four decades, has long touted it as strategic and value-creating, and a source last month told Reuters that view had not changed. After carefully assessing all companies in the sector, including Unilever, Third Point started buying Nestle shares earlier this year, when the stock was trading above 70 Swiss francs per share, the source said, noting that Nestle had the greatest opportunity for upside. The shares jumped 4 percent to a record high the day Third Point's letter was disclosed and the stock was trading at 82.90 francs per share at 1559 GMT, up 1.3 percent.  That stands to boost Third Point's performance, which is already outshining its rivals this year. For example, Loeb's Ultra fund, which is invested in Nestle, gained 0.9 percent in June, taking its year-to-date performance to 17.2 percent, said the source.  That compares to an average activist hedge fund performance of 1.27 percent in June and 4.21 percent for the year, according to industry tracker Hedge Fund Research. Since founding Third Point in 1995, Loeb has campaigned for changes at companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Sothebys and famously brought his tactics to Japan via now-exited positions in Sony Corp (6758.T) and Seven & I Holdings (3382.T).

Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress will be on Wednesday and Thursday. San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Tuesday in Sydney that it was a reasonable view to expect one more rate hike this year, and his own view was to start adjusting the central bank's balance sheet in the next few months. Most Gulf currencies are pegged to the dollar and any monetary policy change in the United States is usually mimicked by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Four blue-chip banks were up in the first 45 minutes of trade in Qatar; the largest of them Qatar National Bank rose 1.7 percent. The bank is set to report second-quarter earnings, the first since Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt on June 5 decided to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and impose stringent economic sanctions on the tiny Gulf state. In Saudi Arabia, half of the 12 listed banks advanced after 10 minutes of trade with heavy weight National Commercial Bank adding 1.4 percent. Shares of Saudi Arabian Mining was up 0.6 percent after saying it has started trial operations at its subsidiary Ma'aden Waad Al Shamal Phosphate Company. The impact on earnings will be recognised following when commercial production begins Ma'aden said in a statement. United Electronics Company (Extra) added 0.5 percent after its chief executive, Mohamed Fahmy, told financial news website, Argaam, late on Monday that the company aims to boost sales through its online portal, and strengthen partnerships with suppliers and brands offering the latest technologies and products. Extra soared by its 10 percent daily limit On Monday after it reported a near quadrupling in second quarter net income from a year earlier and a 15 percent growth in sales. Union National Bank was the top gainer amongst its peers in Abu Dhabi, adding 1.5 percent. The index was up 0.2 percent. The Dubai index was up a small 0.2 percent with the majority of trade focused on small-to-mid sized shares. Property developer Deyaar Development was up 1.5 percent. Shares of Kuwait's largest lender National Bank of Kuwait were up 0.2 percent, after reporting in-line second quarter net profit of  79.34 million dinars ($262 million),  an almost 11 percent rise from a year earlier. EFG Hermes forecast NBK would make a quarterly net profit of 83.98 million dinars and Arqaam Capital estimated its net profit at 83 million dinars. Kuwait's index was flat.

Yields across the bloc fell on Monday, retracing some of a sharp rise seen over the last two weeks in which the benchmark German 10-year yield has more than doubled on the growing view the European Central Bank will begin reining in its ultra-loose policy sooner rather than later. The ECB's Benoit Coeure is due to speak on Tuesday but analysts said they are most interested in a speech by Fed Governor Lael Brainard on the topic of normalising central banks' balance sheets, while Fed chair Janet Yellen's semi-annual testimony to Congress follows on Wednesday. San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said earlier on Tuesday in Sydney that he expected the Fed to start unwinding its massive balance sheet in the next few months and for it to raise rates one more time this year.  Given the recent sensitivity to central bank talk about unwinding emergency stimulus, today's speech by the Fed's Brainard...looks like a compelling read before Yellen's testimony moves into focus tomorrow,  said Padhraic Garvey, global head of debt and rates strategy at ING. Germany's 10-year yield edged up 2 basis points on Tuesday to 0.56 percent, reversing some of a near 4 basis point fall on Monday, which was the biggest daily drop in around a month. That drop appears to have been just a pause in a sell-off that has seen Germany's 10-year yield more than double from the 0.25 percent it was at on June 27, the day ECB President Mario Draghi hinted at the possibility of tweaking the central bank's aggressive stimulus in a speech in Sintra, Portugal. The yield remains within touching distance of an 18-month high of 0.583 percent hit in early trading on Monday. All other euro zone bond yields were up 1-5 bps on the day, with Portuguese equivalents leading the charge, up 5 bps at 3.18 percent. Greek yields held near an eight-year low as its main creditor encouraged the country to return to financial markets and raise private finance before its bailout programme ends in a year's time. European Stability Mechanism head Klaus Regling said on Monday it was important for Greece to  develop a strategy to go back  given other countries - Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus - had returned to markets  well before  the end of their programmes, in order to avoid a possible gap in funding. Greece could issue its first sovereign bond in three years as early as this month, sources familiar with Athens' plan told Reuters in May.

Basic resources stocks supported the index, up 1 percent, with Anglo American the top FTSE gainer. Pearson gained 2.6 percent, a top STOXX riser after it sold 22 percent of its stake in publisher Penguin Random House, to bolster its balance sheet and return 300 million pounds ($386 million) to shareholders. Marks & Spencer reported a rise in full-price sales, but its shares fell 0.6 percent, partly on the back of underwhelming food sales. Rivals Tesco and Morrisons rose more than 1 percent. Construction equipment company Travis Perkins was lifted by a positive update from peer Galliford Try, which said it saw full-year profit at the top end of guidance. Broker notes also spurred some moves, with semiconductor makers STMicro and AMS top gainers after JP Morgan raised the Italian semiconductor maker to 'overweight'. Among the top individual drags on the STOXX 600 were Randstad and Adecco, targeted by Deutsche Bank in a note on staffing firms. Analysts at Deutsche cut ratings for the world's two largest staffing firms, saying current employment levels in the U.S. and Europe were associated with peaking 12-month investor returns.

Slideshow (9 Images)The run, on the fifth day of the San Fermin festival which draws thousands of tourists, featured six of the most feared specially-bred fighting bulls and was the quickest yet in 2017, lasting just over two minutes.  The bulls run alongside six steers, or castrated bulls, chasing people dressed in white with red neckerchiefs through the streets into the town's bullring. Later in the day they will be killed in a bullfight.  Runners are often injured when they trip up or barge into each other in the crammed streets of Pamplona.  The San Fermin festival dates back to the Middle Ages and has religious origins. Participants still chant to an image of the saint and ask for his blessing before the run, which starts at 8 o'clock.

The Outlook is Stable. The agency has also assigned the company a Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs of 'F1' and a Support Rating of '1'. MUMSS is a consolidated subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG; A/Stable/F1/a) and is 60% owned by MUFG via an intermediate holding company, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings Co., Ltd. (which is fully owned by MUFG), and 40% owned by US-based Morgan Stanley (A/Stable/F1/a). KEY RATING DRIVERS MUMSS's IDRs are aligned with those of its majority shareholder, MUFG. This reflects Fitch's view that MUFG would be extremely likely to extend its subsidiary support in a timely manner, if required. There is a history of MUFG supporting MUMSS in its early years of conception, although Fitch would now expect capital support for business expansion to be apportioned between shareholders. Fitch believes liquidity support is readily available from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU; A/Stable/F1/a), a core subsidiary of MUFG. Fitch believes MUMSS's role of supporting the group's aggregate securities business and the high degree of operational integration and branding underlines the parent's strong commitment to MUMSS. Furthermore, MUFG has effective operational control over MUMSS through representation on its board and in senior management. Fitch sees MUMSS as a core subsidiary of MUFG, engaging in the retail business, investment banking business, sales, trading and research. MUMSS plays a key role in collaborating with other core group entities, including BTMU and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation (A/Stable/F1/a), in the retail and middle-market business as well as acting as a group investment banking arm. RATING SENSITIVITIES MUMSS's IDRs would be directly affected by changes to MUFG's IDRs, which are currently underpinned by its Viability Rating of 'a'. Fitch does not envisage negative rating action on the MUFG's Viability Rating due to its strong domestic franchises, solid yen liquidity profile, sound asset quality and adequate capital position. However, the Viability Rating may be negatively affected if an unexpected deterioration in the operating environment, such as increased uncertainty or failure of Abenomics, adversely affects the bank's financial profile. Downward pressure may also result from a substantial increase in risk appetite without a corresponding increase in risk buffers or higher volatility in earnings and capital. Negative rating action on MUFG's Viability Rating would also likely to be a reflection of negative action on Japan's sovereign rating (A/Stable). MUMSS's Support Rating and IDRs could be downgraded if MUFG's propensity to support its subsidiary diminished, MUMSS's functions within the group were substantially lessened and Fitch no longer viewed its position within the group as core and integral. Also, a large reduction in ownership and management oversight, would likely result in a review of MUMSS's Support Rating and IDRs. Fitch does not assign a Viability Rating to MUMSS as its operation is highly integrated with the parent's business.

The manner of Fitchâ€™s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

An index tracking 50 blue-chips in Shanghai, dubbed China's  nifty 50  index, rose 0.8 percent to a 20-month high as investors continued to chase blue-chips with solid fundamentals. This follows MSCI's decision to include China's 222 big-caps in its key index. At the smaller end of town, however, the tech-heavy start-up board index ChiNext lost 1.1 percent following a 1.8 percent slump on Monday, with 12 small-cap stocks tumbling the 10 percent trading limit. Small-caps have weakened after the securities regulator approved more initial public offerings over the weekend.

The tight liquidity conditions will last for a relatively long time, as the central bank's current moves to maintain stability in the market were only meant to prevent financial risks amid Beijing's concerted campaign to deleverage, Bohai securities analyst Song Yiwei wrote in a report. Banking and consumer stocks led the advance, while material firms took a breather after recent strong gains amid an industry recovery and a weaker dollar.

Increases in charges for services, if sustained, threaten to push up core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices.  Nomura estimates the annual core rate could rise as much as 60 basis points. Although headline inflation slumped to 2.18 percent in May, its lowest since a new series was adopted five years ago, core inflation has stubbornly stayed above 4 percent for years. Statements from the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee have cited core inflation as a key reason for keeping rates on hold at 6.25 percent since October, given concerns it will spill over into broader prices and threaten the RBI's target of 4 percent headline inflation. An acceleration could make the central bank extra-cautious in reducing rates at a time many analysts believe the economy, weakened by over-leveraged banks and tiny private investment, could handle cuts of up to 50 bps instead of the single 25 bps trim expected at the next review in August.  Given that the long-term target is to have inflation at 4 percent on a durable basis, the central bank is bound to exercise some caution while assessing core inflation,  said A. Prasanna, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai.  Therefore we can expect just one more rate cut.   India will post June inflation data on Wednesday, with the headline rate expected to ease below 2 percent, though the core one is likely to stay around 4 percent. Executives Fret Under GST - India's biggest tax reform in the 70 years since independence from British colonial rule - tax rates for services have been broadly raised. Shoppers walk past stores at a mall in Mumbai, India, July 10, 2017.Danish SiddiquiThe health-care sector is exempt from GST, but people taking cholesterol tests face higher charges, as clinics are passing along their higher input costs. Other services are directly impacted by GST; moviegoers in some places are paying up to 32 percent more for a ticket.Â Â Â   Higher costs for services are meant to be offset by lower tax rates for goods such as food products, and the government has said it expects the GST to have a  broadly neutral to disinflationary impact  in prices. In practice, much remains uncertain about how individual businesses will respond. Executives in the services sector say they may be unable to offset the higher taxes through lower costs or by trimming profit margins.  Slideshow (2 Images)Deepak Sahni, founder of Healthians.com, a medical test provider, said despite healthcare's exemption from GST, he is forced to raise test-costs at least 7-8 percent due to taxes on inputs and equipments.  We operate on a thin margin,  he said.  It's not possible for us to fully absorb this hit. We have to pass on the higher costs to consumers.  Worries Overblown? Although analysts broadly agree that core inflation is bound to accelerate, the RBI's repeated concerns about it have been controversial in markets. To the analysts, sluggish economic growth means that core inflation is unlikely to spill over and raise headline inflation.   India's gross domestic product had annual 6.1 percent growth in January-March, the lowest since late 2014 - a factor that analysts say will keep prices in check given wage pressures are subsiding, output gap is declining and private credit is slow.   Given the actual inflation level and the reality in terms of excess capacity, dismal credit growth and very low pricing power, the RBI's concerns on core inflation might be exaggerated,  said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India.

Total energy investment fell for the second straight year by 12 percent to $1.7 trillion compared with 2015, the IEA said.    Oil and gas investments plunged 26 percent to $650 billion, down by over a quarter in 2016, and electricity generation slipped 5 percent.  This decline (in energy investment) is attributed to two reasons,  IEA chief economist Laszlo Varro told journalists.   The reaction of the oil and gas industry to the prolonged period of low oil prices which was a period of harsh investment cuts; and technological progress which is reducing investment costs in both renewable power and in oil and gas,  he said. Oil and gas investment is expected to rebound modestly by 3 percent in 2017, driven by a 53 percent upswing in U.S. shale, and spending in Russia and the Middle East, the IEA said in a report.  The rapid ramp up of U.S. shale activities has triggered an increase of U.S. shale costs of 16 percent in 2017 after having almost halved from 2014-16,  the report said. The global electricity sector, however, was the largest recipient of energy investment in 2016 for the first time ever, overtaking oil, gas and coal combined, the report said.    Robust investments in renewable energy and increased spending in electricity networks, made electricity the biggest area of capital investments,  Varro said. Electricity investment worldwide was $718 billion, lifted by higher spending in power grids which offset the fall in power generation investments.  Investment in new renewables-based power capacity, at $297 billion, remained the largest area of electricity spending, despite falling back by 3 percent,  the report said. Although renewables investments was 3 percent lower than five years ago, capacity additions were 50 percent higher and expected output from this capacity about 35 percent higher, thanks to the fall in unit costs and technology improvements in solar PV and wind generation, the IEA said. Investments in coal-fired electricity plants fell sharply. Sanctioning of new coal power plants fell to the lowest level in nearly 15 years, reflecting concerns about local air pollution, and emergence of overcapacity and competition from renewables, notably in China. Coal investments, however, grew in India.  Coal investment is coming to an end. At the very least, it is coming to a pause,  Varro said. The IEA report said energy efficiency investments continued to expand in 2016, reaching $231 billion, with most of it going to the building sector globally. Electric vehicles sales rose 38 percent in 2016 to 750,000 vehicles at $6 billion, and represented 10 percent of all transport efficiency spending. Some $6 billion was spent globally on electronic vehicle charging stations, the IEA said.      Spending on electricity networks and storage continued the steady rise of the past five years, reaching an all-time high of $277 billion in 2016, with 30 percent of the expansion driven by Chinaâ€™s spending in its distribution system, the report said.  China led the world in energy investments with 21 percent of global total share, the report said, driven by low-carbon electricity supply and networks projects. Although oil and gas investments fell in the United States in 2016, its total energy investments rose 16 percent on the back of spending in renewables projects, the IEA report said.

The Outlook on the IDRs is Positive. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sovereign Caps Ratings: Telkom's IDRs are constrained by the Indonesian sovereign (BBB-/Positive) due to the state's majority shareholding of 52.1% as of end-March 2017, and the significant influence over Telkom's key operating and financial policies through control of the board. Telkom is also strategically important as Indonesia's largest fixed and wireless operator, capturing almost half of the nation's mobile subscriber base as of end-March 2017. Strong Credit Profile: Telkom continues to exhibit a robust credit profile, underpinned by its solid market position in the domestic mobile and fixed-line markets, low leverage and wide operating EBITDAR margin of over 50%. Rating headroom for Telkom's IDRs remains large, although FFO-adjusted net leverage is likely to increase to around 0.7x in 2017 and 2018 (2016: 0.5x) on high capex needs and dividend commitments. We expect high-single-digit revenue growth and operating EBITDAR margin of around 50%, supported by data monetisation initiatives through a reduction in mobile-data allowances, and rational pricing in the fixed broadband segment. FCF Deficit: Fitch expects Telkom's cash flow from operations of IDR40 trillion-42 trillion in 2017 and 2018 may not be sufficient to fully cover capex and dividend commitments. Capex/revenue is likely to be stable at around 25%, as further investment in long-term evolution (LTE) networks offsets slowing fibre broadband expansion. After an initial push to expand its fibre network to over 16 million homes-passed at end-2016, Telkom is now planning to monetize its existing homes-passed instead of building new ones. We view this as a positive development for the domestic fixed broadband market. Further capex may stem from participation in a possible spectrum auction of the 2100MHz and 2300MHz frequency bands in 2H17, but we believe this should not have a major impact on Telkom's credit profile. M&A Opportunities: The prospect of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) remains, in light of Telkom's growth ambitions outside Indonesia. However, Fitch does not expect Telkom to undertake large debt-funded acquisitions which could have a negative effect on its credit profile - given its conservative nature and the lengthy approval process for state-owned firms. Future tower monetisation provides added financial flexibility to the company, although sale of state-owned assets is likely to require a lengthy approval process by the government. DERIVATION SUMMARY Telkom's IDRs continue to be capped due to the strong links between the company and its majority owner, the Indonesian sovereign (BBB-/Positive), which exerts significant influence over the company's key operating and financial decisions through control of the board. Telkom's standalone profile is at least two notches higher than its IDR, given its strong market position in Indonesia's fixed-line and mobile markets, wide EBITDA margins and low net leverage. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Revenue to increase at 7%-8% a year in 2017-2019 driven by data services (2016: 13.5%); - Operating EBITDAR margin of around 50%-52% in 2016-2017 due to data-led substitution of more profitable voice and text services (2016: 52.9%); - Annual cash capex/revenue of around 25% in 2016-2017 (2016: 25.1%); - No significant debt-funded M&A or divestment; and - Dividend payout ratio of 70% in 2017-2019, in line with the historical average of 60%-73%. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Upgrade in the sovereign's IDRs - Weaker links between the government and Telkom. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action, such as the Outlook being revised to Stable, include: - Revision of the sovereign's IDRs Outlook to Stable from Positive. For the sovereign rating of Indonesia, the following sensitivities were outlined by Fitch in its Rating Action Commentary of 21 December 2016: The main factors that, individually or collectively, could trigger positive rating action are: - A strengthening of the external balances, making Indonesia less vulnerable to sudden changes in foreign-investor sentiment, for instance through lower commodity export dependence or structurally higher foreign direct investment inflows. - Continued improvement of the business environment and governance standards. - Maintenance of sustainable GDP growth at a higher level than rating peers. The rating Outlooks are Positive. Hence, Fitch does not anticipate a high probability of negative action over the forecast period. However, the main factors that could see the ratings revert to Stable Outlook are: - A sharp and sustained external shock to foreign and/or domestic investors' confidence with the potential to cause external financing difficulties. - A rise in the public debt burden, for example caused by breaching the budget-deficit ceiling. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Telkom's unrestricted cash of IDR34 trillion at end-March 2017 is sufficient to meet debt maturities of IDR11 trillion over the next 24 months. We expect liquidity to remain strong, given its robust financial position and strong access to capital markets and local banks. Telkom has low exposure to foreign-currency debt, with 93.9% of its IDR27.8 trillion borrowings in rupiah, 3.6% in US dollar and the remaining 2.5% in yen.

Total energy investment fell for the second straight year by 12 percent to $1.7 trillion compared with 2015, the IEA said.    Oil and gas investments plunged 26 percent to $650 billion, down by over a quarter in 2016, and electricity generation slipped 5 percent.  This decline (in energy investment) is attributed to two reasons,  IEA chief economist Laszlo Varro told journalists.   The reaction of the oil and gas industry to the prolonged period of low oil prices which was a period of harsh investment cuts; and technological progress which is reducing investment costs in both renewable power and in oil and gas,  he said. Oil and gas investment is expected to rebound modestly by 3 percent in 2017, driven by a 53 percent upswing in U.S. shale, and spending in Russia and the Middle East, the IEA said in a report.  The rapid ramp up of U.S. shale activities has triggered an increase of U.S. shale costs of 16 percent in 2017 after having almost halved from 2014-16,  the report said. The global electricity sector, however, was the largest recipient of energy investment in 2016 for the first time ever, overtaking oil, gas and coal combined, the report said.    Robust investments in renewable energy and increased spending in electricity networks, made electricity the biggest area of capital investments,  Varro said. Electricity investment worldwide was $718 billion, lifted by higher spending in power grids which offset the fall in power generation investments.  Investment in new renewables-based power capacity, at $297 billion, remained the largest area of electricity spending, despite falling back by 3 percent,  the report said. Although renewables investments was 3 percent lower than five years ago, capacity additions were 50 percent higher and expected output from this capacity about 35 percent higher, thanks to the fall in unit costs and technology improvements in solar PV and wind generation, the IEA said. Investments in coal-fired electricity plants fell sharply. Sanctioning of new coal power plants fell to the lowest level in nearly 15 years, reflecting concerns about local air pollution, and emergence of overcapacity and competition from renewables, notably in China. Coal investments, however, grew in India.  Coal investment is coming to an end. At the very least, it is coming to a pause,  Varro said. The IEA report said energy efficiency investments continued to expand in 2016, reaching $231 billion, with most of it going to the building sector globally. Electric vehicles sales rose 38 percent in 2016 to 750,000 vehicles at $6 billion, and represented 10 percent of all transport efficiency spending. Some $6 billion was spent globally on electronic vehicle charging stations, the IEA said.      Spending on electricity networks and storage continued the steady rise of the past five years, reaching an all-time high of $277 billion in 2016, with 30 percent of the expansion driven by Chinaâ€™s spending in its distribution system, the report said.  China led the world in energy investments with 21 percent of global total share, the report said, driven by low-carbon electricity supply and networks projects. Although oil and gas investments fell in the United States in 2016, its total energy investments rose 16 percent on the back of spending in renewables projects, the IEA report said.

Earlier this year, Tabcorp and Tatts took the unusual step of applying to the court-run Australian Competition Tribunal (ACT) for deal clearance after the usual arbiter, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), raised concerns. The tribunal approved the deal. But the commission then asked the Federal Court to review that decision, saying the tribunal misused certain tests which competition regulators use to determine if a deal will hurt competition, and gave inappropriate weightings to data about the effects of the takeover. On Tuesday, Tabcorp said it will oppose the commission's appeal and that it and Tatts remain committed to the takeover. Tabcorp said the appeal  will impact the timing of the implementation of the transaction, though the precise impact will not be known until the court has considered the matter .  Tabcorp considers that implementation remains achievable in the last quarter of 2017,  it said. Tabcorp published its response to the commission's appeal after the close of share trading on Tuesday. Earlier, Tabcorp shares fell 0.2 percent and Tatts shares fell 0.7 percent, in a flat overall market.

British households spent more money on food and other essentials last month but held back on less urgent purchases as they faced rising prices, two sets of industry figures showed on Tuesday. Sterling edged lower to 1.2870 against the dollar in early trades and has weakened more than 1 percent since it hit a one-month high above 1.30 last week after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that a rise in rates was likely to be needed as the economy came close to running at full capacity. Market watchers will get fresh insights into the central bank's thinking later in the day with two policymakers making separate appearances. Three policymakers voted last month for a rate rise, and both Carney and his chief economist Andy Haldane have said they could vote for a rate rise later this year. With markets pricing in roughly a 50 percent probability of a quarter percentage point hike by year-end, strategists at RBC Capital Markets believe the weakness in the pound may have more room to run if policymakers, particularly BOE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent, adopt a cautious note. Broadbent is due to give a speech at 1100 GMT on Tuesday. RBC recommends a short sterling trade against the U.S. dollar at 1.2895 targeting a level of 1.2635. Optimism about the business environment among Britain's financial services firms declined in the second quarter of this year, according to a survey published on Tuesday.

Profit rose to $75.3 billion from $73.9 billion a year earlier, its annual report showed on Tuesday. Total investment income was $83 billion in 2016, compared with $76.7 billion in 2015. Its accumulated annualized investment return rose to 4.76 percent last year. The increase was bolstered by portfolio adjustment and high returns on stock markets in Europe and the United states, Li Wenping, managing director of CIC's financial department, told a news conference. The fund is seeking to increase direct investment in the United States with its newly-established New York office, spokeswoman Liu Fangyu told Reuters. That includes direct investments in infrastructure and property. Presently, 42 percent of CIC's total overseas portfolio is in the United States, but mostly in public markets, she said.  We established the U.S. office with the mandates to explore the opportunities andâ€¦establish close relationships with local partners, with the local government agencies and the local regulatory agencies,  she added.  CIC, headquartered in Beijing, was founded in 2007 to help China earn a higher return on its foreign exchange reserves. The fund reported a 6.22 percent return on its overseas investments in 2016, compared with a negative 2.96 percent in 2015.  Eight years following the global financial crisis, major economies' rounds of easing policies and developed countries' sluggish economic recovery led to intensifying competition among global funds, adding pressure on investment returns,  CIC Vice Chairman and President Tu Guangshao said in the report.  Potential risks are the rising uncertainties of global politics and policies,  he said, referring to the outlook for 2017. CIC invests overseas through two subsidiaries, CIC International Co and direct investment vehicle CIC Capital Corp. CIC Capital, launched in 2015, signed 16 deals worth $5 billion last year. Last month, CIC signed the buyout of European warehouse firm Logicor Ltd [IPO-LOG.L] from Blackstone Group LP for 12.25 billion euros ($13.95 billion), Europe's biggest private equity real estate deal. Earlier this month, CIC joined a consortium led by TIAA Private Investments and Antarctica Capital LLC to buy InterPark LLC, the largest owner-operator of parking infrastructure in the United States from Alinda Capital Partners LLC. CIC started with initial funding of $200 billion. By the end of 2016, its assets had surpassed $813.5 billion. Profit and loss from fair value changes recorded an increase of $23.5 billion over last year, primarily due to the reversal in fair value of financial assets, Li said. Through its Central Huijin Investment Ltd subsidiary, CIC is a shareholder in 18 Chinese state-owned financial institutions, including the country's largest banks such as China Development Bank Corp, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd, China Construction Bank Corp and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd, according to its annual report.

Debt Italy's Treasury said on Monday it would offer up to 7.25 billion euros in bonds at auction on Thursday. Companies (*) Italian Banks The head of euro zone finance ministers said on Monday that Italy's winding-down in June of two banks from the Veneto region had raised the question of whether European Union rules on state aid should be changed.

In Europe, futures for the Eurostoxx 50 and the DAX were both up 0.3 percent, while the FTSE was 0.2 percent higher. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.8 percent, with technology-led gains on Wall Street sparking sentiment toward Asian tech shares. Japan's Nikkei stock index ended up 0.6 percent, buoyed by the weaker yen, while Australian shares erased losses and ended slightly higher.  Except for worries about North Korea, the situation in Asia is calm at the moment, and this is giving some relief to investors,  said Kyoya Okazawa, head of global markets, Japan and Korea, at BNP Paribas.  The dollar has risen above the 114 level, and this is lifting Japanese shares,  he said. In China, the blue-chip CSI300 index rallied 1 percent in afternoon trade, while the Shanghai Composite Index turned positive and was 0.2 percent higher. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, added 0.2 percent to 96.183 ahead of Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said Tuesday in Sydney that it was a reasonable view to expect one more rate hike this year, and his own view was to start adjusting the central bank's balance sheet in the next few months.  Normalisation of monetary policy in the coming months is almost priced in, and the Fed will start shrinking its balance sheet in September, and this does not necessarily mean a delay of rate hikes,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  This is supporting the dollar as a positive factor, and limiting its downside at the moment,  he said.  I think Yellen will confirm that rate hikes are coming, and that balance sheet shrinkage will come.  Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar added 0.4 percent to 114.47, its highest level since mid-March. The euro inched 0.1 percent lower on the day to $1.1385 . The Canadian dollar was down slightly against its U.S. counterpart as investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision on Wednesday. Forecasters are divided on whether the central bank will raise rates but data from the overnight index swaps market shows that money markets are almost fully priced for an increase, while an 80 percent chance of a second hike has been implied by December. Crude oil prices extended their overnight gains, even as increased drilling activity in the United States and uncertainty over Libyan and Nigerian production cuts clouded the future supply outlook. U.S. crude futures rose 0.2 percent to $44.49 a barrel after adding 0.4 percent on Monday, while Brent crude was also 0.2 percent higher at $46.96. Spot gold edged 0.2 percent lower to $1,212.13 an ounce, moving back toward near four-month lows touched in the previous session.

In the first couple of rounds, I wasn't playing my best and I was fighting but I feel like every match I'm getting better and better,  Ostapenko, a junior Wimbledon champion in 2014, told the WTA website. (www.wtatennis.com) The 20-year-old, who beat world number four Elina Svitolina on Monday, will play on Centre Court for the first time against Williams, who has seven grand slam titles to her name, and the aggressive youngster is looking to enjoy the experience.  She's a great player who has won many Grand Slams, and I'm just going to go on court, enjoy the match, and show my best,  Ostapenko added.

The market has been also underpinned by the Bank of Japan's aggressive bond purchase operations on Friday, which has also assured market players of its firm commitment to keep yields around the current levels. The auction of 2.2 trillion yen ($19.2 billion) five-year JGBs produced the highest accepted yield of minus 0.033 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio was 4.85, above 4.71 in the previous five-year JGB auction last month and the highest in almost three years. In the secondary market, the five-year yield stood flat at minus 0.035 percent.  Given today's strong auction results, the BOJ probably won't need to increase its buying in five-year bonds tomorrow,  said a trader at a Japanese bank. The BOJ is due to buy one- to ten-year JGBs on Wednesday. Still, traders say the BOJ may have to step in and increase its buying or conduct fixed-rate purchases to draw a line in the sand again in the near future. Such a challenge could come as early as Thursday if U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen makes hawkish comments in her testimony on Wednesday and boosts U.S. and European bond yields, they say. The JGB market had been hit by rising expectations that some of the world's central banks including the European Central Bank may dial back their stimulus. Although the BOJ is nowhere near ending its easy policy, higher bond yields elsewhere undermine the relative attraction of JGBs. Pressure from rising bond yields overseas is likely to hurt longest maturities the most and to steepen the yield curve, because the BOJ's control on them is looser than that on the 10-year bonds and shorter maturities. In part driven by such thinking, the curve steepened on Tuesday as the 30-year yield rose 1.0 basis point to 0.900 percent while the 10-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.095 percent. The 10-year JGB futures price was up 0.01 point at 149.78 . $1 = 114.41 yen Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; Editing by Sam Holmes","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-bonds-idUSL4N1K22BI"},

Tuesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed investor lending shrank 1.4 percent in May, from April, to hit a nine-month trough.  Importantly, the value of canceled loans climbed about 17 percent to a 10-month high of A$1.44 billion as more people pulled out of deals, a sign tighter lending standards and rising mortgage rates were changing investor behavior. At the same time, lending to owner occupiers edged up 1 percent, while loans for construction climbed for a fourth straight month and promised to boost supply.  The home loan data had the right mix in May â€“ more loans to budding home owners and fewer loans to investors,  said James Craig, chief economist at CommSec.   It is also important to remember that lenders may agree to provide finance to buy a home but borrowers may not take up the offer. More budding property owners are getting cold feet and not going through with the deal.  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), long worried that debt-fueled speculation in property could ultimately hurt both consumers and banks, will welcome the much-awaited slowdown in lending. Household debt is already at 190 percent of disposable income and was a major reason the RBA left interest rates at an all-time low of 1.50 percent this month. Instead, policy makers have tightened rules on home lending  and particularly on interest-rate only loans massively favored by property speculators.  That led the banks to hike rates on interest-only debt in both April and June. Growth in home prices seems to be moderating in response though it remains uncomfortably strong in the two major markets of Sydney and Melbourne.   Prices in the capital cities rose an annual 9.6 percent in June, down from a peak of 12.9 percent in March. Sydney was growing at 12.2 percent while Melbourne fared better at 13.7 percent.  Even so, economists said it was premature to call a peak in the housing market, noting that a similar easing off in prices in 2016 proved all too brief.  Auction activity and price growth show a material slowdown coming through, although both remain fairly mild to date,  said Westpac economist Matthew Hassan.  Given the banks made a second round of loan rate increases in June, a full picture is unlikely to emerge until much later in the year.

Amazon confirmed winning government approval for its plan to sell food products, but it declined to provide further details. Separately, a source familiar with the matter said Amazon planned to invest $500 million in the food segment, over and above the $5 billion it had already committed to investing in India. Cheaper smartphones, increasing internet penetration and steep discounts have led to a surge in domestic online shopping for everything from gadgets to clothes and food items in India. Still, mom-and-pop stores account for the biggest share of grocery sales, offering organized players huge growth potential. Currently Amazon offers food products in India via Amazon Pantry, where retailers including joint venture Cloudtail sell various products. It also offers same-day grocery delivery on its Amazon Now app through a tie-up with Indian retailers Big Bazaar, Star Bazaar and Hypercity. Amazon did not comment on whether its new investments would affect any of its existing tie-ups, or its Cloudtail joint venture.  Venture-funded Flipkart, whose backers include Tiger Global, Tencent Holdings and Microsoft, also plans to move into the groceries space, company executives have said. Amazon last month announced plans to buy upscale U.S. grocer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion.

The Nikkei rose 0.6 percent to 20,195.48, the highest closing level since June 29. The broader Topix climbed 0.7 percent to 1,627.14, but volumes hit a two-week low of 1.43 billion shares. Panasonic Corp soared 2.0 percent and Hitachi Ltd gained 1.6 percent after the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 technology index rose overnight on expectations for brisk earnings. Technology companies are expected to post some of the strongest earnings growth figures for the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Overall sentiment was positive, as the dollar rose to 114.45 yen to hit a four-month high. The dollar has been strong against the yen since the Bank of Japan offered last week to buy an unlimited amount of bonds, which drew investors' focus to the divergent monetary policy outlook between the BOJ and the U.S. Federal Reserve. The spread between 10-year Treasury and JGB yields is the widest it has been in two months, contributing to the dollar's strength against the yen. Market analysts said that investors are likely to continue to take heart from the weak yen for now, while strength in tech shares is expected to support the Nikkei benchmark index.  While Japanese exporters expect much lower dollar-yen assumptions, the current currency levels raise hopes for better Japan Inc earnings,  said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities. He also said that there is demand for growth shares and commodity-related stocks globally, and the Japanese market is following this trend, citing strong performance among resource giants like Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Freeport-McMoRan.  Strength in these stocks indicate a pick up in global demand, which helps appetite for Japanese stocks as well,  Kuramochi said. Meanwhile, ink jet printer and watch maker Seiko Epson Corp soared 3.7 percent after Nikkei Inc said it would add the company's stock to the benchmark Nikkei 225 average, replacing scandal-hit Toshiba Corp, which fell 1.8 percent. Elsewhere, Suzuki Motor Corp fell 1.8 percent after Dutch prosecutors said they would investigate the automaker's possible misuse of vehicle emissions software.

As her minority government prepares to start the difficult task of passing Brexit through parliament, May will remind Britons of her promise to build a fairer society, seeking to repair a reputation damaged by an ill-judged snap election. Almost one year on from her first day as prime minister -- a job she took on after Britain's shock referendum vote to leave the European Union -- May will urge voters and political opponents to help her  tackle the injustice and vested interests that threaten to hold us back .  My commitment to change in Britain is undimmed,  May will say on Tuesday, according to advanced extracts from her speech.  May called the election on June 8 in an attempt to cash in on high poll ratings and win support for her plan to make a clean break with the EU in 2019. Related Coverage'A damp squib': EU parliament reacts to UK proposal on citizensBut the gamble backfired when voters stripped her of a majority in parliament and forced her party into a deal with a small Northern Irish party to prop up a minority government.  In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in parliament as well as in the country,  May will say. Confidence Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May  in Henley-on-Thames, Britain, June 30, 2017.Toby MelvilleMay's ability to carry on as prime minister and drive Brexit legislation through parliament with only a fragile majority behind her has been persistently questioned since the election.  But May's position seems secure for now, with colleagues preferring to see her start Brexit talks rather than topple her and risk the government collapsing -- a scenario that could let a resurgent opposition Labour Party into power.    The first stage of the Brexit process will come later this week when a key piece of legislation, which translates EU law into British law, is presented to parliament. Damian Green, who as First Secretary of State is effectively May's deputy, told Sky News he was confident the government could get the legislation through . Asked about media reports of plots to oust her, Green said it was simply  gossip and chatter  at summer parties.  There is no credible plot going on,  he said.  The prime minister is determined to carry on, to lead the party and the country for many years to come and the overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs (lawmakers) are behind her in that.  May will make the appeal for national backing at the launch of a report into how the government should protect workers affected by a shift to different employment models, including the 'gig economy' championed by the likes of Uber and Deliveroo. The report is a key element of May's plan to address dissatisfaction expressed at the referendum by working class Britons who felt left behind by globalization.  At this critical time in our history, we can either be timid or we can be bold,  May will say.  We will act with an unshakeable sense of purpose to build the better, fairer Britain which we all want to see.

Moraeus Hanssen, a petroleum engineer and economist, has headed Engie's E&P business since October 2015 and oversaw the unit's sale to Neptune, part of Engie's strategy to sell 15 billion euro worth of assets until 2018 as it shifts focus to energy grids and services.  I'm not going to stay on. We'll have to see what I'm going to do,  Moraeus Hanssen told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an industry conference in Istanbul. The deal is set to close in late 2017 or early next year. Neptune declined to comment. New owner Neptune, which is backed by private equity funds The Carlyle Group and CVC Capital Partners, will likely mean a return to more daring exploration investments for the business, Moraeus Hanssen said.  The good news for E&P employees is now they have dedicated owners who want to invest in E&P,  she said. Engie's E&P business was loss-making in 2015 and 2016, hit hard by writedowns on the back of weak oil prices like its peers in the business. As a result of poor returns in the business and Engie's strategy shift, the group has been investing less in its oil and gas business, with total capital expenditure on the unit dropping below 1 billion euros ($1.14 billion) last year. Engie's E&P business, which mainly consists of assets in the Norwegian, British and Dutch parts of the North Sea, has lately focused on finding fresh resources in areas close to existing fields.  We will go deeper and we will look at maybe things that we left behind, like the tighter and deeper zones,  Moraeus Hanssen said, highlighting a wider industry trend of dropping riskier frontier exploration in favor of nearfield oil searches since prices started falling three years ago. Growth for the business lies within expanding organically like this but also within acquiring new assets in areas where Engie is present, like Britain's gas-rich southern North Sea basin, Moraeus Hanssen said.  We would be looking at stuff that will be where we already are. This is Europe, North Africa and southeast Asia.

The pilgrims were on their way back from the Amarnath shrine deep in the Himalayas when their bus got caught up in the crossfire near the town of Anantnag, police said.  Twelve pilgrims were wounded in the fighting triggered after the militants attacked a police bunker and another police party at a checkpoint.  The attack has stirred the ire of hardline Hindu groups tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party who have long sought tough action against militants fighting Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir. In the Hindu-dominated Jammu region of the Indian state, saffron-clad members of the right-wing Bajrang Dal group stopped cars to enforce a strike in memory of the pilgrims. Protests also took place in the country's financial capital of Mumbai and the industrial city of Ahmedabad in the west.  Pained beyond words on the dastardly attack on peaceful Amarnath pilgrims in Jammu and Kashmir,  Modi said on social network Twitter.  The attack deserves strongest condemnation from everyone,  he added, saying he had spoken to the state's governor and chief minister to assure them of all possible help. Hundreds of thousands of Hindus visit the Amarnath cave, 12,000 feet (3,658 m) above sea level in the picturesque Lidder Valley, in the months of July and August every year. Indian security force personnel stand at the site of a gunbattle between Indian police and militants on Monday in which seven Hindu pilgrims were killed, in Boateng village in south Kashmir's Anantnag district July 11, 2017.Danish IsmailPilgrims trek through treacherous mountain passes to the shrine, where devotees worship a phallus-shaped ice stalagmite seen as a symbol of Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction. Police superintendent Altaf Khan said the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba was behind the attack aimed at sowing sectarian discord.  But the militant group rejected the allegation, calling the attack  reprehensible , and accusing India of trying to sabotage the freedom struggle of the Kashmiris.  Slideshow (5 Images)Separatist leaders also condemned the attack.   This incident goes against the very grain of Kashmiri ethos,  separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Farooq and Yasin Malik said in a joint statement.  The annual Amarnath yatra has been going on peacefully for centuries and is part of our yearly rhythm and will remain so.   Militants battling Indian rule in Kashmir have largely spared the pilgrimage, even during the most violent phases of their 28-year armed revolt. About 150,000 pilgrims have already completed the journey to Amarnath and tens of thousands more are expected to do so by the time it ends in late August. India has been struggling to restore normality in Muslim-majority Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim in full but rule in part. India accuses Pakistan of pushing in militants from its part of Kashmir to carry out attacks, a charge denied by Islamabad.

The U.S. dollar's advances against major peers slowed with a pause in the rise of sovereign bond yields, and investor caution ahead of Yellen's speech.     Yellen is due to make a semi-annual testimony before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, and dollar bulls are banking on her to retain a hawkish stance, emboldened by last Friday's relatively robust U.S. non-farm jobs report.      Forex markets have remained calm amid a conspicuous lack of fresh central bank cues and ahead of key earnings reports, Mizuho Bank said in a note.     Among regional currencies, the Taiwan dollar led the gains, up 0.1 percent in thin trade.     The Indian rupee rose 0.07 percent, gaining for the fourth straight day, ahead of June consumer price inflation data scheduled to be out on Wednesday.     India's consumer inflation is expected to have slowed to a record-low in June to 1.7 percent, pressured by a sharp drop in food and oil prices, a Reuters poll showed, a result that could intensify calls for an interest rate cut.            Meanwhile, the Thai baht hit its lowest in more than a month, easing 0.1 percent.     Bank of Thailand's assistant governor, Vachira Aromdee, said on Tuesday, that the strength of the Thai baht is having a limited impact on exports.     The Chinese yuan was marginally lower for a sixth session in seven, hurt by corporate dollar demand and a weaker fixing.     On Tuesday, the People's Bank of China resumed open market operations, after a 12-sesion hiatus, injecting 40 billion yuan.               PHILIPPINE PESO     The Philippine peso fell 0.2 percent, hitting its lowest since September 2006.      It is a combination of domestic politics and, on a technical perspective, USD/PHP appears well supported above 50 level,  says Andy Ji, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.      Data on Tuesday showed that while exports rose for a sixth straight month in May, the trade deficit widened for the month from a year earlier.     However, Ji said as long as overseas remittances stay resilient, a widening in the trade deficit would not be a problem as long as it remains a product of stronger domestic demand.

The spot rupee traded steady at 153.73/80 per dollar at 0529 GMT, unchanged from Monday's close.  The demand is there but we can see some (dollar) conversions time to time, which prevents a sharp depreciation of the currency,  said a currency dealer, who declined to be identified.  The dollar demand from state banks is there.  Dealers also said the market has priced in further depreciation of the rupee because of the central bank's no-intervention policy. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5, when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50. Dealers said they expected seasonal demand for dollars to pick up from August. The rupee has been under pressure since early this year after the central bank stopped providing support for the currency at a time when the island faces a balance of payments crunch. The central bank is also compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet the reserve target set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme.

The bank made a net profit of 79.34 million dinars  ($262 million) in the three months to June 30, compared to 71.68 million dinars a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations.

The text of the 2013 accord, whose existence was known but whose contents have never before been made public, was first published by CNN on Monday and later released on social media by Saudi officials. In a joint statement, Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said the publication of the accord, meant to settle a dispute between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors,  confirms beyond any doubt Qatar's failure to meet its commitments and its full violation of its pledges . Amid fresh tension with Qatar, the four slapped sanctions on Doha on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism, cozying up to Iran, backing the Muslim Brotherhood - the world's oldest Islamist organization - and interference in  their affairs. The four say Qatar pledged to desist from interfering in its neighbors' politics in the 2013 agreement. Related CoverageEgypt says Arab foreign ministers boycotting Qatar to meet Tillerson on WednesdayVisiting Doha, Tillerson calls Qatari position 'reasonable'Qatar has rejected the charges and said the four countries are trying to impose their own views on its foreign policies. The document surfaced as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in the region to help Washington's allies hammer out a way out of the crisis. In response, Qatar accused Saudi Arabia and the UAE of breaking the spirit of the Riyadh agreement and engaging in an  unwarranted and unprecedented attack on Qatar's sovereignty .

Kuwaiti mediation efforts hit a snag last week when the four Arab states said they were disappointed with Qatar's response to their list of 13 demands. Muslim Brotherhood Qatar said the demands, which included ending support for militant groups, the closure of the Al Jazeera TV channel, shutting down a Turkish military base in Qatar and downgrading ties with Iran, were an infringement of its sovereignty. QNA reported Sheikh Saif Bin Ahmed Al-Thani, director of Qatar's government communications, as saying the 13 demands bore no relation to the Riyadh accord and the latest crisis was the result of a coordinated media campaign against Qatar.  Some of the allegations and demands of the siege countries have no basis, while others were an unwarranted and unprecedented attack on the sovereignty of the state of Qatar in violation to all international and regional agreements.   The 2013 agreement, reached at a meeting in Riyadh hosted by the then Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, was signed by the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, while an implementation mechanism was signed by the six GCC foreign ministers. In the document, the parties agreed to refrain from backing any  political currents that pose a threat to any member country of the (Gulf Cooperation) Council , and provided for Muslim Brotherhood leaders who are non-GCC citizens to leave the area.

No official details were immediately available on the circumstances of the crash in northern Mississippi's LeFlore County, about 100 miles (160 km) north of Jackson, the state capital. Captain Sarah Burns, a spokeswoman for the Marine Corps, said only that a U.S. Marines KC-130 Hercules transport aircraft had  experienced a mishap,  with news media initially reporting five confirmed deaths. Several hours later, Fred Randle, LeFlore County director of emergency management, told Reuters that at least 16 people had perished. Randle gave no further details of the incident. WSOC-TV in Charlotte reported, citing the Federal Aviation Administration, that the flight originated from Cherry Point, North Carolina, where a Marine Corps air base is located. FBI spokesman Brett Carr told the New York Times that the agency was sending officials to the scene, but authorities did not believe foul play was involved.  Weâ€™re just trying to offer any type of assistance,  Carr, a spokesman for the bureauâ€™s Jackson, Mississippi office, told the newspaper.  It could be anything from manpower to evidence response.  Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement on social media site Facebook that the incident was a tragedy, but provided no details. Images posted online by news organizations showed the crumpled wreckage of a plane engulfed in flames in a field surrounded by tall vegetation, with a large plume of smoke in the sky above. The aircraft is used for air-to-air refueling, to carry cargo and perform tactical passenger missions. The plane is operated by three crew members and can carry 92 ground troops or 64 paratroopers, according to a description on the U.S. Navy website.

Yellen's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress will be on Wednesday and Thursday. San Francisco Federal Reserve President John Williams said on Tuesday in Sydney that it was a reasonable view to expect one more rate hike this year, and his own view was to start adjusting the central bank's balance sheet in the next few months. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.6 percent on Tuesday morning. Brent crude futures were at $47.07 per barrel at 0502 GMT, up 0.4 percent, from their last close. Banking shares, which have been strong since the start of the week, may continue to see some buying interest as another hike in interest rates may be net positive on their earnings. Most Gulf currencies are pegged to the dollar and any monetary policy change in the United States is usually mimicked by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. In Riyadh, shares of Saudi Arabian Mining (Ma'aden) may be bid up after saying it has started trial operations at its subsidiary Ma'aden Waad Al Shamal Phosphate Company.  During initial production, MWSPC will gradually ramp-up until it reaches the 3 million tonnes production capacity. The impact on earnings will be recognised following the declaration of commercial production,  Ma'aden said in a statement. Shares of phone and home appliance retailer United Electronics (Extra) may extend on the previous day's strong gains after bullish comments from the company's chief executive. The firms's chief executive Mohamed Fahmy told financial news website, Argaam, late on Monday that the company aims to boost sales through its online portal, and strengthen partnerships with suppliers and brands offering the latest technologies and products. Extra reported a near quadrupling in its second quarter net profit and a 15 percent rise in sales for the period.

Ikaika Erik Kang, 34, an air traffic control specialist who also had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, was arrested by the FBI on Saturday following a year-long undercover probe, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. An FBI affidavit filed in court with the criminal complaint summarized a lengthy sting operation employing several undercover agents and other  confidential human sources  who posed as Islamic State operatives and sympathizers. As described in the affidavit, the sting drew to a climax as Kang swore a pledge of loyalty to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, then proceeded to make training videos for the extremist group, also known as ISIS, which has seized large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. He was taken into custody that same day, the affidavit said. Hours earlier, according to the FBI, he had purchased a GoPro drone aircraft and camera kit that he intended to be sent to the Middle East to help ISIS fighters evade enemy tanks in battle. Kang also is accused of attempting to furnish ISIS with classified and other sensitive military records that would have assisted the group in its combat tactics. But the FBI said none of those documents made it to ISIS.  Kang, a member of the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, was assigned to the Army's Schofield Barracks, a major garrison on the island of Oahu. He is believed to be a  lone actor  with no ties to anyone who might pose a threat to Hawaii, the FBI said. He was brought to the FBI's attention by the Army last year, officials said. At a brief court appearance on Monday, he was presented with the charges against him and ordered to remain in federal custody pending a July 13 detention hearing. He entered no plea. Kang's attorney, Birney Bervar, told reporters afterwards that he knew  very little  about the case, having spoken only briefly to his client just before the hearing as he was handed a copy of the complaint. Kang, who attained the rank of sergeant first class, served three overseas tours of duty - one each in South Korea (2002-03), Iraq (2010-11) and Afghanistan (2013-14), his Army service record shows.

Yellen's semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, may give further indication on the timing of the third Fed rate hike for the year, said Grace Aller, an analyst with Manila-based AP Securities.           A Fed rate hike can further dampen appetite for emerging markets as it points to further strengthening in the investment environment for developed markets,  she said.

Philppine shares edged up 0.3 percent in early trade, helped by industrial and real estate stocks.      Philippine exports rose for a sixth straight month in May, growing 13.7 percent from a year ago, while imports climbed 16.6 percent.     International Container Terminal Services was among the biggest gainers on the index, climbing as much as 2.6 percent, after signing an agreement with a dredging company to deepen the Congo River in Africa, a move that would realize cost savings for the terminal operator from 2018.

Iraq's prime minister declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul on Monday, three years after the militants seized the city. In neighboring Syria, U.S.-backed forces have entered Raqqa and are battling Islamic State militants there. The battlefield advances are a potentially fatal blow to Islamic State's self-proclaimed  caliphate,  but also bring fresh challenges and risks, according to Western diplomats and U.S. officials. The key question, they said, is whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been leery of foreign assistance and  nation building,  and allies in Europe and the Middle East lead a long-term campaign of physical and political reconstruction.  I think everyone has learnt the hard way that unless you stick around and get the job done, weâ€™ll be back there again in 10 yearsâ€™ time,  said one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. One concern, the officials and diplomats said in interviews, is that Iran could fill the vacuum left by Islamic State to expand its clout in both Iraq and Syria. Another is that the region's Sunni Muslims, if not given a share of political and economic power, could be vulnerable to Islamic State recruitment as the group reverts from one that holds territory to a shadowy, violent insurgency. Trump's budget for fiscal year 2018, which begins Oct. 1, would allocate $13 billion for the military fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.  Are we going to spend even a fraction of the amount on reconstruction?  asked Jeremy Konyndyk, who oversaw disaster assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development until January. When the U.S. military withdrew from Iraq in 2011, U.S. aid budgets and personnel were reduced as well, said Konyndyk, now at the Center for Global Development.  We should not make the same mistake this time (of) taking a really military-centric approach to our engagement and once the military job is done, stripping out most of the other tools.  Two-Track Strategy The Washington meetings Tuesday through Thursday will focus on ways to intensify a multi-pronged campaign against Islamic State, according to the State Department. That campaign and the overall military strategy were set under Trump's predecessor, U.S. President Barack Obama. Trump's post-conflict strategy, as described by U.S. officials, follows two tracks. A member of Iraqi security forces holds a flag of Islamic State militants on the top of a destroyed building from clashes in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 10, 2017.Thaier Al-SudanThe United States, they say, will support a robust Iraqi- and United Nations-led effort to stabilize liberated areas in Iraq, where American officials say they have a reliable partner in Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. But amid Syria's ongoing civil war, Washington is pursuing a more cautious, localized stabilization plan. Initial stabilization efforts are already underway in eastern Mosul, but officials said the western part of the city, where fighting was more intense, will be the greater challenge. Nearly 1 million civilians fled the city, according to the United Nations.  This was beyond our worst-case scenario and weâ€™re still one step ahead,  thanks to $1 billion in funding pledged last year, said Lise Grande, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq. Across Iraq, 1.9 million people have returned home, Grande said, adding  I'm not sure you would have bet on this.  Top Trump aides, including national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, commanded U.S. troops in Iraq and remain committed to the country's security, diplomats and analysts said.  The strategy in Iraq will be to prevent an ISIL (Islamic State) recurrence and to prevent an expulsion of the U.S. by Iranian-backed actors. The two issues are viewed as linked,  said Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank.   There is a lot of Iraq experience inside this administration and it shows in the long-term commitment to Iraqi security that is being offered,  Knights said. Pushing back against Iranian influence won't be easy. Tehran wields clout through some Iraqi politicians and Shiite militias, which have recently deployed towards Iraq's border with Syria. Syria is even more fraught, officials said, with its multi-sided civil war that has drawn in outside powers including the United States, Russia, Iran and Turkey. In Syria,  the campaign against ISIS is moving faster than resolution of the underlying political challenges,  a State Department official said, using another acronym for Islamic State.  That has led us to really emphasize the local solutions.  Washington, he said, is backing local civilian councils to provide basic governance in areas U.S.-backed forces have retaken, such as the city of Tabqa and, ultimately, Raqqa. The U.S.-led military coalition's focus is on the quick restoration of essential services,  getting the lights back on. Weâ€™re not reconstructing Syria,â€�Â the official said. There are also tensions over who should pay for what. U.S. and other Western officials argue that Russia, which intervened to help Syrian President Bashar Assad, should contribute.

I announce from here the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism which the terrorist Daesh announced from Mosul,  Haider al-Abadi said in a speech shown on state television, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. A 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi'ite militias launched the offensive to recapture the northern city from the militants in October, with key air and ground support from a U.S.-led coalition. Abadi, wearing a black military uniform and flanked by commanders from the security forces, thanked troops and the coalition. But he warned that more challenges lay ahead.  We have another mission ahead of us, to create stability, to build and clear Daesh cells, and that requires an intelligence and security effort, and the unity which enabled us to fight Daesh,  he said before raising an Iraqi flag. Iraq declared a week-long holiday to mark the victory. People celebrated in the streets of the capital Baghdad and southern cities. Abadi arrived in Mosul on Sunday to congratulate military commanders who have waged a nearly nine-month battle to recapture the city, many parts of which were reduced to rubble. Gunfire and explosions could be heard earlier in the day as the last few Islamic State positions were pounded. The coalition said in a statement Iraqi forces were in  firm control  of Mosul, but some areas still needed to be cleared of explosive devices and possible Islamic State fighters in hiding. Around the time of Abadi's announcement, Islamic State released a statement claiming to have mounted an attack on Iraqi forces in Mosul. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Related CoverageU.S.-led coalition says Mosul victory does not mark end of global threatOld City bears the brunt of Islamic State's last stand in MosulAbadi had been meeting military and political officials in Mosul in an atmosphere of celebration that contrasts with the fear that spread after a few hundred Islamic State militants seized the city and the Iraqi army crumbled in July 2014. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi shocked the Middle East and Western powers three years ago by appearing at the pulpit of Mosul's Grand al-Nuri Mosque to declare the caliphate and himself the leader of the world's Muslims. A reign of terror followed which eventually alienated even many of those Sunni Muslims who had supported the group as allies against Iraq's Shi'ite majority. Opponents of Islamic State were executed and such crimes as smoking a cigarette were punishable by public whipping. Since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, the Shi'ites have been politically dominant in Iraq but the country has been racked by ethnic conflict.

Iraqi Prime Minister Media Office/Handout via REUTERSIn the aftermath of victory in Mosul, Abadi's government  faces the task of managing the sectarian tensions there and elsewhere that enabled Islamic State to win support, and the threat of a wave of revenge violence in the city. The coalition warned that victory in Mosul did not mark the end of the group's global threat.  Now it is time for all Iraqis to unite to ensure ISIS (Islamic State) is defeated across the rest of Iraq and that the conditions that led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq are not allowed to return again,  Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend said in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated Iraq and said Islamic State's days were numbered. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the victory  a critical milestone  in the war against Islamic State. Baghdadi has fled the city and his whereabouts are unknown. Reports have circulated that he is dead but Iraqi and Western officials say they cannot corroborate this.  Slideshow (10 Images)His death or capture would not be the end of Islamic State, which still controls areas south and west of Mosul and which is now expected to take to the desert or mountains to wage an insurgency. The militants are likely to keep trying to launch attacks on the West and inspiring violence by  lone wolves  or small groups of the kind mounted recently in Britain, France and elsewhere. But the loss of Iraq's second-largest city is a grave body blow to Islamic State. Islamic State is also under heavy pressure in its operational headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa. But a concern shared by the United States and its coalition allies is that Iran could fill the vacuum left by the Sunni militants to expand in both Iraq and Syria. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force, the extraterritorial branch of Shi'ite Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said on Monday Iran had sent  thousands of tonnes  of arms and fighter jets to Iraq to help it fight Islamic State, Iranian media reported. Humanitarian Crisis The stench of corpses along Mosul's streets was a reminder of the gruelling urban warfare required to dislodge Islamic State. Much of the city of 1.5 million has been destroyed in the fighting, its centuries-old stone buildings flattened by air strikes and other explosions. One of Islamic State's last acts was to blow up the historic al-Nuri mosque and its famous leaning minaret. Thousands of people have been killed. The United Nations says 920,000 civilians have fled their homes since the military campaign began in October. Close to 700,000 people are still displaced.  It's a relief to know that the military campaign in Mosul is ending. The fighting may be over, but the humanitarian crisis is not,  said U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Lise Grande. Many of the people who have fled have lost everything. They need shelter, food, health care, water, sanitation and emergency kits. The levels of trauma we are seeing are some of the highest anywhere. What people have experienced is nearly unimaginable.  Iraqi soldiers relaxed. Some swam in the Tigris river which runs through the city. One wiped the sweat from his face with an Islamic State flag.

Access to birth control boosts economic productivity by allowing women to earn an income and leads to smaller families with more resources to spend on children's health and education, Gates said. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was co-hosting an international summit in London on family planning, where donors were expected to raise at least $2.5 billion to expand access to contraception.  Contraceptives empower women. And empowered women ... well, they transform societies,  Gates said, according to an advance copy of her speech. The foundation will announce an additional $375 million for family planning over the next four years. The summit comes at a critical time, with U.S. President Donald Trump having said he will end funding to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations agency which deals with family planning, sexual and reproductive health. The Trump administration also reinstated a policy blocking U.S. funding to overseas groups that perform or provide information about abortion. Gates said she was  deeply troubled  by the proposed cuts.  If empowering women is more than just rhetoric for the president, he will prove it by funding family planning,  she added. Gates, who is married to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, said contraception allowed her to finish her education, pursue a career in technology and plan when she had her children.  My family, my career, and my life are the direct result of having access to contraceptives,  she said. But many women around the world get pregnant  too young, too old and too often , she said.  In Malawi, everyone I met told me they knew a woman who had died in pregnancy,  she said.  In India, I sat in a circle of women and asked if anyone had lost a child. Every single woman raised her hand.  Some 214 million women and girls in developing countries cannot get access to contraceptives, experts say. Meeting that need could help avert 67 million unintended pregnancies every year, thereby preventing the deaths of 76,000 women from pregnancy and childbirth related complications, they say. Universal access to reproductive health services would lead to economic benefits of more than $430 billion a year as well, they say.  Family planning has the power to change a whole country's trajectory and help lift people out of grinding poverty,  Priti Patel, Britain's minister for international development, said in a statement. Gates said contraceptives were  one of the smartest investments countries can make .  At the individual level, contraceptives make lives better. In the aggregate, they transform economies.  The summit, held on World Population Day, will focus on ramping up access to contraceptives for adolescents, boosting family planning services in humanitarian crises and improving the supply and range of contraceptives available. The conference comes five years after activists, philanthropists and leaders gathered at an earlier summit and set a goal to empower 120 million additional women and girls in the 69 poorest countries to use modern contraception by 2020. The number has only grown by 30 million since then, meaning the target will be missed unless efforts are accelerated, organisers said. (Reporting by Emma Batha, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

The CSI300 index rose 0.5 percent, to 3,670.57 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, to 3,206.96 points.

The dollar was 0.1 percent higher at 114.190 yen following a rise to a two-month high of 114.300 overnight. The euro was effectively flat at $1.1394 after inching down about 0.1 percent the previous day.  The dollar is capped as the surge in German bund yields stopped overnight and in turn dragged down U.S. Treasury yields. The recent surge in bond yields appears overdone and we are seeing a bit of a correction,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. Investors have dumped euro zone government bonds over the past two weeks on expectations the European Central Bank (ECB) would unwind extraordinary stimulus sooner rather than later. The resulting surge in euro zone yields had also helped the benchmark Treasury yield climb to two-month highs on Friday. Japanese government bond (JGB) yields had also tracked the rise in their U.S. and euro zone counterparts. Last week, however, the Bank of Japan stepped in and halted the move through a special debt-buying operation, intent on keeping yields anchored close to zero. With U.S. yields free to rise, the spread between 10-year Treasury and JGB yields is the widest it has been in two months, contributing to the dollar's strength against the yen.  JGB yields can't move at all after the BOJ came out and stopped the yield rise with brute force, leaving the door open for the U.S.-Japan yield spread to widen,  said Ishizuki at Daiwa Securities. The next large cue for the currency market was seen coming from Fed's Yellen, due to make a semi-annual testimony before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Dollar bulls are banking on Yellen to retain her hawkish stance, emboldened by last Friday's relatively robust U.S. non-farm jobs report.  The main focus is whether Yellen makes it clear in Congress that the Fed intends to begin winding down quantitative easing. Once the intent is shown in front of Congress, the next step would be to actually follow through with it,  said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo. The pound was little changed at $1.2877. It was within reach of a two-week low of $1.2855 plumbed overnight after a run of lacklustre data cast doubt over the Bank of England's recent warnings that it is on the verge of raising borrowing costs. BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent is due to speak later in the day, giving investors a chance to hear the views of an interest-rate setter's first public comments since a narrow vote to keep rates unchanged last month. The Australian dollar inched up 0.2 percent to $0.7619 as the greenback's broader advance slowed. The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.5 percent to $0.7238 on lacklustre local data showing that electronic retail card spending remained unchanged in June.

That internationalism was felt this year through the fashion collections displayed. Nigerian-born designer Taofeek Abijako dressed male models in boxy fits and bright colors, saying he drew on the colonial history of his country for inspiration.  I took inspiration from African contemporary photographers like Malick SidibÃ©, Seydou Keita ... and how they reacted to Western influence,  he said. Although just in its fifth year, New York Fashion Week: Men's is fast becoming an important stop on the fashion circuit.      I love that New York Fashion Week: Men's is really gaining momentum,  said American designer David Hart, who showcased light summerwear that invoked a feel of Cuba, which has recently restored ties with the United States and seen a rise in tourism.  I feel like there is a new energy, and big excitement, and it really is a platform for the menswear designers here in New York City,  he said. The event mostly dropped the traditional catwalk associated with large fashion shows and designers instead had models stand in large spaces to showcase the clothes. Later in the week, the show will feature collection debuts by Raf Simons and Boss, while Robert Geller launches a contemporary line called  Gustav von Aschenbach  and Barbara Sanchez-Kane of Sanchez-Kane shows for the first time in New York.  New York Fashion Week: Men's  will run till Thursday.
