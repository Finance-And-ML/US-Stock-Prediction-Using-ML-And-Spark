But member nations, including Mexico, committed to keep pressing the issue until the crisis in Venezuela, where at least 75 people have been killed in more than two months of protests, is peacefully resolved.  Mexico's position on Venezuela is a position that will not waver, it's a position that says representative democracy is the only form of government acceptable in the Western Hemisphere,  Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told reporters. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is accused by opponents of leading the OPEC member toward dictatorship by delaying elections, jailing opposition activists and pressing to overhaul the constitution. Videgaray and OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro repeated calls for Venezuela to establish an election timetable, respect for human rights, political prisoners to be freed, an independent judiciary and respect for the autonomy of the legislature.  Foreign ministers from the 34-nation OAS bloc failed to agree on a resolution formally rebuking Venezuela after the issue of the crisis-racked nations consumed most of the three-day general assembly in Cancun, Mexico. A group of Venezuelan opposition lawmakers and members of the Venezuela diaspora protest at the Organization of American States (OAS) 47th General Assembly in Cancun, Mexico June 21, 2017 in this still image taken from video. OAS POOL TV via REUTERSAn effort by a group of nations, led by the United States, Mexico and regional allies, to include a declaration on Venezuela by tucking it into a more general resolution on human rights also failed. Throughout the OAS sessions, Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez fought back at attempts to chastise her nation, accusing U.S. allies of being  lapdogs of imperialism.  Slideshow (13 Images)Rodriguez left her post as foreign minister on Wednesday to run for a seat in a controversial new congress, drawing praise from Maduro as a  tiger  for her feisty defense of the socialist government. Twenty states voted to pass the draft resolution censuring Venezuela on Monday, falling short of the 23 votes, or two-thirds majority, needed. Maduro accuses opponents of seeking his violent overthrow with U.S. support. He has called for the creation of a super-body, or constituent assembly, with powers to overhaul the constitution, in voting set for the end of July. Four years of recession caused by failing socialist economic policies plus the decline in global oil prices have battered Venezuela's 30 million people and made Maduro deeply unpopular. Opposition leaders accuse Maduro of leading Venezuela toward dictatorship by delaying elections and jailing opposition activists, while food and medicine run short and inflation is believed to be in the triple digits.

Kalanick's departure caps a tumultuous period for the world's largest ride-services company that has revolutionized the taxi industry and challenged transportation regulations worldwide. The resignation sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and leaves Uber's board of directors with the problem of finding a dynamic leader who also has a steady hand needed to heal Uber after a bruising six months.  The person who still best personifies Uber's potential is the person who left Tuesday night,  said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and adviser.  But it's not like he really could stay without it being brutally bad for the company.  Kalanick's pugnacious style largely defined Uber's approach and helped it become a transportation colossus valued at $68 billion, the largest private firm backed by venture capitalists in the world.  But that brashness has also been blamed for a string of scandals this year, from the unearthing of a culture of sexism and bullying at Uber to a U.S. Department of Justice federal investigation and a high-stakes lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) autonomous car division, Waymo, that threatens Uber's self-driving car ambitions.  I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors' request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,  Kalanick said in an email to employees that was seen by Reuters. Kalanick's departure as CEO widens an already gaping hole at the top of Uber which has no chief financial officer, head of engineering or general counsel at the moment. For now, 14 people who reported to Kalanick are running Uber. It is not clear who will be Uber's new CEO, but the next leader will likely be tasked with making the company profitable and paving the way to an initial public offering, said executive recruiters.  They need someone who is willing to walk into this mess, and be the single adult in this room for awhile until the rest of the executive team is in place,  said Steve Nilsen, a partner at executive search firm Boyden. The pursuit of a CEO puts the more than three-months-old search for a chief operating officer on hold, according to a source close to the board. The CEO must be hired first, the person said, and he or she will be key to figuring out the remaining positions to fill. Uber declined comment.  Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has been identified as a target in media reports, but a source close to Sandberg told Reuters she plans to stay at the online social media company.  Toxic Culture  Kalanick, who will remain on Uber's board, will likely have some sway over the new CEO. He still wields significant power in the board room, made possible by a dual-class share structure that gives him and key allies 10 votes per share.  Ultimately, it was some of Uber's main investors who forced Kalanick out, according to a source familiar with the matter. Venture capital firm Benchmark, whose partner Bill Gurley is one of Uber's largest shareholders, plus investors First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments, all pressed Kalanick to quit. A source close to Menlo Ventures, which led one of Uber's early financing rounds, told Reuters that the firm helped write a letter calling for Kalanick to step down. The investors delivered the letter to Kalanick while he was in Chicago, the New York Times reported, citing people with knowledge of the situation.

In a statement sent to Reuters, the Uber board of directors said Kalanick's resignation  gives the company room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber's history.  Gurley on Wednesday resigned from his influential board seat, a Benchmark spokeswoman said, signaling the departure of one of Kalanick's closest confidants. He will be replaced by Benchmark general partner Matt Cohler. The board got a second new member on Wednesday in David Trujillo of TPG Capital, an Uber investor, according to a source familiar with the matter. Trujillo replaces David Bonderman, a co-founder of TPG who resigned from the board last week after making a sexist remark during an all-staff meeting called to discuss the results of an investigation into sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber.  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder led that investigation, which concluded that Kalanick's authority should be reduced and that board oversight and independence should increase. Uber hired Holder's firm Covington and Burling to look into its culture and workplace practices after a female former employee, Susan Fowler, publicly accused the company of sexual harassment. In addition, Uber fired 20 employees for incidents involving discrimination, sexual harassment and other bad behavior earlier this month. Slideshow (3 Images)Uber  is the very definition of a toxic leadership culture  and Kalanick  set the tone , said Jason Hanold, chief executive officer and managing partner at human resources executive recruitment firm Hanold Associates. Sweeping Power Following the release of the Covington report, Kalanick said last week he would take a leave of absence to grieve for his mother, who died recently in a boating accident that also seriously injured his father, and to work on his leadership skills.  Uber couldn't make a credible claim that it was committed to the changes it has to make if he was hovering in the wings, waiting to return as CEO,  said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. Kalanick and other executives were also criticized for the handling of a crisis in India after an Uber driver was arrested for raping a passenger. Though the driver was convicted in 2015, Kalanick and other executives became convinced the crime was a set up by a local rival, former employees said.  Eric Alexander, the head of Asian business for Uber, shared medical records internally, including with Kalanick. Alexander argued they showed the woman had been assaulted but not raped, people who spoke to him said. Alexander was fired earlier this month.  Even some of Kalanick's staunchest allies have found fault with how Uber has been run. In a blog post on Medium published on Tuesday, Uber co-founder Garrett Camp, who has long aligned himself with Kalanick, called Uber's problems serious.  Over the years we have neglected parts of our culture as we have focused on growth. We have failed to build some of the systems that every company needs to scale successfully,  Camp wrote. In March, following the start of the Holder investigation, Uber director Arianna Huffington said on a call with reporters the board had full confidence in Kalanick. She repeated that position on Friday in an interview with Reuters by saying Kalanick's leave of absence was solely his decision. Benchmark's Gurley praised the CEO on Twitter following his resignation.  There will be many pages in the history books devoted to @travisk - very few entrepreneurs have had such a lasting impact on the world,  Gurley wrote.

Kalanick's departure caps a tumultuous period for the world's largest ride-services company that has revolutionized the taxi industry and challenged transportation regulations worldwide. The resignation sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and leaves Uber's board of directors with the problem of finding a dynamic leader who also has a steady hand needed to heal Uber after a bruising six months.  The person who still best personifies Uber's potential is the person who left Tuesday night,  said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and adviser.  But it's not like he really could stay without it being brutally bad for the company.  Kalanick's pugnacious style largely defined Uber's approach and helped it become a transportation colossus valued at $68 billion, the largest private firm backed by venture capitalists in the world.  But that brashness has also been blamed for a string of scandals this year, from the unearthing of a culture of sexism and bullying at Uber to a U.S. Department of Justice federal investigation and a high-stakes lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) autonomous car division, Waymo, that threatens Uber's self-driving car ambitions.  I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors' request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,  Kalanick said in an email to employees that was seen by Reuters. Kalanick's departure as CEO widens an already gaping hole at the top of Uber which has no chief financial officer, head of engineering or general counsel at the moment.

The notes are rated at the same level as Shimao's senior unsecured rating as they constitute its direct and senior unsecured obligations. The final ratings are contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. Shimao's ratings are supported by its focus on maintaining high margins from its high quality and well-located land bank rather than building contracted sales. Its contracted sales have been stable at around CNY67 billion each year for the last four years, while its cash collection of contracted sales was a healthy 80%-88%. The homebuilder maintained an EBITDA margin of 26%-27% in 2015-2016, which is comparable with other 'BBB' to 'BBB+' rated peers. Fitch expects Shimao's cash flow from operations (CFO) to remain neutral to positive in the next year or two, after achieving positive CFO of CNY2.2 billion in 2015, including capex on property construction. The ratings are also supported by the homebuilder's strong execution record and leadership in key regions. KEY RATING DRIVERS Well-Positioned in Lower-Tier Cities: Shimao is well-positioned to capture market growth in weaker tier 2 and stronger tier 3 and 4 cities and has increased its 2017 target for the share of contracted sales from these cities to 40% of total contracted sales, from a Fitch-estimate of 23%-25% in 2016. We expect stronger growth from these cities in 2017 due to limited supply and strict policies to rein in property price increases in tier 1 cities. High-Quality Inventory: Shimao re-established its focus on higher-tier cities in 2014, when the average land cost was around CNY3,000-4,000 per square metre (sq m). Fitch expects average selling prices for these projects to be as high as CNY14,000/sq m subject to location, allowing Shimao to maintain its margin-focused business model for the next year or two. Tighter Operational Control: Fitch believes Shimao's efforts to improve its sales efficiency, cash flow cycle, operations and financing costs have created a sound base to maintain its stable business profile for the next year or two. Shimao improved its sell-through rate for new supply to 74% in 2017, from 60% in 2014, and its cash collection rate increased to 88%, from 80%. Selling, general and administrative expenses also improved to around 7% of recognised revenue, from over 8% historically, and Shimao reported that its finance costs decreased to around 5.8% at end-2016, from 6.9% at end-2015. The homebuilder has also moved with the market towards upgrader and larger units and expects these products to make up 72% of its 2017 saleable resources, from 66% in 2014 and 2013. It continued to clear inventory in more remote lower-tier cities that have not benefited from growth in upper-tier cities and increased the proportion of products targeting buyers in tier 1 and 2 cities. Expansion into Hotel and Investment Properties: Shimao forecasts annual hotel income growth of 20% to CNY4 billion by 2021 and an expansion of its commercial investment properties to more than 2 million sq m gross floor area (GFA), with rental income of CNY3 billion. Fitch estimates that Shimao has a GFA of more than 1 million sq m in commercial and office building resources in its pipeline to support its five-year plan. We do not expect the homebuilder's expansion into hotels and investment properties to affect its property development business, as its CFO is close to neutral and it has significantly improved its homebuilding operations. Shimao's hotel and rental segment had revenue of CNY3 billion and an EBITDA margin of around 65%-70% in 2016. Fitch will monitor the development of Shimao's investment-property operation and may consider positive rating action if Shimao's investment-property business stabilises at a larger scale that generates substantially higher recurring income. Healthy Financial Profile: Fitch expects Shimao to maintain its EBITDA margin at above 25% and its leverage below 30%-32% for the next two years, although this may narrow thereafter as sector competition intensifies. Shimao has a well-located land bank and products in higher-tier cities that will support wider margins than those of peers. DERIVATION SUMMARY Shimao has elevated itself to a margin-focused homebuilder by moving away from a contracted sales model. It is well-positioned among peers. Its contracted sales of around CNY68 billion a year are comparable with peers rated 'BBB-' to 'BB+' and its EBITDA margin of 26%-27% in 2015-2016 are comparable with 'BBB' to 'BBB+' rated peers, such as China Overseas Land & Investment Limited (A-/Stable) and China Resources Land Ltd (BBB+/Stable). Shimao's leverage of around 30%-32% is comparable with that of Longfor Properties Co. Ltd. (BBB-/Stable). No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary aspects affect Shimao's rating. Operating environment risks make it difficult for companies in this sector to be rated above 'BBB+'. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: - Contracted sales by GFA to increase by 7%-8% over 2017-2018. - Average selling prices for contracted sales to increase by 5% in 2017-2018. - An EBITDA margin of around 25%-27% in 2017-2018. - Land premium of CNY40 billion in 2017-2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action: -sustained strong positive cash flow from operations (CFO); -stronger position in metropolitan cities in northern and southern China without significant deterioration in its financial profile; -net debt/adjusted inventory sustained below 25% (2016: 32%, 2015: 31%); and -investment property operations stabilising at a larger scale and generating substantially higher recurring income. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action: - negative CFO for a prolonged period; - net debt/adjusted inventory at above 35% for a prolonged period; - an EBITDA margin below 22% for a prolonged period (2016: 27%. 2015: 27%); and - contracted sales/total debt at below 1.0x for a prolonged period (2016: 1.0x, 2015: 0.9x). LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: Shimao had CNY22.2 billion in cash, of which CNY2.9 billion was restricted, and CNY22 billion in unused bank credit facilities as of end-2016. This easily covers its short-term borrowings of CNY17.8 billion. Diversified Funding Channels: Shimao has many financing options, including equity issuance, perpetual capital securities, offshore notes, onshore debentures and bank borrowings. Its weighted-average borrowing cost was 5.8% in 2016.

Conner signed the deal to add the Shenzhen-based airline to a list of launch customers for the new jet at the Paris Airshow, calling it  great to finish up this way  and expressing satisfaction that it was with an  all-Boeing customer.  The deal for jets worth $1.2 billion was signed at an emotional ceremony at Boeing's air show base as sales vice president Ihssane Mounir hailed a  very good friend, mentor and boss.  Donghai Chairman Wong Cho-Bau said he was happy to sign Conner's last deal but could not resist a final tweak of the negotiations, joking that he wanted  early delivery positions .

Six months into the job, he faced a four-month grounding of the 787 Dreamliner due to battery problems, from which Boeing emerged without losing any customers but with wounded pride, and set about stabilizing production of the new high-tech jet. But he clashed with unions over employment and efforts to make Boeing more competitive against Europe's Airbus. His departure marks a turning point coinciding with the planned retirement later this year of Airbus sales chief John Leahy, another industry veteran who went head to head with Conner in pursuit of deals worth tens of billions of dollars.

More than 200 people were arrested in Washington in January after some black-clad activists among those protesting Donald Trump's swearing-in clashed with police a few blocks from the White House, in an outburst of violence rare for an inauguration. The lawsuit against the Metropolitan Police Department, the District of Columbia and individual officers claims the plaintiffs broke no laws at the protests and endured abuses including being pepper-sprayed and denied food and water for hours.  The plaintiffs include two individuals who came to the District of Columbia to express their views concerning the inauguration and a photojournalist who covered the demonstrations.  “The MPD’s extreme tactics against members of the public, including journalists, demonstrators, and observers, were unjustifiable and unconstitutional,  Scott Michelman, senior staff attorney for the ACLU-DC, said in a statement. Since Trump's election win, a number of demonstrations in U.S. cities have highlighted strong discontent over his comments and policy positions toward a wide range of groups, including Mexican immigrants, Muslims, the disabled and environmentalists.

It added officers worked diligently to protect the rights of thousands who came to the inauguration to peacefully express their views.   Unfortunately, there was another group of individuals who chose to engage in criminal acts, destroying property and hurling projectiles, injuring at least six officers. These individuals were ultimately arrested for their criminal actions,  it said. The lawsuit says photojournalist Shay Horse was pepper-sprayed while taking photographs and subjected to unjustified, invasive body probes. It also said demonstrator Elizabeth Lagesse was peacefully protesting when she was arrested and handcuffed so tightly that her wrists bled.

The Nikkei was down 0.1 percent at 20,118.25 at the end of morning trade, extending Wednesday's decline and moving further away from Tuesday's session high of 20,318.11 - its loftiest level since August 2015. The dollar skidded 0.4 percent against the yen to 110.96 .  The Nikkei is heavy, as some investors continue to take profits on its recent rise and the yen strengthens,  said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  Some individual shares are rising on specific news, but overall, there are no big buying incentive factors,  he said. On Wall Street overnight, U.S. shares put in a mixed performance, with only the Nasdaq Composite marking a gain. Satori Electric Co shares rose 2.9 percent after earlier touching their highest since November 2015. The company on Wednesday said it expected to post a net profit of 220 million yen ($1.98 mln) for its fiscal year through May 31, compared with its previous estimate of no profit. Shares in Takata Corp changed hands for the first time since sources said last week that the struggling airbag maker was preparing to file for bankruptcy, falling 51.6 percent. The stock has closed down by its daily limit each day this week after being untraded during the day - a forced close in accordance with Tokyo Stock Exchange rules. It has lost about 75 percent of its value since Friday.  Obviously, with Takata, someone is now seeing some kind of trading value there,  said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading Ltd.  But ultimately, there needs to be more clarity in quantifying the ultimate liability of this company, because who knows what kind of litigation or claims it will face down the line.  Shares of Toshiba Corp pared losses but fell 0.1 percent, as the company aims to seal a deal worth some $18 billion by next week for the sale of its chip business needed to cover massive losses. Toshiba has chosen a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors as the preferred bidder. The mining sector fell 1.6 percent. While oil prices steadied in Asian trade after a recent spate of weakness, investors are looking for more signs that output cuts by OPEC and some other producers are ending a three-year glut.

Kazikhstan's Golovkin will carry a 37-0 record, including 33 knockouts, and his WBC, WBA, IBF and IBO championship belts into the Sept. 16 fight in Las Vegas. Alvarez, the red-haired darling of boxing-crazed Mexico with a 49-1-1 record and 34 knockouts, told a group of reporters at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday that there would be no need for a rematch or potential trilogy.  It only needs to be one,  he said on the New York stop of the promotional tour.  I want to make it clear that I’m better than him and there will be no need for another fight.  Knockout artist Golovkin was so efficient in the ring over the last few years he had a hard time getting top-flight opponents to agree to fight him, including Alvarez. Golden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya said now was the perfect time for his 26-year-old Alvarez to get in the ring against 35-year-old Golovkin, who was pushed to 12 rounds for the first time in his previous bout against Danny Jacobs.  The timing couldn’t be at a better moment,  said De La Hoya.  Canelo is a full-blown middleweight and Golovkin is undefeated at middleweight. This fight has been perfectly planned at the perfect time.  Canelo began boxing professionally at 139 pounds aged 15 before moving up through the weight classes, holding world middleweight and super welterweight titles. Britain Boxing - Gennady Golovkin & Canelo Alvarez Press Conference - The Landmark London - June 19, 2017 Gennady Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez go head to head after the press conference Action Images via Reuters / Henry Browne LivepicThe Mexican said Golovkin's previous opponent missed a golden opportunity to hand the Kazakh his first defeat.  I think Jacobs gave him too much respect the first two rounds and if he would have started sooner and not respect him as much he would have won a clear decision,  he said. Slideshow (7 Images)The Golovkin-Alvarez bout will come three weeks after the much-hyped fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr and mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor. Golovkin has already branded the crossover bout a  circus show  and while Alvarez has also dismissed the importance of that fight, it does hold some interest for him. The only blemish on the Mexican's record is a 2013 title fight defeat to Mayweather via a 12-round decision.  That fight motivated me. It motivated me to become a better fighter,  he said. And if Mayweather, who retired after his last fight in September 2015, has it in mind to resume his ring career against legitimate boxers, Alvarez said he was interested in getting revenge for his one and only loss.  Sure, why not? It’s in the back of my mind, that fight. And I would love to erase it.

Farmers in the world's No. 4 soy exporter gathered in Itapua, one of the main agricultural areas of the landlocked South American country, complaining the tax would put an end to corn and wheat planting and shrink soy output.  This tax has to be rejected because it is going to kill Paraguayan agriculture,  Colonias Unidas cooperative President Agustin Konrad told Reuters.  The proposal, which could come to a vote on Thursday, came from a leftist coalition in Congress, Guasu Front.

San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Christopher Hite gave the state attorney general's office until mid-July to file a revised complaint that describes the accusations in greater detail, including specific dates, alleged victims and circumstances. Hite ruled the identities of alleged victims would remain under court seal and admonished lawyers to keep that information confidential, after the defense team for one defendant, David Daleiden, was found to have posted videos and other identifying material online. The judge declined to take disciplinary action against Daleiden's lawyers, as urged by prosecutors, and also denied the defense's request to toss out the case. Daleiden, 28, and Sandra Merritt, 64, appeared in court on Wednesday, but they are not expected to enter a plea until the arraignment on July 17, the deadline set for the amended complaint. Each is charged with conspiracy and 14 counts of invasion of privacy for creating false identities as representatives of a fetal-tissue procurement company to infiltrate a 2014 National Abortion Federation meeting, then videotaping conference participants and others without their consent.  FILE PHOTO: Anti-abortion activist, Sandra Merritt, waits outside Superior Court in San Francisco, California, U.S., May 3, 2017.Lisa Fernandez/File PhotoDaleiden and Merritt have cast themselves as targets of a politically motivated prosecution for their roles in  sting  operations that exposed Planned Parenthood and related groups to unwelcome scrutiny by conservatives in Congress during the run-up to the 2016 elections.   Defense lawyers say Daleiden and Merritt acted as  citizen journalists  employing well-worn undercover tactics of the news media. Prosecutors counter that Daleiden and Merritt engaged in computer hacking and criminal fraud to create false IDs and a sham corporate entity to gain access to private meetings - behavior that bona fide journalists would avoid as unethical. Daleiden became an anti-abortion movement hero in 2015 after his group, the Center for Medical Progress, circulated videos purporting to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to profit from the sale of aborted fetal tissue in violation of federal law.  The organization said Daleiden's heavily edited videos distorted its lawful and ethical practice of seeking reimbursement only to cover costs associated with such donations. Daleiden and Merritt were indicted in January 2016 for using illegal government IDs to covertly film a Planned Parenthood facility in Texas, but that case was dropped.

The Fed is looking to start reducing its massive $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities beginning later this year. Most of the assets were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. However, the PBOC's assets are mainly foreign exchange-based, Sheng Songcheng, former director-general of statistics and research at the central bank, wrote in the Shanghai Securities News.   The balance sheet structures of China and the United States' are very different,  he wrote in the newspaper.   The PBOC does not have the huge portfolio of securities assets that need to be dealt with and foreign exchange accounts are impacted by capital flows, which can be hedged by adjusted other subjects,  he said.  The PBOC also held a neutral monetary policy, he added, while the Fed is aiming to gradually normalize ultra-loose  conditions. Sheng also said that while the Fed's balance sheet expanded rapidly during the financial crisis, from less than $900 billion before 2007 to $4.5 trillion in 2014, the PBOC's balance sheet less than doubled in size during that period.  The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week for the second time in three months and said it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year in a bid to shrink its balance sheet. While the PBOC's policy stance has also been seen as super loose since the financial crisis, China's economic stimulus has been more direct - largely coming in the form of credit extended by big state-controlled banks and increased government spending on items like big infrastructure projects. Aggregate financing in China, which includes bank loans as well as off-balance sheet lending, surged in March and was a record in the first quarter.

Mehul Kapadia, one of those who helps make things happen as head of Formula One business at official  connectivity partner  Tata Communications, is eager to step on the accelerator.  While Formula One gets criticized for being late on the digital journey, a lot has been happening,  he told Reuters in an interview.  The conversations which are now happening are far more ‘Let’s get it done’.  It was not always that way. Liberty Media, the U.S. firm that completed a takeover of the sport in January, immediately identified digital as an area ripe for development as it seeks to tap lucrative new revenue streams and give fans more of an experience. Its chief executive Greg Maffei said last September that less than one percent of revenues were from digital and that there was a huge amount of video feed and data about the races that were being captured but not processed incrementally for the dedicated fan. Formula One's chief technical officer John Morrison said at the same time, at the awarding of Tata's F1 connectivity prize in Austin, Texas, that the sport was about two years away from fans being able to race virtually in a real race. The main problem, he explained then, was getting the accuracy of GPS positioning down to about 10mm from the current 200mm. Kapadia could see that obstacle being overcome.  If you look at the pace of development happening in that field, two years doesn’t seem to be incorrect,  he said.  Is the appetite there to commercialize it? That is a different question.  Four Groups Kapadia said fans could be divided into four distinct groupings that needed to be catered for. There are those attending the race, those watching on television at home, people 'consuming' the sport on the move, and the largest group of all - a restless 'always on generation' seeking bite-sized entertainment.  They don’t have 90 minutes for anything apart from the exam papers they are forced to sit. A lot are not even watching movies now,  he said. That demographic is one that Formula One has a particular interest in targeting and Kapadia said there was plenty that could be done immediately with existing technology to win them over. The important thing was for fans to see progress after being promised change, even if only providing quick and reliable WiFi trackside that would allow the use of more interactive smartphone apps and augmented reality. A start was made in Canada this month when free WiFi was available to fans throughout the race weekend, while footage from inside the previously off-limits pre-race drivers' briefing was also released. The use of 360 cameras and VR technology could be harnessed to provide an immersive experience from various parts of the track and pitlane.  I would like a bunch of things to happen by next year so that people start seeing the path,  said Kapadia.  Everything won’t happen but some things happening will give people the confidence of the trajectory.  Personally I would like to see the power of connectivity unleashed at the race. Fan experiences at the racetrack completely evolving to the next level because they can now connect in, literally, to what’s happening.  The other thing is, I believe a lot of bite-sized content throughout the year, not just on the race day ... We have amazing stuff that can happen, amazing footage, driver experiences which are out there.  I believe this entire digital transformation thing is about unlocking the value for those four different groups, converting it from a once-in-a-while experience to something that you can participate in throughout the year at any point of time.

All we do is win, win, win,” he told a cheering crowd. A feisty Trump spoke for more than an hour at a rally in Cedar Rapids that was similar to those he held during last year's presidential campaign. It included protesters escorted out by police, Trump attacking the news media and supporters waving signs saying  Drain the Swamp  in Washington. Trump's first trip to Iowa since taking office on Jan. 20 came against a backdrop of problems in Washington. His legislative agenda is struggling to gain traction, a federal investigation of alleged Russian meddling into the election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign continues and his approval rating is below 40 percent in most polls. But Trump touted jobs gains and an improving stock market as evidence that his economic policies are working. He vowed he would eventually get funding for a border wall with Mexico - possibly with solar panels attached - despite congressional refusal thus far.  We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall,  he said.  Pretty good imagination, right? It's my ideas.  Solar panels along the wall are among proposals that have been submitted by companies to the Department of Homeland Security, according to media reports. Buoyed by Republican victories in special congressional elections in Georgia and South Carolina on Tuesday, Trump blasted his opponents as  unbelievably nasty  and said cable news anchors appeared stunned by the Democratic losses. Unable to get Democrats to join Republicans in major legislative efforts, Trump said the wounding by a gunman last week of Republican Representative Steve Scalise in Alexandria, Virginia, had fostered a spirit of unity. But he did not sound optimistic about breaking through the partisan divide any time soon. Trump said he doubted he would have help from Democrats in getting major healthcare legislation through the U.S. Congress. He wants the Senate to join the House of Representatives in approving legislation soon to reform the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.  If we went and got the single greatest healthcare plan in the history of the world we would not get one Democrat vote because they’re obstructionists,  Trump said. Looking to foreign policy, Trump complained about the  bad hand  he had been dealt, such as North Korea's nuclear program, days after American student Otto Warmbier died after returning in a coma from captivity in North Korea. On Tuesday, Trump had tweeted that he has basically given up on getting help from Chinese President Xi Jinping on North Korea after investing a lot of effort to coaxing Beijing to use its influence on Pyongyang.  I do like President Xi,  said Trump, who was with the new U.S. ambassador to China, former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad.  I do wish we would have a little more help on North Korea.

In a bi-annual report on financial stability, the Bank of Korea said debt-to-disposable income at South Korean households was at 153.3 percent in the first quarter, up 8.6 percent points from a year earlier. While the private sector's overall ability to repay debt was still in  fair condition,  the number of households that could default with rising yields could increase by 60,000 should there be a 1.5 percentage point hike in lending rates. Currently, about 315,000, or 2.9 percent of households are facing default risks as these homes are categorized as stressed, whose assets may not cover debt repayment and ongoing costs, the central bank said. South Korean households are facing higher lending rates amid rising interest rates in the United Sates, leaving little cash for discretionary spending as their income gets squeezed by large mortgages and high rental payments in the country's red-hot property market. The average mortgage rate was at 3.21 percent in April, the highest in about 2 years and up from 3.13 percent as of December 2016, Bank of Korea data shows.

Those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients' income, a  major improvement  from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services.  The healthcare bill will be released to the Republican Senate Conference on Thursday morning and posted online, senators said. A vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid.  There is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the Obama healthcare law,  Senator John Barrasso, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN.  People across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.  Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement that leaked details of the bill indicated it was  every bit as devastating for families’ bank accounts and healthcare coverage as the disastrous bill that passed in the House.  President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal Obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.          Republican Concern Some Republican senators voiced concern on Wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their party's leaders prepare to unveil it. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017.Joshua RobertsRepublican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes.  I'd find it hard to believe we'll have enough time,  he said, adding that if he did not get enough information,  I won't be voting yes.  Democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the Republican-led Senate need at least two Republicans to defect. The Democrats have criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, and blocked Senate committees on Wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, defending the closed-door sessions, has said all Senate Republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that Democrats are not interested in overhauling Obamacare. Once the plan is unveiled, Senate Republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the House version would be harmful for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing health conditions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.  Slideshow (8 Images)Trump told a rally in Iowa on Wednesday night that he hoped the Senate would come up with a  really good  bill.  I’ve been talking about a plan with heart,  Trump said. He had privately called the House legislation  mean,  according to congressional sources. Party Tensions Several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. Much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the Medicaid expansion that took place under Obamacare. Moderates favored a seven-year phase-out, but the Senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. There was also an argument over Medicaid's growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025.  That's what we're told it might be,  said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.  Cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost-sharing subsidies made available to help low-income Americans under Obamacare  for a couple of years.  Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.   The first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,  she said.  An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the Republican-controlled House, according to the CBO.

In the most expensive congressional election in U.S. history, Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, defeated political newcomer Democrat Jon Ossoff by 4 percentage points on Tuesday in a suburban Atlanta district that Republicans have held since the 1970s. The special election, to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price after Trump appointed him health and human services secretary, did not change the balance of power in Washington where Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress. But it was a demoralizing blow to Democrats hoping Georgia would be a breakthrough for a party trying to harvest electoral victories from the grassroots anti-Trump activism seen in marches on Washington and boisterous crowds at town hall meetings around the country. The district was seen as within reach to Democrats because Trump won there last November by only 1 percentage point. Democrats also lost a special election in South Carolina on Tuesday in a race Republicans were widely expected to win. Democrats lost two other contested special elections earlier this year for Republican-held seats in conservative Kansas and Montana. That makes the party 0-for-4 in this year's races for Republican-held congressional seats.  Ossoff race better be a wake up call for Democrats - business as usual isn't working,  tweeted Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts.  We need a genuinely new message, a serious jobs plan that reaches all Americans, and a bigger tent.  Several prominent Democrats said the party needed to rethink its approach heading into next year's congressional elections, when Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to regain control of the House of Representatives. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut told MSNBC that Democrats needed to focus on economic growth and  get back to being a big tent party.  'Party Needs New Leadership' The outcome also raised questions about the future of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Republican groups spent millions on television ads linking Ossoff to Pelosi, portraying him as a captive of the party's liberal wing despite Ossoff's efforts to present a more moderate image. U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks to reporters during his meeting with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S. June 20, 2017.Jonathan ErnstIn South Carolina, Charleston attorney and Democratic political newcomer Joe Cunningham said on Wednesday he would seek the House seat now held by Republican Mark Sanford, but that if elected he would not back Pelosi as the Democratic leader.  The Democratic Party needs new leadership now,  Cunningham tweeted.  The road to a Democratic House majority runs through dozens of districts similar to the affluent, well-educated northern suburbs of Atlanta where Ossoff was defeated, and the outcome there is likely to reassure Republicans already nervous about their chances of holding control under Trump next year. Slideshow (4 Images)The win in Georgia also could strengthen the political will of Republicans in Congress evaluating their next steps on a tax package and what opinion polls show is a deeply unpopular replacement of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Trump was quick to celebrate the Georgia win and accused Democrats of standing in the way of a legislative agenda bogged down by infighting and investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in last year's presidential election. At a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Wednesday night, Trump said:  If Karen Handel had lost, they would have blamed it on me.   And don't forget, this happened in Montana, in Kansas,  he added.  They don't get it. They haven't figured it out yet. You know they're still trying to figure where all those voters came from,  he said of Democrats.  Despite the string of losses in special elections, some Democrats said there were reasons to be encouraged. In all four states, Democrats bolstered their historical performance in districts they lost by double-digit margins last year. The unpopularity of Trump and the Republican healthcare bill - along with the historic trend that the party holding the White House loses seats in midterm elections - gives Democrats hope for capturing the House in 2018. Democrats have a target-rich environment next year, starting with 23 Republican-held districts where Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won a majority of the vote.

People Magazine and E! News, citing unidentified sources, said the couple had hired a surrogate, and TMZ.com said they had agreed to pay the surrogate more than $113,000 to carry a child.  It was not clear whether the surrogate was already pregnant. Kardashian's representative did not respond to a request for  comment.  Kardashian, 36, has two children with rapper West and has spoken openly about her medical struggles during her pregnancies with daughter North, born in 2013, and son Saint, born in 2015, on her E! reality show  Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  In a recent episode, Kardashian spoke about considering surrogacy for future children with West.  The reality star has given detailed accounts on her blog about the difficulties she experienced during her two labors, and the TV show has followed her various surgeries and doctor consultations in a bid to resolve them. FILE PHOTO - Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala - Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garcons: Art of the In-Between - Arrivals - New York City, U.S. - 01/05/17 - Socialite Kim Kardashian.Lucas Jackson I think I always knew that surrogacy was an option, but I didn't think it was that realistic of an option, and now I feel like that's my reality,  Kardashian said in an April episode of   Keeping Up With The Kardashians.   The surrogacy reports come after a difficult year for the couple.  Kardashian was the victim of a robbery in Paris last October, in which millions of dollars' worth of jewelry was stolen from her. That led her to boost security measures and to take a temporary pause from public engagements and prolific social media postings. Late last year, West canceled a December tour and was hospitalized after an apparent mental health breakdown. The couple have embraced a more modest social media presence over the past few months, with Kardashian occasionally posting glimpses into their family life. On Wednesday, the reality star launched her own solo make-up line, which sold out within hours.

On Thursday, a decision was made to resume the air strikes in Syria after an assessment of the Russian statement, although it did not say when they would begin again.

A flattening yield curve is often interpreted as a negative economic indicator as it shows concerns about the future pace of growth and inflation, because buyers of long-dated debt would demand higher yields if they expected higher costs. “The Fed’s optimism has no real counterpart in any of the data that we’ve seen so far,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York “The presumption of weak economic growth is fairly firmly rooted and you can see that in the long-end of the curve.“ Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan on Tuesday said that the yield curve showed the market expected sluggish growth ahead; however, New York Fed President William Dudley said this week that the flat yield curve reflects low overseas inflation and borrowing costs and not a weakening U.S. economy. The yield spread between five-year Treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds US5US30=TWEB on Wednesday flattened to 95 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007. The gap between two-year note and 10-year note yields US2US10=TWEB also declined to 80 basis points, just above 10-year lows of 73 basis points reached in mid-2016. The yield curve reflects the extra interest investors require to buy bonds of a longer maturity. When they demand higher payments for shorter-dated bonds than for longer-dated ones it shows that they are more concerned about nearer-term risks. The flattening is not yet near an inversion, which is typically seen as a harbinger of a recession.  The curve flattened this week after Fed officials including Dudley and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren took a more aggressive view to rate hikes, which sent shorter-dated bond yields higher. That came despite recent data that shows inflation retreating from Fed targets and weakening retail sales and housing data. Still, there is not widespread alarm of the risk of a recession. Economists at Deutsche Bank said earlier in June that the chances of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months are remote. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer at DoubleLine Capital, said the flatter curve would start being a concern  when two- and three-year U.S. Treasuries yield about the same.  An economic downturn would be a setback for U.S. President Donald Trump who during his campaign had vowed to lift annual GDP growth to 4 percent, though administration officials now see 3 percent growth as more realistic. First-quarter economic growth disappointed. Irrespective of economic predictions, investors say demand for high-quality assets is also helping to flatten the U.S. yield curve, as there are few other options that generate returns. “The market is starved for product and starved for yield and has to be invested. We are still one of the highest-yielding bond markets on the planet,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. Conditions Still Loose  The flattening yield curve may further loosen financial conditions despite the Fed's attempts to tighten them, giving an additional boost to risk assets like stocks regardless of the strength of the economy. That's because long-dated debt is heavily influenced by pension funds, hedge funds and other participants that lend across the economy, often known as the “shadow banking” industry, and not the U.S. central bank. “The Fed doesn’t have control over the monetary base because the pile of money represented by shadow banking is so much bigger than what the Fed has under its control,” said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. The Chicago Fed’s National Financial Conditions Index shows that economic conditions have in fact loosened from a year ago even though the Fed has raised rates three times since then. As the flattening yield curve forces investors to chase higher returns to meet investment objectives, the curve could become even flatter, according to Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at New Albion Partners in New York. But history suggests it would be some time before the curve inverts, and even longer before stocks take a turn for the worse, he said.  When the yield gap between two-year and 10-year notes was similar to current levels in 2005 at around 80 basis points, it took 11 months for the yield curve to invert, after which stocks gave an annualized return of 14.8 percent before the bear market began 21 months later, Reynolds said. In 1994, the yield curve took an additional three and a half years to invert from current levels and in that instance stocks returned 21.6 percent on an annualized basis after the inversion before the bull market ended 22 months later, Reynolds said.

Hammond,Rex Tillerson,Stephen Miller,USA,TRUMP/REFUGEES,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two studies that President Donald Trump hopes will buttress his case to cut the number of refugees are at the heart of a fight between senior White House adviser Stephen Miller and career U.S. government officials over immigration policy, four current and former officials said. Trump in March ordered the U.S. State Department and other agencies to tally only the costs of resettling refugees but not the benefits that policy experts said refugees can also bring, including tax revenues, professional skills and job creation. A current official said Miller had convened meetings with State Department staffers to discuss the refugee cost reports. When department specialists proposed including refugees' economic contributions in the studies to produce a more balanced assessment, Miller rebuffed the idea, one current and one former U.S. official said. The White House said Miller did not hold meetings on the specific subject of the cost reports and that Trump's overall fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sought to  make transparent the net budgetary effects of immigration programs and policy.  The current and former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe, however, that the administration wants to help make a case to restrict refugee flows by creating a skewed analysis.  It's a policy outcome in search of a rationale,  said a former U.S. official familiar with the debate. The White House disputed the notion that Miller was seeking to tailor the outcome of the reports, which are to be compiled mainly by the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM).  The idea that we are ordering biased reports is false,  said Michael Short, a White House spokesman. The tensions over the reports, due in September, have not been previously reported. Miller has a history of backing curbs on immigration. He was the architect of Trump's order in January suspending the refugee program for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely. That order, which also temporarily barred travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, was largely blocked by the courts, as was a second executive order. Miller was not available for an interview. R.C. Hammond, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said a department staffer who attended budget meetings recalled Miller  suggesting the State Department review the methodology and findings of existing studies  on refugees.  Essentially, suggesting we learn how others have examined the issue and see if there is anything we can learn,  Hammond said in an email.  My colleague did not take away the sense that any instructions were given to include or not include certain information.  Hammond he did not identify the State Department staffer. Dissent Tensions in the government over Trump's immigration policies began with Trump's executive order, which prompted about 900 State Department employees to sign an internal memo dissenting against it in January. Weeks later, the right-wing Breitbart website, which has close ties to the White House, published a story calling for the firing - among others - of the two top officials in the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement and three senior officials at the PRM bureau. Breitbart listed the officials by name, but it did not mention the reports on refugee costs. Career officials cannot be fired, but can be reassigned. There is no evidence the five have been reassigned. Trump promised a hardline immigration policy during his 2016 presidential campaign. He called at one point for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States, citing security reasons amid a series of attacks worldwide by Islamist militants. For the first report, Trump ordered a tally of  the estimated long-term costs of the United States Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and local levels, along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs.  Trump directed that the second report estimate  how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum (near their home countries) for the same long-term cost as supporting refugees in the United States, taking into account the full lifetime cost of Federal, State, and local benefits, and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere.  Refugee policy experts said that while more refugees can be supported in third-country camps for a given sum than settled in the United States, that support does not provide a permanent solution as resettlement can. Most studies show that refugees entering the United States require more government services than immigrants as a whole. But scholars differ over the long-term economic impact of accepting refugees, which can depress low-skilled workers' wages and require all workers to help pay for social services that refugees receive. During their first eight years in the United States, refugees receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, a study published this month by the nonprofit National Bureau for Economic Research said.  After the eighth year, taxes paid tend to be greater than the benefits received,  by an average of $21,000 over a 20-year period, the study found. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors limiting immigration, agreed that accountings such as those Trump ordered should not be limited to costs.  It's only fair to consider any fiscal benefits,  she said. The four current and former U.S. officials said the high-level White House focus on the reports has sent a clear signal about the outcome Trump wants.  When the White House calls and expresses interest...in a report of this nature, given all the things that the national security council and people around the president have to worry about, that sends an enormously profound signal to the bureaucracy,  one of the former officials said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-refugees-idUSL1N1JI1DN"},

President Donald Trump will meet with the chief executives of General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc and AT&T; Inc AT&T; Inc, major drone industry firms and venture capitalists in the latest effort by the White House to focus on innovative technologies as a way of spurring job growth. Michael Kratsios, the White House's deputy chief technology officer, told reporters the goal of the sessions is to find ways the United States  can maintain its leadership creating and fostering entirely new technologies that will drive our economic growth.  The chief executives of several unmanned aerial system, or drone, companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc are attending the White House sessions. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc are also taking part as are venture capital firms including AOL co-founder Steve Case who heads Revolution LLC, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. The administration wants to promote the development and commercialization of emerging technologies and speed the development of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones and 5G wireless technology, Kratsios said. The Obama administration implemented rules that opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for purposes such as deliveries where aircraft would fly beyond the sight of an operator. Security issues would need to be resolved. The FAA in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and the commercial drone fleet will increase tenfold to about 442,000.  Last year, the FCC cleared the way for 5G, a lightning-fast next generation of wireless services. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today's 4G networks. The next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely, regulators say. The networks could help wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines to facilitate the internet of things.

Crude prices have dropped more than 20 percent since late February, in part because of rising U.S. shale production that is offsetting OPEC's efforts to tame global stockpiles. On Wednesday, prices fell more than 2 percent to $42.58 after touching a 10-month low during the day.  The price tumble has dragged down shares of oil and natural gas producers and raised the specter of trims to drilling budgets set when oil was trading around $50 a barrel. Oil producers' average capital spending was previously projected to rise by 50 percent this year over depressed levels of 2016.   Analysts say prices that stick between $40 and $45 a barrel could trigger some companies to quietly scale back planned drilling activities. But industry-wide, major changes to capital spending budgets likely will not be announced until later this summer as quarterly results are released.  Companies will try to push that back as long as possible,  said Dan Katzenberg, an oil industry analyst at Baird. A Wall Street sell-off of energy stocks largely has spared those shale producers with strong balance sheets, hedged production and significant operations in the Permian basin. Investors are treating them as likely not only to survive but thrive at below $45 a barrel.  The Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, America's largest oilfield, can produce profitably even if oil prices drop below $40 per barrel.   Investors are starting to make that separation between companies that were already outspending cash flow and those that weren't,  said Baird's Katzenberg. Permian producer Parsley Energy Inc, which has hedged most of its production through 2019, bullishly raised its production forecast last month.  I don't see Parsley dialing back,  said Chief Executive Bryan Sheffield.  Shares of Parsley, which operates in the Permian, fell 1.6 percent on Wednesday.  By contrast, Whiting Petroleum Corp, heavily in debt from a 2014 buyout deal that made it the largest oil producer in North Dakota's Bakken region, saw its stock price drop 9.2 percent on Wednesday. Whiting, which nearly doubled its 2017 capital budget in February, did not respond to a request for comment.  Some oil producers see the crude price drop as an opportunity to buy acreage cheaply from distressed peers.  I'm kind of licking my chops right now,  said Avi Mirman, CEO of Lilis Energy, which bought Permian acreage at a discount when oil prices last plunged two years ago.   I would not complain if oil prices got down into the $30s  per barrel range, he said. Shares of Lilis fell 1.8 percent on Wednesday. The stock is up 13 percent in the last three months.  Wall Street's optimism on the financially strong may be based on future trading projections for oil prices, which show a slight increase through the end of the decade.<0#CLCAL:>   That picture is very important for psychological reasons,  said Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Permian producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co, one of the leading U.S. shale producers.  WPX Energy, also a Permian producer, said it has no plans to dial back its drilling.  We've already contemplated this scenario (of falling oil prices) and planned for it to protect our drilling plans and our production targets this year and next,  said WPX spokesman Kelly Swan.

All allowances, bonuses and financial benefits for civil servants and military personnel canceled, amended or suspended in September 2016 have been restored and backdated by a royal decree issued by King Salman ( Saudi Arabia slashes ministers' pay, cuts public sector bonuses , Reuters, Sept. 26, 2016).  The decision coincides with the alteration of the succession in favor of the king’s son Mohammad bin Salman and relieves the previous crown prince of all his posts. The distribution of largesse to coincide with changes in the succession is common in monarchical systems to cement loyalty to the ruler and the chosen heir. Saudi successions have normally been accompanied by generous financial packages for employees on the government payroll and distributions have also been made at other times of political stress. The government has been gradually relaxing some austerity measures in recent months and signaling it would go further. The decision to pair the change in succession with a relaxation of austerity is not surprising but there are questions about its affordability in the medium term. Austerity Austerity measures were introduced by the government in response to the sharp drop in oil prices and revenues (tmsnrt.rs/2sTgvoG). Saudi Arabia’s earnings from petroleum exports shrank to $134 billion in 2016, from $322 billion in 2013, the last full year before oil prices slumped (“Annual Statistical Bulletin”, OPEC, 2017). As spending outstripped income, the country’s foreign reserves were depleted by $116 billion in 2015 and another $81 billion in 2016, according to statistics from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. Saudi Arabia’s official foreign assets have fallen by a third to $500 billion at the end of April 2017, from a peak of $746 billion in August 2014 (“Monthly Statistical Bulletin”, SAMA, April 2017). The combination of spending controls, increases in taxes and utility fees, and higher oil prices at the end of 2016 and in early 2017 narrowed the budget deficit and stemmed the depletion of reserves. But austerity has provoked complaints from Saudi citizens and a broad slowdown in the private-sector economy, which relies heavily on government spending and oil revenues as the ultimate source of almost all activity. According to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, the decision on Wednesday to reverse cuts for civil servants and military personnel was necessary to ensure a decent life for the kingdom’s citizens. Sustainability Foreign reserves declined by $35 billion in the first four months of the year; the reversal of austerity coupled with lower oil prices means the decline could accelerate in the rest of 2017. Saudi Arabia still has room to maneuver. The kingdom’s remaining reserves stand at $500 billion. It has little foreign debt. And the eventual sale of shares in state oil firm Aramco should raise additional funds. But reserves are depleting at an unsustainable rate of $100 billion per year, plus or minus $20 billion (tmsnrt.rs/2rV1m0N and tmsnrt.rs/2sqfPWh). Saudi Arabia maintains a fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, which means the country probably needs to keep minimum reserves of $200-300 billion to preserve confidence or risk a run on the peg. In the meantime, the country is bogged down in an expensive armed conflict in Yemen which appears to have reached a stalemate. Military and political competition with Iran, the kingdom’s traditional enemy, is escalating, and Saudi Arabia has promised to buy billions of dollars of extra armaments from the United States. The government has outlined ambitious plans to move the economy away from dependence on oil and public-sector jobs to non-oil industries and the private sector. The decision to restore public-sector salaries and bonuses is inconsistent with the policy of encouraging a shift to private-sector employment. Pacing Reforms So far the economic transformation plan has been long on rhetoric and short on substance. Tough decisions on spending lie ahead and will test the government’s resolve. The recent Article IV consultation between the Saudi government and the International Monetary Fund concluded the kingdom could afford to take longer to balance its budget (“IMF staff completes 2017 Article IV mission to Saudi Arabia”, IMF, May 17). “The government is adapting its fiscal policy to lower oil prices. The aim of bringing about a large, sustained, and well-paced fiscal adjustment to achieve a balanced budget is appropriate,” the IMF said in May. “The target of balancing the budget, however, does not need to be met in 2019 ... given Saudi Arabia’s strong financial asset position and its low debt.” “A more gradual fiscal consolidation to achieve budget balance a few years later would reduce the effects on growth in the near term while still preserving fiscal buffers to help manage future risks.” But given the government’s swift turnaround on austerity, it remains unclear how it will close the persistent budget and current account deficits. If something cannot go on forever, it will stop, noted the late Herbert Stein, chief economic adviser to then-U.S. president Richard Nixon. The kingdom has comfortable financial reserves but they will not last forever. Editing by Dale Hudson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-reform-kemp-idUSKBN19D03W"},

The country is both the world's largest producer and consumer of the packaging and soldering metal.  But its interaction with the rest of the global tin market has in the past been severely constrained by a 10 percent export duty.  Before that tax came into effect at the start of 2008, China had been a net exporter of refined tin. In the period after, it became a net importer, albeit one with steadily diminishing appetite. The export tax disappeared at the beginning of this year. Don't worry if you didn't notice. Even China's producers didn't see the change coming. Now they are starting to react, with Yunnan Tin, China's and the world's largest producer, gearing up to start overseas shipments. A resumption of Chinese exports will be welcome news to short-position holders on the London Metal Exchange (LME) tin contract, which has for months been starved of stocks liquidity and gripped by persistent tightness.  But might the return of China to the global tin stage herald a more profound shift in how this metal is priced?  Graphic on China's refined tin trade 2004-2017: tmsnrt.rs/2rUu5mv Delayed Reaction There has been no discernible reaction to the lifting of the export tax at the start of this year.  China's exports of refined tin were a miniscule 232 tonnes over the January-April period.  That's because there was no consultation or advance warning from China's Commerce Ministry.  The only clue that something had changed was the omission of refined tin from the annual list of commodities qualifying for an export tax. The resounding official silence may be down to the fact that this looks like a preemptive move to avert a potentially embarrassing World Trade Organization complaints process set in motion by the United States last year. It's taken local producers several months to confirm that the tax is indeed no more.  And now one, Yunnan Tin, is capitalizing on its removal by preparing to export tin under a so-called  processing  deal.  What this means is that the company can import raw materials without paying value-added tax as long as they are used to produce metal for export, which of course is now also tax-free.  Yunnan Tin, it is worth noting, is by some margin the world's largest producer with refined output last year of 76,000 tonnes, more than the next three largest producers combined.  It is also a major importer of raw materials from across the border in Myanmar. Such imports totaled 473,000 tonnes last year. That's a bulk weight figure. Industry association ITRI estimates it translates into 50,000 tonnes of contained tin.  Relief for London Market...?  Yunnan Tin's  YT  brand is one of six Chinese producer brands deliverable against the LME's tin contract.  Which desperately needs some fresh stocks liquidity.  LME inventory stands at just 1,730 tonnes, or an even more marginal 1,480 tonnes if metal that has been earmarked for physical load-out is excluded.  Unsurprisingly, the front part of the curve is tight, with cash metal commanding a premium of $120 per tonne over three-month metal as of Tuesday's close. This backwardated structure has been a near constant in the London tin market for over two years. But that's because stocks have been so low over the same period.  Rebuilds have been relatively small and short-lived and the London market gives every appearance of having to generate a cash premium just to keep any stocks liquidity at all.  Compare and contrast with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), which had 4,440 tonnes of tin in its warehouse system at the end of last week.  That's probably symptomatic of broader availability in mainland China, ITRI suggesting there was  some stock  built up in the first quarter of this year.  The association's takeaway is that a renewed flow of metal from China to the rest of the world will cut the current VAT-based price differential between the two markets and, in time, lead to  a rebalancing of pricing, with LME prices falling and China prices rising . Graphic on LME stocks and spreads: tmsnrt.rs/2sSZHxK ...Or a Threat?  The breaching of the great tin wall of China should have some short-term positives for the London market in terms of stocks liquidity and a consequent dissipation of the tightness that has become almost hard-wired into the LME contract. But does it also pose a longer-term threat? The LME tin contract has seen trading activity shrink dramatically over the last couple of years from over 2 million lots in both 2013 and 2014 to 1.4 million last year.  The trend shows no sign of abating, with volumes sliding another 16 percent over the first five months of 2017.  Even within the context of the broader decline in LME activity, tin is something of a stand-out.  The London market is largely being kept alive because just enough players still want to use it as a pricing benchmark.  The obvious alternative would be the ShFE but there is still sufficient wariness about what drives Shanghai pricing to prevent any collective switch.  The ShFE tin contract, launched in 2015, has largely escaped the attention of the flash investment crowds that have roiled other mainland commodity markets.  But the ratio of open interest to volume is still low, averaging under 4 percent in January-April, which suggests a significant element of speculative day-trading.  The ratio on the LME contract, by contrast, averaged 17.5 percent over the same period, implying larger positions being held for longer, indicative of more  trade  hedging presence.  The LME's price-reference franchise looks fragile but OK. For now at least.  But as the market adjusts to the reality of Chinese exports, it will also become ever more Asia-centric.  There is only one European producer brand listed as LME good delivery; that of Belgium's Metallo Chimique. And right now there are no live LME tin stocks outside of Asian locations. The 120 tonnes at Rotterdam have been canceled prior to drawdown.  London tin, in other words, looks ripe for a serious challenge from another exchange, particularly an Asian one.

And what do they have now to show for it? Lower prices. Specs, usually hesitant to become buyers in such an oversupplied market, bought nearly 1 billion bushels of corn in the form of CBOT futures and options – equivalent to 200,000 contracts – between June 6 and June 16. That buying among money managers reversed the 200,981-contract short position held as of May 30. By June 13, the net short had dwindled to 17,929 contracts and fund buying activity in the days after strongly suggested that the net short no longer existed by the end of last week. During the 11-day buying rally, July corn futures peaked on June 8, a 5 percent gain in price. By the end of last week – which is when the funds had presumably evened out their bets – the total gains amounted to only 3 percent. Prices have fallen further since, as Tuesday’s $3.70 settle was the lowest of the month. This probably sets the record as the biggest fund buyback with the most pitiful price move, as gains were significantly less than those produced by the spring and early summer short-covering rallies of the last two years.  In 2015, funds depleted a hefty short position within the last nine days of June, culminating in a 17 percent jump in July futures. They did the same within nine days in mid-April 2016 for an 11 percent gain in the July contract on increasingly unfavorable South American weather. The 2015 move was sparked initially by U.S. weather concerns and capped off with bullish government stocks and acreage reports on June 30. Balance sheets from the previous two years show ample domestic corn supply relative to previous years, but apparently not as ample as this year given the stubbornness in the futures market.  Corn futures finally broke above the relentless 20-cent range earlier this month, spurring action on the commercial side of the market, including U.S. farmers who have been hoarding last year’s crop in hope of better prices. CBOT corn trading volume broke records on June 7 with help from intense selling by commercial handlers, which pushed against price gains from speculative buying. Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission suggests commercial corn hedgers had their third-biggest net sell-off in the week ended June 13, which suggests significant farmer selling. Not surprisingly, the top spots are occupied by weeks in April 2016 and June 2015.  Weather the Only Hope? It has been exactly one year to the day since front-month corn futures traded above $4. With lots of old supply still sitting in bins throughout the Midwest, prices may struggle to notch gains comparable to years past unless U.S. weather genuinely takes a turn for the worse. Weather thus far in the 2017 growing season has not been perfect, which has been reflected in lower crop ratings than in the previous three high-yielding years. Forecasts have been relatively benign this week, but the outlooks will become even more important in the next two months as pollination followed by grain fill occurs – more chance for volatility should they call for hot and dry stretches. Even if July and August weather is not glaringly adverse, crop shortfalls that may have arisen amid the wet and cold spring will come to light as soon as the combines begin to roll in September, which could give a late-season boost to futures.  A similar situation arose in 2015 as disappointing early harvest results and a cut in expected production from the U.S. Department of Agriculture sparked a 12 percent futures rally in the first half of September.  Monstrous output in Brazil will also offer pressure to corn prices as the ongoing harvest could touch 100 million tonnes.  This is 50 percent larger than last year’s drought-stricken crop, which carried the original April 2016 futures rally into mid-June with even bigger price gains. In the past decade, funds were net short corn during July and August only twice. In 2013, the U.S. corn crop was on track to easily surpass the previous year's disastrous harvest, and in 2016, the eventual record-large output appeared very likely by the midpoint of the summer under non-threatening weather conditions.

They're still optimistic and positive on the medium-term growth outlook,  said Peter Dragicevich, G10 FX strategist for Nomura in Singapore.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * China tin trade: tmsnrt.rs/2rUu5mv * LME tin stocks and spreads: tmsnrt.rs/2sSZHxK By Andy Home LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - The great tin wall of China is about to come crashing down. The country is both the world's largest producer and consumer of the packaging and soldering metal. But its interaction with the rest of the global tin market has in the past been severely constrained by a 10 percent export duty. Before that tax came into effect at the start of 2008, China had been a net exporter of refined tin. In the period after, it became a net importer, albeit one with steadily diminishing appetite. The export tax disappeared at the beginning of this year. Don't worry if you didn't notice. Even China's producers didn't see the change coming. Now they are starting to react, with Yunnan Tin, China's and the world's largest producer, gearing up to start overseas shipments. A resumption of Chinese exports will be welcome news to short-position holders on the London Metal Exchange (LME) tin contract, which has for months been starved of stocks liquidity and gripped by persistent tightness. But might the return of China to the global tin stage herald a more profound shift in how this metal is priced? Graphic on China's refined tin trade 2004-2017: tmsnrt.rs/2rUu5mv Delayed Reaction There has been no discernible reaction to the lifting of the export tax at the start of this year. China's exports of refined tin were a miniscule 232 tonnes over the January-April period. That's because there was no consultation or advance warning from China's Commerce Ministry. The only clue that something had changed was the omission of refined tin from the annual list of commodities qualifying for an export tax. The resounding official silence may be down to the fact that this looks like a preemptive move to avert a potentially embarrassing World Trade Organization complaints process set in motion by the United States last year. It's taken local producers several months to confirm that the tax is indeed no more. And now one, Yunnan Tin, is capitalising on its removal by preparing to export tin under a so-called  processing  deal. What this means is that the company can import raw materials without paying value-added tax as long as they are used to produce metal for export, which of course is now also tax-free. Yunnan Tin, it is worth noting, is by some margin the world's largest producer with refined output last year of 76,000 tonnes, more than the next three largest producers combined. It is also a major importer of raw materials from across the border in Myanmar. Such imports totalled 473,000 tonnes last year. That's a bulk weight figure. Industry association ITRI estimates it translates into 50,000 tonnes of contained tin. Relief for London Market...? Yunnan Tin's  YT  brand is one of six Chinese producer brands deliverable against the LME's tin contract. Which desperately needs some fresh stocks liquidity. LME inventory stands at just 1,730 tonnes, or an even more marginal 1,480 tonnes if metal that has been earmarked for physical load-out is excluded. Unsurprisingly, the front part of the curve is tight, with cash metal commanding a premium of $120 per tonne over three-month metal as of Tuesday's close. This backwardated structure has been a near constant in the London tin market for over two years. But that's because stocks have been so low over the same period. Rebuilds have been relatively small and short-lived and the London market gives every appearance of having to generate a cash premium just to keep any stocks liquidity at all. Compare and contrast with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), which had 4,440 tonnes of tin in its warehouse system at the end of last week. That's probably symptomatic of broader availability in mainland China, ITRI suggesting there was  some stock  built up in the first quarter of this year. The association's takeaway is that a renewed flow of metal from China to the rest of the world will cut the current VAT-based price differential between the two markets and, in time, lead to  a rebalancing of pricing, with LME prices falling and China prices rising . Graphic on LME stocks and spreads: tmsnrt.rs/2sSZHxK ...Or a Threat? The breaching of the great tin wall of China should have some short-term positives for the London market in terms of stocks liquidity and a consequent dissipation of the tightness that has become almost hard-wired into the LME contract. But does it also pose a longer-term threat? The LME tin contract has seen trading activity shrink dramatically over the last couple of years from over 2 million lots in both 2013 and 2014 to 1.4 million last year. The trend shows no sign of abating, with volumes sliding another 16 percent over the first five months of 2017. Even within the context of the broader decline in LME activity, tin is something of a stand-out. The London market is largely being kept alive because just enough players still want to use it as a pricing benchmark. The obvious alternative would be the ShFE but there is still sufficient wariness about what drives Shanghai pricing to prevent any collective switch. The ShFE tin contract, launched in 2015, has largely escaped the attention of the flash investment crowds that have roiled other mainland commodity markets. But the ratio of open interest to volume is still low, averaging under 4 percent in January-April, which suggests a significant element of speculative day-trading. The ratio on the LME contract, by contrast, averaged 17.5 percent over the same period, implying larger positions being held for longer, indicative of more  trade  hedging presence. The LME's price-reference franchise looks fragile but OK. For now at least. But as the market adjusts to the reality of Chinese exports, it will also become ever more Asia-centric. There is only one European producer brand listed as LME good delivery; that of Belgium's Metallo Chimique. And right now there are no live LME tin stocks outside of Asian locations. The 120 tonnes at Rotterdam have been cancelled prior to drawdown. London tin, in other words, looks ripe for a serious challenge from another exchange, particularly an Asian one. The resumption of Chinese tin exports after a near-decade hiatus may herald more than a simple readjustment of London-Shanghai pricing. It threatens a much more profound reconfiguration of global pricing. Editing by Dale Hudson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-tin-ahome-idUSL8N1JI4L0"},

President Donald Trump will meet with the chief executives of General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc and AT&T; Inc AT&T; Inc, major drone industry firms and venture capitalists in the latest effort by the White House to focus on innovative technologies as a way of spurring job growth. Michael Kratsios, the White House's deputy chief technology officer, told reporters the goal of the sessions is to find ways the United States  can maintain its leadership creating and fostering entirely new technologies that will drive our economic growth.  The chief executives of several unmanned aerial system, or drone, companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc are attending the White House sessions. Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc are also taking part as are venture capital firms including AOL co-founder Steve Case who heads Revolution LLC, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures. The administration wants to promote the development and commercialization of emerging technologies and speed the development of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones and 5G wireless technology, Kratsios said. The Obama administration implemented rules that opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for purposes such as deliveries where aircraft would fly beyond the sight of an operator. Security issues would need to be resolved. The FAA in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and the commercial drone fleet will increase tenfold to about 442,000.  Last year, the FCC cleared the way for 5G, a lightning-fast next generation of wireless services. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today's 4G networks. The next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely, regulators say. The networks could help wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines to facilitate the internet of things.

Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told state broadcaster CCTV late on Wednesday that the regulator would implement reforms to internationalise the market, improve investors' access to the market, and encourage the development of products such as derivatives. China finally won a long campaign for inclusion in U.S. index provider MSCI Emerging Markets Index on Wednesday after having been rejected for three years running. Its acceptance was seen as a milestone for global investing.

The floodwaters that destroyed her family’s house and most of their possessions also swept away her and her older brother’s school books, school bags and uniforms, leaving them uncertain whether they can return to school. “What am I to do? My parents can’t afford new books, new clothes, new desks. We are ruined,” the small girl said with tears in her eyes.  Her school has become a shelter for those left homeless – but Radhika’s family stayed there only two days before moving to a hut near their old home, fearing the packed school wasn’t safe for their daughter. Women and children can be disproportionately affected by disasters, for reasons ranging from a desire to stay behind to help less-able family members to cultural restrictions on women’s movements. But taking a closer look at data collected in disasters – and getting the results out quickly – could help reduce the vulnerabilities of those at the highest risk, experts say. “Data collected and analyzed at the time of emergency is not disaggregated by age, creating a challenge in assessing and responding to the needs of affected population,” said Paula Bulancea, UNICEF’s representative in Sri Lanka. For example, officials at the country’s Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said that if they got a quick breakdown of the number of infants, small children and pregnant and nursing mothers caught up in a disaster, they could quickly channel particularly vital supplies, such as baby supplements and specialized medical experts, to those in need. “Even if the number is one or two, we still could make sure that the supplies get to specific locations,” said DMC spokesman Pradeep Kodippili.   G.L.S Senadeera, the director general of the agency, agreed that better information could help guide better action. “It could most certainly help in more efficient channeling of life-saving resources, which become stretched during large-scale disasters like the one we had recently,” he said. For instance, if the DMC had known earlier that several pregnant women were trapped in a hospital in the Kalwana area in Rathnapura District during the May floods, they could have sent rescue flights earlier to that location, Kodippili said.  At least one still birth was reported during evacuations during the flooding, he said. Floods and Landslides Floods and landslides swept Sri Lanka in late May, killing at least 300 people and displacing or otherwise directly affecting 600,000. A rapid assessment of the disaster by the DMC found that 70 percent of those displaced or affected were women and children. The UNICEF office in Colombo said that this pattern was consistent in many disasters in the country.  “For example, nearly half of the affected population in the landslide and flood disaster in May 2016 were women and girls,” Bulancea said.  Apart from the risks during disasters, women and children can face greater problems in their aftermath of crises as well, the UNICEF country head said. “Beyond the loss of their livelihoods and their social context, displacement, separation from home, loss of family members, lack of basic health and hygiene as well as personal safety can be stressful and traumatic for them. Children are more inclined to get sick and suffer if basic services are disrupted,” she said. Disasters – including extreme heat waves – also can leave many children out of school for significant periods of time, with their schools at times turned into relief shelters, according to a UNICEF vulnerability study released last year, looking at Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province. “Climate change has a direct impact on school education,” the study noted. At least 29 schools were completely destroyed in Sri Lanka’s May floods and scores more damaged, according to the Education Ministry. Schools were also used as temporary shelters during the first two weeks after the disaster. The disaster risks women and children face are accentuated by a combination of social, economic and even cultural factors, experts said. “For example, in our culture, small children are in the care of women, and when disasters happen, women have to take care of their safety as well. The attitude is changing but still persists in rural areas,” said Senadeera, head of the DMC. Helping those who respond to disasters better understand the risks women and children face could help reduce them, Senadeera and Bulancea agreed. Risks could also be reduced by teaching disaster preparedness in school, with children carrying home lessons to their families, the UNICEF study said. From Policy to Action UNICEF’s Bulancea said Sri Lanka should reassess the implementation of its disaster resilience policies.  “While we have systems, policies and plans in place on disaster risk reduction which are gender and age sensitive, these are not be being fully implemented,” she said.  Radhika, the girl displaced in recent flooding, said her family had no warning of the disaster or idea how to cope effectively with it. “We don’t know what to do, where to go or who to contact when floods come. No one has told us anything,” the girl said.  Senadeera said his agency was implementing changes, including issuing more detailed weather alerts and using social media and smartphone apps to disseminate warnings. Smartphone apps might also be used to communicate with regional offices to make quick decisions on areas for relocation centers that will be safe for women and children, he said.  “We have learned from our past mistakes. It’s a stiff learning curve, but policies and implementation are going to change,” he promised.

The issuance consists of notes ultimately backed by New Zealand finance and operating vehicle leases originated by Fleet Holding (NZ) Limited (FleetPartners NZ), a subsidiary of FleetPartners Pty Limited (FleetPartners). The ratings are as follows: NZD130.4 million Class A notes: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable NZD10.2 million Class B notes: 'AA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable NZD17.4 million Class C notes: 'A(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable NZD12.0 million Class D notes: 'BBB(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable NZD14.0 million Class E notes: 'BB(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable NZD4.0 million Class F notes: 'B+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable NZD2.0 million Class G notes: 'NR(EXP)sf' NZD10.0 million Originator notes: 'NR(EXP)sf' The notes will be issued by NZGT (FP) Trustee Limited in its capacity as trustee of FP Ignition 2017 - B Trust. The total underlying collateral pool consisted of 8,332 leases totalling NZD235.9 million at the 30 April 2017 cut-off date. FleetPartners NZ has indicated to Fitch that the final lease-receivable pool will be adjusted to match the final liability balance, with no significant changes to the portfolio stratifications expected. KEY RATING DRIVERS Residual Value Risk Present: This is the third term securitisation, and the first in New Zealand, by FleetPartners that includes operating leases within the lease portfolio. The lessees are a broad mix of small-to-medium entities (SMEs) through to large corporations and government entities. Residual value (RV) and vehicle-servicing risk are present within the transaction due to the inclusion of operating leases, along with credit risk. Fitch assumes 'AAAsf' RV losses of 15.1%. Large Lessee Concentration: The pool's 20-largest obligors account for about 26.4% of the asset balance. Fitch deems this concentration higher than usually observed in consumer ABS transactions and has therefore derived default assumptions while considering lessee concentrations and correlation risks, in line with its SME criteria. Sufficient Enhancement: The transaction incorporates a sequential pay/pro rata pay structure, consistent with other ABS transactions. Pro rata paydown will commence when hard credit enhancement (CE) reaches 45.0% for the class A notes, subject to transaction performance. Overall CE is sufficient to cover the Fitch-stressed cumulative net loss assumptions in all Fitch scenarios. The transaction also comprises a vehicle-servicing account to enable the issuer to fund operating lease vehicle-servicing obligations. Mixed Collateral Included: The collateral backing the transaction comprises of lease receivables backed by a mix of passenger vehicles as well as light and heavy commercial vehicles, with a weighted-average seasoning of 18.1 months and an average receivable size of NZD28,306. Operating leases comprise 93.8% of the portfolio and finance leases 6.2%. Historically, FleetPartners' 30+ day delinquencies for their New Zealand and Australian assets have generally tracked below Fitch's Dinkum ABS Index EXPECTED RATING SENSITIVITIES Unexpected decreases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case, possibly resulting in negative rating action on the notes. Fitch has evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased defaults and reduced recovery rates over the life of the transaction. Expected impact on note ratings from increased defaults: Final rating AAAsf/AAsf/Asf/BBBsf/BBsf/B+sf Increase defaults by 10%: AAAsf/AAsf/BBB+sf/BBBsf/BBsf/B+sf Increase defaults by 25%: AA+sf/A+f/BBB+sf/BBB-sf/BB-sf/B+sf Increase defaults by 50%: AA-sf/Asf/BBB+sf/BB+sf/B+sf/B+sf Expected impact on note ratings from decreased recovery rates and RV sale proceeds: Final rating AAAsf/AAsf/Asf/BBBsf/BBsf/B+sf Reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 10%: AAAsf/AA-sf/Asf/BBBsf/BBsf/B+sf Reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 25%: AAAsf/AA-sf/A-sf/BBB-sf/BB-sf/B+sf Reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 50%: AAAsf/A+sf/BBB+sf/BBB-sf/B+sf/B+sf Expected impact on note ratings from multiple factors: Final rating AAAsf/AAsf/Asf/BBBsf/BBsf/B+sf Increase defaults by 10%; reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 10%: AAAsf/AA-sf/A-sf/BBB-sf/BB-sf/B+sf Increase defaults by 25%; reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 25%: AAsf/A+sf/A-sf/BB+sf/B+sf/B+sf Increase defaults by 50%; reduce recoveries and RV sale proceeds by 50%: Asf/BBB+sf/BBB-sf/BBsf/B+sf/Bsf USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es;) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under  Related Research  below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es; to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled  Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,  dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of FleetPartners' origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the portfolio information, but at this time no assessment was available for this transaction. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. Key rating drivers and expected rating sensitivities are further discussed in the corresponding presale report entitled  FP Ignition 2017 - B Trust , published today.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The Big Sick  explores Nanjiani's cultural conflict as a Pakistani Muslim comedian in a post-9/11 America. His life is further complicated when he falls in love with Gordon, played by Zoe Kazan, and goes against his family's wishes that he marry a Pakistani woman.  The film, out in limited U.S. release on Friday, is  coming out at a time when there's a lot of anti-Muslim sentiment, there's a lot of Islamophobia,  Nanjiani said in an interview.  By depicting a Muslim family as like normal people, that's its big political statement,  said Nanjiani, who is also the first Pakistani leading man in a Hollywood romantic comedy. The movie arrives after U.S. President Donald Trump's call during his 2016 election campaign for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States    Now in the White House, Trump is seeking to ban travelers from six Muslim-majority countries in a case awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court decision. Nanjiani, 39, best known for playing snarky programmer Dinesh in HBO's comedy  Silicon Valley,  and Gordon said they did not predict the film would wade into a hot-button issue.   It obviously feels so weirdly timely but it also does have this expectation on it that it really wasn't built for,  Nanjiani said.

In  The Big Sick,  Nanjiani's family struggle with his decision to pursue comedy as they try to arrange a suitable marriage, while he secretly dates the smart, nerdy Emily. Slideshow (2 Images)Nanjiani's world is upended when Emily falls into a coma with an undiagnosed illness and he keeps a bedside vigil alongside her parents.   I think that Kumail is trying to show how similar their lives are to people who already live here in some respects. They're looking for love and they're trying to be happy and they're also dealing with their culture,  Judd Apatow, the film's producer said.       In one scene, Nanjiani is heckled during his stand-up comedy routine by a man calling him a terrorist. In another, Ray Romano, who plays Gordon's father, asks Kumail about his stance on the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.   Anti. It was a tragedy,  Nanjiani said, before quipping,  I mean, we lost 19 of our best guys.   The Big Sick  arrives as Hollywood films such as  Get Out  and  Wonder Woman  are starting to break the white, male-dominated movie mold and show that audiences will pay to see films with minority leads.   It's important for kids to see themselves in the stuff they watch. But more than that, I think it's important that people from different points of view are behind the camera telling the stories, writing them, directing them,  Nanjiani said.

A current official said Miller had convened meetings with State Department staffers to discuss the refugee cost reports. When department specialists proposed including refugees' economic contributions in the studies to produce a more balanced assessment, Miller rebuffed the idea, one current and one former U.S. official said. The White House said Miller did not hold meetings on the specific subject of the cost reports and that Trump's overall fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sought to  make transparent the net budgetary effects of immigration programs and policy.  The current and former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believe, however, that the administration wants to help make a case to restrict refugee flows by creating a skewed analysis.  It's a policy outcome in search of a rationale,  said a former U.S. official familiar with the debate. The White House disputed the notion that Miller was seeking to tailor the outcome of the reports, which are to be compiled mainly by the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM).   The idea that we are ordering biased reports is false,  said Michael Short, a White House spokesman. The tensions over the reports, due in September, have not been previously reported. Miller has a history of backing curbs on immigration. He  was the architect of Trump's order in January suspending the refugee program for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely. That order, which also temporarily barred travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, was largely blocked by the courts, as was a second executive order. Miller was not available for an interview. R.C. Hammond, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said a department staffer who attended budget meetings recalled Miller  suggesting the State Department review the methodology and findings of existing studies  on refugees.  Essentially, suggesting we learn how others have examined the issue and see if there is anything we can learn,  Hammond said in an email.  My colleague did not take away the sense that any instructions were given to include or not include certain information.  Hammond he did not identify the State Department staffer. Dissent FILE PHOTO: A woman who is seeking asylum has her fingerprints taken by a U.S. Customs and Border patrol officer at a pedestrian port of entry from Mexico to the United States, in McAllen, Texas, U.S., May 10, 2017.Carlos Barria/File PictureTensions in the government over Trump's immigration policies began with Trump's executive order, which prompted about 900 State Department employees to sign an internal memo dissenting against it in January. Weeks later, the right-wing Breitbart website, which has close ties to the White House, published a story calling for the firing - among others - of the two top officials in the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement and three senior officials at the PRM bureau. Breitbart listed the officials by name, but it did not mention the reports on refugee costs. Career officials cannot be fired, but can be reassigned. There is no evidence the five have been reassigned. Trump promised a hardline immigration policy during his 2016 presidential campaign. He called at one point for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States, citing security reasons amid a series of attacks worldwide by Islamist militants. For the first report, Trump ordered a tally of  the estimated long-term costs of the United States Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and local levels, along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs.  Trump directed that the second report estimate  how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum (near their home countries) for the same long-term cost as supporting refugees in the United States, taking into account the full lifetime cost of Federal, State, and local benefits, and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere.  Refugee policy experts said that while more refugees can be supported in third-country camps for a given sum than settled in the United States, that support does not provide a permanent solution as resettlement can. Most studies show that refugees entering the United States require more government services than immigrants as a whole. But scholars differ over the long-term economic impact of accepting refugees, which can depress low-skilled workers' wages and require all workers to help pay for social services that refugees receive. During their first eight years in the United States, refugees receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, a study published this month by the nonprofit National Bureau for Economic Research said.  After the eighth year, taxes paid tend to be greater than the benefits received,  by an average of $21,000 over a 20-year period, the study found. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors limiting immigration, agreed that accountings such as those Trump ordered should not be limited to costs.   It's only fair to consider any fiscal benefits,  she said. The four current and former U.S. officials said the high-level White House focus on the reports has sent a clear signal about the outcome Trump wants.  When the White House calls and expresses interest...in a report of this nature, given all the things that the national security council and people around the president have to worry about, that sends an enormously profound signal to the bureaucracy,  one of the former officials said.

Longbow Finance SA regrets to announce that, by mutual consent and due to diverging views of the future of the company, Monisha Kaltenborn will leave her positions with the Sauber Group effective immediately,  they said in a statement.  Her successor will be announced shortly,  it added. The team are due to compete this weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku. No details were given about the 'diverging views' but board chairman Pascal Picci issued a separate statement, angrily rejecting speculation that it concerned the status of the team's drivers and a desire to favor Sweden's Marcus Ericsson.  The owners and board of Sauber Motorsport AG take strong exception to speculative and widespread media reports today that our race drivers have not been, and are not being, treated equally,  he said.  This is not only patently untrue, it would be contrary to the team’s absolute and longstanding commitment to fair competition.   These reports, attributed to anonymous 'sources', are highly detrimental to both Marcus Ericsson and Pascal Wehrlein as well as to the management and all staff of the Sauber F1 Team.  Ericsson have yet to score a point in seven races this season but have important backers while Wehrlein, who has a long-term Mercedes contract, finished eighth in Spain in May.    Motorsport.com said the terms of Kaltenborn's departure were still being worked out. Kaltenborn, an Indian-born Austrian citizen, took over from team founder Peter Sauber in 2012. The sport's first woman team principal, and the second Indian-born after Force India's Vijay Mallya, Kaltenborn joined Sauber in 2000 to run the legal department and took over as chief executive in 2010. The team fell on hard times in recent seasons, struggling to score points last year, but the financial problems eased when  Longbow, a Swiss-based investment company, took over in July last year. They recently agreed with Honda to switch to the Japanese manufacturer's engines next year instead of using year-old Ferrari ones. Kaltenborn's departure will leave former champions Williams as the only team with a woman in charge. Claire Williams is officially the deputy principal to father and founder Frank but effectively runs the team day-to-day.

So Wangyal, whose parents fled Tibet as teenagers, went to court to demand his right to an Indian passport. In response to his petition, the Delhi High Court said authorities must abide by an earlier ruling that all Tibetans born in India between January 1950 and July 1987 are Indian citizens by birth, and can be issued passports. The order came into effect in March, and Wangyal got his Indian passport shortly thereafter, using it to go to Thailand. For the first time, he was spared the additional scrutiny that his documents always got from immigration officials.   I feel like a real person now, having obtained a passport,  said Wangyal, 47, who was born in a Tibetan settlement in eastern Odisha state and now lives in the hill town Dharamsala.  Tibetans are seen as refugees and as stateless in India. Being seen that way after having been born and lived our whole lives in India is unfair and impractical,  he said. Emotional Turmoil Tibetans have been seeking asylum in India since the Dalai Lama fled Lhasa in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese occupation. The Tibetan spiritual leader has since lived mostly in Dharamsala in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, where his supporters run a small government in exile and advocate for autonomy for Tibet by peaceful means. More than 100,000 Tibetans live in 39 formal settlements and dozens of informal communities across India. They generally arrive via Nepal, after a perilous trek across the Himalayas. The Indian government has funded schools to provide free education for Tibetans, and reserved seats in medical and engineering colleges. Those eligible can get voter identification cards. But Tibetans do not have citizenship rights, which limits their access to government jobs and freedom of movement within and outside India. They cannot own land or property. In some states, they cannot get driving licenses or bank loans. Those without identity documents are at risk of harassment, arrests and deportation to China.  The status of statelessness is demoralizing and frustrating. There's a lot of emotional turmoil,  said Tenzin Tselha, an activist with Students for a Free Tibet, whose father served in the Indian Army.  Sometimes I eat rice and daal (lentils) more than thukpa (Tibetan noodle soup), but I never feel Indian; I am Tibetan. It drains my energy, this struggle to always prove who I am and where I am from,  she said.  Foreigners by Law India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and state responsibilities to protect them. Nor does it have a domestic law to protect the more than 200,000 refugees it currently hosts, including Tibetans, Sri Lankans, Afghans, Bangladeshis and Rohingyas from Myanmar. They are all considered foreigners by law. Tibetan refugees get  enough rights and benefits , and not everyone wants citizenship, said Sonam Norbu Dagpo, a spokesman for the Central Tibetan Administration, the government in exile.   Even those Tibetan refugees who qualify for Indian citizenship do not apply for citizenship,  he said. While the number of refugees across the world has risen in recent years, the number of Tibetans arriving in India has fallen significantly since 2008, following a crackdown by China  which considers Tibet a renegade province. Only 87 Tibetans registered in Dharamsala in 2015, compared to about 2,500 each year before 2008.  India's policy towards refugees has always been dictated by geo-political compulsions,  said Saurabh Bhattacharjee, a professor at the National University of Juridical Sciences in Kolkata.  But beyond ensuring basic protections and civic amenities for all refugees, India must consider the status of Tibetan refugees more carefully, he said.  Will they always remain refugees, or should they be given some sort of permanent resident status, as they have been here for so long, and have little chance of being repatriated?  Decent Life Recent court orders and the Tibetan Rehabilitation Policy of 2014 promise more rights and benefits. The policy proposes, for the first time, to give refugees welfare benefits on par with Indians, subsidies for some college courses, more job options and greater ease in getting documents. It does not address property ownership, getting government jobs, or traveling freely within and outside India. But the issue of rights and citizenship is also an emotional one that divides the community.  I don't think it's important to have citizenship rights or to have an Indian passport,  said Dorjee Tsering, 28, who works in a store in Dharamsala selling Free Tibet T-shirts and sweatshirts.   We may face some problems, but we should sacrifice a little to preserve our heritage and identity.  But for Wangyal, who fought for a passport, more rights are necessary.  I would like the right to own property. A little house and a small business would be good to live a decent life,  he said.  Tibetans will fight on for Free Tibet, but at the same time we have to live our lives now.  Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran and Abhishek Madhukar, Editing by Astrid Zweynert @azweynert.

Crude prices have dropped more than 20 percent since late February, in part because of rising U.S. shale production that is offsetting OPEC's efforts to tame global stockpiles. On Wednesday, prices fell more than 2 percent to $42.58 after touching a 10-month low during the day.  The price tumble has dragged down shares of oil and natural gas producers and raised the specter of trims to drilling budgets set when oil was trading around $50 a barrel. Oil producers' average capital spending was previously projected to rise by 50 percent this year over depressed levels of 2016.   Analysts say prices that stick between $40 and $45 a barrel could trigger some companies to quietly scale back planned drilling activities. But industry-wide, major changes to capital spending budgets likely will not be announced until later this summer as quarterly results are released.  Companies will try to push that back as long as possible,  said Dan Katzenberg, an oil industry analyst at Baird. A Wall Street sell-off of energy stocks largely has spared those shale producers with strong balance sheets, hedged production and significant operations in the Permian basin. Investors are treating them as likely not only to survive but thrive at below $45 a barrel.  The Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, America's largest oilfield, can produce profitably even if oil prices drop below $40 per barrel.   Investors are starting to make that separation between companies that were already outspending cash flow and those that weren't,  said Baird's Katzenberg. Permian producer Parsley Energy Inc, which has hedged most of its production through 2019, bullishly raised its production forecast last month.  I don't see Parsley dialing back,  said Chief Executive Bryan Sheffield.  Shares of Parsley, which operates in the Permian, fell 1.6 percent on Wednesday.  By contrast, Whiting Petroleum Corp, heavily in debt from a 2014 buyout deal that made it the largest oil producer in North Dakota's Bakken region, saw its stock price drop 9.2 percent on Wednesday. Whiting, which nearly doubled its 2017 capital budget in February, did not respond to a request for comment.  Some oil producers see the crude price drop as an opportunity to buy acreage cheaply from distressed peers.  I'm kind of licking my chops right now,  said Avi Mirman, CEO of Lilis Energy, which bought Permian acreage at a discount when oil prices last plunged two years ago.   I would not complain if oil prices got down into the $30s  per barrel range, he said. Shares of Lilis fell 1.8 percent on Wednesday. The stock is up 13 percent in the last three months.  Wall Street's optimism on the financially strong may be based on future trading projections for oil prices, which show a slight increase through the end of the decade.<0#CLCAL:>   That picture is very important for psychological reasons,  said Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Permian producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co, one of the leading U.S. shale producers.  WPX Energy, also a Permian producer, said it has no plans to dial back its drilling.  We've already contemplated this scenario (of falling oil prices) and planned for it to protect our drilling plans and our production targets this year and next,  said WPX spokesman Kelly Swan.

The latest Digital News Report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found high scepticism about news and comment, with 33 percent of more than 70,000 consumers polled in 36 countries saying they can't rely on the news to be true. Only 24 percent of people said social media did a good job separating fact from fiction, compared to 40 percent for mainstream media. In countries like the United States and Britain, people were twice as likely to have faith in the news media to weed out fake news. Greece was the only country where people said social media was better at dividing truth from fantasy.  Although mainstream media is not trusted, it is still trusted twice as much for separating fact from fiction as social media,  Nic Newman, lead author of the sixth annual Digital News Report, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Fake news could be the best thing that has happened to journalism in a long while. It's an opportunity to re-establish the value of mainstream brands and focus on quality.   Newman said this has led to a hike in digital subscriptions to news organizations in the United States, with 16 percent now prepared to pay for news compared to 9 percent, and evidence that more people might be prepared to pay elsewhere. Prepared to Pay Despite a commonly held view that younger consumers would not pay online, the annual study that examines global news consumption found people under 35 were willing to pay for quality news, just as they did for music and video services. The online survey, by pollster YouGov, was the first time the Reuters Institute has looked at the response to the quality of information on social media, with 54 percent of consumers now using social media for news. The Reuters Institute, which is funded by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has looked previously at overall levels of trust in the media, finding a strong connection between distrust in the media and perceived media bias. This was strongest in nations with high levels of political polarization like the United States, Hungary and Italy. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the established news media for peddling  fake news  and gained traction during the election campaign by complaining of unfair media coverage.  But in the United States, trust in the media has increased a bit in the past year partly because a lot of the mistrust came from people on the right, Trump supporters,  said Newman.  While in the UK, trust in the media fell due to a sense the right-wing press was pushing a pro-Brexit agenda.  Newman said social networks were not going away, even though users are moving more to messaging apps for news, frustrated by the level of debate on networks such as Facebook and Twitter.  It is very popular to criticize social media but it is very good for incidental news and especially in countries where the media is controlled by the government,  he said.  It exposes people to a far greater range of views and issues such as during the migrant crisis when people were reporting directly from camps ... or on LGBT issues.

But it was wishful thinking. The women of Boeung Kak Lake, once home to a thriving community, have been kicked, manhandled, threatened and jailed, one of many land battles globally where women are bearing the brunt of the crackdown on protesters.  We are mostly women because we are more gentle so we face less violence. This is our strategy,  said Im Srey Touch, a 42-year-old activist from Boeung Kak Lake.  If we let men participate in our protests, we let them stand behind us or outside, and we stand in the front to reduce the likelihood of violence.  In fact, as the number of people killed in land conflicts around the world soars, more than half of the dead have been women, rights watchdogs say. In Phnom Penh the conflict began in 2007 when nearly 4,000 families were stripped of their housing rights after the Cambodian government leased the Boeung Kak Lake area in the nation's capital to make way for an upmarket mini city. Since then, the lake has been filled with sand and most of the 4,000 families evicted - with little to no compensation - amid complaints about the social and environmental impact. Over the years, more than a dozen activists protesting against the evictions have been arrested, most of them women through whom land is passed down in many parts of Cambodia. In February, a court sentenced Tep Vanny, the most high-profile lake activist, to two and a half years in jail for inciting violence and assaulting security guards. Whose Courts? Rights observers say the government is using the courts and jails to muzzle activists, including those defending their land rights against government officials and their business cronies.  It is a signal to civil society that 'We can come after you whenever we want. The courts are ours. We can make anything we say about you stick,'  said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Asia for New York-based nonprofit Human Rights Watch. The government of Minister Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) rejects such criticism and says it respects due process.  The court makes decisions based on the constitution and, like every open society, the court provides justice to everyone no matter who they are,  said government spokesman Phay Siphan. Amnesty International has criticized the Cambodian government for  bending the law to their will  to crack down on dissent. It said 42 criminal cases have been brought against the Boeung Kak Lake activists since 2011.  Nobody believes Tep Vanny was assaulting these security guards,  said Robertson, who accused the judges of being  stooges  of the CPP. Recipe for Violence Home to 15 million people, impoverished Cambodia has a long history of disputes over land rights, many dating back to the 1970s when the communist Khmer Rouge regime destroyed property records, and all housing and land became state property. Cambodia began to privatize land after 1989, when Hun Sen's CPP-led government shed its communist past and courted foreign investment, paving the way for economic land concessions.  After privatization, land prices started going up, and people were at risk of land grabbing by companies, the state and well-connected individuals,  said Naly Pilorge, director of the nonprofit Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights (LICADHO). LICADHO says the lack of a publicly available land register detailing boundaries means authorities could confiscate land, claiming that affected families were living on state property. Between 2000 and 2014, about 770,000 Cambodians were affected by land conflicts, according to charges presented by lawyers at the International Criminal Court in the Hague.  Because Cambodia is lawless ... with close ties between companies, government, the military and police, it's a recipe for violence,  Pilorge said by phone from Phnom Penh. A Broken Family Despite the court cases and jail time, the Boeung Kak Lake women persist. They protest loudly and lie on the ground when ringed and roughed up by authorities. They are arrested in groups - sometimes just two, and, once, 13 of them. Pilorge says authorities now appear to be trying a new tack, turning their energies onto Vanny on whom it is taking its toll. During a brief recess before her guilty verdict on Feb. 23, the 37-year-old divorcee who was arrested last August described the impact of her detention on her son, 11, and daughter, 13.  I lost my role as a mother. I have a broken family. My child is sick,  she said, adding that she could not be there for her daughter's surgery to remove her appendix.  During the last hearing, my daughter cried until she fainted ... I am a mother but I'm in prison. I can't take care of her.  Activists suspect authorities are using her in a bid to silence other activists ahead of local elections this month and next year's national vote. A lake activist who was arrested with Vanny last year, Sophea Bov, was convicted for insulting authorities and fined $20. So far Bov has refused to pay the fine, Pilorge said, but no one has come for yet although the judge could imprison her.  She was hoping that if she refused to pay the fine, she could go to prison to be with Vanny. Imagine where they are now, to think like that,  Pilorge said.  As human beings, we grow and we become stronger with challenges ... these women have been tested, and they've overcome a lot of obstacles.

Federal Judge Ricardo Leite blocked JBS's $300 million sale of the unit to rival Minerva SA (BEEF3.SA), citing a corruption scandal ensnaring JBS's controlling Batista family, court documents seen by Reuters showed on Wednesday. In a separate decision, the attorney general's office urged state auditors to freeze assets of JBS and the Batistas, who own 42 percent of JBS. The move guarantees that funds reimbursing state lender BNDES [BNDES.UL] for faulty dealings with JBS will be preserved, the attorney general's office said in a statement. Common shares in JBS surged 4.3 percent, while those of Minerva reversed early gains on the judge's decision. Minerva's stock shed 2.7 percent to 11.52 reais as of 4:20 p.m. local time (1920 GMT).  Leite, the judge, sits on the court that will review a leniency deal the Batistas reached with prosecutors, and his decision highlights the legal risks for the meatpacker and its founding family.  Last month, Prosecutor-General Rodigo Janot reached a plea agreement with billionaire brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista to avoid prosecution if they turned in 1,893 politicians involved in a bribery scheme. A separate leniency deal between the Batistas and federal prosecutors was signed on May 31, requiring the family to pay a 10.3 billion reais ($3.1 billion)fine over 25 years. The terms of the plea agreement have drawn intense scrutiny after the Batistas alleged that President Michel Temer took part in a bribery scheme, threatening to topple the president and sink his reform agenda. Leite said in his ruling that the deal to sell JBS beef plants in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay could harm the corruption investigation.

The acquisition would come a year after a U.S. federal judge thwarted a merger between Staples and peer Office Depot Inc (ODP.O) on antitrust grounds. It would represent a bet by Sycamore that Staples could more quickly shift its business model from serving consumers to catering to companies if it were to go private. Sycamore is in the process of finalizing a debt financing package for its bid for Staples after it prevailed over another private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, three sources said.  An agreement could be announced as early as next week, though negotiations between Sycamore and Staples are continuing and there is still a possibility that deal discussions could fall apart, the sources added.  The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples and New York-based Sycamore declined to comment. Cerberus, which is also based in New York, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Staples, which made its name selling paper, pens and other supplies in retail stores, reported a smaller-than-expected fall in first-quarter comparable sales last month, while its profit met analyst estimates, helped by a growth in demand for facilities, breakroom supplies and technology solutions.  Staples has 1,255 stores in the United States and 304 in Canada. It has the largest market share of office supply stores in the United States at 48 percent, and its share has increased since 2011, according to Euromonitor. Private-equity acquisitions of retailers have become increasingly rare, as the investment firms worry about increasing headwinds facing the industry and their portfolio companies struggle with the debt burden left behind from leveraged buyouts. Retail deals comprised the smallest share of mergers and acquisitions in the first quarter of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. A number of private equity-backed retailers, from Sports Authority Inc to Payless ShoeSource Inc, have filed for bankruptcy in the last two years. Sycamore, however, specializes in retail investments and has been more bullish on the sector. Its previous investments include regional department store operator Belk Inc, discount general merchandise retailer Dollar Express and mall and web-based specialty retailer Hot Topic.

The acquisition would come a year after a U.S. federal judge thwarted a merger between Staples and peer Office Depot Inc (ODP.O) on antitrust grounds. It would represent a bet by Sycamore that Staples could more quickly shift its business model from serving consumers to catering to companies if it were to go private. Sycamore is in the process of finalizing a debt financing package for its bid for Staples after it prevailed over another private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, three sources said.  An agreement could be announced as early as next week, though negotiations between Sycamore and Staples are continuing and there is still a possibility that deal discussions could fall apart, the sources added.  The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples and New York-based Sycamore declined to comment. Cerberus, which is also based in New York, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Staples, which made its name selling paper, pens and other supplies in retail stores, reported a smaller-than-expected fall in first-quarter comparable sales last month, while its profit met analyst estimates, helped by a growth in demand for facilities, breakroom supplies and technology solutions.

Five Padres relievers combined to limit the Chicago Cubs to two runs on one hit in the final 6 2/3 innings in a 3-2 victory that salvaged the finale of the three-game series.  To get that many good innings to keep a good offense down, to give us the opportunity to win a lot of the credit goes to (backup catcher) Luis Torrens,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  That's a young kid back there and he's navigating a very difficult lineup. He's calling the right pitches, he's blocking better and better.  Torrens also helped at the plate when he drew an eighth-inning walk with two out and bases loaded off Cubs reliever Koji Uehara to score Wil Myers for the go-ahead run.  He's grown and for the long run that's really fun to see him take those steps forward,  Green said.  He deserves a lot of credit for the win today.  Related CoveragePreview: Padres at CubsSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchPadres reliever Phil Maton (1-0) worked a scoreless seventh for the victory as the Padres (29-44) broke a three-game losing streak. Reliever Brandon Maurer worked a one-two-three ninth for his career-high-tying 13th save. Uehara (2-4) took the loss as the Cubs (36-35) had a three-game winning streak snapped. Cubs right-hander Eddie Butler had no decision in his start. Diaz departed a right forearm strain after working 2 1/3 innings. Albert Almora Jr. was on base following a walk at the time, and Anthony RIzzo was at the plate. Right-hander Craig Stammen entered and got Rizzo to ground to second for an inning-ending double play.  (Diaz) was having some trouble spinning the baseball, every time he did he could feel it,  Green said.  You never feel good when you hear that, but we don't know how severe it is at this time.  Diaz had been limited to no more than 3 1/3 innings in three starts. He allowed one hit, walked one and struck out two on 43 pitches on Wednesday.  Their young guy (Diaz) got hurt -- he has a good arm also -- and their bullpen matched up well,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  We hit a couple balls fairly good at people but otherwise couldn't mount an attack.  Ian Happ gave the Cubs a 2-0 lead in the fourth with his 10th homer of the season, a two-out shot off Stammen to right field that also brought home Kyle Schwarber. It was his second homer in two days and third since Sunday.  I feel like the at-bats are getting better,  said Happ, who joined the Cubs from Triple-A Iowa on May 13.  When I go up there I'm just trying to make contact ... Right now it's happening to go out of the ballpark.  Stammen doubled to right to open the fifth and scored on Jose Pirela's single to center. That spelled the end for Butler, who departed with Pirela on second and none out. Cubs reliever Justin Grimm wrapped up the inning with a pair of strikeouts. Butler threw 92 pitches in his four-plus innings. He allowed one run on five hits, struck out four and walked three. Padres shortstop Erick Aybar forced a 2-2 tie in the fifth with his one-out solo home run to right off left-handed reliever Brian Duensing. Aybar's fifth homer of the season came on Duensing's 2-0 pitch. Rizzo went 0-for-4, ending his streak of seven straight games reaching base in his leadoff at-bat. The Padres swept the Cubs in a three-game series at Petco Park in late May. NOTES: The Cubs presented 2016 World Series rings to Padres RHP Trevor Cahill and LHP Clayton Richard this week. Cahill spent all of last season with Chicago while Richard was released last August and rejoined San Diego. ... C Luis Torrens started again in place of Austin Hedges, injured in a home plate collision with Anthony Rizzo on Monday. Hedges may return to action on Friday. ...

Although Mohammed bin Salman's promotion to crown prince had long been expected among those who follow the royal family closely, the timing was a surprise and puts the kingdom's future in relatively untested hands. Mohammed bin Salman replaces his cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran security chief who led the Saudi campaign against Islamic State and al Qaeda, at a time when Riyadh faces tensions with Qatar and Iran and is locked into a war in Yemen. His appointment may make Saudi policy more hawkish against arch-rival Iran and other Gulf rivals such as Qatar, increasing volatility in an already unstable region, analysts said.  Under his watch, Saudi Arabia has developed aggressive foreign policies (Yemen, Qatar) and he has not been shy about making strong statements against Iran,  said Olivier Jakob at Switzerland-based oil consultancy Petromatrix.  It is not really a question of if, but rather of when, a new escalation with Iran starts.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who last month made Saudi Arabia his first foreign stop since his election, telephoned Mohammed bin Salman to congratulate him on his promotion.  The two leaders discussed the priority of cutting off all support for terrorists and extremists, as well as how to resolve the ongoing dispute with Qatar,  the White House said in a statement, adding they also discussed efforts to achieve a lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani congratulated Prince Mohammed, in a conciliatory gesture to Riyadh after it joined other Arab states in imposing sanctions on Qatar over  its alleged support for terrorism.  His Highness (Sheikh Tamim) wished him success ... for the good of the kingdom under the wise leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques,  Sheikh Tamim said in a message to Prince Mohammed, Qatar state news agency QNA reported.   British Prime Minister Theresa May also welcomed Prince Mohammed's appointment.  Iran, Saudi Arabia's main rival for regional influence, called Prince Mohammed's appointment a  soft coup . Its leadership was critical of comments he made last month that the  battle  should be taken into Iran, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei labeling Saudi leaders as  idiots . Iran, which is predominantly Shi'ite Muslim, and Saudi Arabia, which is mostly Sunni, compete for power and influence across the region. The two countries support opposite sides in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Related CoverageQatar's emir congratulates Saudi crown prince on his promotion: agencyAlwaleed bin Talal pledges loyalty to new Saudi Crown Prince: Twitter accountTrump, Saudi crown prince discuss Qatar, terror financing in callAnalysts said the prince's rapid rise has created friction within the ruling family, however, and made Saudi policy less predictable than in recent decades. Saudi royal family: tmsnrt.rs/2rVcsD4 Favorite Son The reshuffle sparked speculation on Twitter about a possible future abdication by the octogenarian King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in favor of his son, whose youth and dynamism have appealed to younger Saudis who make up the majority in society and are often eager for change. After decades in which the same small group of princes handled Saudi affairs on the world stage, Prince Mohammed has led diplomacy with global powers, reportedly charming both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He was appointed crown prince and deputy prime minister by royal decree, but he retains the defense portfolio and still controls oil and economic policies.  Mohammed bin Nayef, Salman's nephew and a counter-terrorism chief, who has been admired in Washington for crushing an al Qaeda bombing campaign in 2003-2006, was relieved of his posts, the decree said.

Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERSThe decision by King Salman to promote his son and consolidate his power was endorsed by 31 of 34 members of the Allegiance Council, made up of senior members of the ruling Al Saud family, the decree said.  In a ceremony at a al-Safa palace in the Muslim holy city of Mecca late on Wednesday night, Saudi state television showed royal family members, clerics and officials queue to shake hands with the young prince or kiss his shoulder.  We must hand in hand ... behind our leadership which we pray to God for it to be a wise one,  Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz Al al-Sheikh said, opening the pledging ceremony.  By God's book (the Koran) and the laws of His Messenger, I pledge allegiance.   Intent on dispelling speculation of internal divisions in the ruling dynasty, Saudi television repeatedly aired footage of Mohammed bin Nayef pledging allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman, who knelt and kissed his older cousin's hand, saying,  We will not give up taking your guidance and advice.  No Power Struggle Analysts said the change reduces uncertainty over succession and is expected to empower Mohammed bin Salman to move faster with his plan to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil, which includes the partial privatization of state oil company Aramco.  The change is a huge boost to the economic reform program ... Prince Mohammed bin Salman is its architect,  said John Sfakianakis, director of the Gulf Research Centre. Slideshow (9 Images)Bernard Haykel, professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton, said the king's decision was aimed at avoiding a power struggle between his son and Mohammed bin Nayef.  It's clearly a transition that has happened smoothly and bloodlessly. Now it's clear, it's straightforward. That kind of clarity lowers the risk. There's no question as to who's going to be in charge.      Saudi Arabia's stock market surged after the announcement, closing more than 5 percent up on the day. Arab leaders, including Oman’s Sultan Qaboos, Jordan’s King Abdullah and Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan congratulated Prince Mohammed on his appointment, state media said.     The royal decree did not nominate a new deputy crown prince, a post relatively new in Saudi Arabia, where kings have traditionally chosen their own successors. In an apparent attempt to appease the family, the decree had a clause that made clear that Mohammed bin Salman will not be allowed to appoint one of his own sons as his successor.  It also appointed young princes from other branches of the family to government roles, seemingly to reassure them that they will remain part of the ruling structure.  As deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman has been  responsible for running Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, dictating an energy policy with global implications and spearheading plans for the kingdom to build an economic future after oil.      Power Behind the Throne  Until his father became Saudi Arabia's seventh king in January 2015, few people outside the kingdom had heard of Prince Mohammed. As defense minister, he commands one of the world's biggest arms budgets and is ultimately responsible for Saudi Arabia's military adventure in Yemen.     Prince Mohammed chairs the supreme board of Aramco, making him the first royal family member to directly oversee the state oil company, long seen as the preserve of commoner technocrats.     But perhaps most importantly, he is the gatekeeper to his father, King Salman, who in Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy retains the final say in any major decision of state.     Outside Saudi Arabia, that rapid rise and the sudden changes to longstanding policies on regional affairs, energy and its economy have prompted unease, adding an unpredictable edge to a kingdom that allies long regarded as a known quantity.     Inside, they have prompted admiration among many younger Saudis who regard his ascent as evidence that their generation is taking a central place in running a country whose patriarchal traditions have for decades made power the province of the old.

Overall, 41 percent of American adults oppose the House plan, while 30 percent support it. Another 29 percent said they  don't know,  according to the poll.   It'll make people's deductibles skyrocket  said Shannon Sowards, 39, of Memphis, Tennessee, a Trump supporter who took the poll.  So I'm not for this healthcare act. I'm for insurance for everyone.   The Senate is expected to release its full plan on Thursday.  The gap between what Republicans say their plan will do and what people think it will do further complicates matters for Senate Republicans, who already have been criticized for drafting their bill in secret.   It would be great if a politican had the nerve to be brutally honest  and tell people that healthcare costs are going up, said Joseph Antos, a healthcare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.  None of them seem to.   For years, Republicans have promised voters they would replace Democratic former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which they say is too costly and intrusive.  When House Republicans pitched their health plan earlier this year, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted that it would lower premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions and improve public  access  to high-quality, low-cost healthcare. U.S. Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, who helped shape the House bill, said it  would make coverage of pre-existing conditions sacrosanct for all Americans.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, however, presented a different view of the bill. It estimated that under the House plan 23 million people would lose their health coverage by 2026 in an effort to cut the federal deficit.  According to the poll, nearly 60 percent of adults said they thought it would make insurance more expensive for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing conditions. Fifty-seven percent said it would make Medicaid less available, and 69 percent said it would cut federal money for Planned Parenthood.  Thirteen percent felt that the House plan would improve the quality of their healthcare, and 9 percent said it would make their healthcare cheaper.  About 28 percent of Americans said they would be  less likely  to support their congressional representative if he or she supported the House plan. Another 16 percent said they would be  more likely  to support their representative and 33 percent said it would make  no difference.   Republican respondents were more supportive of the House plan than others. And even those Republicans who did not like the House plan said that it is probably an improvement over the current healthcare system.   It's not going to change my political views  said Barb Huntington, 64, of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, a Trump supporter who took the poll.  Huntington, who buys health insurance through her state's Obamacare exchange, said her premiums went up by $25 per month this year. Huntington said she would not be surprised if they keep going up no matter what the Republicans do.   It's going to be like that every year, and we'll be lucky to have what we have,  she said.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 1,492 adults, including 671 Democrats and 501 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group, 4 percentage points for Democrats and 5 percentage points for Republicans.

Trump,John Barrasso,Mitch McConnell,Rand Paul,Ron Johnson,Susan Collins,USA,HEALTHCARE/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A healthcare bill being released by U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday is expected to roll back the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and reshape subsidies to low-income people buying private insurance. Those subsidies are expected to be linked to income, a  major improvement  from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services. The healthcare bill will be released to the Republican Senate Conference on Thursday morning and posted online, senators said. A vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. Obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid.  There is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the Obama healthcare law,  Senator John Barrasso, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN.  People across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.  Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal Obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy. Some Republican senators voiced concern on Wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their party's leaders prepare to unveil it. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes.  I'd find it hard to believe we'll have enough time,  he said, adding that if he did not get enough information,  I won't be voting yes.  Democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the Republican-led Senate need at least two Republicans to defect. The Democrats have criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, and blocked Senate committees on Wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, defending the closed-door sessions, has said all Senate Republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that Democrats are not interested in overhauling Obamacare. Once the plan is unveiled, Senate Republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the House version would be harmful for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing health conditions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. Party Tensions Several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. Much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the Medicaid expansion that took place under Obamacare. Moderates favored a seven-year phase-out, but the Senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. There was also an argument over Medicaid's growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025.  That's what we're told it might be,  said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost-sharing subsidies made available to help low-income Americans under Obamacare  for a couple of years.  Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.  The first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,  she said. An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the Republican-controlled House, according to the CBO. Conservative Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said he had not yet seen the Senate bill. But he promised voters he would seek full repeal of Obamacare, and  everything I hear (about the Senate draft) sounds like Obamacare light.

Jeanette Manfra, the department's acting deputy undersecretary of cyber security, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Kremlin orchestrated a wide-ranging influence operation that included email hacking and online propaganda to discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump, a Republican, win the White House in November. The Russia issue has cast a shadow over Trump's first five months in office. The extent of interference by Russian hackers, and whether they or others could interfere in future elections, has been the source of speculation and media reports for months. Russia has repeatedly denied responsibility for any cyber attacks during the election. Trump has variously said Russia may or may not have been responsible for hacking but has dismissed allegations his associates colluded with Moscow as  fake news.  Manfra and other officials testifying on Wednesday said U.S. elections are resilient to hacking in part because they are decentralized and largely operated on the state and local level. Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, voiced skepticism, saying only a small number of votes in key battleground states would need to be altered to tip the scales in an election.  A sophisticated actor could hack an election simply by focusing on certain counties,  King said.  I don't think it works just to say it’s a big system and diversity will protect us.  Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate panel, expressed frustration at Manfra's refusal to identify which states had been targeted. Arizona and Illinois last year confirmed that hackers had targeted their voter registration systems. Samuel Liles, another senior DHS cyber official, likened states targeted or scanned to a thief walking by homes to scout for weaknesses, and breaches to breaking through a front door. Investigation Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, met on Wednesday with senior Senate Judiciary Committee members to ensure there was no conflict between his investigation of potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and the panel's probe of what led to Trump firing Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. Trump acknowledged on Friday he was under investigation in the probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 race and possible collusion by his campaign, and seemed to assail the Justice Department official overseeing the inquiry. Mueller was examining whether Trump or others sought to obstruct the probe, a person familiar with the inquiry told Reuters. Jeh Johnson, who led the Homeland Security Department until the end of the Obama administration, told the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee his department had issued warnings about hacking into voter registration databases. Asked why the Obama administration did not do more to warn the public, Johnson said:  We were very concerned that we would not be perceived as taking sides in the election, injecting ourselves into a very heated campaign.  He told the House committee, which is investigating alleged Russian meddling in the election, that the notices did not get the attention he would have liked, blaming the emergence of a 2005 videotape - in which Trump brags about sexual conquests - for distracting the American public.

Perez went 3-for-3 with a grand slam as the Kansas City Royals rallied to defeat the Boston Red Sox 6-4 on Wednesday afternoon.  I was thinking about it two pitches before,  Perez said.  I don't know where it's coming through my mind, that I never hit one. I said, thank God. Unbelievable, huh.  Perez homered in the eighth inning after Red Sox relievers Matt Barnes and Robby Scott (0-1) walked the bases loaded with nobody out. Perez worked the count full before propelling a Scott pitch out to left, scoring Jorge Bonifacio, Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer.  The last pitch was lower in, a little in the middle,  Perez said.  And I hit it pretty good. I don't make adjustments. I see the ball and hit it. If it's close, I'm swinging.  Red Sox manager John Farrell decided to keep the left-handed Scott in to face the right-handed swinging Perez. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RoyalsBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatch His power numbers have come against right-handed pitching, by a 2- or 3-to-1 margin,  Farrell said.  He's a .230 hitter against left-handers. It didn't happen today.  Scott walked the left-handed-hitting Hosmer on four pitches, none close to the strike zone, to set up Perez's blast.  With the go-ahead run at the plate with the possibility of left-on-left to try to get a ground ball, there's four wide ones again,  Farrell said.  It set the stage for the grand slam, unfortunately.  Said Scott,  I've got to do better.  Kelvin Herrera pitched around a Jackie Bradley Jr. leadoff double in the ninth to collect his 17th save. Joakim Soria (3-2) worked a perfect eighth to pick up the victory. Drew Pomeranz held the Royals to two runs over 6 1/3 innings, but the bullpen could not hold a 4-2 lead after he was pulled.  We've been playing great,  Pomeranz said.  You can't win them all. That's going to happen sometimes, especially against these guys. They're swingers. It's part of the game. The bullpen has been great all year. It's just one of those things. We'll forget about it and be back at it on Friday.  Ian Kennedy silenced the Red Sox without a hit in the first three innings, but there were two loud booms to start the fourth. Rookie Andrew Benintendi led off the inning with a 454-foot splash down into the center field fountains. It was his 100th career hit and his 10th home run this season. Xander Bogaerts took a 3-1 Kennedy offering over the left-field fence to tie the score at 2.  Those are frustrating pitches,  Kennedy said. The Royals scored a pair of runs on three outs. Eric Hosmer doubled to lead off the second and stopped at third on Perez's single. Hosmer scored when Mike Moustakas grounded into a double play. Alcides Escobar led off the third with a double, advanced to third on Ramon Torres' groundout and scored on Whit Merrifield's flyout to Mookie Betts. The Red Sox took advantage of two Kansas City errors in the fifth to score a pair of unearned runs on one single. Christian Vazquez started it with a single to left. Deven Marrero put down a sacrifice bunt, but Kennedy's throw sailed over the head of first baseman Cheslor Cuthbert. Vasquez wound up scoring on Betts' sacrifice fly. Kennedy was removed after an intentional walk to Bogaerts. Mike Minor replaced Kennedy and attempted to pick Bogaerts off first, but Cuthbert whiffed on the throw, which hit first base coach Ruben Amaro Jr., allowing Marrero to score. NOTES: Boston 2B Dustin Pedroia missed the entire series with soreness in his rib cage area after being struck by a pitch Sunday in Houston. The Red Sox are optimistic Pedroia will start Friday. ... Royals LHP Danny Duffy, who is on the disabled list with a strained oblique, will throw a bullpen session Friday and could begin a minor league rehab assignment next week. ... DH Hanley Ramirez, who is hitting .205 with five extra-base hits in his previous 22 games, was not in the Red Sox lineup. He flied out as a pinch hitter to end the game. ... The Royals and Red Sox are off Thursday. The Red Sox return home and will retire David Ortiz's No. 34 jersey before the game Friday against the Angels. The Royals will welcome the Blue Jays to Kauffman Stadium for a weekend series.

Next door, rice paddies the size of 40 football fields have been filled for the $320 million textile mill which Hong Kong based TAL Group plans to build so it won't need to import cloth for the shirts. As elsewhere in Vietnam, there has been no sign of an impact on investment plans since U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal which had been expected to benefit Vietnam more than any country. In fact, foreign direct investment rose 6 percent year-on-year to $6.15 billion in the first five months of 2017. Cheap labor is an obvious lure for foreign investors. TAL's chief executive, Roger Lee, said Vietnam also scores highly on middle management, work ethic and government policy.  Though the removal of U.S. import tariffs under a TPP pact would have been a bonus, Lee said he had no second thoughts about investment plans after Trump pulled out of the deal soon after taking office.  Vietnam is a very compelling proposition,  said Lee. The wage for garment workers is $250 a month in Vietnam, compared to $700 in China, where TAL recently shut a factory for cost reasons.  The removal of tariffs of up to about 30 percent would have made clothing firms particular beneficiaries of the TPP deal, which had been forecast to add 28 percent to Vietnam's exports and 11 percent to its gross domestic product over a decade. Other clothing firms were also not discouraged by the scrapping of the deal. Lawsgroup's chief executive, Bosco Law, told Reuters it was now seeking to expand from its three factories with 10,000 workers. Vietnam's trade surplus over the United States - the sixth biggest last year - has come under scrutiny as a result of Trump's  America First  policy to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. But it hasn't discouraged investment. Labourers work at TAL garment factory in Vinh Phuc province, Vietnam May 23, 2017. Picture taken May 23, 2017.Kham We have started working for a couple of American manufacturing companies that contacted us after the TPP's demise and that are willing to relocate part of their operations from China,  said Oscar Mussons, Senior Associate at Dezan Shira and Associates professional services firm. Cheaper Than China Vietnam has been a big winner as Chinese manufacturing costs have risen and China itself is now one of the three biggest investors in Vietnam. Slideshow (3 Images)The TPP deal would have further improved access to U.S. and other markets for manufacturers based there, but also bound Vietnam to reforms meaning everything from opening up food import markets to strengthening labor rights. Investment and Planning Minister Nguyen Chi Dung told Reuters that Vietnam planned to go ahead with its commitments under TPP anyway - both to strengthen the economy and because of other trade deals, such as one with the European Union. The 11 remaining TPP members are also still trying to keep it alive. Dung said Vietnam had a target of $10 billion a year in foreign direct investment over the next five years – compared to nearly $16 billion in 2016 alone – as it sought a change in the type of investment it wants to draw.  Before we focused on quantity, now we switch to quality,  Dung said.  Higher technology, higher added value, less use of energy, less use of raw materials, less cheap labor.  That is where Vietnam has a greater challenge. It lags competitors for top skills. The proportion of secondary school leavers going on to further studies is a third higher in China and over three times higher in South Korea. “Vietnam is still a very attractive country, but companies might not invest as much as expected because they find the employees lack the skills for that added value,” Mussons said.  “Companies have been too focused on reducing costs and not enough on training.” Additional reporting and writing by Matthew Tostevin; Editing by Shri Navaratnam","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-investment-idUSKBN19C32X"},

The latest Digital News Report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found high scepticism about news and comment, with 33 percent of more than 70,000 consumers polled in 36 countries saying they can't rely on the news to be true. Only 24 percent of people said social media did a good job separating fact from fiction, compared to 40 percent for mainstream media. In countries like the United States and Britain, people were twice as likely to have faith in the news media to weed out fake news. Greece was the only country where people said social media was better at dividing truth from fantasy.  Although mainstream media is not trusted, it is still trusted twice as much for separating fact from fiction as social media,  Nic Newman, lead author of the sixth annual Digital News Report, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Fake news could be the best thing that has happened to journalism in a long while. It's an opportunity to re-establish the value of mainstream brands and focus on quality.   Newman said this has led to a hike in digital subscriptions to news organizations in the United States, with 16 percent now prepared to pay for news compared to 9 percent, and evidence that more people might be prepared to pay elsewhere. Prepared to Pay Despite a commonly held view that younger consumers would not pay online, the annual study that examines global news consumption found people under 35 were willing to pay for quality news, just as they did for music and video services. The online survey, by pollster YouGov, was the first time the Reuters Institute has looked at the response to the quality of information on social media, with 54 percent of consumers now using social media for news. The Reuters Institute, which is funded by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has looked previously at overall levels of trust in the media, finding a strong connection between distrust in the media and perceived media bias. This was strongest in nations with high levels of political polarization like the United States, Hungary and Italy. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the established news media for peddling  fake news  and gained traction during the election campaign by complaining of unfair media coverage.  But in the United States, trust in the media has increased a bit in the past year partly because a lot of the mistrust came from people on the right, Trump supporters,  said Newman.  While in the UK, trust in the media fell due to a sense the right-wing press was pushing a pro-Brexit agenda.  Newman said social networks were not going away, even though users are moving more to messaging apps for news, frustrated by the level of debate on networks such as Facebook and Twitter.  It is very popular to criticize social media but it is very good for incidental news and especially in countries where the media is controlled by the government,  he said.  It exposes people to a far greater range of views and issues such as during the migrant crisis when people were reporting directly from camps ... or on LGBT issues.

But it was wishful thinking. The women of Boeung Kak Lake, once home to a thriving community, have been kicked, manhandled, threatened and jailed, one of many land battles globally where women are bearing the brunt of the crackdown on protesters.  We are mostly women because we are more gentle so we face less violence. This is our strategy,  said Im Srey Touch, a 42-year-old activist from Boeung Kak Lake.  If we let men participate in our protests, we let them stand behind us or outside, and we stand in the front to reduce the likelihood of violence.  In fact, as the number of people killed in land conflicts around the world soars, more than half of the dead have been women, rights watchdogs say. In Phnom Penh the conflict began in 2007 when nearly 4,000 families were stripped of their housing rights after the Cambodian government leased the Boeung Kak Lake area in the nation's capital to make way for an upmarket mini city. Since then, the lake has been filled with sand and most of the 4,000 families evicted - with little to no compensation - amid complaints about the social and environmental impact. Over the years, more than a dozen activists protesting against the evictions have been arrested, most of them women through whom land is passed down in many parts of Cambodia. In February, a court sentenced Tep Vanny, the most high-profile lake activist, to two and a half years in jail for inciting violence and assaulting security guards. Whose Courts? Rights observers say the government is using the courts and jails to muzzle activists, including those defending their land rights against government officials and their business cronies.  It is a signal to civil society that 'We can come after you whenever we want. The courts are ours. We can make anything we say about you stick,'  said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Asia for New York-based nonprofit Human Rights Watch. The government of Minister Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) rejects such criticism and says it respects due process.  The court makes decisions based on the constitution and, like every open society, the court provides justice to everyone no matter who they are,  said government spokesman Phay Siphan. Amnesty International has criticized the Cambodian government for  bending the law to their will  to crack down on dissent. It said 42 criminal cases have been brought against the Boeung Kak Lake activists since 2011.  Nobody believes Tep Vanny was assaulting these security guards,  said Robertson, who accused the judges of being  stooges  of the CPP. Recipe for Violence Home to 15 million people, impoverished Cambodia has a long history of disputes over land rights, many dating back to the 1970s when the communist Khmer Rouge regime destroyed property records, and all housing and land became state property. Cambodia began to privatize land after 1989, when Hun Sen's CPP-led government shed its communist past and courted foreign investment, paving the way for economic land concessions.  After privatization, land prices started going up, and people were at risk of land grabbing by companies, the state and well-connected individuals,  said Naly Pilorge, director of the nonprofit Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights (LICADHO). LICADHO says the lack of a publicly available land register detailing boundaries means authorities could confiscate land, claiming that affected families were living on state property. Between 2000 and 2014, about 770,000 Cambodians were affected by land conflicts, according to charges presented by lawyers at the International Criminal Court in the Hague.  Because Cambodia is lawless ... with close ties between companies, government, the military and police, it's a recipe for violence,  Pilorge said by phone from Phnom Penh. A Broken Family Despite the court cases and jail time, the Boeung Kak Lake women persist. They protest loudly and lie on the ground when ringed and roughed up by authorities. They are arrested in groups - sometimes just two, and, once, 13 of them. Pilorge says authorities now appear to be trying a new tack, turning their energies onto Vanny on whom it is taking its toll. During a brief recess before her guilty verdict on Feb. 23, the 37-year-old divorcee who was arrested last August described the impact of her detention on her son, 11, and daughter, 13.  I lost my role as a mother. I have a broken family. My child is sick,  she said, adding that she could not be there for her daughter's surgery to remove her appendix.  During the last hearing, my daughter cried until she fainted ... I am a mother but I'm in prison. I can't take care of her.  Activists suspect authorities are using her in a bid to silence other activists ahead of local elections this month and next year's national vote. A lake activist who was arrested with Vanny last year, Sophea Bov, was convicted for insulting authorities and fined $20. So far Bov has refused to pay the fine, Pilorge said, but no one has come for yet although the judge could imprison her.  She was hoping that if she refused to pay the fine, she could go to prison to be with Vanny. Imagine where they are now, to think like that,  Pilorge said.  As human beings, we grow and we become stronger with challenges ... these women have been tested, and they've overcome a lot of obstacles.

Representative Jody Hice of Georgia said his proposal was an important step to ensure the personal safety of lawmakers  in light of recent events,  an apparent reference to an attack last week in which a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress practicing for a charity baseball game.  Personal protection and being able to defend oneself against an assailant is part of the fabric of our Constitution, which is why I am an ardent believer in the Second Amendment,  Hice said in a statement, referring to U.S. legal guarantees of the right to keep and bear arms.  While members of Congress are all average Americans, it is clear that we also have a bull's eye on our backs,  Hice added.  In light of recent events, it's incredibly important that congressmen and women maintain the ability to provide for their own safety, regardless of the city or state.  Hice said he introduced the measure on Tuesday, less than a week after a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at the baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, a Washington suburb. U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, was wounded in the attack, along with a Republican aide, a lobbyist and a Capitol Police officer in Scalise's security detail.  The gunman, a former volunteer campaign worker for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders who was said to be angry with Republicans, was killed in a gunbattle with police. Scalise underwent several surgeries to treat internal injuries caused by a wound to the hip. His condition was upgraded to  fair  on Wednesday.

China's Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N) and JD.com Inc (JD.O) have invested heavily in offline retail - bricks-and-mortar stores - in recent years to complement their online offerings.  With their ready-made payment and social media platforms to lure shoppers, Alibaba and JD.com have helped China become the world’s largest online grocery market, far ahead of the United States.  This early lead, cemented by densely populated urban areas and cheap labor, could be key as retailers and tech firms race to boost margins on low-cost consumer goods by reinventing supply chains with big data analytics.   China is already the largest online grocery market in terms of value in the world so it's really advanced in terms of scale,  said Nick Miles, London-based head of Asia Pacific for food and grocery industry research body IGD. Sales made online are set to more than double to around 6.6 percent of China's broader grocery market by 2020, compared to around 1.4 percent for U.S. sales by then. Both U.S. and Chinese e-commerce firms are grappling with the challenge of increasing their margins on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), which include low-margin, high-demand goods with a short shelf-life - a staple of grocery stores. Alibaba, which has a burgeoning cloud business that competes directly with Amazon, plans to use its trove of consumer data to provide a suite of connected services back to brands whose goods they sell. Services will include inventory management, smart manufacturing and logistics, aiming to slash waste and margins across the entire supply chain, according to the company's so-called  New Retail  strategy. Likewise, JD.com uses data from a partnership with China's hugely popular messaging app WeChat, which has over 930 million users, to build data profiles for a range of brands including baby products, cosmetics and soft drinks.  Catch Up Alibaba has invested over $9.3 billion in offline retail stores since 2015, including supermarket chain Sanjiang, department store Intime Retail Group and Suning Commerce Group Co Ltd (002024.SZ), one of China's biggest offline retailers. In May it took an 18 percent stake in Lianhua Supermarket Holdings Co Ltd (0980.HK), part of retailer Bailian Group.

FILE PHOTO: A Whole Foods Market is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S. June 16, 2017.Carlo Allegri/File PhotoU.S. firms are now looking to play catch up - key as bricks-and-mortar stores are hit by a slowdown and online players battle with tight profit margins and high delivery costs. Amazon launched a $13.7 billion bid for grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.N last week, marking its intention to take on Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart, which got a stake in JD.com in the Yihaodian deal, upped its share in the Chinese firm to 12.1 percent in February, having bought online retailer Jet.com in a $3 billion deal last year. It's a race with a big global impact on the wider market: worries about Amazon's new clout with the Whole Foods deal wiped more than $35 billion off the combined market value of dozens of U.S. supermarkets, food producers and shopping malls. The incentive for Chinese tech firms to slash costs and take a bigger bite of the offline market is clear.  Slideshow (7 Images)Despite being the world's largest e-commerce market, over 80 percent of transactions are still conducted offline in China. The country's e-commerce market grew over 50 percent last year while hypermarket and supermarket sales flatlined, according to consultancy Bain & Company. Online retail growth hasn't been immune either, with analysts pointing to high delivery costs and tight margins.  It's going to very hard for those pure e-commerce players to grow (margins), and for those offline players, it's going to be very hard to survive and make money,  said Bruno Lannes, Shanghai-based partner at Bain.  The answer is to combine in an integrated supply chain.  Competition China's firms and their global rivals are increasingly looking to tap into overseas market such as South East Asia and India, the most likely battlegrounds for any stand-off. However, online-offline tie-ups, even in China, are still at a relatively early stage. Challenges remain with integrating physical store assets to online systems, cutting delivery costs and dealing with fierce competition. At the Hema seafood market on the east side of Beijing, these challenges - and China's ambition - are on display. Shoppers peruse fresh fish and clams, but pay with smartphones, scanning QR codes using Alibaba-linked payment platform Alipay as staff in red t-shirts help set up accounts and connect to wifi.  I don't think Amazon is competitive in this field... its pages, functions and payments are old fashioned,  said one female shopper in her 20's with the last name Liu.  Hema is like Ikea but better... it feels like home.

Next door, rice paddies the size of 40 football fields have been filled for the $320 million textile mill which Hong Kong based TAL Group plans to build so it won't need to import cloth for the shirts. As elsewhere in Vietnam, there has been no sign of an impact on investment plans since U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal which had been expected to benefit Vietnam more than any country. In fact, foreign direct investment rose 6 percent year-on-year to $6.15 billion in the first five months of 2017. Cheap labor is an obvious lure for foreign investors. TAL's chief executive, Roger Lee, said Vietnam also scores highly on middle management, work ethic and government policy.  Though the removal of U.S. import tariffs under a TPP pact would have been a bonus, Lee said he had no second thoughts about investment plans after Trump pulled out of the deal soon after taking office.  Vietnam is a very compelling proposition,  said Lee. The wage for garment workers is $250 a month in Vietnam, compared to $700 in China, where TAL recently shut a factory for cost reasons.  The removal of tariffs of up to about 30 percent would have made clothing firms particular beneficiaries of the TPP deal, which had been forecast to add 28 percent to Vietnam's exports and 11 percent to its gross domestic product over a decade. Other clothing firms were also not discouraged by the scrapping of the deal. Lawsgroup's chief executive, Bosco Law, told Reuters it was now seeking to expand from its three factories with 10,000 workers. Vietnam's trade surplus over the United States - the sixth biggest last year - has come under scrutiny as a result of Trump's  America First  policy to bring manufacturing jobs back to America. But it hasn't discouraged investment. Labourers work at TAL garment factory in Vinh Phuc province, Vietnam May 23, 2017. Picture taken May 23, 2017.Kham We have started working for a couple of American manufacturing companies that contacted us after the TPP's demise and that are willing to relocate part of their operations from China,  said Oscar Mussons, Senior Associate at Dezan Shira and Associates professional services firm. Cheaper Than China Vietnam has been a big winner as Chinese manufacturing costs have risen and China itself is now one of the three biggest investors in Vietnam. Slideshow (3 Images)The TPP deal would have further improved access to U.S. and other markets for manufacturers based there, but also bound Vietnam to reforms meaning everything from opening up food import markets to strengthening labor rights. Investment and Planning Minister Nguyen Chi Dung told Reuters that Vietnam planned to go ahead with its commitments under TPP anyway - both to strengthen the economy and because of other trade deals, such as one with the European Union. The 11 remaining TPP members are also still trying to keep it alive. Dung said Vietnam had a target of $10 billion a year in foreign direct investment over the next five years – compared to nearly $16 billion in 2016 alone – as it sought a change in the type of investment it wants to draw.  Before we focused on quantity, now we switch to quality,  Dung said.  Higher technology, higher added value, less use of energy, less use of raw materials, less cheap labor.  That is where Vietnam has a greater challenge. It lags competitors for top skills. The proportion of secondary school leavers going on to further studies is a third higher in China and over three times higher in South Korea. “Vietnam is still a very attractive country, but companies might not invest as much as expected because they find the employees lack the skills for that added value,” Mussons said.  “Companies have been too focused on reducing costs and not enough on training.” Additional reporting and writing by Matthew Tostevin; Editing by Shri Navaratnam","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/vietnam-investment-idUSL8N1IV16U"},

The storm took the life of a 10-year-old boy who was struck and fatally injured by a log dislodged by a large wave while he stood near shore in the Gulf Coast community of Fort Morgan, Alabama, the Baldwin County Coroner said. The boy, whose name was not immediately disclosed, was vacationing with and his family at the shore. No other casualties have been reported from the storm.  Cindy's wind speed remained at maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (85 km) per hour, down from 60 miles (95 km) per hour on Tuesday, and the storm center was located about 135 miles (215 km) south of Lake Charles, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said Wednesday in an afternoon update.  Two tornados were reported about 4 miles (6.4 km) northwest of Biloxi, Mississippi, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and readied emergency vehicles and the Louisiana National Guard. As of noon, he said there were no reports of significant flooding or damage, but there were worries of tornadoes. Alabama also declared a state of emergency, Texas increased its state of preparedness and Florida's governor warned residents in the northwest part of his state to stay alert for flooding and heavy rain. The storm has had limited impact on oil production in the Gulf. About 17 percent of oil production in the Gulf was shut in and 40 platforms, or about 5 percent, were evacuated. Expected rains and wind could disrupt regional refineries that are home to some 2.3 million barrels per day of refining capacity.  Sabine Pilots, which guides ships in and out of the ports of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange, Texas, suspended some operations on Wednesday, a spokesperson said.  The storm, moving northwest at nearly 9 miles (14 km) per hour, was expected to make landfall along the Texas-Louisiana border, near major Exxon Mobil Corp., Motiva Enterprises and Total SA refineries. Outages at refineries could drive up gasoline prices.  The big story here is going to be a large area of rain across the southern portion of the U.S.,  said Matt Rogers, president and co-founder of Commodity Weather Group.  Cindy could drop between 6 and 9 inches (15-23 cm) of rain and bring as much as 15 inches to some parts of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and cause  life-threatening flash flooding,  the NHC said. The storm could cause a surge of up to 3 feet (0.91 meters) in isolated areas and possibly spawn tornados from southern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations ahead of the storm but expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. Energy companies with operations in the Gulf of Mexico reported little impact on production. Shell suspended some well operations and Anadarko Petroleum, ENI and Enbridge said they had evacuated non-essential personnel. The Gulf of Mexico region is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. New Orleans residents were told to expect about 6 inches of rain from the storm, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in a press conference, about half the amount previously forecast.   There was little impact on air travel. At 4 p.m., New Orleans airport reported eight flights canceled and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson had seven flights canceled, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service.  There were reports of voluntary evacuations from some coastal communities in Texas, including the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County, near where the storm was expected to hit land. The Tennessee Valley Authority said it was lowering some lake levels to add water storage capacity for rains from Cindy. TVA provides electricity to more than 9 million people in parts of seven southeastern states, along with flood control for the Tennessee River system. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. Most meteorologists forecast this year will be more active than normal.

The storm took the life of a 10-year-old boy who was struck and fatally injured by a log dislodged by a large wave while he stood near shore in the Gulf Coast community of Fort Morgan, Alabama, the Baldwin County Coroner said. The boy, whose name was not immediately disclosed, was vacationing with and his family at the shore. No other casualties have been reported from the storm.  Cindy's wind speed remained at maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (85 km) per hour, down from 60 miles (95 km) per hour on Tuesday, and the storm center was located about 135 miles (215 km) south of Lake Charles, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said Wednesday in an afternoon update.  Two tornados were reported about 4 miles (6.4 km) northwest of Biloxi, Mississippi, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and readied emergency vehicles and the Louisiana National Guard. As of noon, he said there were no reports of significant flooding or damage, but there were worries of tornadoes. Alabama also declared a state of emergency, Texas increased its state of preparedness and Florida's governor warned residents in the northwest part of his state to stay alert for flooding and heavy rain. The storm has had limited impact on oil production in the Gulf. About 17 percent of oil production in the Gulf was shut in and 40 platforms, or about 5 percent, were evacuated. Expected rains and wind could disrupt regional refineries that are home to some 2.3 million barrels per day of refining capacity.  Sabine Pilots, which guides ships in and out of the ports of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange, Texas, suspended some operations on Wednesday, a spokesperson said.  The storm, moving northwest at nearly 9 miles (14 km) per hour, was expected to make landfall along the Texas-Louisiana border, near major Exxon Mobil Corp., Motiva Enterprises and Total SA refineries. Outages at refineries could drive up gasoline prices.  The big story here is going to be a large area of rain across the southern portion of the U.S.,  said Matt Rogers, president and co-founder of Commodity Weather Group.  Cindy could drop between 6 and 9 inches (15-23 cm) of rain and bring as much as 15 inches to some parts of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and cause  life-threatening flash flooding,  the NHC said. The storm could cause a surge of up to 3 feet (0.91 meters) in isolated areas and possibly spawn tornados from southern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations ahead of the storm but expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. Energy companies with operations in the Gulf of Mexico reported little impact on production. Shell suspended some well operations and Anadarko Petroleum, ENI and Enbridge said they had evacuated non-essential personnel. The Gulf of Mexico region is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. New Orleans residents were told to expect about 6 inches of rain from the storm, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in a press conference, about half the amount previously forecast.   There was little impact on air travel. At 4 p.m., New Orleans airport reported eight flights canceled and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson had seven flights canceled, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service.  There were reports of voluntary evacuations from some coastal communities in Texas, including the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County, near where the storm was expected to hit land. The Tennessee Valley Authority said it was lowering some lake levels to add water storage capacity for rains from Cindy. TVA provides electricity to more than 9 million people in parts of seven southeastern states, along with flood control for the Tennessee River system. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. Most meteorologists forecast this year will be more active than normal.

Trump,John Thune,USA,AVIATION/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Transportation Committee on Wednesday proposed legislation to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system and make other aviation changes, but it faces an uncertain future in Congress. The panel plans to consider the bill next Tuesday, and the full House will vote in mid-July, said the committee's Republican chairman, Representative Bill Shuster.  This is about saving the taxpayers' money,  Shuster told reporters on Wednesday.  Maintaining the status quo is unacceptable.  The legislation would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United Airlines passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline banned the practice. The bill would also require the U.S. Transportation Department to clarify regulations for compensating passengers, including that there is no maximum compensation, and would legally bar the use of cellphones and other mobile devices for phone calls during flights. No airline currently allows in-flight calls from personal phones. In April, the Federal Communications Commission said it planned to halt a regulatory process that could have led to in-flight calls on airplanes. The legislation also requires large and medium-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers. Airlines would have to post a prominent link on their website on services offered in the event of a widespread computer outage. Many airlines have been hit by computer system outages over the last year. The most controversial proposal is the privatization of air traffic control. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump unveiled a plan to modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. Congressman Shuster said airlines would have three seats on the 13-member board: one for major airlines, one for cargo carriers and one for regional airlines. The Trump administration has proposed giving airlines two seats on the board, while Shuster last year proposed giving airlines four seats. Shuster aims to address concerns among private plane owners and rural airports by barring the new air traffic control entity from charging general aviation operators user fees. Critics say the plan would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. A coalition of five general aviation groups said in a statement on Wednesday that they would not support the bill, saying it was  fundamentally flawed.  The Airline Owners and Pilots Association said the bill has a  high potential for unintended consequences as well as increased costs and uncertainty.  Shuster's bill would reauthorize the FAA for six years and also has provisions to speed up a decision by the Transportation Department on whether to allow expanded commercial drone use. The Transportation Department would also have to consider whether to require airlines to stock emergency medicine for children aboard flights. The legislation would also authorize significantly higher funding for a program that subsidizes commercial air service to rural airports, which the Trump administration budget proposed eliminating. The Senate Commerce Committee's chairman, Senator John Thune, said on Tuesday that he was not planning to include air traffic control privatization in the FAA reauthorization, a committee aide said. The administration and Shuster say they would not charge the private entity for the government's air traffic control assets and would bar Congress from reviewing fees charged by the board. Executives from United, Hawaiian Airlines Inc, American Airlines Inc and Southwest Airlines Co, strongly back the proposal. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. It is unclear whether privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-aviation-idUSL1N1JI25M"},

Officials from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said they were looking at ways to simplify the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from making speculative bets with their own money. The possible steps included exempting small banks from having to comply with it.  In our view, there is room for eliminating or relaxing aspects of the implementing regulation,  Fed Governor Jerome Powell said in testimony to be given before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.  The Volcker Rule provides a practical example of how conflicting messages and inconsistent interpretation can exacerbate (the) regulatory burden,  said Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, a leading regulator for national banks. The Fed and the comptroller's office are among five bank regulators that must agree to any reform of the Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank law that passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Volcker rule also limits relationships between covered banks and hedge funds or private equity funds. Wall Street and some regulators have said the standard is too constricting, leaving banks vainly trying to separate accounts that may not actually take risky bets and sapping liquidity in some markets because bank dealers are put off from participating. Backers of the rule say it guards against speculation that could lead to another costly government bank bailout.  The Federal Reserve wrote much of the regulatory language spelling out the Volcker Rule, and the central bank now thinks there is a way to improve the standard, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said. Noreika and Powell are among a handful of national regulators due to testify about regulatory reform on the banking panel. They said they could envision smaller banks being exempted from the Volcker Rule, named after former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker who led the central bank in the 1980s.

Taking Altice USA public will give Altice's founder, French billionaire Patrick Drahi, traded shares in the company which he can then use as currency in new acquisitions in order to expand what is already the fourth-biggest U.S. cable provider. Altice USA priced 63.9 million shares at $30, within its indicated price range of $27 to $31, making it this year's second largest U.S. IPO and giving the company a market capitalization of approximately $22 billion. There has only been one IPO of a U.S. cable company in the last five years, WideOpenWest Inc, which last month raised about $310 million in an IPO, pricing below its expected range. Most sizeable cable companies are already public. Those that are not often seek scale by being acquired rather than going public. Last month, private equity firm TPG Global LLC said it would buy Wave Broadband for $2.37 billion, to combine it with its existing investments, RCN Telecom Services LLC and Grande Communications Networks. A wave of dealmaking has swept the U.S. cable sector over the past few years, as consumers have dropped cable-providers in favor of internet streaming, forcing many companies in the sector to slash prices as they compete for subscribers. Some analysts have said that Altice USA could harbor ambitions to one day take on large acquisition targets such as Charter Communications Inc and privately held Cox Communications. Altice USA, which operates in 21 states, had $9.2 billion in pro forma annual revenue in 2016. It has said it plans to use IPO proceeds to pay down some of its roughly $21 billion in debt. Altice USA's parent is a European and Israeli telecoms and cable empire that Drahi has built through debt-heavy acquisitions. It will hold 70.3 percent of Altice USA's shares and 98.3 percent of the voting rights in the company thanks to a separate bundle of stock. Private equity firm BC Partners Ltd and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, two pre-existing minority investors in Altice USA, will jointly own a minority stake in the company.

McIlroy has played just a handful of tournaments this year after battling through a rib injury, which he said was not a factor in him missing the cut at Erin Hills after shooting an ugly first-round 78.   In a perfect world last week wouldn't have been my first week back,  the Northern Irishman told reporters on Wednesday.   It's the U.S. Open, it's a high stress, high pressure sort of event. I hit my stride a little too late. I played well my last nine holes on Friday. I was just trying to shake the rust off before that.   The world number three was inaccurate off the tee and too often found the course's long fescue, which he had criticised event organisers for cutting back before the tournament's opening day.  McIlroy, however, was far from the only big name to miss the cut at Erin Hills.   World number one Dustin Johnson and number four Jason Day also failed to make it into the weekend play.  McIlroy hopes he can get momentum going in his debut at the par-70 Connecticut course.  Mentally, I was not as sharp as I needed to be and that just comes from playing rounds of golf,  he said.   Hopefully, I can get on a good run over these next few weeks and hopefully this is the start of that run.

Trump,John Thune,US,USA,AVIATION,Crime / Law / Justice,Lawmaking,Company News,Picture available,Government / Politics,Corporate Events,US House of Representatives,Airline Services (TRBC),Regulation,Airlines (TRBC),US Senate,United States","sector":"Politics","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Transportation Committee on Wednesday proposed legislation to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system and make other aviation changes, but it faces an uncertain future in Congress. The panel plans to consider the bill next Tuesday, and the full House will vote in mid-July, said the committee's Republican chairman, Representative Bill Shuster.  This is about saving the taxpayers' money,  Shuster told reporters on Wednesday.  Maintaining the status quo is unacceptable.  The legislation would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United Airlines passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline banned the practice.  The bill would also require the U.S. Transportation Department to clarify regulations for compensating passengers, including that there is no maximum compensation, and would legally bar the use of cellphones and other mobile devices for phone calls during flights. No airline currently allows in-flight calls from personal phones. In April, the Federal Communications Commission said it planned to halt a regulatory process that could have led to in-flight calls on airplanes. The legislation also requires large and medium-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers.  Airlines would have to post a prominent link on their website on services offered in the event of a widespread computer outage. Many airlines have been hit by computer system outages over the last year. The most controversial proposal is the privatization of air traffic control. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump unveiled a plan to modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. Congressman Shuster said airlines would have three seats on the 13-member board: one for major airlines, one for cargo carriers and one for regional airlines. The Trump administration has proposed giving airlines two seats on the board, while Shuster last year proposed giving airlines four seats. Shuster aims to address concerns among private plane owners and rural airports by barring the new air traffic control entity from charging general aviation operators user fees.  Critics say the plan would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. A coalition of five general aviation groups said in a statement on Wednesday that they would not support the bill, saying it was  fundamentally flawed.  The Airline Owners and Pilots Association said the bill has a  high potential for unintended consequences as well as increased costs and uncertainty.  Shuster's bill would reauthorize the FAA for six years and also has provisions to speed up a decision by the Transportation Department on whether to allow expanded commercial drone use. The Transportation Department would also have to consider whether to require airlines to stock emergency medicine for children aboard flights. The legislation would also authorize significantly higher funding for a program that subsidizes commercial air service to rural airports, which the Trump administration budget proposed eliminating. The Senate Commerce Committee's chairman, Senator John Thune, said on Tuesday that he was not planning to include air traffic control privatization in the FAA reauthorization, a committee aide said. The administration and Shuster say they would not charge the private entity for the government's air traffic control assets and would bar Congress from reviewing fees charged by the board. Executives from United, Hawaiian Airlines Inc, American Airlines Inc and Southwest Airlines Co, strongly back the proposal. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. It is unclear whether privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two.

Officials from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said they were looking at ways to simplify the Volcker rule, which prevents banks from making speculative bets with their own money. The possible steps included exempting small banks from having to comply with it.  In our view, there is room for eliminating or relaxing aspects of the implementing regulation,  Fed Governor Jerome Powell said in testimony to be given before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.  The Volcker Rule provides a practical example of how conflicting messages and inconsistent interpretation can exacerbate (the) regulatory burden,  said Keith Noreika, the acting Comptroller of the Currency, a leading regulator for national banks. The Fed and the comptroller's office are among five bank regulators that must agree to any reform of the Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank law that passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Volcker rule also limits relationships between covered banks and hedge funds or private equity funds. Wall Street and some regulators have said the standard is too constricting, leaving banks vainly trying to separate accounts that may not actually take risky bets and sapping liquidity in some markets because bank dealers are put off from participating. Backers of the rule say it guards against speculation that could lead to another costly government bank bailout.  The Federal Reserve wrote much of the regulatory language spelling out the Volcker Rule, and the central bank now thinks there is a way to improve the standard, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said. Noreika and Powell are among a handful of national regulators due to testify about regulatory reform on the banking panel. They said they could envision smaller banks being exempted from the Volcker Rule, named after former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker who led the central bank in the 1980s. President Donald Trump has favored less restrictive banking rules to boost lending and spur economic growth. But Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insures bank assets, warned it could be risky to loosen the rules too much.  It is important to preserve the gains that have been achieved in restoring financial stability,  Gruenberg was due to tell the banking panel. Gruenberg's term ends in November. Trump has said he intends to nominate James Clinger, a Republican Congressional staffer, to replace Gruenberg.

(Reuters) - The first total solar eclipse across the continental United States in a century is expected to spark watching parties and traffic jams as it darkens skies from Oregon to South Carolina, authorities said on Wednesday. During the Aug. 21 eclipse, the moon will pass between the sun and Earth, blocking the face of the sun and leaving only its outer atmosphere, or corona, visible in the sky. It is the first coast-to-coast total eclipse since 1918. Weather permitting, people can watch as the moon's 70-mile (113-km) wide shadow crosses through 14 states from 10:15 a.m. PDT (1715 GMT) around Lincoln Beach, Oregon, to 2:49 p.m. EDT (1849 GMT) in McClellanville, South Carolina. With 200 million Americans within a day's drive of the path, national parks and highways officials are bracing for a travel surge. “Be prepared,  Martin Knopp of the Federal Highway Administration said at a news conference, cautioning drivers against simply showing up.  It’s not the time to pull over and be on the side of the road.”  Travel groups and many scientists will be heading to Oregon's northwest desert seeking favorable weather for viewing, according to the website eclipsophile.com. FILE PHOTO - A combination photograph shows the beginning (top L) to the end (top L to bottom R) of a total solar eclipse as seen from the beach of Ternate island, Indonesia, March 9, 2016.BeawihartaTotal solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every year or so, but most cast their shadow over oceans or remote land. The last total eclipse over part of the contiguous U.S. was in 1979. All of North America will experience a partial eclipse, though the difference between a full and partial eclipse is  literally the difference between night and day,  said astronomer Rick Fienberg of the American Astronomical Society. He noted that even a 99 percent eclipse will not reveal the sun's corona. And during a total eclipse, the temperature drops and the horizon is ringed by the colors of sunset.   The sky gets deep twilight blue and bright stars and planets come out,  Fienberg said.  Animals and birds behave strangely, like it's the end of the day.  NASA said it plans to fly high-altitude research balloons and airplanes for solar physics and other experiments. Nearly a dozen U.S. science satellites will observe the sun and Earth.  The U.S. space agency will also broadcast the eclipse live from locations along the path. Experts caution that the only safe time to look at the sun without special eclipse glasses is during totality when the surface of the sun is completely blocked by the moon.

The company, Det Norske Veritas Inc, was to produce a risk analysis by the end of June on Enbridge's 540,000 barrel per day Line 5 pipeline, which travels underwater through the Straits of Mackinac. That report will no longer be delivered, said Melody Kindraka, a public information officer with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Det Norske Veritas did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the issue. The state said it came to light after Det Norske Veritas informed officials that an employee who worked on the Line 5 risk analysis subsequently worked on another project for Enbridge while the risk analysis was still being finished. This violated conflict of interest clauses in the contract.  Our trust was violated and we now find ourselves without a key piece needed to fully evaluate the financial risks associated with the pipeline that runs through our Great Lakes, this is unacceptable,  Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said in a statement.  Terminating the contract is the only option we have to maintain the integrity of the risk analysis.  The 64-year-old Line 5 pipeline running under the Straits of Mackinac has become the subject of fierce environmental opposition in Michigan because of fears the aging infrastructure could leak crude oil into the Great Lakes. It is a key part of Enbridge's Mainline system, which delivers the bulk of Canadian crude imports to the United States. In 2016 state officials ordered two independent reports into the pipeline, one looking at the risks of a spill and the other assessing potential alternatives to the underwater crossing in the Straits of Mackinac. Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said the company supported the state's actions and was disappointed by the developments. Kindraka said the state is reassessing its plans on how to move forward with a risk assessment but the report on alternatives to the pipeline from another firm, Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems, will be presented to the public on July 6. So far Det Norske Veritas has not received any payment for its work and the state is reviewing the payment terms of the contract, she added.

Many funds use the MSCI benchmark stock and bond markets indices as guides for allocating investments into emerging markets.  Argentina's benchmark Merval stock index .MERV rose nearly 25 percent in 2017 as traders bet on the inclusion of the country's stocks in the benchmark index, a move which could have triggered close to $2 billion in additional capital inflows.  The decision was also a blow to Argentine companies hoping for more liquidity in their equities market to raise funds.  The real damage that the MSCI's decision may cause is the delay of IPOs and investments,  said Fausto Spotorno, economist at Buenos Aires consultancy Orlando Ferreres.  The Merval index slumped 4.8 percent on Wednesday, its steepest drop this year, while the Argentine peso currency ARS=RASL fell as much as 2.0 percent to a record low 16.48 per U.S. dollar. President Macri declared Argentina open for business after a decade of interventionist rule scared away foreign investors but progress has been uneven since he took office 18 months ago.  MSCI's decision underlined how Macri has struggled to lure private investments crucial to boosting a sluggish economy and to pass market-friendly legislation which has stalled in the opposition-controlled congress.  Key among those bills is a capital markets reform which the administration proposed last year and which would undo measures allowing the market regulator wide leeway to intervene in company affairs.  People cross the street as a plane flies over the city in the financial district in Buenos Aires, Argentina, June 21, 2017.Marcos BrindicciThe legislation would also allow licensed wealth managers to invest Argentine citizens' funds in overseas assets, as well as lowering some taxes.   The local market is still hard to access,  said Asha Mehta, senior portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management in Boston.  It's costly. I consider the capital gains tax environment in Argentina to be prohibitive.    'Irreversible'? Slideshow (9 Images)Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo has said Congress could approve the reform this year, and local media have reported that the CNV securities regulator is mulling a decree that would accomplish some of the reform's aims. A spokeswomen for the CNV said she had no information about a possible decree. Shortly after taking office in December 2015, Macri got rid of the most glaring distortions put in place by his populist predecessor Cristina Fernandez, including capital controls and foreign exchange restrictions. The capital controls were cited by MSCI in 2009 as the reason for downgrading Argentina to  frontier  market status in the first place.  A surprise $2.75 billion sale of 100-year bonds on Monday, which was more than three times oversubscribed, reflected improving investor confidence in Macri, but foreign direct investment has been slower to come, with many eyeing midterm elections in October and a presidential vote in 2019 for signs of the longevity of Macri's reforms. Similarly, MSCI said it needed more signs that the changes were  irreversible  to reincorporate the country's shares into its emerging markets index .MSCIEF, which guides major developing country stock allocations worldwide by investment funds. Still, investors said the MSCI decision did not change fundamental optimism about Argentina, where the economy is expected to grow around 3.0 percent this year after falling 2.3 percent in 2016, and inflation is seen at half last year's 40 percent.  Data published on Wednesday afternoon showed the Argentine economy grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period the prior year, snapping three straight quarters of year-on-year declines.  It probably makes us a bit more negative in the very short term, but in the long term what we're focused on is the direction of the reforms,  said Leigh Innes, lead portfolio specialist for frontier markets strategy at T Rowe Price.

This is not a failure of talks, I am hopeful we will reach a deal when we return to the table on Thursday at 15.30 (1330 GMT),  he said in a phone interview. About 70 percent of VW's 12,300 employees joined the protest that started on Tuesday and hit production at the biggest private employer in Slovakia, which exports virtually all of its output. The first strike at a major Slovak plant since the 1989 end of communist rule comes as economies across Central Europe outpace Western Europe, leading to a labour shortage that many companies worry will limit growth. On Monday, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico supported the action, which began as labour office data on Tuesday showed Slovakia's unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent in May, the lowest since the global financial crisis hit central Europe in 2008. But VW's Slovak unit said last week that union demands for a bigger pay hike would endanger the plant's competitiveness within the car group and also job stability. The VW workers are seeking a 16 percent pay boost over two years. Management has offered 4.5 percent raise this year and 4.2 percent raise next year, plus bonuses. VW produced 388,687 cars in Slovakia in 2016. It makes Volkswagen Touareg, Audi Q7, Volkswagen up!, Seat Mii, Skoda Citigo, and bodies for the Porsche Cayenne. The company pays an average wage of 1,800 euros ($2,010) a month, double the national average. That figure is also higher than the average salary of 37,000 crowns ($1,577) that VW pays at its Czech carmaker Skoda Auto. Slovakia's Finance Ministry has estimated that 12 days of an uninterrupted strike would cut 0.1 percentage point off the country's annual economic output. Growth is seen at 3.3 percent this year and above 4 percent in coming years, with the auto sector the most important driver. Slovakia, with a population of 5.4 million, produces more than 1 million vehicles a year, making it the biggest per-capita auto producer in the world. Besides VW, Kia Motors Corp and Peugeot SA have plants in Slovakia. Jaguar Land Rover is building a plant due to open next year.

Trump,Jennifer Newby,Lee Gelernt,Maher,Mark Goldsmith,Shantal Hanna,USA,IMMIGRATION/IRAQ (PIX),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"DETROIT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge heard arguments on Wednesday to halt the deportations of around 100 Iraqis arrested by immigration authorities in the Detroit area because many belong to minorities and could face torture or religious persecution in their homeland. In a coordinated sweep in recent weeks, immigration authorities moved to detain Iraqi immigrants around the country who had final deportation orders and convictions for serious crimes. The roundup followed Iraq's agreement to accept deportees, as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban signed in March. Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to an agreement on March 12. The class action lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, asks the court to issue an emergency halt to the planned removals, arguing that many of those affected in Michigan are Chaldean Catholics, who are  widely recognized as targets of brutal persecution in Iraq.  The ACLU argues that deporting the Iraqis could violate the United Nations Convention Against Torture, an international human rights treaty adopted by the United States. The U.S. government says the district court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and that the immigrants can appeal their claims in immigration court. Jennifer Newby, the Justice Department attorney at Wednesday's hearing before U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith in Detroit, said the people arrested had known about their deportation orders and should have had time to seek legal remedies.  They waited until removal was imminent to ask for injunctive relief, thereby creating their own emergencies,  Newby said. She said the government would not deport anyone to Iraq before June 27 and that at least 50 people have filed motions to reopen their individual cases in immigration court, which could delay any deportations. ICE has said that people with convictions for murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, burglary and drugs and weapons charges were among the 199 Iraqis arrested in their operations nationwide. Goldsmith did not say when he would issue a ruling in the case. The ICE arrests, many of them carried out on June 11 and 12, surprised and shocked the close knit Iraqi community in Michigan. Many of those arrested have been transported to detention facilities in Youngstown, Ohio and other states. Some Kurdish Iraqis were also picked up in Nashville, Tennessee, but they are not covered by the current class action, said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney arguing the case.  There's absolutely no question the government can't deport somebody to be tortured,  Gelernt argued in court.  What they're challenging are the current conditions in Iraq. Through no fault of their own, they're still here. Iraq wouldn't take them back. Now the government wants to send them back,  he said. Six Michigan lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives, five Democrats and one Republican, sent a letter urging the Department of Homeland Security to hold off on the removals until Congress can review the agreement between the United States and Iraq and be given assurances about the deportees' safety. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the courthouse waving American flags and holding red crosses and signs with slogans like  Deportation is a sentence to death.  In the 2016 election, Trump won in Michigan's Macomb County north of Detroit where many Iraqi Chaldeans live. Shantal Hanna, a 24-year-old Trump supporter whose husband Maher, 40, was detained by ICE, said she voted for the president in part because he had promised to protect Christian minorities in Iraq. Hanna said her husband of three years, who owns a valet car service, was arrested more than a decade ago on a drug possession charge and had been ordered deported. She held a sign with the photo of Trump being blessed by a Chaldean priest on the campaign trail in Michigan with the words  You vowed to protect us.

The new deal, which goes until 2024, comes a week after longtime Olympics sponsor McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) bowed out of its sponsorship deal three years early, citing a change in the company's priorities as it tries to hold down costs. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but IOC sources have previously told Reuters that major sponsors pay about $100 million per four-year cycle, which includes one summer and one winter games. The IOC has been looking to increase the cost of those deals, sources previously said. Intel joins about a dozen global Olympics sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Samsung (005930.KS) and most recently, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA.N) which signed on six months ago. The IOC has been trying to make the Olympics more technologically savvy and appeal to younger people through its internet-based TV network, the Olympic Channel. IOC President Thomas Bach and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said Intel's sponsorship will open up new experiences for athletes, fans and spectators in emerging areas such as virtual reality.  We'll allow people online to feel like they are there,  Krzanich said, speaking at a press conference in New York. Intel said it would provide 5G wireless technology, virtual reality, artificial intelligence platforms, and drones that could be used in aerial filming or light shows.  Intel's business has undergone big changes in recent years. In March, it agreed to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye (MBLY.N) for $15 billion in a bid to expand its reach beyond its core microprocessor business, which has faced declines along with the personal computer market. Intel may be seeking to expand its reach in Asia, which is preparing to host three consecutive Olympic Games. Pyeongchang in South Korea is staging the 2018 winter games, Tokyo the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the 2022 Winter Olympics. The IOC is deciding between Paris and Los Angeles for the 2024 summer games. The IOC is looking to sign pricier deals while brands are trying to figure out whether exclusive Olympics sponsorship rights offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC. Timo Lumme, managing director of IOC Television and Marketing Services, said in an interview that the IOC, with 13 top sponsors, has more partners than ever before, showing that brands see  tangible returns  from investing in the games. As for the tensions in the Korean Peninsula, Lumme said that the IOC is monitoring the situation daily to see if it could effect the 2018 games.   We feel very sure and comfortable and that the Korean government will provide a safe environment for the world's athletes to meet next February,  Lumme said. Reporting by Liana B.

Christie's said the price was reached after three minutes of  spirited bidding  in its New York saleroom, online and by phone. It did not identify the buyer.  The auction house had estimated the watch and the painting, sold as one lot, would fetch up to $120,000, calling them  two of the most important historic artifacts to surface in recent years from the golden era of the Kennedy Presidency.  The Cartier tank watch, engraved on the back, was given to the then-U.S. first lady by her brother-in-law Prince Stanislaw  Stas  Radziwill, and she was photographed many times wearing it. The picture was painted by Kennedy to mark a 50-mile (80-km) hike in Palm Beach in 1963 that Radziwill and other friends of the Kennedys undertook to promote fitness.

Although Mohammed bin Salman's promotion to crown prince had long been expected among those who follow the royal family closely, the timing was a surprise and puts the kingdom's future in relatively untested hands. Mohammed bin Salman replaces his cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran security chief who led the Saudi campaign against Islamic State and al Qaeda, at a time when Riyadh faces tensions with Qatar and Iran and is locked into a war in Yemen. His appointment may make Saudi policy more hawkish against arch-rival Iran and other Gulf rivals such as Qatar, increasing volatility in an already unstable region, analysts said.  Under his watch, Saudi Arabia has developed aggressive foreign policies (Yemen, Qatar) and he has not been shy about making strong statements against Iran,  said Olivier Jakob at Switzerland-based oil consultancy Petromatrix.  It is not really a question of if, but rather of when, a new escalation with Iran starts.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who last month made Saudi Arabia his first foreign stop since his election, telephoned Mohammed bin Salman to congratulate him on his promotion.  The two leaders discussed the priority of cutting off all support for terrorists and extremists, as well as how to resolve the ongoing dispute with Qatar,  the White House said in a statement, adding they also discussed efforts to achieve a lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani congratulated Prince Mohammed, in a conciliatory gesture to Riyadh after it joined other Arab states in imposing sanctions on Qatar over  its alleged support for terrorism.  His Highness (Sheikh Tamim) wished him success ... for the good of the kingdom under the wise leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques,  Sheikh Tamim said in a message to Prince Mohammed, Qatar state news agency QNA reported.   British Prime Minister Theresa May also welcomed Prince Mohammed's appointment.  Iran, Saudi Arabia's main rival for regional influence, called Prince Mohammed's appointment a  soft coup . Its leadership was critical of comments he made last month that the  battle  should be taken into Iran, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei labeling Saudi leaders as  idiots . Iran, which is predominantly Shi'ite Muslim, and Saudi Arabia, which is mostly Sunni, compete for power and influence across the region. The two countries support opposite sides in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Related CoverageQatar's emir congratulates Saudi crown prince on his promotion: agencyAlwaleed bin Talal pledges loyalty to new Saudi Crown Prince: Twitter accountTrump, Saudi crown prince discuss Qatar, terror financing in callAnalysts said the prince's rapid rise has created friction within the ruling family, however, and made Saudi policy less predictable than in recent decades. Saudi royal family: tmsnrt.rs/2rVcsD4 Favorite Son The reshuffle sparked speculation on Twitter about a possible future abdication by the octogenarian King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in favor of his son, whose youth and dynamism have appealed to younger Saudis who make up the majority in society and are often eager for change. After decades in which the same small group of princes handled Saudi affairs on the world stage, Prince Mohammed has led diplomacy with global powers, reportedly charming both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He was appointed crown prince and deputy prime minister by royal decree, but he retains the defense portfolio and still controls oil and economic policies.  Mohammed bin Nayef, Salman's nephew and a counter-terrorism chief, who has been admired in Washington for crushing an al Qaeda bombing campaign in 2003-2006, was relieved of his posts, the decree said. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sits during an allegiance pledging ceremony in Mecca, Saudi Arabia June 21, 2017. Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERSThe decision by King Salman to promote his son and consolidate his power was endorsed by 31 of 34 members of the Allegiance Council, made up of senior members of the ruling Al Saud family, the decree said.  In a ceremony at a al-Safa palace in the Muslim holy city of Mecca late on Wednesday night, Saudi state television showed royal family members, clerics and officials queue to shake hands with the young prince or kiss his shoulder.  We must hand in hand ... behind our leadership which we pray to God for it to be a wise one,  Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz Al al-Sheikh said, opening the pledging ceremony.  By God's book (the Koran) and the laws of His Messenger, I pledge allegiance.   Intent on dispelling speculation of internal divisions in the ruling dynasty, Saudi television repeatedly aired footage of Mohammed bin Nayef pledging allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman, who knelt and kissed his older cousin's hand, saying,  We will not give up taking your guidance and advice.  No Power Struggle Analysts said the change reduces uncertainty over succession and is expected to empower Mohammed bin Salman to move faster with his plan to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil, which includes the partial privatization of state oil company Aramco.  The change is a huge boost to the economic reform program ... Prince Mohammed bin Salman is its architect,  said John Sfakianakis, director of the Gulf Research Centre. Slideshow (9 Images)Bernard Haykel, professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton, said the king's decision was aimed at avoiding a power struggle between his son and Mohammed bin Nayef.  It's clearly a transition that has happened smoothly and bloodlessly. Now it's clear, it's straightforward. That kind of clarity lowers the risk. There's no question as to who's going to be in charge.      Saudi Arabia's stock market surged after the announcement, closing more than 5 percent up on the day. Arab leaders, including Oman’s Sultan Qaboos, Jordan’s King Abdullah and Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan congratulated Prince Mohammed on his appointment, state media said.     The royal decree did not nominate a new deputy crown prince, a post relatively new in Saudi Arabia, where kings have traditionally chosen their own successors. In an apparent attempt to appease the family, the decree had a clause that made clear that Mohammed bin Salman will not be allowed to appoint one of his own sons as his successor.  It also appointed young princes from other branches of the family to government roles, seemingly to reassure them that they will remain part of the ruling structure.  As deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman has been  responsible for running Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, dictating an energy policy with global implications and spearheading plans for the kingdom to build an economic future after oil.      Power Behind the Throne  Until his father became Saudi Arabia's seventh king in January 2015, few people outside the kingdom had heard of Prince Mohammed. As defense minister, he commands one of the world's biggest arms budgets and is ultimately responsible for Saudi Arabia's military adventure in Yemen.     Prince Mohammed chairs the supreme board of Aramco, making him the first royal family member to directly oversee the state oil company, long seen as the preserve of commoner technocrats.     But perhaps most importantly, he is the gatekeeper to his father, King Salman, who in Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy retains the final say in any major decision of state.     Outside Saudi Arabia, that rapid rise and the sudden changes to longstanding policies on regional affairs, energy and its economy have prompted unease, adding an unpredictable edge to a kingdom that allies long regarded as a known quantity.     Inside, they have prompted admiration among many younger Saudis who regard his ascent as evidence that their generation is taking a central place in running a country whose patriarchal traditions have for decades made power the province of the old.

Dominique Heaggan-Brown, who is also black, was charged with first-degree reckless homicide in the death of Sylville Smith, 23, following a foot chase that was captured on a police body camera.  People were heard in a courtroom video stream crying and yelling after Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Conen read the jury's verdict.  Heaggan-Brown was fired from the police force in October over unrelated sexual assault charges. He was charged with assaulting a man a day after he fatally shot Smith. The former cop was also charged with having sex with prostitutes and sexually assaulting another person between December 2015 and July 2016, court records said.  This guy is somebody we now know was engaged in all sorts of criminal conduct, shouldn’t have been there,  the Smith family attorney, David Owens, told reporters after the verdict.   The department knew about it, but they don't care because they defend officers with impunity and that is what allows them to kill and shoot first and ask questions later.   Heaggan-Brown's attorney Jonathan Smith, said by telephone that no officer wants to use deadly force, but his client did what he was trained to do.   He acted consistent with his training. We are certainly gratified that the jury agreed with that,  he said. Michael Crivello, President of the Milwaukee Police Association, the city's police union, also welcomed the jury's decision.  Police said Smith was armed and ignored commands to drop his gun. After Smith was shot, the resulting violence during protests left businesses burned, police cars damaged and officers injured.  Heaggan-Brown was acquitted less than a week after a Minnesota police officer was found not guilty of shooting a black motorist in a suburb of St. Paul.  Milwaukee District Attorney John Chisholm told reporters he respected the jury's decision and the body camera that provided footage of the shooting was itself a step towards greater police accountability.

In a coordinated sweep in recent weeks, immigration authorities moved to detain Iraqi immigrants around the country who had final deportation orders and convictions for serious crimes. The roundup followed Iraq's agreement to accept deportees, as part of a deal that removed the country from President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban signed in March.  Some of those affected came to the United States as children and committed their crimes decades ago, but they had been allowed to stay because Iraq previously declined to issue travel documents for them. That changed after the two governments came to an agreement on March 12. The class action lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, asks the court to issue an emergency halt to the planned removals, arguing that many of those affected in Michigan are Chaldean Catholics, who are  widely recognized as targets of brutal persecution in Iraq.   The ACLU argues that deporting the Iraqis could violate the United Nations Convention Against Torture, an international human rights treaty adopted by the United States. The U.S. government says the district court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and that the immigrants can appeal their claims in immigration court.  Jennifer Newby, the Justice Department attorney at Wednesday's hearing before U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith in Detroit, said the people arrested had known about their deportation orders and should have had time to seek legal remedies.  They waited until removal was imminent to ask for injunctive relief, thereby creating their own emergencies,  Newby said. She said the government would not deport anyone to Iraq before June 27 and that at least 50 people have filed motions to reopen their individual cases in immigration court, which could delay any deportations. ICE has said that people with convictions for murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, burglary and drugs and weapons charges were  Protesters rally outside the federal court just before a hearing to consider a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Iraqi nationals facing deportation, in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., June 21, 2017.Rebecca Cookamong the 199 Iraqis arrested in their operations nationwide. Goldsmith did not say when he would issue a ruling in the case. The ICE arrests, many of them carried out on June 11 and 12, surprised and shocked the close knit Iraqi community in Michigan. Many of those arrested have been transported to detention facilities in Youngstown, Ohio and other states.  Some Kurdish Iraqis were also picked up in Nashville, Tennessee, but they are not covered by the current class action, said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney arguing the case. Slideshow (5 Images) There's absolutely no question the government can't deport somebody to be tortured,  Gelernt argued in court.  What they're challenging are the current conditions in Iraq. Through no fault of their own, they're still here. Iraq wouldn't take them back. Now the government wants to send them back,  he said. Six Michigan lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives, five Democrats and one Republican, sent a letter urging the Department of Homeland Security to hold off on the removals until Congress can review the agreement between the United States and Iraq and be given assurances about the deportees' safety. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the courthouse waving American flags and holding red crosses and signs with slogans like  Deportation is a sentence to death.  In the 2016 election, Trump won in Michigan's Macomb County north of Detroit where many Iraqi Chaldeans live. Shantal Hanna, a 24-year-old Trump supporter whose husband Maher, 40, was detained by ICE, said she voted for the president in part because he had promised to protect Christian minorities in Iraq. Hanna said her husband of three years, who owns a valet car service, was arrested more than a decade ago on a drug possession charge and had been ordered deported. She held a sign with the photo of Trump being blessed by a Chaldean priest on the campaign trail in Michigan with the words  You vowed to protect us.

Daniel, who was 30 when he died, was a father of three young boys: Dylan, Landon and Gavin.  I got the call laying on the beach,  Weidle, 58, said.  Worst day of my life.  Weidle, a sand and gravel contractor in Montgomery County, Ohio, said he could never have imagined his son becoming a statistic in the United States' growing opioid crisis.  I have all kinds of emotions,  he said.  One day it's outrage, one day I'm infuriated, and one day I'm in disbelief.  Opioid drugs, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An estimated 800 people in Montgomery County will die this year from drug overdose, more than double the 370 overdose deaths the county recorded last year, giving it the unfortunate distinction of logging the most overdose deaths in the country per capita, according to the county's coroner's office.  If we stay on this pace, we could quadruple our deaths from last year,  Mike Brem, captain of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office, said.

Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The agency says illegally manufactured non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, and related overdoses, are a rising problem. In May, the state of Ohio sued five major drug manufacturers, accusing them of misrepresenting the risks of prescription opioid painkillers. The county morgue is at  full capacity all the time,  Ken Betz, director of the coroner's office, said.  We can average almost 10 bodies per day in our facility where, historically, five bodies a day was a busy day,  Betz said.  Our staff is just plain tired.  We've never experienced this level of daily drug overdoses in my entire career,  he added. Weidle continues to fight on behalf of Daniel, advocating for stricter laws to curb opioid deaths.  He always loved to put his arm around you, always had a smile on his face,  Weidle said.  People who looked a little desperate, a little down and out ... he would go friend them.

The new deal, which goes until 2024, comes a week after longtime Olympics sponsor McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) bowed out of its sponsorship deal three years early, citing a change in the company's priorities as it tries to hold down costs. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but IOC sources have previously told Reuters that major sponsors pay about $100 million per four-year cycle, which includes one summer and one winter games. The IOC has been looking to increase the cost of those deals, sources previously said. Intel joins about a dozen global Olympics sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Samsung (005930.KS) and most recently, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA.N) which signed on six months ago. The IOC has been trying to make the Olympics more technologically savvy and appeal to younger people through its internet-based TV network, the Olympic Channel. IOC President Thomas Bach and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said Intel's sponsorship will open up new experiences for athletes, fans and spectators in emerging areas such as virtual reality.  We'll allow people online to feel like they are there,  Krzanich said, speaking at a press conference in New York. Intel said it would provide 5G wireless technology, virtual reality, artificial intelligence platforms, and drones that could be used in aerial filming or light shows.  Intel's business has undergone big changes in recent years. In March, it agreed to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye (MBLY.N) for $15 billion in a bid to expand its reach beyond its core microprocessor business, which has faced declines along with the personal computer market. Intel may be seeking to expand its reach in Asia, which is preparing to host three consecutive Olympic Games. Pyeongchang in South Korea is staging the 2018 winter games, Tokyo the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the 2022 Winter Olympics. The IOC is deciding between Paris and Los Angeles for the 2024 summer games. The IOC is looking to sign pricier deals while brands are trying to figure out whether exclusive Olympics sponsorship rights offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC. Timo Lumme, managing director of IOC Television and Marketing Services, said in an interview that the IOC, with 13 top sponsors, has more partners than ever before, showing that brands see  tangible returns  from investing in the games. As for the tensions in the Korean Peninsula, Lumme said that the IOC is monitoring the situation daily to see if it could effect the 2018 games.   We feel very sure and comfortable and that the Korean government will provide a safe environment for the world's athletes to meet next February,  Lumme said. Reporting by Liana B.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said last week that the MTA should withhold payments to Amtrak to make up for the alternate services MTA must provide during shutdowns from July 10 through Sept. 1.     NJ Transit officials have also said they may seek reimbursements from Amtrak. Over the last 20 years, Amtrak has paid the most for capital improvements at Penn Station while running the fewest trains, Moorman's letter said. Amtrak invested nearly $470 million, or 69 percent of the total, while accounting for just 20 percent of train movements through the station, it said. The LIRR invested 26 percent, or $179 million, while comprising 45 percent of trains, and NJ Transit put in about 5 percent, or $32 million, for about 35 percent of all trains, Amtrak said. Moorman also said Amtrak would be hit hardest by its own repair program, with 31 percent of its rush-hour, peak-direction trains affected versus 19 and 21 percent for LIRR and NJ Transit, respectively.  Insufficient investment by all parties over the past four decades, during which commuter train operations have doubled, means passengers and trains now exceed capacity even under the most optimal conditions,  Moorman wrote.

Many funds use the MSCI benchmark stock and bond markets indices as guides for allocating investments into emerging markets.  Argentina's benchmark Merval stock index .MERV rose nearly 25 percent in 2017 as traders bet on the inclusion of the country's stocks in the benchmark index, a move which could have triggered close to $2 billion in additional capital inflows.  The decision was also a blow to Argentine companies hoping for more liquidity in their equities market to raise funds.  The real damage that the MSCI's decision may cause is the delay of IPOs and investments,  said Fausto Spotorno, economist at Buenos Aires consultancy Orlando Ferreres.  The Merval index slumped 4.8 percent on Wednesday, its steepest drop this year, while the Argentine peso currency ARS=RASL fell as much as 2.0 percent to a record low 16.48 per U.S. dollar. President Macri declared Argentina open for business after a decade of interventionist rule scared away foreign investors but progress has been uneven since he took office 18 months ago.  MSCI's decision underlined how Macri has struggled to lure private investments crucial to boosting a sluggish economy and to pass market-friendly legislation which has stalled in the opposition-controlled congress.  Key among those bills is a capital markets reform which the administration proposed last year and which would undo measures allowing the market regulator wide leeway to intervene in company affairs.  People cross the street as a plane flies over the city in the financial district in Buenos Aires, Argentina, June 21, 2017.Marcos BrindicciThe legislation would also allow licensed wealth managers to invest Argentine citizens' funds in overseas assets, as well as lowering some taxes.   The local market is still hard to access,  said Asha Mehta, senior portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management in Boston.  It's costly. I consider the capital gains tax environment in Argentina to be prohibitive.    'Irreversible'? Slideshow (9 Images)Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo has said Congress could approve the reform this year, and local media have reported that the CNV securities regulator is mulling a decree that would accomplish some of the reform's aims. A spokeswomen for the CNV said she had no information about a possible decree. Shortly after taking office in December 2015, Macri got rid of the most glaring distortions put in place by his populist predecessor Cristina Fernandez, including capital controls and foreign exchange restrictions. The capital controls were cited by MSCI in 2009 as the reason for downgrading Argentina to  frontier  market status in the first place.  A surprise $2.75 billion sale of 100-year bonds on Monday, which was more than three times oversubscribed, reflected improving investor confidence in Macri, but foreign direct investment has been slower to come, with many eyeing midterm elections in October and a presidential vote in 2019 for signs of the longevity of Macri's reforms. Similarly, MSCI said it needed more signs that the changes were  irreversible  to reincorporate the country's shares into its emerging markets index .MSCIEF, which guides major developing country stock allocations worldwide by investment funds. Still, investors said the MSCI decision did not change fundamental optimism about Argentina, where the economy is expected to grow around 3.0 percent this year after falling 2.3 percent in 2016, and inflation is seen at half last year's 40 percent.  Data published on Wednesday afternoon showed the Argentine economy grew 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period the prior year, snapping three straight quarters of year-on-year declines.  It probably makes us a bit more negative in the very short term, but in the long term what we're focused on is the direction of the reforms,  said Leigh Innes, lead portfolio specialist for frontier markets strategy at T Rowe Price.

It was Washington's strongest language yet on a dispute that erupted after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and transport links to isolate Qatar. The Arab countries accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional instability or cosying up to their enemy Iran. Qatar has denied the accusations.  We understand a list of demands has been prepared and coordinated by the Saudis, Emiratis, Egyptians and Bahrainis,  the Tillerson statement said.  We hope the list ... will soon be presented to Qatar and will be reasonable and actionable.  Tillerson also said the United States backs a Kuwaiti mediation effort aimed at resolving the crisis. Asked about the Qatar issue at a later news conference, Tillerson said the United States wanted to achieve unity among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries so that they can focus on the fight against Islamic State militants across the region.  Our role has been to encourage the parties to get their issues on the table, clearly articulated, so that those issues can be addressed and some resolution process can get under way to bring this to a conclusion,  Tillerson said.

Hyeon Soo Lim, who served at one of the largest churches in Canada, was sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 for what North Korea says was an attempt to overthrow the regime. Family spokeswoman Lisa Pak said Lim's family wants to see a more aggressive approach from the Canadian government following the death of American university student Otto Warmbier earlier this week, days after he was released from captivity in North Korea in a coma.  The family is very concerned at this point,  said Pak.  They are hoping the Canadian government will turn (efforts) up a few notches in terms of active diplomacy and really start engaging.  Pak said there have been no substantial developments in the case since December 2016 when Canadian officials visited Lim. The family spoke with Canadian officials this week, who promised something different would be done, though they did not provide details, she said. While a lower-key approach had seemed appropriate given the sensitive nature of the situation, Warmbier's death has changed that, Pak said.  The countries who have detainees in North Korea have an option now and they really need to take full advantage of it to get the other people who are still alive back home to their families.  In addition to Canada's Lim, North Korea is holding three Americans. A spokeswoman for Global Affairs Canada, the government's foreign affairs department, said the case is  absolutely a priority .  The government of Canada is very concerned about the health, well-being, and continued detention of Mr. Lim,  spokeswoman Jocelyn Sweet said.  We have been actively engaged on this difficult case and consular officials are ‎working actively to secure Mr. Lim's release.   The Swedish ambassador visited Lim earlier this year and told the family he was in decent health at the time, Pak said. Lim's Toronto-area church has said Lim visited North Korea more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spends eight hours a day digging holes at a labor camp where he has not seen any other prisoners.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index inched down 1.07 points, or 0.01 percent, to close at 15,148.53. The dip left the index stuck below its 200-day moving average, which is widely seen as a bearish signal.  You could see some more downside on the TSX as long as energy prices keep going down,  said Luciano Orengo, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. U.S. crude oil futures settled 2.3 percent lower at $42.53 a barrel after hitting a 10-month low in volatile trade, as concerns mounted over a global supply glut. Oil prices have fallen more than 20 percent from their January peak, indicating a bear market. Cenovus Energy shares fell 3.2 percent to C$9.14 a day after being battered by news the company would replace its chief executive and sell some assets. Encana Corp shed 3.8 percent to C$10.72, while the overall energy group lost 0.5 percent. The drop in oil prices has reduced inflation prospects, contributing to a recent flattening in the yield curve, which tends to compress net interest margins for banks. The spread between Canada's 2- and 10-year yields narrowed by 0.9 basis point to a spread of 58.1 basis points, its narrowest gap since last October, as longer-dated bonds outperformed. The financials group, which makes up roughly a third of the index's weight, also retreated 0.5 percent. Manulife Financial Corp fell 2.1 percent to C$23.76 and Bank of Montreal retreated 0.9 percent to C$92.48. Investors may also worry about how a drop in oil prices will impact loans to the energy sector.  It is a confluence of many things that put a lid on financial stock prices,  Orengo said. Just four of the index's 10 main sector groups ended lower. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners as well as fertilizer and lumber companies, added 1.5 percent. Goldcorp Inc rose 3.1 percent to C$17.85 and Barrick Gold Corp gained 1.4 percent to C$20.96, while Teck Resources added 2.5 percent to trade at C$20.37.

Tillerson's comments came in a short statement a day after the State Department bluntly questioned the motives of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in announcing their boycott of Qatar on June 5, saying it was  mystified  the Gulf states had not released their grievances. It was Washington's strongest language yet on a dispute that erupted after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and transport links to isolate Qatar. The Arab countries accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional instability or cosying up to their enemy Iran. Qatar has denied the accusations.  We understand a list of demands has been prepared and coordinated by the Saudis, Emiratis, Egyptians and Bahrainis,  the Tillerson statement said.  We hope the list ... will soon be presented to Qatar and will be reasonable and actionable.  Tillerson also said the United States backs a Kuwaiti mediation effort aimed at resolving the crisis. Asked about the Qatar issue at a later news conference, Tillerson said the United States wanted to achieve unity among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries so that they can focus on the fight against Islamic State militants across the region.  Our role has been to encourage the parties to get their issues on the table, clearly articulated, so that those issues can be addressed and some resolution process can get under way to bring this to a conclusion,  Tillerson said. Qatar hosts a vital U.S. military base, Al Udeid, to which more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces are deployed or assigned and from which more than 100 aircraft operate. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a tough stance on Qatar, accusing it of being a  high level  sponsor of terrorism, but he has also offered help to the parties in the dispute to resolve their differences.

A new UK study find that companies with leaders who show “psychopathic characteristics” destroy shareholder value, tending to have poor future returns on equity. (here) This, coming just a year after a study finding better operating results at companies with nice leaders, suggests there may be a viable investment strategy in buying the one and betting against the other. (here) Let’s talk about the bad apples first; they are always so much more interesting. Psychopathy is a disorder characterized by antisocial actions, excessive risk taking, egotism and a lack of empathy and remorse. Sound like any successful CEOs you know? The UK study doesn’t seek to identify psychopaths per se, but, examining senior management and company characteristics as a whole, uses a series of markers which the authors believe are highly correlated with there being psychopaths in control. “For 4 out of the 5 proxies (for psychopathy) considered the relationship with returns is statistically significant. Such results imply that managerial psychopathic behavior is an ominous sign of shareholder wealth destruction,” Tomasz Wisniewski of the University of Leicester, and Liafisu Yekini and Ayman Omar of Coventry University write. The study measures the extent to which company annual reports use words which are aggressive, use self-absorbed language or show a tendency to blame others, all traits they theorize reveal psychopathic tendencies. As psychopaths break rules, they also measure how often companies are caught out in accounting troubles. As they are thrill seekers, the study looks at a measure of idiosyncratic company risk, and as psychopaths lack empathy, the study looks at corporate charitable donations. The upshot is though psychopaths may have some advantage in climbing the corporate ladder, once at the top they do shareholders no favors. Having psychopaths in the executive suite now points to poor returns in a year’s time, according to the study. Psychopathic behavior in the executive suite may not be a small or isolated problem. A 2011 study of Australian white-collar managers found that 5.76 percent could be classed psychopathic and another 10.42 percent dysfunctional with psychopathic characteristics. “Overall, the reading of the literature reveals that the concentration of psychopaths tends to be particularly high in prisons and boardrooms,” the authors write. Nice People Do Finish First All of this accords well with the study last year from academics at Harvard, the University of Chicago and Stanford, which found that CEOs who score well for “agreeableness” are associated with companies which show better operating results. Nice people, it seems, have a hard time getting ahead but do good work for those who employ them when they do. That study looked at the language executives used in conference calls with analysts, which being unscripted are perhaps more revealing, and then mapped them to the five major personality traits of agreeableness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion and openness. In terms of who gets to be a CEO it is not surprising that the group showed low levels of neuroticism, which is associated with emotional instability, anxiety and hostility. While the mean scores for the other four traits were all more than three times higher than for neuroticism, it is striking that agreeableness was the fourth highest, with conscientiousness the highest. In other words, among personality trait holders only fretful neurotics are less likely to find themselves in the C-suite than nice people. “There is a robust negative association between extraversion and return on assets and cash flow. Similarly, openness is negatively associated with profitability,” Ian Gow of Harvard University, Steven Kaplan and Anastasia Zakolyukina of the University of Chicago and David Larcker of Stanford University write. As for agreeable CEOs, they tend to spend less on R&D; but have far and away the strongest positive correlation to return on assets, both in current and future terms. Earlier research has posited that agreeable CEOs do well by encouraging cooperation and less hierarchical structures and cultures. While that might make a company less “results-orientated” it also might make it better able to make good medium- and long-term investment decisions. Less agreeable CEOs are more likely to be found at firms which are innovative and take on more risk via the use of borrowed money. In part, we may be seeing an illustration of the truism that a small growing company needs a different kind of leader than an established one. A remorseless psychopath is no-one’s idea of a good leader, while having nice people in charge is not simply a matter of preference. Investors, and companies, should work harder to weed out the one and promote the other. Editing by James Dalgleish","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-saft-idUSKBN19C2Y0"},

The company, Det Norske Veritas Inc, was to produce a risk analysis by the end of June on Enbridge's 540,000 barrel per day Line 5 pipeline, which travels underwater through the Straits of Mackinac. That report will no longer be delivered, said Melody Kindraka, a public information officer with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Det Norske Veritas did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the issue. The state said it came to light after Det Norske Veritas informed officials that an employee who worked on the Line 5 risk analysis subsequently worked on another project for Enbridge while the risk analysis was still being finished. This violated conflict of interest clauses in the contract.  Our trust was violated and we now find ourselves without a key piece needed to fully evaluate the financial risks associated with the pipeline that runs through our Great Lakes, this is unacceptable,  Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said in a statement.  Terminating the contract is the only option we have to maintain the integrity of the risk analysis.  The 64-year-old Line 5 pipeline running under the Straits of Mackinac has become the subject of fierce environmental opposition in Michigan because of fears the aging infrastructure could leak crude oil into the Great Lakes. It is a key part of Enbridge's Mainline system, which delivers the bulk of Canadian crude imports to the United States. In 2016 state officials ordered two independent reports into the pipeline, one looking at the risks of a spill and the other assessing potential alternatives to the underwater crossing in the Straits of Mackinac. Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said the company supported the state's actions and was disappointed by the developments. Kindraka said the state is reassessing its plans on how to move forward with a risk assessment but the report on alternatives to the pipeline from another firm, Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems, will be presented to the public on July 6. So far Det Norske Veritas has not received any payment for its work and the state is reviewing the payment terms of the contract, she added.

Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill granted a request from several media companies to reveal the jurors' identities, which were kept secret during the trial due to its extraordinary publicity. O'Neill said he would instruct each juror not to discuss anything their fellow jurors said or any votes for conviction or acquittal other jurors made during six days of deliberations. The names of the jurors were emailed by the court to media organizations. Cosby, 79, is facing a second trial for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home near Philadelphia in 2004. The case is the only criminal prosecution to emerge from dozens of similar allegations against the entertainer and comedian. Both prosecutors and defense lawyers had urged O'Neill not to disclose the jurors' names, arguing that news coverage of their deliberations could have an effect potential jurors for the retrial, making it more difficult to find an unbiased panel. Thus far, only a single alternate juror, one of six who heard the evidence but did not participate in deliberations, has spoken out, telling a Pittsburgh radio station he would have voted to convict Cosby. Without more details from jurors, it may be impossible to determine why the jury was unable to come to a consensus despite 52 hours of deliberations, longer than the trial itself. Jurors asked to rehear lengthy excerpts of trial testimony but eventually told O'Neill they were hopelessly deadlocked. O'Neill did not ask the 12 jurors how they were split. The original jury was already brought across the state from Pittsburgh to Montgomery County out of concern about the amount of pretrial publicity the case generated.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/people-cosby-idUSL1N1JI1ZO"},

July hogs finished 1.075 cents higher at 86.075 cents per pound, rising to a session and contract high of 86.400 cents shortly after the U.S. Department of Agriculture at late morning showed sharply higher wholesale pork prices. Most-active August hog futures        settled up 0.575 cent at 82.225 cents     USDA said pork prices were up $2.24 to $101.09 per cwt, the highest since October 2014. Pork bellies surged $5.22 to $185.83 per cwt, the highest since April 2014. Cash hog prices edged lower in Iowa and southern Minnesota, USDA said.                        Extremely strong pork demand remains the big hog market story and demand is generally more difficult to gauge than supply, which makes it a bit harder to project where and when prices will top out,  brokerage Brock and Associates said in a note to clients.           LIVE CATTLE LOWER, FEEDERS HIGHER     CME August live cattle        eased 0.550 cent to 115.350 cents per pound, holding above Tuesday's nearly two-month low of 113.650 cents. August feeder cattle futures        were up 0.725 cents at 144.050 cents per pound.     Cattle prices had bounced from Tuesday's lows, and some analysts thought the market had reached a short-term bottom following more than a week of declines. However, cash cattle prices continued to weaken, weighing on futures.     Feedlots in Texas sold cattle on Thursday at about $122 per cwt and in Kansas at $123, sales that were down $8-$9 from a week ago.               I wonder if this is a dead-cat bounce,  Zaner Ag Hedge senior market strategist Ted Seifried said, adding that the poor recovery could spell lower cattle prices ahead.     Analysts predicted that USDA in a monthly Cattle on Feed report on Friday would show 2.085 million cattle placed on feed in May, up 10.4 percent from the same time in 2016. More cattle placed in feedlots increase the number of fattened animals available for beef packers later in the year.                  A few analysts expected the USDA in a monthly Cold Storage report on Thursday to show total beef stocks in May at 438.6 million pounds and 572.0 million pounds for pork.

MSCI said it needed more signs that center-right President Mauricio Macri's pro-market reforms were  irreversible  to reincorporate the country's shares into its Emerging Markets Index.     Macri has repealed the capital controls and foreign exchange restrictions that drove MSCI to downgrade Latin America's No. 3 economy to  frontier  status.     Argentina's benchmark Merval stock index fell nearly 5 percent, its biggest daily decline since January 15. Shares of Pampa Energia SA led the losses, dropping 8.35 percent.     The index had risen nearly 25 percent in 2017 as traders anticipated increased inflows from funds tracking the MSCI index. As those expectations faded, the peso weakened as much as 1 percent to a record low before recovering slightly.      There is no longer any rush for passive funds to get in, and those who have been buying in advance of an expected reclassification will probably now look to take some money off the table,  strategists at Itaú BBA wrote in a note to clients.     However,  we still have a positive view of the current domestic dynamics in Argentina, both political and economic.      Trading in other Latin American markets was skittish, tracking volatility in commodity prices.     The Mexican peso weakened by 0.1 percent, adding to a sharp decline on Tuesday, with falling crude prices pressuring the currency. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index edged down 0.01 percent, while shares of miner Vale SA tracked iron ore higher.     Shares of meatpacker Minerva SA fell 1.6 percent after Reuters reported a judge blocked the $300 million purchase of JBS SA's South American assets. Shares of JBS rose 5.32 percent.

The Bank of Canada's top two officials said last week that rate cuts put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates need to be kept at near-record lows.                  But with the price of oil, a main Canadian export, hitting a 10-month low, having dropped some 20 percent since peaking in late February, some currency strategists said it was wiping out expectations the central bank could raise rates sooner rather than later.      It's really changed the tone that we saw over the last couple of weeks where we saw the loonie rising on the basis of strong economic fundamentals,  said Rahim Madhavji, president at KnightsbridgeFX.com, who is expecting the Canadian dollar to struggle over the next couple of quarters.      I think the rosiness of the loonie is gone ... It's back to grinding lower.      At 4:00 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3318 to the greenback, or 75.09 U.S. cents, down 0.4 percent.     The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3263, while it touched its weakest in 1-1/2 weeks at C$1.3348.     U.S. crude        prices were down 2.3 percent to $42.51 a barrel as growing U.S. production and reduced Chinese refinery activity fed mounting concern over excess global supply.           Canadian government bond prices were mostly higher across the yield curve, with the two-year            up half a Canadian cent to yield 0.908 percent and the 10-year             rising 10 Canadian cents to yield 1.489 percent.     The Bank of Canada's auction of C$3 billion 10-year bonds on behalf of the federal government yielded an average 1.504 percent.     Canadian retail sales data for April is due out on Thursday, while inflation data for May is due on Friday         .

Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill granted a request from several media companies to reveal the jurors' identities, which were kept secret during the trial due to its extraordinary publicity. O'Neill said he would instruct each juror not to discuss anything their fellow jurors said or any votes for conviction or acquittal other jurors made during six days of deliberations. The names of the jurors were emailed by the court to media organizations. Cosby, 79, is facing a second trial for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his home near Philadelphia in 2004. The case is the only criminal prosecution to emerge from dozens of similar allegations against the entertainer and comedian. Both prosecutors and defense lawyers had urged O'Neill not to disclose the jurors' names, arguing that news coverage of their deliberations could have an effect potential jurors for the retrial, making it more difficult to find an unbiased panel. Thus far, only a single alternate juror, one of six who heard the evidence but did not participate in deliberations, has spoken out, telling a Pittsburgh radio station he would have voted to convict Cosby. Without more details from jurors, it may be impossible to determine why the jury was unable to come to a consensus despite 52 hours of deliberations, longer than the trial itself. Jurors asked to rehear lengthy excerpts of trial testimony but eventually told O'Neill they were hopelessly deadlocked. O'Neill did not ask the 12 jurors how they were split. The original jury was already brought across the state from Pittsburgh to Montgomery County out of concern about the amount of pretrial publicity the case generated.

Federal Judge Ricardo Leite blocked JBS's $300 million sale of the unit to rival Minerva SA (BEEF3.SA), citing a corruption scandal ensnaring JBS's controlling Batista family, court documents seen by Reuters showed on Wednesday. In a separate decision, the attorney general's office urged state auditors to freeze assets of JBS and the Batistas, who own 42 percent of JBS. The move guarantees that funds reimbursing state lender BNDES [BNDES.UL] for faulty dealings with JBS will be preserved, the attorney general's office said in a statement. Common shares in JBS surged 4.3 percent, while those of Minerva reversed early gains on the judge's decision. Minerva's stock shed 2.7 percent to 11.52 reais as of 4:20 p.m. local time (1920 GMT).  Leite, the judge, sits on the court that will review a leniency deal the Batistas reached with prosecutors, and his decision highlights the legal risks for the meatpacker and its founding family.  Last month, Prosecutor-General Rodigo Janot reached a plea agreement with billionaire brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista to avoid prosecution if they turned in 1,893 politicians involved in a bribery scheme. A separate leniency deal between the Batistas and federal prosecutors was signed on May 31, requiring the family to pay a 10.3 billion reais ($3.1 billion)fine over 25 years. The terms of the plea agreement have drawn intense scrutiny after the Batistas alleged that President Michel Temer took part in a bribery scheme, threatening to topple the president and sink his reform agenda. Leite said in his ruling that the deal to sell JBS beef plants in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay could harm the corruption investigation.

The sale process comes as Quintiles IMS seeks to prune some of its non-core businesses in the wake of the $17.6 billion merger last year that saw IMS Health Holdings Inc and Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc combine.  Contract sales organizations have been under pressure in recent years, as large pharmaceutical companies increasingly rely on their own internal salesforce. Quintiles IMS has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to carry out a sale process for the contract sales business, which is still in the early stages, four sources said, cautioning that no deal is certain. The business for sale has 12-month earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization of around $100 million, the sources said. Private equity firms have expressed interest in the auction, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Quintiles IMS, which is based in Danbury, Connecticut and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,  did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The Quintiles and IMS merger is so far proving to be a win for the combined company, which says it has added $400 million in revenues that it otherwise would not have obtained thanks to its new capabilities. Quintiles IMS now has a market capitalization of $19.4 billion. The merger was largely aimed at giving Quintiles contract research business access to IMS's rich streams of drug use data to help it better plan clinical trials and build a case for why its clients' drugs are differentiated from the competition.  The pharmaceutical outsourcing industry has been undergoing a wave of consolidation, largely driven by contract researchers, as pharmaceutical companies cut costs, reduce clinical trial times and expand their research and development presence around the world. Earlier this week, buyout firm Pamplona Capital Management agreed to buy contract researcher Parexel International Corp (PRXL.O) for around $4.5 billion. Last month, INC Research Holdings Inc (INCR.O) agreed to merge with inVentiv Health Inc in a $4.6 billion deal.

The sale process comes as Quintiles IMS seeks to prune some of its non-core businesses in the wake of the $17.6 billion merger last year that saw IMS Health Holdings Inc and Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc combine.  Contract sales organizations have been under pressure in recent years, as large pharmaceutical companies increasingly rely on their own internal salesforce. Quintiles IMS has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) to carry out a sale process for the contract sales business, which is still in the early stages, four sources said, cautioning that no deal is certain. The business for sale has 12-month earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization of around $100 million, the sources said. Private equity firms have expressed interest in the auction, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Quintiles IMS, which is based in Danbury, Connecticut and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,  did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The Quintiles and IMS merger is so far proving to be a win for the combined company, which says it has added $400 million in revenues that it otherwise would not have obtained thanks to its new capabilities. Quintiles IMS now has a market capitalization of $19.4 billion. The merger was largely aimed at giving Quintiles contract research business access to IMS's rich streams of drug use data to help it better plan clinical trials and build a case for why its clients' drugs are differentiated from the competition.  The pharmaceutical outsourcing industry has been undergoing a wave of consolidation, largely driven by contract researchers, as pharmaceutical companies cut costs, reduce clinical trial times and expand their research and development presence around the world. Earlier this week, buyout firm Pamplona Capital Management agreed to buy contract researcher Parexel International Corp (PRXL.O) for around $4.5 billion. Last month, INC Research Holdings Inc (INCR.O) agreed to merge with inVentiv Health Inc in a $4.6 billion deal.

For the study, researchers focused on adults diagnosed with the most common type of heart disease, known as atherosclerosis, which happens when fats, cholesterol and other substances build up on artery walls.  When these patients did as much as they could to avoid so-called modifiable risk factors for heart disease - inactivity, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure and diabetes - their total average annual pharmaceutical expenditures were $1,400, the study found.  But patients who did little to modify these risk factors had total average annual pharmaceutical expenditures of $4,516, researchers report in the Journal of the American Heart Association.  Individuals who are unwilling to modify their lifestyles so as to have a favorable risk factor profile would most likely resort to medications to control the risk factors,  said lead study author Dr. Joseph Salami of the Center for Health Care Advancement and Outcomes at Baptist Health South Florida in Coral Gables.  A person getting little or no exercise has a higher risk of obesity,  Salami said by email.  Someone obese is more likely to have diabetes, high blood cholesterol and hypertension.  For the study, researchers examined 2012 and 2013 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a national snapshot of spending based on surveys of almost 76,000 American patients, families, doctors and employers. The total pharmaceutical costs, reported in 2013 dollars, include patients' out-of-pocket fees like co-payments and co-insurance as well as the portion of the tab covered by insurance or other sources, Salami said. Among the survey participants, 4,248 adults aged 40 or older had atherosclerosis, representing about 21.9 million people in the U.S. population. They were 68 years old on average, and 45 percent were women. Overall, average annual drug costs for each participant were $3,432. About a third of this was for cardiovascular disease drugs and another 14 percent was spent on diabetes medicines.  The remaining expenditures - more than half of the total - were for non-cardiovascular disease and non-diabetes drugs and were significantly associated with the modifiable risk factors, the study team notes.  Nationwide, this adds up to annual drug spending of $71.6 billion for patients with atherosclerosis, researchers estimated.  One limitation of the study is that it might overestimate expenditures because it's possible some people prescribed medications for heart disease might be taking them for other reasons, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on the type of insurance patients' had or for individual characteristics of patients, doctors or pharmacists that might influence drug costs. Costs should be considered in the context of how well treatments work, and the study doesn't address this, noted Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston who wasn't involved in the study.   In some cases, the benefit that patients get from these non-pharmacologic therapies may be much more substantial than the benefit that drug therapy can offer,  Kesselheim said by email.  In other cases, the drug might be more helpful.  The study also isn't a controlled experiment designed to prove that people will spend less on drugs when they make lifestyle changes to reduce their risk of heart disease, said Julie Schmittdiel of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research in Oakland.  It does suggest there is promise that addressing modifiable health behaviors will reduce costs,  Schmittdiel, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.  Knowing this might help motivate some patients to make changes, said Stacie Dusetzina, a pharmacy researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who wasn't involved in the study.  I think many of us realize how hard these risk factors are to modify,  Dusetzina said by email.  But having incentives that include feeling better and saving money may help with motivation.

The U.S. S&P; 500 financial sector .SPSY closed down 0.8 percent while the European Stoxx Europe 600 Financial Services index .SXFP closed down 1.3 percent.  The financial sector fell as the U.S. Treasury yield curve held near 10-year lows, with European financials were punished by heavy losses from British subprime lender Provident Financial Plc (PFG.L). Flattening in the yield curve, or the narrowing in the difference between short- and long-term yields, can weigh on banks' profitability. A drop in U.S. crude prices to a 10-month low of $42.05 per barrel and a decline in benchmark Brent crude to a seven-month low of $44.35 per barrel pressured energy shares on nagging fears about global oversupply.  The U.S. Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend of weaker equity indexes, rising on gains in biotechnology stocks.   Because people are seeing oil lower as another harbinger of lower inflation, a lot of other cyclicals (besides energy stocks) aren't doing well,  said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners in Huntersville, North Carolina. The price of oil has dropped more than 20 percent so far this year, its weakest performance in the first six months since 1997.

There were 2,186 murder probes in May, the highest for any month in data going back to 1997, according to the latest government statistics. Some cases may include multiple homicides, and the number of murder victims reported in May was 2,452, the highest for any month in a separate series of data that only goes back to 2014.   The violence has contributed to a slump in the popularity of President Enrique Pena Nieto, and could undermine support for his Institutional Revolutionary Party in next year's presidential race. Mexican presidents can only serve one six-year term. Murder investigations in the first five months of the year totaled 9,916 cases, up nearly 30 percent from the same period in 2016. Discoveries of bodies tossed by the roadside, strung up on bridges as warnings to rival drug gangs, or buried in mass graves have become almost daily events in Mexico. The capture or killing of major drug bosses during the past decade led to an increase in the number of gangs fighting each other over turf and battling government forces. According to statistics from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, Mexico's murder rate in 2015 was 16.35 people per 100,000, sharply higher than the U.S. rate of 4.88 per 100,000 people, but much lower than in many countries in Central America and the Caribbean.

That was a failure of the state, local and national, to help people when they needed it most,  she told parliament on Wednesday.  As prime minister, I apologize for that failure and as prime minister, I've taken responsibility for doing what we can to put things right.  May added that those who had lost their homes would receive a downpayment from an emergency fund, and repeated a promise to rehouse all victims within three weeks. Traffic passes a new housing development in Kensington where 68 apartments will be assigned to rehouse families who lost their homes in the Grenfell Tower fire, in London, Britain, June 21, 2017.Hannah McKayCommunities minister Sajid Javid said that 68 apartments were newly built social housing in Kensington Row, where private properties can cost as much as 3.5 million pounds ($4.43 million). He added that these were the first batch of permanent new homes to rehouse residents of Grenfell Tower. Police said that 79 people were dead, or missing and assumed dead, after the blaze rapidly spread through the 24-storey block. The tragedy shone a spotlight on London's economic divide, as it happened a few hundred meters (yards) away from one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country. Slideshow (4 Images)The upmarket neighborhoods of London's Kensington district have proved hugely popular with foreign buyers in recent years, and pressure had been growing to ensure that victims of the fire were not relocated outside of the borough when many properties nearby stand empty for much of the year. Opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for government to requisition unoccupied properties in the area to rehouse residents. Properties for sale on Kensington Row are priced between 1.5 million and 3.5 million pounds, according to housebuilder Berkeley Group's website. The development is just a mile away from Grenfell Tower.  The government said that the new homes will be a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom flats across two blocks, and that developer St Edward was committing extra staff to the project to fast-track its completion.

Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley said his office filed a lawsuit in a state court in St. Louis against Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson and units of Endo International Plc. Hawley said the three companies knew their opioid products were addictive and potentially life-threatening, but  engaged in a deliberate campaign of fraud to convince Missouri doctors and consumers otherwise.   They used bogus front organizations and fake research; they used fraudulent advertising and deceptive trade practices,  Hawley said in remarks prepared for a news conference.  And they repeatedly lied about the true risks of the drugs they sold.  Hawley said the lawsuit accuses the companies of violating Missouri's consumer protection laws and its Medicaid statutes and seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and civil penalties. The case made Missouri the third state to sue drug manufacturers over their opioid marketing and sales practices. Last week a bipartisan group of state attorneys general announced an investigation.

Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. J&J;'s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit said in a statement it acted appropriately and responsibly, adding that its opioid pain medications were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and carry mandated warnings about their known risks. Purdue, which manufactures OxyContin, said it denied the allegations but shared Hawley's concerns about the opioid crisis and was  committed to working collaboratively to find solutions.  Endo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said its  top priorities include patient safety and ensuring that patients with chronic pain have access to safe and effective therapeutic options.  The FDA this month asked Endo to withdraw its long-lasting opioid painkiller Opana ER from the market. Beyond the states' cases, similar lawsuits have been filed by local governments, including two California counties; the cities of Chicago and Dayton, Ohio; three Tennessee district attorneys; and nine New York counties.

The company's shares were up 5 percent at $48.74 in after-market trading on Wednesday. Oracle said cloud-computing and on-premise software business revenue rose 5.3 percent to $8.88 billion in the fourth quarter ended May 31. The business accounted for 78 percent of total revenue in 2016. The company has been shifting to a cloud-based service as customers increasingly shun the costlier licensing model, a pattern also adopted by rivals such as Microsoft Corp, SAP SE and Amazon.com Inc. In an effort to strengthen its cloud business, Oracle signed a deal with AT&T; Inc in May, under which the U.S. telecom company agreed to move some of its large-scale databases to Oracle's cloud platform. The company had said it expected more of its  big customers  to migrate their databases and database applications to Oracle Cloud in the coming year. NetSuite, which Oracle acquired in 2016, is also expanding its data center footprint to take on nimbler rivals such as Workday Inc and Salesforce.com Inc. The company's net income rose to $3.23 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $2.81 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Oracle earned 89 cents per share. The company reported an adjusted revenue of $10.94 billion. Analysts on average had estimated a profit of 78 cents per share and a revenue of $10.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Up to Wednesday's close, Oracle's shares had risen about 20 percent this year.

Energy was the weakest S&P; sector with a 1.6 percent decline after oil prices reversed course during the morning session and U.S. crude touched its lowest point since August despite larger-than-expected declines in inventories. Continued weakness in oil futures added to investor worries about inflation and as a result hurt cyclicals such as banks and industrials, according to Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer at Cornerstone Financial Partners in Huntersville, North Carolina.  Because people are seeing oil lower as another harbinger of lower inflation, a lot of other cyclicals (besides energy stocks) aren't doing well,  said Zaccarelli. Bank stocks fell 0.8 percent as investors worried interest rate margins would be hurt by a flattening yield curve, which is also driven by inflation expectations. Industrial stocks were also among the biggest decliners with a 0.7 percent drop. Caterpillar's 3.3 percent fall weighed on the sector while a 1.6 percent rise in FedEx was its biggest boost. Investors looking for growth opportunities turned to Nasdaq, which contains many technology and biotechnology companies, according to Zaccarelli. Healthcare stocks were helped by reports that U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to rein in drug prices may be friendlier than expected to the industry, according to Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Mass. In general equity investors are biding their time ahead of quarterly results, which are expected to be good.  We're just continuing to bounce around here until second quarter earnings come out,  said McMillan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 57.11 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 21,410.03, the S&P; 500 lost 1.42 points, or 0.06 percent, dropping to 2,435.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.92 points, or 0.74 percent, rising to 6,233.95. The energy index has fallen 14.9 percent so far this year compared with an 8.9 percent rise for the S&P; 500. Oil futures have fallen about 21 percent so far this year. The four-company telecommunications sector was the second weakest with a 1.2 percent drop, with AT&T; Inc leading the percentage declines. The Nasdaq biotechnology index was up 4.1 percent, on track for its biggest one-day gain since the day after Trump's Nov. 8 election. Its biggest boosts were Celgene, and Regeneron which both rose more than 5 percent and Biogen, which rose 4.7 percent. Republicans were due to release details of a bill aimed at overhauling U.S. healthcare law on Thursday and a vote could come as soon as next week, several senators told Reuters. Republicans worked behind closed doors for weeks on the bill. If it passes, some investors see it as a positive sign for Trump's pro-business agenda Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 7.16 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with a 6.92 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The cost of market data has long been a contentious issue within the trading industry and more public information about how much exchanges earn from specific data products would help inform the debate, John Ramsay, chief market policy officer at IEX, said in a blog post. (bit.ly/2tun8uv)  IEX, which launched the Investors Exchange last August, does not charge for market data or access to its exchange. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed in 2004 making exchanges break down, item by item, their revenue from market information, including data feeds. But it never acted on the idea, said Ramsay, a former head of the regulator's trading and markets division. The SEC declined to comment.  At the time, the focus was on the public data feeds that aggregate all of the best prices and last sale information across exchanges.  Since then, automated trading strategies that rely on market data have come to dominate the market. Exchanges have responded with faster proprietary data feeds that provide more granular trading information than the slower public feeds.  Critics argue that exchanges favor the more lucrative private data feeds over the public feeds. They also say they have no way to challenge price increases from the exchanges, which create a barrier for new entrants to the industry.  Exchanges are extremely competitive businesses and market data is only one area where we compete,  said a spokesman for Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O), who pointed to a 2016 court ruling that found exchange data was fairly and competitively priced. CBOE Holdings Inc (CBOE.O) and Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) New York Stock Exchange declined to comment. Exchanges have also argued that overall costs are going up because the amount of data and data products available has exploded and that actual price increases have been minimal. Exchanges do provide information on market data revenue in financial statements, but it is not uniformly reported and is often lumped together with other services and products.  Disclosing revenue for each data product would let impartial observers evaluate how the composition of that revenue has changed over time, how the trends compare across exchanges, and whether the numbers are consistent with a well-functioning competitive market, Ramsay said.

The Washington Nationals right-hander had a no-hitter and a shutout through 7 1/3 innings, retiring 18 consecutive batters.  That was probably the best I've seen him,  Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton said.  Balls were zooming. He was mixing his speeds and angles.  Fortunately for Miami, it caught a couple of breaks and rallied to defeat Washington 2-1 on Wednesday afternoon at Marlins Park. Scherzer (8-5) had his attempt at a third career no-hitter broken up by backup catcher A.J. Ellis, who hit a comebacker for an infield single with one out in the eighth inning. Ellis, who is batting just .204, didn't hit the ball particularly hard, but the ball bounced off Scherzer's glove, and shortstop Trea Turner couldn't make the play in time.  I thought I had it,  Scherzer said.  When I looked at my glove, it was empty.  And the Marlins, suddenly, had hope.  That was the little crack left in the door for us,  Stanton said.  The best teams capitalize on those opportunities.  Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at MarlinsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchThe Marlins did just that. After Ellis, pinch-hitter J.T. Realmuto reached on a two-out fielding error credited to first baseman Adam Lind, who could not come up with Turner's low throw. A good throw or clean catch there would've ended the inning. Instead, the next batter, Dee Gordon, was hit by a pitch that struck his foot to load the bases, and Miami got on the board on a high wild pitch by Scherzer. That tying run was scored by pitcher Jose Urena, who was used as a pinch-runner for Ellis.  We've used Jose (as a pinch-runner) before,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.  It's not the best scenario to have your pitcher running because who will replace those innings if he were to go down? But you are trying to win a game.  Stanton then gave Miami the lead with an RBI single that scored Realmuto. Gordon was thrown out at the plate by left fielder Ryan Raburn to end the threat. Stanton's single was nearly caught by Raburn, who came up with the ball on a short-hop.  I got good barrel on it, and it just kept going and going,  said Stanton, who produced his eighth game-winning hit of the season.  I waited that one out, and luckily it just skipped on him.  Scherzer went eight innings and allowed two hits and two runs, both unearned. He also hit two batters. He fanned 11 batters, marking his sixth consecutive game with double-figure strikeouts, a Nationals record and a career best for Scherzer. Nationals catcher Jose Lobaton said he felt Scherzer was  running out of gas  at the end. Scherzer disagreed, saying,  I had stuff in the tank.  Dusty Baker, Washington's manager, sided with Scherzer.  He was still throwing 95, 96 (mph),  Baker said.  He looked strong. He gave up a cheap hit. It was his game. Who would you bring in who was throwing better than him?  Early on, Scherzer had two minor hiccups. Miami's Christian Yelich drew a five-pitch walk in the first inning, and Derek Dietrich was hit by a pitch in the second. After that, Scherzer retired those 18 consecutive batters. The Marlins (32-38), though, hung in and evened its season series against the Nationals, 3-3. Kyle Barraclough (3-1) earned the win in relief, and A.J. Ramos pitched a scoreless ninth for his 10th save. Washington (43-29), which completed a 4-3 road trip, scored its only run in the fifth on a solo homer by Raburn, his first long ball of the year. The homer was allowed by Miami starter Dan Straily, who was otherwise outstanding but got a no-decision. He allowed just three hits, one walk and one run in six innings, striking out six. Straily has allowed just one run in the past two games, covering 12 1/3 innings, and is 19-12 since the start of last season.  Coming into today, I was thinking it would be a tight game,  said Straily, who has 22 strikeouts and just four walks in his past four games.  Today was real close to being a special day for (Scherzer). I'm happy we were able to catch some breaks and take the win.  It just shows you how fast things can turn.

The cost of market data has long been a contentious issue within the trading industry and more public information about how much exchanges earn from specific data products would help inform the debate, John Ramsay, chief market policy officer at IEX, said in a blog post. (bit.ly/2tun8uv)  IEX, which launched the Investors Exchange last August, does not charge for market data or access to its exchange. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed in 2004 making exchanges break down, item by item, their revenue from market information, including data feeds. But it never acted on the idea, said Ramsay, a former head of the regulator's trading and markets division. The SEC declined to comment.  At the time, the focus was on the public data feeds that aggregate all of the best prices and last sale information across exchanges.  Since then, automated trading strategies that rely on market data have come to dominate the market. Exchanges have responded with faster proprietary data feeds that provide more granular trading information than the slower public feeds.  Critics argue that exchanges favor the more lucrative private data feeds over the public feeds. They also say they have no way to challenge price increases from the exchanges, which create a barrier for new entrants to the industry.  Exchanges are extremely competitive businesses and market data is only one area where we compete,  said a spokesman for Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O), who pointed to a 2016 court ruling that found exchange data was fairly and competitively priced. CBOE Holdings Inc (CBOE.O) and Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) New York Stock Exchange declined to comment. Exchanges have also argued that overall costs are going up because the amount of data and data products available has exploded and that actual price increases have been minimal. Exchanges do provide information on market data revenue in financial statements, but it is not uniformly reported and is often lumped together with other services and products.  Disclosing revenue for each data product would let impartial observers evaluate how the composition of that revenue has changed over time, how the trends compare across exchanges, and whether the numbers are consistent with a well-functioning competitive market, Ramsay said.

These threaten the ride-hailing service's eye-popping, and currently unwarranted, valuation of $68 billion. In addition to the shortage of senior managers after departures in recent months, he leaves a void right at the top. Using the company's own how-to guide as a template, Breakingviews imagines an Uber-like app that helps fill it.   How to request a CEO:  1. Enter your requirements in the  Who on Earth?  box. Alternatively, if a strong record on scaling startups, taking firms public, tackling cultural and diversity problems and turning money-losing businesses around seems too much to ask of one person, simply tap a shortcut icon at the bottom of your screen, which will connect with your executive search firm.  2. Your default starting point is set to  Desperate.  If you are hoping for a different perception, your board and remaining managers will need to work hard to implement recent recommendations on changing the boys'-club culture – even while your request is still pending.  3. Use the slider at the bottom of your screen to toggle between available CEO options. For example: UberXX would limit the search to women, perhaps including ex-Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer, Uber board member Arianna Huffington, Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman or even Facebook operating chief Sheryl Sandberg; and UberCAR would seek automotive specialists like former Ford Motor bosses Alan Mulally and Mark Fields, leaders who could push forward the autonomous-driving part of your business.  UberPOOL, meanwhile, would alert other Uber board members who already have day jobs, unemployed tech executives such as Nikesh Arora, formerly of Google and SoftBank, or people like Jack Dorsey, who is already running Twitter and Square but may have further capacity.  4. Tap  Request.  You may be asked to confirm (a) that you're serious about changing the corporate culture and (b) that your investors have accepted that your current valuation is far lower than assumed in the past.  5. Wait for a CEO candidate to accept your request, if any are brave enough to take the role with Kalanick, who sits on the board and controls the company, riding shotgun.  6. When your request has been accepted you'll see your CEO's résumé and estimated time of arrival. Given the circumstances, that this may come with surge pricing.  7. Your app will notify you when your CEO is close to accepting the job. Failure to confirm the request quickly could result in a damaging delay.  8. Keep in mind this app can be used to replace board members, as well.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Sterling rose after the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he expected to back a British rate increase this year. The currency sagged on Tuesday after BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise UK interest rates after three policymakers had voted in favour of a hike last week. Commodity-linked currencies such as the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 and the Australian dollar AUD=D4 fell in step with lower oil prices.  It's a bit of a pushback from the equity space,  Jason Leinwand, founder of FirstLine FX Currency Strategy in Randolph, New Jersey, said of the weaker dollar.  The market is still digesting what (Fed Chair) Yellen said.  A week ago, the U.S. central bank, as expected, raised key borrowing costs by a quarter point to 1.00-1.25 percent, while Yellen at her news conference downplayed recent signs of inflation softening. The dollar index was down 0.2 percent at 97.541, below a one-month high of 97.871 reached on Tuesday. The Dow and S&P; 500 were modestly lower, while the Nasdaq recovered from recent losses. Among major currencies, the pound was the biggest gainer against the greenback following Haldane's hawkish view, which ran counter to his perceived dovish reputation.  If his opinion is shifting, then that is potentially significant news for rates going forward,  said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London. Investors were also closely watching political developments in Britain, with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists Party (DUP) to form a government.           Sterling was down as much as 0.6 percent based on Tuesday's close in New York before halving that decline, which brought it to $1.2668 .  Meanwhile, global benchmark oil prices touched seven-month lows on Wednesday on worries about oversupply. That put downward pressure on currencies whose economies are reliant on oil and commodity exports. The Canadian dollar traded at C$1.3313 per dollar, down 0.4 percent from late on Tuesday. The Aussie was down 0.3 percent at $0.7558, and the New Zealand dollar slipped 0.1 percent to $0.7231. Investors await a rate decision from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand due later on Wednesday. Analysts expected the RBNZ to leave rates at a record low of 1.75 percent.  (Deletes extraneous time element.)

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Erasmo Ramirez had given up at least six hits in his previous four starts, so a dominating outing like Wednesday's, leading the Tampa Bay Rays to an 8-3 win at Tropicana Field, was just what he needed.  I feel proud of myself to keep the team with no score in the first four,  Ramirez said.  To be able to do that today gives me more confidence, and we started hitting like we always did.  The Rays (39-36) scored four in the sixth to break open a close game and won two of three from Cincinnati, and Ramirez (4-2) took a no-hitter into the fifth inning. Up only 3-2 in the sixth, the Rays got two-out RBI singles from Corey Dickerson and Steven Souza and a two-run double by Logan Morrison off reliever Wandy Peralta. Peralta and Austin Brice each recorded only one out while giving up two runs and three hits apiece.  It's extremely disappointing,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  It would have been a good feel to not just break a losing streak but to win a series. For us to do what we want to do, we have to start to knock down series. ... Today, it was a nice game at 3-2 going to the bottom of the sixth and Tampa comes up with four. It wasn't necessarily a death blow, but it certainly gave them a huge advantage.  Related CoveragePreview: Reds at RaysCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchThe Reds (30-41) have dropped 11 of their last 12 road games and still have four more ahead before they return home. The Rays have won nine of their last 12 at home with three more ahead this weekend.  Everything worked together today,  Ramirez said.  That's something you always want. All the little pieces -- it's something that makes a team. You lose together and you win together.  The Rays could have had more of a lead, but they lost three runners in scoring position -- Souza was picked off at second, Trevor Plouffe was thrown out to end the fifth trying to get to third on a single, and the same thing happened to Taylor Featherston for the first out of the sixth. Ramirez retired the first nine batters in order before walking Billy Hamilton to lead off the fourth. He struck out Scooter Gennett and Adam Duvall, sandwiching those two around a Joey Votto walk, and caught a break defensively to end the inning. Eugenio Suarez hit a slow grounder to short that Robertson bobbled, allowing Suarez to reach first, but Robertson smartly caught Hamilton between third and home, getting the out in a 6-5-2-4-5-7 rundown to end the inning. Cincinnati got its first hit and run when Scott Schebler led off the fifth with a home run, his 20th on the season, to cut the Rays' lead to 3-1. It was Schebler's second home run of the series, extending his career season high to 20. The Rays didn't get a hit until the third inning against Reds starter Tim Adleman (4-4), but came up with support for Ramirez, whose job in the starting rotation was in jeopardy after recent struggles. Souza got a two-out single in the third to score Jesus Sucre, who had walked, for a 1-0 lead. Plouffe, acquired over the weekend from Oakland, hit a solo home run to left field to lead off the fourth, his first with the Rays and the eighth this season. The Rays again came up with a two-out hit, as Mallex Smith hit an RBI single to right to score Robertson, who had walked. Price had talked after Tuesday's loss about the need to limit walks by his pitchers, but two of the Rays' first three runs were scored by batters who reached base on walks. He also said he needs longer outings from his starting pitchers.  It's critical at this point -- we'd like to see a lot more 6-7 inning outings, and truth be told, we're starting to talk about six-inning outings being successful,  Price said.  Maybe the game is evolving and changing that way, but I'm still a believer if you have guys that can pitch deep into a game, you have a fresh bullpen to finish the game off when you need them.  Cincinnati got a run closer in the sixth, with Gennett scoring on a bases-loaded single by Schebler, who hit a comebacker that reliever Jose Alvarado tried to catch behind his back on the mound. The ball knocked his glove off and bounced away for an infield single. Alvarado was able to strike out Devin Mesoraco with the bases loaded to end the inning and preserve the lead. Both teams are off Thursday before opening three-game series on Friday. The Reds continue a seven-game road swing at Washington against the Nationals, while the Rays play host to the Baltimore Orioles. NOTES: The Rays' Triple-A affiliate, the Durham Bulls, played a man short in their bullpen Wednesday as RHP Ryan Garton was placed on the seven-day disabled list, according to the Tampa Bay Times. ... For Friday's opener at Washington, the Reds will call up RHP Luis Castillo from Double-A Pensacola to start and make his major league debut against Nationals RHP Stephen Strasburg. Castillo, 24, is 4-4 with a 2.58 ERA in 14 starts for the Blue Wahoos, with 81 strikeouts against just 13 walks.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-rays-writethru-idUSMTZED6LWXE7D4"},

Led by biotechnology shares, the S&P; 500 healthcare sector has topped all other major groups this month and led the way again on Wednesday. Tech's recent pullback may be benefiting healthcare shares as investors rotate to different sectors. Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, has created uncertainty this year for investors in the sector, but analysts doubt the Senate's proposal, expected on Thursday, will significantly throw off the overall group's momentum. Senate Republicans have been working for weeks behind closed doors on legislation.  Just getting to the end of the Senate process, whichever way it goes, is positive,  said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds, adding that it was important  to get some level of certainty out there.  For the year, the S&P; 500 healthcare sector has climbed more than 15 percent, topping the 9-percent increase for the overall S&P; 500 and trailing only technology's roughly 19-percent gain among the major sectors. Biotech fueled healthcare's recent gains, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology index up 8 percent already this week. The shares may be getting a boost from news reports suggesting Trump administration actions to rein in drug prices may not be overly onerous on the industry.  What he’s proposing is a little bit less punitive than feared... That probably is a meaningful catalyst of late,  said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. Impressive data on cancer drugs such as one from Clovis Oncology along with positive developments for larger players such as Alexion also may be helping the sector.  Investors were caught a bit off-sides, in that they weren’t invested enough in the sector,  said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management.  Now they are playing catch up a little bit towards the end of the quarter.  Healthcare struggled last year - falling 4.4 percent against a 9.5 percent rise for the broader market - so the sector may have been due to bounce back. The Nasdaq biotech index tumbled 21.7 percent in 2016 and remains well below 2015 highs. Political uncertainty clouded healthcare last year. After his election, President Donald Trump took aim at high drug prices, spooking investors in the sector.  This year a lot of those fears are at least easing,  Katz said. First-quarter results for the sector also shored up confidence. Eighty-four percent of healthcare companies topped analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations versus 76 percent for the S&P; 500 overall, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The country has some 630 troops on the ground in Central African Republic, according to the latest U.N. figures. A U.N. database of sexual abuse and exploitation accusations showed three reported incidents involving Congo Republic troops in Central African Republic this year. Nine were reported in 2016.  The review of the deployment of uniformed military personnel from the Republic of Congo found that the nature and extent of existing allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, in their totality, point to systemic problems in command and control,  the United Nations said in a statement.  These problems have also been compounded by issues related to the preparedness, overall discipline, maintenance of contingent owned equipment, and logistical capacity of these troops,  it said. The world body said the review was shared with the Congo Republic authorities who then  decided to withdraw their military personnel.  The 13,000-strong peacekeeping mission is seeking to contain violence in a multi-year conflict driven by ethnic and religious grievances and vying over vast diamond resources. The United Nations said some 140 Congo Republic police would remain part of the peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic because  failures identified with the military contingent are not reflected by the performance of the police.

Fox News.  Former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros filed the case two months ago, packing her complaint with boldfaced allegations that the network and Fox executives had orchestrating a social media campaign to frighten her away from pursuing sexual harassment claims. According to Tantaros’ lawyer, Judd Burstein, Fox figured out a way to spy on Tantaros’ phone and computer conversations, then used Twitter “sock puppets” to seed social media with menacing hints about its surveillance.  Fox’s lawyers at Dechert almost immediately filed a motion for Rule 11 sanctions against Tantaros and Burstein. Fox said their spying accusations were “not just false (but) outrageously and flagrantly so.” If Burstein had conducted even minimal investigation, Fox’s sanctions motion said, he would have discovered that the Twitter “sock puppet” account at the heart of Tantaros’ allegations of social media threats is operated by a real person whose tweets reflect no malicious designs toward the ex-Fox host. (Fox also said Burstein should be sanctioned for suing in federal court when Tantaros’ sexual harassment claims have been transferred to confidential arbitration.)  On Wednesday, Fox News contributor Pete Snyder, a Virginia social media marketing executive who is also a defendant in Tantaros’ suit, filed his own motion for sanctions against Tantaros and Burstein. The motion, by bulldog litigator Randy Mastro of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, makes many of the same points as the filing by Fox.  But Mastro also adds some provocative details about his and his client’s interactions with Tantaros lawyer Burstein, asserting that Burstein nakedly attempted to “shake down” Snyder for $15 million in exchange for leaving him out of the suit against Fox.  In a statement issued in response to the new sanctions motion, Burstein did not deny Mastro’s allegations but claimed the new sanctions brief presents only a “truncated version” of discussions between Burstein and Mastro, leaving out key mentions of whether Fox contributor Snyder is willing to take a polygraph test.  Let’s start with Mastro’s account of how Snyder was supposedly dragged into Tantaros’ case. According to the sanctions brief, Snyder has been a friend and even mentor to Tantaros, allegedly helping her first get a job at Fox and then advising her after she was hired. Snyder’s own relationship with the network, he said, goes back to 1998, when he began appearing as an unpaid guest. After an unsuccessful run for office in Virginia, he was hired as an on-air contributor. Snyder’s company also did social media and consulting work for Fox, but he maintains that gig lasted less than a year and ended in 2012. Snyder said his contract as a Fox contributor ended in April 2017.  On April 10, according to the Snyder sanctions motion, Tantaros lawyer Burstein sent Snyder an email alleging that he and his company helped Fox perpetrate a social media campaign to discredit and intimidate Tantaros. The email supposedly threatened that Tantaros would sue Snyder unless he paid her millions of dollars.  Burstein also, according to the sanctions motion, “threw into his email irrelevant personal smears—falsely accusing Mr. Snyder of having a ‘widely-known drinking problem’ and of ‘hitting on’ Ms. Tantaros as ‘his pregnant wife slept’ in the same home—for no apparent reason other than to try to coerce a huge, multimillion dollar settlement out of Mr. Snyder to avoid the adverse publicity.” (Snyder counsel Mastro said those personal accusations are “completely fabricated.”)  Snyder hired Mastro, who said in the sanctions motion that he called Burstein a week after his client received the threatening email. Mastro supposedly told Burstein that Snyder hadn’t advised Fox on social media matters in years.  Burstein followed up, according to the sanctions motion, with an email demanding that Snyder pay Tantaros $15 million within 24 hours or be prepared to face an embarrassing lawsuit. “Burstein’s shakedown was so brazen that it was tantamount to extortion,” the sanctions brief said.  After Burstein filed the suit naming Snyder and his company, Gibson Dunn informed him by letter that it intended to seek Rule 11 sanctions against him and Tantaros if they refused to drop Snyder and his company from the complaint. (Fox sent its own warning letter.) According to the sanctions motion, Burstein said he would dismiss claims against Snyder if an independent investigator selected by both sides agreed after examining the evidence that Snyder hadn’t done social media work for Fox and hadn’t slurred Tantaros.  “Mr. Snyder was so confident that all of Ms. Tantaros’s allegations were completely false that he would have submitted to such an invasive investigation so that the truth would come out,” the sanctions motions said.  But within 24 hours, according to the motion, Burstein said Snyder would have to agree to a sweeping investigation granting Tantaros “complete access to all of Snyder’s business and banking records,” but would not permit Snyder’s lawyers to investigate whether Tantaros and Burstein raised allegations against Snyder in good faith. “After an extended back-and-forth, Mr. Burstein finally pulled the plug,” the sanctions motion said.  Burstein’s statement responding to the Gibson Dunn accusations raises questions about why Fox paid Snyder $180,000 a year – a salary he said Mastro confirmed to him – for a mere ten hours of on-air appearances. “Plainly, Mr. Snyder is being paid $180,000 for something more,” Burstein said. “Why did Mr. Snyder’s counsel present such a truncated version of our discussions to date, thereby leaving out any mention of facts such as (a) my offer to allow Mr. Snyder to clear himself with a polygraph test, (b) Mr. Snyder’s counsel’s demand that we use an investigator that he alone chose, and (c) his counsel’s demand that there be no inquiry into what Mr. Snyder does for the $180,000 a year he receives from Fox News?”  Burstein said the sanctions motion is “yet another attempt to improperly intimidate me into abandoning my pursuit of justice for Andrea Tantaros,” and that he regards it “as a badge of honor. I am not going to back down because I have truth on my side.”  As I mentioned above, what the Burstein statement doesn’t say is that he never promised Snyder and Mastro not to sue in exchange for $15 million.  Litigation spectators don’t often get to see the down-and-dirty details of negotiations like the ones that supposedly took place between Mastro and Burstein. That’s probably for the best. We all like to think justice is blind. This case makes clear that it isn’t always pretty.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-fox-idUSKBN19C2UC"},

The investment manager said it agreed to buy 17.6 million shares of Hornby from New Pistoia Income Ltd (NPIL), which in April had called for a meeting to remove the company's Chairman Roger Canham amid falling sales and multiple profit warnings. Phoenix, Hornby's largest shareholder, struck a deal with smaller stakeholders Ruffer LLP and Downing LLP to vote against NPIL's proposal. NPIL is Hornby's second-largest investor. Canham, who has been in the post since February 2013 and is also the chairman of Phoenix, on Wednesday said he resigned from the Hornby board with immediate effect. Phoenix said it offered to buy Hornby shares from NPIL at 32.375 pence per share. The acquisition will take the fund's holding in Hornby to about 55.2 percent. Following the acquisition, Phoenix UK, as required by British takeover laws, made a cash offer for Hornby at 32.375 pence per share, valuing the toy train maker at 27.4 million pounds ($34.71 million). Hornby's shares closed up 3.6 percent at 32.38 pence on Wednesday. The company, which is trying to turn around its business, said its board acknowledged the offer and advised its shareholders to take no action for now. Hornby said in 2016 it would decrease its product lines by 40 percent and exit a majority of its concession agreements in UK to boost its gross margins. In its earnings statement released on Wednesday, Hornby said its gross margin for the 11 weeks to June 18 rose 5 percentage points from a year earlier. Full-year revenue declined 15 percent to 47.4 million pounds, the company said.

The investment manager said it agreed to buy 17.6 million shares of Hornby from New Pistoia Income Ltd (NPIL), which in April had called for a meeting to remove the company's Chairman Roger Canham amid falling sales and multiple profit warnings. Phoenix, Hornby's largest shareholder, struck a deal with smaller stakeholders Ruffer LLP and Downing LLP to vote against NPIL's proposal. NPIL is Hornby's second-largest investor. Canham, who has been in the post since February 2013 and is also the chairman of Phoenix, on Wednesday said he resigned from the Hornby board with immediate effect. Phoenix said it offered to buy Hornby shares from NPIL at 32.375 pence per share. The acquisition will take the fund's holding in Hornby to about 55.2 percent. Following the acquisition, Phoenix UK, as required by British takeover laws, made a cash offer for Hornby at 32.375 pence per share, valuing the toy train maker at 27.4 million pounds ($34.71 million). Hornby's shares closed up 3.6 percent at 32.38 pence on Wednesday. The company, which is trying to turn around its business, said its board acknowledged the offer and advised its shareholders to take no action for now. Hornby said in 2016 it would decrease its product lines by 40 percent and exit a majority of its concession agreements in UK to boost its gross margins. In its earnings statement released on Wednesday, Hornby said its gross margin for the 11 weeks to June 18 rose 5 percentage points from a year earlier. Full-year revenue declined 15 percent to 47.4 million pounds, the company said.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled at $42.53, down 98 cents or 2.3 percent, after touching a low of $42.13, the lowest intraday level since August 2016. Since peaking in late February, crude has dropped more than 20 percent, with only brief rallies. More than 1 million front-month crude contracts changed hands on Wednesday, far exceeding the daily average of 560,000 contracts. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled down $1.20 or 2.61 percent at $44.82 a barrel.   The market wants proof that OPEC cuts are shifting petroleum balances, and it's not getting it. Crude prices are now on the hunt to find the stress point for the U.S. producers and we're not there yet,  said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. Oil prices rose in late 2016 and early 2017 in response to the OPEC agreement, but weeks of surprisingly high inventory figures shifted sentiment among speculators who are shedding long positions as the crude glut persists.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude inventories declined by 2.7 million barrels last week, exceeding expectations for a 2.1 million-barrel drop. The data briefly supported prices, but  updated inventory balances don't represent a game changer,  said Headrick. The EIA also reported that U.S. crude production rose to 9.35 million bpd, nearing levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. U.S. producers have added rigs for 22 weeks straight. Oil has slid 20 percent in the first half of 2017, a period when prices have tended to rise. It was the biggest first half slide for Brent since 1997; the contract has risen in the first half of all but six years over that period.   An agreement late last year from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day from January was supposed to reduce the global glut. Yet production is rising in Nigeria and Libya, countries exempt from the deal, offsetting cuts by other OPEC members. Nigeria's crude exports are set to surpass 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, the highest in 17 months. Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said OPEC members were considering deeper output cuts, but not immediately. Investors were discouraged by data showing oil refineries in China, the world's top crude importer, cutting operations during the peak demand summer season. The December 2017 U.S. crude contract is at its biggest discount to December 2018 futures CLZ7-Z8 since July, a signal that traders expect the glut to persist even longer. Options activity picked up on Wednesday as well, as investors bought protection against further declines.  Now everyone seems to be negative,  said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg.  In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, oil facilities braced for Tropical Storm Cindy. About 17 percent of oil production in the Gulf was shut in and 40 platforms, or about 5 percent, were evacuated. Prolonged outages at refineries could drive up gasoline prices.

The move cast some uncertainty over plans for the first face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit on July 7-8 in Hamburg, Germany. With two weeks to go, a senior White House official said no plans for a bilateral meeting had been finalized.  Nothing has been canceled because nothing has been set,  the official said. Moscow said it was obliged to cancel the diplomatic meeting after the U.S. government on Tuesday added 38 individuals and organizations to its list of those sanctioned over Russian activities in Ukraine.  The new U.S. sanctions were  a continuation of the trend set by the Obama administration aimed at ruining relations between our countries , Ryabkov said in a statement posted on the website of Russia's Foreign Ministry. U.S.-Russian relations have already been strained by allegations that Moscow interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year and Trump's first five months in office have been dogged by a controversy over whether his campaign team colluded with Russia. Related CoverageU.S. says it regrets Russia canceled diplomat meetingTrump has said he wants to explore whether Washington and Moscow can work together on issues of mutual concern, such as fighting Islamic State insurgents in Syria. But tensions between the two nations have escalated. On Sunday, the U.S. military shot down a Syrian military jet. That prompted Russia to change its military posture. The Kremlin said the expanded U.S. sanctions undermined Washington's assertions it wanted dialogue with Moscow, calling the new sanctions a  political gift  to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The U.S. State Department said it regretted the Russian cancellation, but remained open to future discussions to try to bridge bilateral differences. The new sanctions only reinforced existing sanctions, which have been updated twice a year since they were first imposed, the department said.  Let's remember that these sanctions didn't just come out of nowhere. Our targeted sanctions were imposed in response to Russia's ongoing violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbor, Ukraine,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday that Russian forces were not present in eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists.  The United States and the European Union have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russian companies and individuals in response to Russia's role in the Ukraine conflict. Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate last week also backed additional sanctions to punish Russia for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region, and support for Syria's government in the six-year-long civil war. Ryabkov was meant to be meeting Shannon in St Petersburg on Friday to discuss  problems in bilateral ties . But Ryabkov, in the same statement on Wednesday, accused the United States of failing to propose anything tangible to improve relations. He said:  Previous multiple waves of American sanctions haven't achieved the result which their initiators had hoped for. Any new attempts to make Russia 'bow down' will be just as futile.

Women who reported having breastfed for any amount of time were about 9 percent less likely than mothers who never breastfed to have signs of coronary heart disease, like a heart attack, in middle age and later and about 8 percent less likely to have a stroke.  This study suggests that it reduces the mother’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease,  said study author Zhengming Chen, of the University of Oxford in the UK. But, Chen told Reuters Health, the study does not prove a direct or causal link between not breastfeeding and poor cardiovascular health. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers exclusively breastfeed their children for the first six months of life, and continue to breastfeed for a year or more while introducing other foods. Previous studies have linked breastfeeding to reduced risks of metabolic dysfunction, diabetes and high blood pressure among women later in life, Chen and colleagues note in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Some studies have also suggested a link between breastfeeding and the risk of cardiovascular disease, they write. For the new study, the researchers analyzed data on women who were recruited between 2004 and 2008, when they ranged in age from 30 to 79 years old, and were followed for about eight years. The analysis included 289,573 women living in 10 urban and rural areas of China, who provided information about their health and breastfeeding history. Researchers also gathered data about them from disease, death and insurance registries to see if they had heart-related events. The women's average age was 51 when they entered the study. Nearly all reported giving birth to at least one child, and the vast majority breastfed at some point. Over about eight years, the researchers found nearly 50,000 cases of cardiovascular disease, which included 23,983 strokes and 16,671 cases of coronary heart disease. Women who had breastfed were 12 percent less likely to have cardiovascular disease, 9 percent less likely to have coronary heart disease and 8 percent less likely to have a stroke over that time than women who had children but never breastfed. In addition, the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke appeared to decrease as the amount of time women breastfed increased. Compared to women who never breastfed, those who reported breastfeeding for six to 12 months were 7 percent less likely to have a heart attack while the risk was 18 percent lower among women who breastfed for more than two years. The results were similar for stroke risk. The researchers also adjusted the calculations to account for other factors that might influence the results like education, income, smoking status, blood pressure and physical activity.  That didn’t really change our study findings at all,  Chen said. The new study can't explain the link between breastfeeding and heart health, but the researchers write that one possibility is breastfeeding helps women's bodies lose weight gained with pregnancy and  resets  their metabolism to improve the way their body uses insulin and processes fats in the blood, for example. These kinds of post-pregnancy changes may help set breastfeeding mothers on a path to better long-term health. Still, women should not breastfeed to lower their cardiovascular risk, cautioned Dr. Steve Nissen, who is chair of the Robert and Suzanne Tomsich Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.  Obviously people who breastfeed are different than people who don’t breastfeed,  said Nissen, who wasn't involved with the new study.  A 10 percent difference is so small that almost any unmeasured factor here could explain it,  he told Reuters Health. Nissen added that breastfeeding is favorable for infants.

Copersucar, a cooperative formed by more than 20 sugar and ethanol companies in Brazil, ended the 2016/17 cane crop year with total revenues of 28.3 billion reais, 7.6 percent more than in the previous season.  We had a small fall on cane crushing volume, but better prices for sugar and ethanol on average in the crop, which boosted margins,  said the company in the earnings report. Associated Copersucar mills in Brazil crushed 87 million tonnes of cane in the crop ended in March, 2.5 percent less than in the previous season. Copersucar sold 5.3 million tonnes of sugar, 3.6 percent less than in 2015/16, and 4.2 billion liters of ethanol, 16 percent less. But the company said larger selling volumes in its wholly-owned subsidiary Eco-Energy Biofuels in the United States and in the 50-50 joint venture with Cargill [CARG.UL], the world's largest sugar trader Alvean, helped its results. It said Alvean traded 12.1 million tonnes of sugar in the period, 5.2 percent more than in the previous crop year, giving the joint venture a 26 percent share of the global raw sugar trade. Copersucar Chief Executive Officer Paulo Roberto Souza told reporters during a conference call that Alvean reported better margins last year, taking advantage of a volatile market for raw sugar.  Alvean benefited from cash and carry. They used our warehouses for that strategy,  said Souza, saying higher volatility usually improves margins for traders such as Alvean. He said the joint venture boosted sugar sourcing in Brazil by doing business with independent mills. Souza believes it could well grow another 4 or 5 percentage points in volumes in the new crop.      Copersucar said its ethanol subsidiary Eco-Energy increased sales in the U.S. by 4.5 percent in 2016/17, to 9.2 billion liters.  They gained share in a consolidated market, so they gained market from competitors , Souza said. Copersucar estimates its subsidiary holds now a 16-percent share of the American market. Souza said Eco-Energy is in talks with ethanol producers in the U.S. to have access to new supplies of the biofuel, as a way to further expand in that market.

The Bulgarian gifted away an early break with a spate of double faults to give 35-year-old Benneteau the impetus. But a superb lob followed by a Benneteau double-fault allowed Dimitrov to forge ahead in the second set and he was always in control thereafter, pulling off some crowd-pleasing diving volleys as he moved to victory.

With on-court temperatures nudging 40 degrees Celsius, Tsonga looked as listless as the sweltering crowd as Muller dominated behind his serve to claim his second title of the year, having never won one before. He needed one break in each set to subdue former runner-up Tsonga and will face either Murray's conqueror Jordan Thompson of Australia or American Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals.  It's working well for me at the moment,  Muller, who saved all three break points he faced, said.  My serve is working great and it's good at this time of the year on the grass.

The changes have been the subject of protests in the capital Bamako and more marches were set for Thursday across the West African country. Crucially, three parties in the governing coalition asked for a delay.  The council of ministers has decided to delay until a future date the referendum initially set for July 9,  a government statement said after the meeting headed by President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. It gave no reason for the delay and set no new date. Mali is struggling to contain militancy in its north, where rival militias frequently clash and Islamist groups carry out attacks on civilians, Malian soldiers, U.N. peacekeepers and French forces there. Islamist militants, some linked to al Qaeda, seized northern Mali in 2012 on the back of a separatist rebellion before being driven out of major cities and towns by a French-led military intervention a year later. The government signed the peace deal that aimed to end the separatist movement by parties including the Coordination of Azawad Movements, which is led by ethnic Tuaregs.

Berlusconi, who had open heart surgery last year, cannot run for office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction. But he remains head of his Forza Italia arty and hopes the European Court of Human Rights will soon rule that he can be a candidate. After months keeping a relatively low-profile, the billionaire businessman has upped his media presence during campaigning for local elections in which second-round run-off ballots are set for Sunday with Berlusconi's center-right bloc poised to make gains.  Whether or not I can be a candidate, I am out on the campaign trail,  Berlusconi told one of Italy's top talkshows on state television RAI.  I want to exceed the 20 percent threshold and think I can get past 30 percent.  The latest EMG Acqua opinion poll published on Monday said Forza Italia was the third largest party in Italy on 14.1 percent, with 5-Star leading the pack on 28.4 percent and the ruling center-left Democratic Party on 26.8 percent. The fourth-placed party, Berlusconi's old ally the Northern League, was seen winning 13.8 percent. The League, which wants to drop the euro currency, has moved increasingly to the hard right in recent years, leading to tensions with Forza Italia. Despite big differences on the national stage, the two parties have successfully joined forces for the municipal vote and are expected to chalk up gains on Sunday, including possibly ending 50 years of center-left rule in the port city of Genoa. [nL8N1J94AQ] FILE PHOTO: Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi takes part in a European People Party (EPP) summit in St Julian's, Malta, March 30, 2017.Darrin Zammit Lupi/File PhotoBerlusconi, 80, said he saw 5-Star, which was founded by comic Beppe Grillo, as the biggest danger facing Italy.  I entered politics to combat the communist threat. Now there is another danger, that of Grillo and his supporters. The center-right has to remain united,  he said.  Grillo's bunch aren't capable of anything ... 80 percent of them have never earned a penny,  he said. Italy must hold national elections within a year, but does not yet have a coherent electoral system. With politicians squabbling over the issue, it looks increasingly likely that a proportional representation system will be adopted, making it highly unlikely that any group could govern alone. [nL8N1J61V1] Berlusconi said that if the League joined forces with 5-Star, as some newspapers have speculated, he would leave Italy.  In an interview earlier in the day, he appeared to rule out any deal with the PD, which is headed by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. But on Wednesday night he indicated an accord might be possible, under the right circumstances.  With me, the left would not be able to hike taxes,  he said, pointing to Germany, where coalition governments are the norm and rival parties are able to draw up joint programmes.

The forces had encircled the jihadist group's stronghold in the Old City of Mosul, where the medieval Grand al-Nuri Mosque  is located, on Tuesday, they said.  The Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) were 200-300 meters (yards) away from the mosque, an Iraqi military statement said, a view supported by a senior commander of the international coalition fighting Islamic State. The U.S.-led coalition is providing air and ground support to the Mosul offensive that started on Oct. 17. The militants' leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, proclaimed himself caliph from the pulpit of the mosque after the insurgents overran parts of Iraq and Syria. His black flag has been flying over its famous leaning minaret since June 2014.  Iraqi officials have privately expressed the hope that the mosque could be captured in time for Eid al-Fitr, the festival marking the end of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month. The first day of the Eid falls this year on June 25 or 26 in Iraq. The battle for the Old City is becoming the deadliest in the  eight-month-old offensive to capture Mosul, Islamic State's de facto capital in Iraq. More than 100,000 civilians, of whom half are children, are trapped in its old fragile houses with little food, water, medicine, no electricity and limited access to clinics. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday  sick and wounded civilians escaping through Islamic State lines were dying in  high numbers .   We are trying to keep families inside their houses and, after we secure their block, we will evacuate them through safe routes,  Lieutenant General Abdul Ghani al-Assadi, senior CTS  commander in Mosul, told Iraqi state TV. The militants are moving stealthily in the Old City's maze of alleyways and narrow streets, through holes dug between houses, fighting back the advancing troops with sniper and mortar fire, booby traps and suicide bombers. Smoke billows in a part of West Mosul, where Iraqi security forces are fighting Islamic State, Iraq June 21, 2017.Marius BoschThey have also covered many streets with sheets of cloth to obstruct air surveillance, making it difficult for the advancing troops to hit them without a risk to civilians.  We are attacking simultaneously from different fronts to break them into smaller groups which are easier to fight,  said an officer from the Federal Police, another force taking part in the assault on the Old City.   The Iraqi army estimates the number of Islamic State  fighters at no more than 300, down from nearly 6,000 in the city when the battle of Mosul started on Oct. 17. The fall of Mosul would, in effect, mark the end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate  even though Islamic State would continue to control territory west and south of the city, the largest they came to control in both Iraq and Syria. Slideshow (7 Images)Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding in the border area between Iraq and  Syria, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources.  There was no confirmation of Russian reports that he was killed in Syria.   If you were a Daesh fighter (..) I don’t sense you would feel as though you are being led by Baghdadi,  Major General Rupert Jones, British deputy commander of the international coalition, said during a visit to eastern Mosul.  I suspect you feel isolated. I suspect you feel deserted and you know this is only going to end one way,  he added. The Iraqi government initially hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the campaign took longer as militants reinforced positions in civilian areas to fight back. The militants are also retreating in Syria, mainly in the face of a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led coalition. Its capital there, Raqqa, is under siege.  About 850,000 people, more than a third of the pre-war population of Mosul, have fled, seeking refuge with relatives or in camps, according to aid groups. Jones said Iraqi forces had overcome the distrust that marked their relations with the population of Mosul, which facilitated Islamic State's takeover of the city in 2014.    There was a huge amount of distrust,  he said.  There seems to be a genuine mutual trust between the security forces and the local population born out of mutual respect, and I have heard it multiple times today. That is fantastic.

The U.S. Treasury yield curve was the flattest in nearly a decade as investors evaluated hawkish Federal Reserve policy and softening inflation.                 Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates and yields, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.      The change in sentiment has helped gold,  ABN AMRO analyst Georgette Boele said.     Spot gold        was up 0.3 percent at $1,246.67 an ounce by 3:27 p.m. EDT (1927 GMT), while U.S. gold futures         settled up 0.2 percent at $1,245.80.      Gold has fallen around 4 percent from a high of $1,295.97 early this month.     But traders were skeptical that gold had hit bottom.       Momentum certainly seems to be lower for the moment,  said MKS PAMP trader Alex Thorndike in a note.       (But) there does seem to be a little renewed buying interest below $1,250, so we feel a period of consolidation is likely,  he added.      Strong technical support at the 200-day moving average at around $1,237 would provide the floor from which gold could climb back toward $1,275, said Boele.     Analysts at Standard Chartered said in a note they expected the Fed to raise rates twice, rather than three times, next year and the gold should rise to $1,300 an ounce by the end of 2017.      Several Fed officials have said the bank should push ahead with rate rises, but the head of the Chicago Federal Reserve said on Tuesday he was increasingly concerned that soft inflation meant the bank would struggle to get price pressures back to its 2 percent objective.                        Among other precious metals, spot palladium        was up 2.4 percent at $889 an ounce after an unexpected rise in U.S. existing home sales in May.                   This positive indicator also signals that if the economy is improving, auto sales should continue to grow. This leads today's strength in palladium which benefits from that play,  said Miguel Perez-Santalla, vice president of Heraeus Metal Management in New York.     Palladium is used for emission-controlling catalytic converters in petrol vehicles and is benefiting from a shift away from diesel cars, said Natixis analyst Bernard Dahdah.

Copersucar, a cooperative formed by more than 20 sugar and ethanol companies in Brazil, ended the 2016/17 cane crop year with total revenues of 28.3 billion reais, 7.6 percent more than in the previous season.  We had a small fall on cane crushing volume, but better prices for sugar and ethanol on average in the crop, which boosted margins,  said the company in the earnings report. Associated Copersucar mills in Brazil crushed 87 million tonnes of cane in the crop ended in March, 2.5 percent less than in the previous season. Copersucar sold 5.3 million tonnes of sugar, 3.6 percent less than in 2015/16, and 4.2 billion liters of ethanol, 16 percent less. But the company said larger selling volumes in its wholly-owned subsidiary Eco-Energy Biofuels in the United States and in the 50-50 joint venture with Cargill [CARG.UL], the world's largest sugar trader Alvean, helped its results. It said Alvean traded 12.1 million tonnes of sugar in the period, 5.2 percent more than in the previous crop year, giving the joint venture a 26 percent share of the global raw sugar trade. Copersucar Chief Executive Officer Paulo Roberto Souza told reporters during a conference call that Alvean reported better margins last year, taking advantage of a volatile market for raw sugar.  Alvean benefited from cash and carry. They used our warehouses for that strategy,  said Souza, saying higher volatility usually improves margins for traders such as Alvean. He said the joint venture boosted sugar sourcing in Brazil by doing business with independent mills. Souza believes it could well grow another 4 or 5 percentage points in volumes in the new crop.      Copersucar said its ethanol subsidiary Eco-Energy increased sales in the U.S. by 4.5 percent in 2016/17, to 9.2 billion liters.  They gained share in a consolidated market, so they gained market from competitors , Souza said. Copersucar estimates its subsidiary holds now a 16-percent share of the American market. Souza said Eco-Energy is in talks with ethanol producers in the U.S. to have access to new supplies of the biofuel, as a way to further expand in that market.

The healthcare bill will be released to the Republican Senate Conference on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT) and posted online, Senators John Barrasso of Wyoming and Bob Corker of Tennessee told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday. A vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said.  There is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the Obama health care law,  Barrasso, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN.  People across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.  Legislators from both sides of the aisle have expressed their displeasure and Democrats hoping to block the measure need at least two Republicans to defect. Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, defending the closed-door sessions, has said all Senate Republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that Democrats are not interested in discussing Obamacare repeal. The Senate proposal is expected to cut back the expansion of Medicaid, the government program for the poor, and reduce subsidies to people buying private insurance. But negotiations have been plagued from the start by tensions between moderates and conservatives. In addition, a growing number of Republicans are frustrated with the process, saying they apparently will have just a few days to study the draft before being forced to vote on a major piece of legislation. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes.  I'd find it hard to believe we'll have enough time,  he said, adding that if he doesn't get enough information  I won't be voting yes.  Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she wants to read an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.  The first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,  she said. An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the House of Representatives, according to CBO. Conservative Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said he had not yet seen the Senate bill. But he promised voters he would seek full repeal of Obamacare, and  everything I hear (about the Senate draft) sounds like Obamacare light.  Given the opposition of all Senate Democrats to repealing Obamacare, Republican leaders will need the support of at least 50 of the chamber's 52 Republicans to ensure passage.

New York Fed President William Dudley and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren both took the view this week that keeping interest rates low may pose risks to the economy.                               “I think the market may be pricing in a little higher odds of another rate hike before the end of the year, and that is helping drive some of the flattening,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.     Five-year note yields           , which are highly sensitive to rate policy, rose to a four-week high of 1.80 percent on Tuesday. They last traded at 1.77 percent.     Meanwhile, thirty-year bond yields            , which are largely driven by future expectations of growth and inflation, dropped to 2.72 percent on Wednesday, the lowest since Nov. 9.     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                flattened to 95 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007.     Long bonds have been supported by inflation concerns, since data last Wednesday showed that the so-called core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out food and energy costs, increased 1.7 percent year-on-year in May, the smallest rise since May 2015.

The U.S. S&P; 500 financial sector was last down about 0.7 percent while the European Stoxx Europe 600 Financial Services index closed down 1.3 percent. The financial sector fell as the U.S. Treasury yield curve held near 10-year lows, with European financials punished by heavy losses from British subprime lender Provident Financial Plc. Flattening in the yield curve, or the narrowing in the difference between short- and long-term yields, can weigh on banks' profitability A drop in U.S. crude prices to a 10-month low of $42.05 per barrel and a decline in benchmark Brent crude to a seven-month low of $44.35 per barrel pressured energy shares on nagging fears about global oversupply. The U.S. Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend of weaker equity indexes, rising on gains in biotechnology stocks. So far this year, oil has lost more than 20 percent in value, its weakest performance for the first six months of the year since 1997. Brent crude settled down $1.20, or 2.61 percent, at $44.82 per barrel. U.S. crude settled down 98 cents, or 2.25 percent, at $42.53 per barrel.  Oil has perhaps tempered some sentiment near-term,  said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  If oil falls below $40, one would see pressure on overall earnings, not just the energy sector.  MSCI's all-country world equity index was last down 0.56 points, or 0.12 percent, at 465.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last down 49.88 points, or 0.23 percent, at 21,417.26. The S&P; 500 was down 1.95 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,435.08. The Nasdaq Composite added 39.44 points, or 0.64 percent, to 6,227.47. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.23 percent at 1,527.15. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 95.3 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007, as investors evaluated hawkish Federal Reserve policy and deteriorating inflation measures. Five-year note yields, which are highly sensitive to rate policy, rose to a four-week high of 1.80 percent on Tuesday. Thirty-year bond yields, which are largely driven by future expectations of growth and inflation, meanwhile dropped to 2.72 percent on Wednesday, the lowest since Nov. 9.  I think the market may be pricing in a little higher odds of another rate hike before the end of the year, and that is helping drive some of the flattening,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. Hawkish comments from the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane were also seen as hurting short-term bonds. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last down 0.2 percent. Gold prices rose after sliding to a five-week low in the previous session. Spot gold prices were up $4.06, or 0.33 percent, at $1,246.87 an ounce.

Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto (BAJA.NS) and several buyout funds are also preparing bids for Ducati, which is being put up for sale by German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). A deal with Harley-Davidson would bring together the maker of touring bikes like the Electra Glide that are symbolic of America with a leading European maker whose high-performance bikes have a distinguished racing heritage. Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson has hired Goldman Sachs to work on the deal, one source familiar with the matter said, adding tentative bids were expected in July. Volkswagen, whose Audi division controls Ducati – maker of the iconic Monster motorbike – is working with investment boutique Evercore on the sale which will help it fund a strategic overhaul following its emissions scandal. Based in the northern Italian city of Bologna, Ducati was on the wish list of private equity funds KKR (KKR.N), Bain Capital and Permira, which are all working on the deal, said the sources who declined to be identified as the process is private. Ducati was launched in 1926 as a maker of vacuum tubes and radio components and its Bologna factory remained open in World War Two despite being the target of several bombings.  Ducati racers have won the Superbike world championship 14 times, with Carl Fogarty and Troy Bayliss its most successful riders. Harley-Davidson, which commands about half the U.S. big-bike market, was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the start of the last century and was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the great depression. Demand for Harley's motorcycles continues to be slow as its loyal baby boomer demographic ages and rivals such as the Indian brand bike maker Polaris Industries Inc (PII.N) and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) offer discounts. Volkswagen's powerful labor unions, which control half the seats on the carmaker's 20-strong supervisory board, repeated their opposition to selling the Italian motorcycle maker.  Ducati is a jewel, the sale of which is not supported by the labor representatives on Volkswagen's supervisory board,  a spokesman for VW group's works council said in an email.  Harley-Davidson is miles behind Ducati in technology terms,  he added. Bidding Field Evercore has sent out information packages to a number of potential suitors including Ducati's previous owner Investindustrial, sources with knowledge of the matter said. A Harley-Davidson bike is displayed in their head office in Singapore October 13, 2016.Edgar SuInvestindustrial bought a stake in Ducati before the financial crisis, subsequently taking control of the business before selling it to Audi in 2012. It is now looking to compete with heavyweight private equity firms and large industry players to regain control.  Volkswagen, Audi, Harley-Davidson, KKR and Bain Capital declined to comment. Bajaj, Investindustrial and Permira were not immediately available. Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, is seeking to move beyond an emissions-cheating scandal that has tarnished its image and left it facing billions of euros in fines and settlements. A successful deal for Ducati, which last year reported revenues of 593 million euros, would show Volkswagen boss Matthias Mueller is serious about reversing his predecessor's quest for size. The logo of Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati is seen at a motocycle dealer in Dietlikon, Switzerland October 11, 2016.Arnd WiegmannVolkswagen said last June it would review its portfolio of assets and brands, rekindling speculation among analysts that  non-core  businesses could be put up for sale. Volkswagen hopes to raise between 1.4 billion and 1.5 billion euros from the sale of Ducati, valuing it at 14-15 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about 100 million euros, the sources said. The German car maker wants a valuation that reflects trading multiples of similar trophy assets in the automotive industry, such as Italian car maker Ferrari (RACE.MI) which trades at almost 30 times its forward earnings. Yet it may need to compromise on price as some of the bidders would struggle to pay as much as 1.5 billion euros for Ducati, several sources said. Price expectations have already proved challenging for some industry players who recently decided against bidding. Indian motorcycle firm Hero MotoCorp (HROM.NS) and its rival TVS Motor Company (TVSM.NS) initially expressed interest in Ducati but were put off by its price tag and decided to walk away, the sources said. German car marker BMW (BMWG.DE) and Japanese motorcycle makers Honda (7267.T) and Suzuki (7269.T) have also decided against bidding for Ducati, sources close to the companies told Reuters. A BMW spokesman confirmed the German firm was not interested in Ducati, while Hero and TVS were not immediately available for comment. Another source close to Volkswagen said the sale of Ducati might not be finalised before the annual EICMA motorcycle show in Milan in mid-November as Volkswagen wanted to find the right buyer and the sales process might take time.

Energy stocks tumbled after oil prices reversed course during the morning session and U.S. crude touched its lowest point since August despite larger-than-expected declines in inventories. While technology stocks were likely attracting growth investors taking advantage of a recent dip, healthcare stocks were helped by reports that U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to rein in drug prices may be friendlier than expected to the industry, according to Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Mass.  We had a great quarterly earnings report. Early signs are good for the second quarter,  said McMillan.  We're just continuing to bounce around here until second quarter earnings come out.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 41.67 points, or 0.19 percent, to 21,425.47, the S&P; 500 had lost 0.62 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,436.41 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 44.02 points, or 0.71 percent, to 6,232.05. The S&P; energy index was the S&P;'s weakest sector with a 1.5 percent decline. It has fallen more than 15 percent this year compared with a 8.8 percent rise for the S&P; 500. Oil futures have fallen about 21 percent so far this year. The four-company telecommunications sector was the second weakest with a 1 percent drop, with CenturyLink and AT&T; Inc leading the percentage decliners there. Bank stocks fell 7 percent, on track for their second consecutive decline on concerns about interest rate margins due to a flattening yield curve. The Nasdaq biotechnology index was up 3.7 percent, on track for its biggest one-day gain since the day after Trump's Nov. 8 election. Its biggest positive drivers were Celgene , Regeneron and Biogen, which all rose more than 4 percent. The move follows Friday's Politico report about an  industry-friendly  drug-price remedy from Trump and a Tuesday New York Times story suggesting he would ease regulation for drug firms, implying a softer stance than expected.  Whenever you see that kind of headline, that's got to act as a signal to investors that maybe at the margin the situation is a little better than you thought,  said McMillan. Caterpillar's 3.2 percent fall weighed on industrials, which fell 0.6 percent. FedEx shares hit a record high at $213.86 after the delivery company forecast higher fiscal 2018 earnings. They were last up 1.7 percent at $212.54. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The new appointments came as France's main conservative party splintered under the impact of Macron's sudden rise to presidential and parliamentary power, and the seismic shift it has caused continues to reverberate around French politics. Businesswoman Florence Parly, who worked previously in a Socialist government and for major French transport companies, was named defense minister, and law expert Nicole Belloubet was nominated justice minister, replacing two of the departed. Jacques Mezard moved from the Agriculture Ministry to the territorial planning ministry vacated by Macron's right-hand man Richard Ferrand earlier this week. Macron loyalist Stephane Travert took over the agriculture portfolio. Macron's reshuffle, tapping more people from the non-political world, reflects the profile of many of his newly elected members of parliament. It also keeps a fragile balance of people from left, right and center and has one more women than men. Related CoverageFrance's Macron says EU states infringing rules should pay the consequencesFrench government spokesman says MoDem exit from cabinet 'simplifies things'The reshuffle came after a group of ministers from an affiliated centrist party, MoDem, resigned over allegations the party misused European parliamentary funds. Those who departed the justice and defense ministries were, respectively, Francois Bayrou, MoDem party leader, and Sylvie Goulard - who had been seen as a key plank of Macron's plan for closer ties with Germany.  Bayrou, a Macron ally since endorsing his centrist bid for the presidency in February, said he quit to protect the government from the scandal that has engulfed him.  I will stand by the president and faithfully support him with a political and personal understanding that is dear to me,  Bayrou told journalists. MoDem leader Francois Bayrou, outgoing Justice Minister, attends a news conference in Paris, France, June 21, 2017.Charles PlatiauUnder Investigation His center-right party is embroiled in a judicial probe into claims it misused EU parliamentary funds, and its importance as a Macron ally waned after his Republic on the Move (LREM) party won a big majority in Sunday's parliamentary election. The majority is so large that Macron does not need MoDem to get planned pro-business labor reforms through parliament. Earlier on Wednesday his camp was in upbeat mood. Slideshow (7 Images) It simplifies things,  government spokesman Christophe Castaner said on Europe 1 radio.  We have a majority after Sunday's big win and we have the wherewithal to govern. So now it's time to get to work.   MoDem's departure, however, risks unbalancing Macron's carefully crafted government of the left, right and center, which broke with convention as he extended his support base. But in a further sign of how Macron has dismantled France's traditional left-right divide, a lawmaker from the main conservative Republicans party said he was forming a splinter group that would back the president on some reforms.    We're working on the creation of ... a new force in parliament,  Thierry Solere told reporters, adding that the roughly 40-strong group would include Republicans and legislators from the Union of Democrats and Independents.  Macron's LREM won 308 seats in the 577-strong National Assembly on Sunday, while MoDem gained 42.  Goulard, a European expert well known in Brussels and Berlin, had emphasized her pro-EU push and desire to work towards greater defense integration.  No other French politician knew how to talk to the Germans in quite the same way. With her goes the hope of more integration in the defense sector. At least for now,  said Britain-based think-tank Eurointelligence.

Iran signed two contracts to export gas, one for the Iraqi capital Baghdad and the other for southern Iraqi city of Basra, IRNA reported. Iran, which has huge gas reserves alongside its oil resources, exports small amounts of gas to Turkey but production has struggled to keep pace with rising domestic consumption. Experts say years of Western sanctions over Iran's disputed nuclear program have also hindered development of gas projects.

The Guards fired six mid-range surface to surface missiles from western Iran into Syria's Deir al Zour province on Sunday night, the first attack of its kind carried out by the Islamic Republic in years. The Guards statement, published on Wednesday by Sepah News, ran counter to a statement by President Hassan Rouhani who said earlier that the strikes were authorised by the Supreme National Security Council, which includes the heads of the three branches of government as well as the head of the Guards and other ministers. Senior Guard commanders said on Monday that the missile strikes were intended to send a message to  terrorists  who carried out attacks in Tehran two weeks ago as well as their regional and international supporters, a reference to Saudi Arabia and the United States. Khamenei's personal directive for the missile strikes, as reported by the Guards, highlighted their symbolic importance. The complex attacks in Tehran included shootings and at least one suicide bombing at the Iranian parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, south of the capital. Eighteen people were killed. Islamic State claimed responsibility for these attacks but senior Iranian officials pointed a finger at Saudi Arabia, the Islamic Republic's biggest regional rival.  Tensions between mostly Shi'ite Iran and Saudi Arabia, which is predominantly Sunni, have ramped up in recent months as both countries compete for power and influence across the region. The two countries support opposite sides in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.  Field operatives from the Quds Force, the branch of the Guards responsible for operations outside Iran's borders, gathered intelligence on the targets inside Syria before the strike, the Guards' statement said. More than 170  terrorists  including some commanders were killed in the missile strike, their statement said. Reuters could not independently verify the claim.

David Chukwuneke Adindu, 29, entered his plea to two conspiracy counts before U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan, according to an announcement from Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan. Prosecutors said Adindu took part in scams in which emails were sent impersonating executives or vendors of companies, directing employees of those companies to make large wire transfers. Such scams are known as  business email compromise.  Adindu, who was arrested at a Houston airport last year, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 26. The more serious of the two counts carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, while the other carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. Lawyers for Adindu could not immediately be reached for comment. Prosecutors said in an indictment last year that Adindu, who during the period in question resided in both Guangzhou, China and Lagos, Nigeria, worked with others to carry out business email compromise scams from 2014 to 2016. Prosecutors said the scammers' targets included an unnamed New York investment firm, where an employee received an email claiming in June 2015 to be from an investment adviser at another firm asking for a $25,200 wire transfer. The employee later learned the email was not actually sent by that adviser, and as a result did not comply with a second wire transfer request for $75,100, according to the indictment. The case is U.S. v. Adindu, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-cr-00575.

The 36-year-old Moroccan who part-detonated a suitcase packed with nails and gas bottles on Tuesday appeared to have acted alone, was virtually unknown in his home area and had never been identified by police as a threat. From Nice to London, men acting alone with guns, knives or  trucks have carried out deadly assaults following calls by Islamic State for followers to attack in their home countries, rather than fight in Syria and Iraq as it loses ground there. Belgian authorities have identified the Brussels attacker only as O.Z. A Belgian security source told Reuters he was Oussama Zariouh. In an overnight raid, investigators found in his home bomb-making materials similar to the chemicals used in the attacks by Islamic State on Brussels airport and metro that killed 32 people last year. Zariouh had lived in the poor Brussels borough of Molenbeek since 2013. But unlike the militants who helped plan the 2015 Paris attacks and who also lived there, Zariouh was largely unheard of, according to interviews with residents.   Oussama is not an uncommon name, so I've heard the name, but here, in this area, no I don't know him,  said a Belgian-Moroccan woman called Jamila who lived near Zariouh's home, echoing the sentiment of other residents. According to Molenbeek Mayor Francoise Schepmans, Zariouh had been investigated only for a minor drug offence. A Facebook account with his name and matching details said he had graduated from a Moroccan university in 2002 and was self-employed. His postings showed no obviously radical comments or militant links and attracted very few responses.  Do It on Your Own  The account, not updated for a year, showed many shots of Zariouh, clean-shaven or with a thin beard, apparently alone at the wheel of a car.  The fact that police couldn't find him in their databases is a bit of a shock, given that lots of searches and raids have been made since the Paris attacks in Molenbeek,  said Bruno Struys, a Belgian author who writes on Islamist fighters. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the abortive Tuesday attack. Kenneth Lasoen, a security and intelligence expert at the University of Ghent, said its clumsiness showed a lack of operational support.    This looks like the work of a lone wolf,  Lasoen said.  He did not know what he was doing. If this had been Daesh (Islamic State), he would have had better instructions about how to do this awful act.       After Zariouh part-detonated his suitcase bomb, he ran downstairs to the station platforms, then ran back up to the concourse and towards a soldier on a routine patrol, shouting  Allahu akbar  - God is greatest, in Arabic.  The soldier shot him several times.     Zariouh's isolation may reflect militants' greater need for secrecy as Europe's security forces step up their surveillance, after years of under-funding of spy services and squabbling among governments.  Because of the heightened security, if militants want to be successful in a planning an attack, they cannot make their intentions clear to anyone, because at some point that will be picked up by the intelligence services,  Lasoen said.  Daesh is saying: as much as you can, do it on your own,  he said.

In an abortive attack that Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said could have been far worse, the man likely made the bomb at his home in the Brussels borough of Molenbeek, a known hotbed of radicalized Muslims, investigators said.  There are also indications that the suspect had sympathies for the terrorist organization IS,  the prosecutors said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State. While little is known about the dead man, who was shot by a soldier on Tuesday evening, any confirmed militant links could fit it into a pattern of recent attacks in European cities claimed by IS, including in London, Paris and Berlin. There was no immediate claim of responsibility on Wednesday. Molenbeek, a poor borough with a big Moroccan Muslim population, gained notoriety after an Islamic State cell based there mounted suicide attacks on Paris in November 2015 that killed 130 people. Associates of that group attacked Brussels itself four months later, killing 32 people. A counter-terrorism prosecutor said the man, who a security source named as Oussama Zariouh and was identified officially as O.Z., was a 36-year-old Moroccan citizen. He set off his bomb on a crowded station concourse below ground at 8:44 p.m. (2.44 p.m. ET), prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said. Walking up to some passengers,  he grabbed his suitcase, while shouting and causing a partial explosion. Fortunately, nobody was hurt,  Van Der Sypt said. Related CoverageBrussels station attacker was secretive lonerBrussels attacker may have supported Islamic State: prosecutorsThe suitcase, later found to contain nails and gas bottles, caught fire and then detonated a second time more violently as the man ran downstairs to the platforms.

The soldier, part of a routine patrol, shot him several times. Bomb disposal experts checked the body and found he was not carrying more explosives. Police raided the man's home overnight, Van Der Sypt said.  Molenbeek Mayor Francoise Schepmans told reporters that Zariouh was on police files over a drug case last year and was divorced. Bruno Struys, a Belgian author who writes on Islamist militants, said Zariouh had lived in Belgium since 2002, was married from 2004-2007 and moved to Molenbeek in 2013.

The Belgian capital, home to the headquarters of NATO and the European Union, took a heavy hit to its tourist industry after last year's deadly attacks at Brussels airport and in the Brussels metro. In Tuesday's incident, visitors and residents out enjoying a hot summer's evening on the ornate Renaissance town square, the Grand Place, close to Central Station, were cleared quickly away by police. Smoke billowed through the 1930s station's marble halls, sending people fleeing, well aware of last year's attacks at Brussels airport and on the metro, as well as of a string of Islamic State-inspired assaults, most recently in Britain.  Such isolated acts will continue in Brussels, in Paris and elsewhere. It's inevitable,  Brussels security consultant Claude Moniquet, a former French agent, told broadcaster RTL. With Islamic State under pressure in Syria, he said, attacks in Europe may increase, though many would be by  amateurs .

The Big Sick  explores Nanjiani's cultural conflict as a Pakistani Muslim comedian in a post-9/11 America. His life is further complicated when he falls in love with Gordon, played by Zoe Kazan, and goes against his family's wishes that he marry a Pakistani woman.  The film, out in limited U.S. release on Friday, is  coming out at a time when there's a lot of anti-Muslim sentiment, there's a lot of Islamophobia,  Nanjiani said in an interview.  By depicting a Muslim family as like normal people, that's its big political statement,  said Nanjiani, who is also the first Pakistani leading man in a Hollywood romantic comedy. The movie arrives after U.S. President Donald Trump's call during his 2016 election campaign for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States    Now in the White House, Trump is seeking to ban travelers from six Muslim-majority countries in a case awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court decision. Nanjiani, 39, best known for playing snarky programmer Dinesh in HBO's comedy  Silicon Valley,  and Gordon said they did not predict the film would wade into a hot-button issue.   It obviously feels so weirdly timely but it also does have this expectation on it that it really wasn't built for,  Nanjiani said.

Three Oakland police chiefs resigned in quick succession last year after the East Bay Express newspaper reported that numerous officers in Oakland and elsewhere sexually exploited the teenager.  Seven current and former San Francisco Bay Area law enforcement officers, including five from Oakland police, were criminally charged last year in connection with the sex scandal, including some charges of sex acts with a minor.  In the report on Wednesday, court investigators Edward Swanson and Audrey Barron found Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf and other local officials did not do enough to learn why police had not investigated the allegations more thoroughly.  Although they took the appropriate step of hiring an outside attorney to investigate this issue, many months passed with no investigative progress, and there is no evidence city leaders pressed to ensure this troubling and important question was being answered,  the 31-page report said. Representatives for Schaaf and Oakland police could not immediately be reached for comment. The Oakland Police Department has been under federal court supervision since 2003 due to accusations that some officers engaged in excessive force and planted evidence. FILE PHOTO - Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf speaks to members of the media at the scene of a fatal warehouse fire in the Fruitvale district of Oakland, California, U.S. on December 5, 2016.Stephen Lam/File PhotoOakland officials in January named a high-ranking Chicago law enforcement official, Anne Kirkpatrick, as the first woman to head its police department. Schaaf has publicly slammed the department for its  toxic  and  macho  culture.  Officials at the department became aware of the scandal after an officer killed himself at his home in September 2015.  In his suicide note, the officer wrote that he had interacted with the teenager and she claimed that as a minor she was involved with other Oakland policemen.  The case was assigned to the Oakland Police Department's internal affairs unit because it contained allegations of sexual misconduct. But the resulting investigation, including by the internal affairs unit, was  wholly inadequate,  the report said.  Exacerbating these problems was the tone at the top,  it said, adding that former Police Chief Sean Whent  sent an unmistakable signal that this case was not a priority.  Whent could not be reached for comment. Oakland officials last month agreed to pay the woman, who is now 19 years old, nearly $1 million to settle her claim against the city, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The judge ordered a stop to future evictions in a move that could prevent an estimated 270,000 other residents of Lagos from losing their prime waterfront homes to development. The court case against the government - launched by the Lagos-based human rights organization Justice and Empowerment Initiative (JEI) - was run on behalf of dozens of waterfront communities throughout Lagos state.  People were dancing in the streets afterward. The judge began reading his lengthy ruling at about 11:30 a.m. and finished around midday,  Megan Chapman, JEI co-executive director, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone. Justice Adeniyi Onigbanjo ruled that the rights of the residents had been violated and ordered that the state government stop further evictions and discuss re-settlement. The government had no immediate comment on the ruling. Campaigners hailed the ruling as a vindication for poorer residents, whose prime land in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, is cleared to make way for luxury flats.  It is a great victory,  said Chapman.  It issues an injunction against the government carrying out any further evictions. They must also consult and arrange for re-settlement if they are to continue with any further eviction.  One man was shot dead and another wounded when the Lagos state police launched the fourth wave of forced removals from  the Otodo Gbame waterfront communities in April.  The Lagos state government announced its intention to demolish all waterfront slums last October, saying it was for  public safety . A month later, bulldozers accompanied by police escorts arrived after midnight and set fire to a first community, forcing residents to flee into their canoes and leaving an estimated 30,000 without shelter. Chapman said most had moved in with friends or relatives, although many were still living in their canoes.  For most, conditions are terrible: if they are lucky they are staying in the homes of relatives or friends, with 10 or 15 additional people in a single, family home.  she said.

Seattle's Mariners, Seahawks, Sounders FC, Storm and Reign said they had coordinated back-to-back matches and other activities this week to mark LGBT Pride Month, a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people (LGBT).      The first pride match will pit the Sounders, a soccer club that competes in the top men's soccer league in the United States and Canada, against Orlando City SC on Wednesday evening. Other pride matches were to feature Major League Baseball team the Mariners hosting the Detroit Tigers, Women's National Basketball Association team the Storm playing the Phoenix Mercury, and National Women's Soccer League team the Reign hosting FC Kansas City. The Seahawks, a professional American football franchise, would not host a pride match because it was off season. But it was planning other events, including lighting its stadium's iconic arches in the rainbow colors that symbolize LGBT pride, a team spokesman said on Tuesday. The teams said they had come together in the hope of spreading a message of acceptance to as many fans as possible.  With the unique place that sport has in our culture, it's incredibly important that teams take advantage of their platforms in order to make a difference,  said Adrian Hanauer, the owner of the Sounders FC in a statement. It was the first time that the entire professional sports roster of a city was banding together to champion LGBT rights, said Hudson Taylor, the executive director of non-profit Athlete Ally, which helped bring the teams together. Discrimination against LGBT athletes was most visible in locker rooms, with only one openly out athlete competing in U.S. professional men's sports leagues among some 4,000 of his peers, he said at the press conference.  Locker rooms continue to be among the least safe spaces for LGBTQ youth,  said Taylor.  Every day we hear from members of the athletic community who remained scared about competing as their true selves.  In 2015, an international study commissioned by LGBT groups and the government of Australia found 80 percent of respondents had witnessed or experienced homophobia in a sporting context. LGBT Pride Month takes place in June in the United States to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, which marked a turning point for gay rights in the United States.

The police took documents and computer files from Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI), UniCredit (CRDI.MI), Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), Banco BPM (BAMI.MI) and Popolare di Bari, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. All five banks declined to comment. Three sources listed all five banks, while several other sources said documents had been seized from lenders but did not list the names of all five institutions. Diamond brokers have been using Italian banks to sell high-quality investment diamonds in a business that totaled at least 300 million euros ($334 million) in sales in 2015, according to broker data. Diamond sales have taken off as negative interest rates have curtailed bank revenues and rendered many other investments unattractive for clients. Banks make a one-off commission of at least 10 percent on diamond sales, in return for putting the diamond brokers in touch with their clients, between whom the contract is signed. The business usually accounts for no more than 2 percent of a lender's total fees. Italian market regulator Consob opened an investigation last year into the sale of diamonds through bank branches after a TV report alleged the stones were missold to the public. Consumer associations have also said they received complaints. In several cases, people have told Reuters that diamonds they had bought as an investment were valued at a much lower price than they paid for them. Selling diamonds with the promise of a financial return is banned in Italy unless regulated in the same way as other financial products, such as mutual funds. Banks and brokers say they do not promise a financial return when selling the stones.

The committee nonetheless approved 11 billion euros of purchases for the armed forces, including five corvette warships for two billion euros. The Defence Ministry had warned against delays, saying the purchases were urgently needed to modernize an army weakened by years of spending cuts. Christine Lambrecht, a lawmaker from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), had earlier said that the budget committee would delay a decision on the whole funding package as her party needed more time for consultations. Defence minister Ursula von der Leyen is eager to get the requests approved before a Sept. 24 general election as delays could further hobble a military trying to rebuild after years of post-Cold War cuts and prepare for added responsibilities. The SPD are junior coalition partners of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU and their Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). After the postponement, Von der Leyen told ARD television that the procurement of the Israeli drones, favored by the military because they are compatible with models they already own, was still under discussion. Some SPD lawmakers have reservations about leasing Heron TP drones from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) which can be armed and used to protect soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Mali. The higher court in Duesseldorf in May dismissed a legal challenge by U.S. weapons maker General Atomics to Germany's plans to lease the drones from rival IAI. But the court this month said it had put the deal on hold again as it considers a complaint by General Atomics against its decision. Some SPD lawmakers want the budget committee to delay a decision on the deal until a final court decision.  Germany already has three earlier versions of the Heron reconnaissance drone which are deployed in Afghanistan. They are maintained by Airbus and cannot be armed. Germany is supposed to be taking on added responsibilities within NATO and the European Union. The army is also facing a probe into right-wing radicalism in its ranks.

The news follows a string of initiatives by the seller marketplace to catch up to e-commerce rivals, and ultimately set itself apart as a haven for finding treasures online rather than commodity products. In the fall, eBay will guarantee three-day delivery for tens of millions of items for the first time - a logistical feat that Amazon.com Inc has already mastered. EBay has also shifted away from its former core - online auctions - toward fixed-price sales in line with big retailers. Now, eBay will guarantee that the roughly 50,000 new products on its Deals site will be at least as cheap as identical items sold by Amazon, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and other major retailers on the web. Shoppers must contact eBay's customer service team about relevant price disparities to receive a coupon they can apply at checkout. The move may be a jab at Amazon, which cut back on price-matching last year.  Consumers are still very price conscious,  said Hal Lawton, senior vice president of North America at eBay, in an interview.

I will tell you that we are investigating this incident today that happened at about 9:45 this morning as an act of terrorism,  David Gelios, special agent in charge of the Detroit division of the FBI, told reporters outside Bishop International Airport.  The U.S. Department of Justice identified the suspect as Amor M. Ftouhi, 49, of Quebec, Canada. Ftouhi legally entered the United States from Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, Gelios said.  According to a criminal complaint, Ftouhi yelled in Arabic   Allahu akbar  (God is greatest) before stabbing Lieutenant Jeff Neville of the airport's Department of Public Safety.  Neville was in satisfactory condition after undergoing surgery and expected to fully recover, police said.  When the subject went up to the officer and stabbed him, he continued to exclaim 'Allah' and made a statement, something to the effect of 'You have killed people in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and we are all going to die,  Gelios said.  Ftouhi has been charged with violence at an international airport, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Gelios said other charges could be lodged against Ftouhi. U.S. officials, who have questioned Ftouhi, currently believe he acted alone and was not part of a larger plot, Gelios said.   Suffice it to say, he has a hatred for the United States,  Gelios said of Ftouhi.  Gelios described the weapon as a 12-inch knife with an 8-inch serrated blade. Ftouhi was a  lone wolf attacker,  he said.  Amor Ftouhi, arrested in connection with the stabbing of a police officer at Bishop International Airport in Flint, Michigan, is shown in this photo released by the FBI in Flint, Michigan, U.S., June 22, 2017. FBI/Handout via REUTERSIt took four people to subdue Ftouhi, including the officer he stabbed and a nearby maintenance worker, said Chris Miller, the airport's director of public safety. Miller and another officer also assisted. According to the criminal complaint, after he was subdued  Ftouhi asked why he had not been killed. The airport was evacuated and there were no other injuries. It reopened on Wednesday evening. A small regional airport, it has, on average, 16 commercial flights arriving or departing each day, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Slideshow (7 Images)Officials in the United States and Canada condemned the attack and said that agencies in both countries would work together to investigate the incident.   Any attack on someone who serves and protects our citizens will be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,  U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement, adding that he had spoken with FBI officials about the attack. Canada's Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale called the attack  heinous and cowardly.    We will do everything we possibly can to assist in this matter,  Goodale told reporters. Police in Montreal went to an apartment building in the city’s Saint Michel area on Wednesday in connection with the stabbing, according to Radio-Canada, the French-language arm of Canada’s public broadcaster.  Radio-Canada reported that police questioned three people but did not search the apartment.  Police were guarding the entrance and rear doorway of the four-story building in Saint Michel, a lower income neighborhood with a large immigrant population, according to a Reuters eyewitness. A small crowd had gathered across the street.  Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not immediately return Reuters requests for comment.

The committee nonetheless approved 11 billion euros of purchases for the armed forces, including five corvette warships for two billion euros. The Defence Ministry had warned against delays, saying the purchases were urgently needed to modernize an army weakened by years of spending cuts. Christine Lambrecht, a lawmaker from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), had earlier said that the budget committee would delay a decision on the whole funding package as her party needed more time for consultations. Defence minister Ursula von der Leyen is eager to get the requests approved before a Sept. 24 general election as delays could further hobble a military trying to rebuild after years of post-Cold War cuts and prepare for added responsibilities. The SPD are junior coalition partners of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU and their Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). After the postponement, Von der Leyen told ARD television that the procurement of the Israeli drones, favored by the military because they are compatible with models they already own, was still under discussion. Some SPD lawmakers have reservations about leasing Heron TP drones from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) which can be armed and used to protect soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Mali. The higher court in Duesseldorf in May dismissed a legal challenge by U.S. weapons maker General Atomics to Germany's plans to lease the drones from rival IAI. But the court this month said it had put the deal on hold again as it considers a complaint by General Atomics against its decision. Some SPD lawmakers want the budget committee to delay a decision on the deal until a final court decision.  Germany already has three earlier versions of the Heron reconnaissance drone which are deployed in Afghanistan. They are maintained by Airbus and cannot be armed. Germany is supposed to be taking on added responsibilities within NATO and the European Union. The army is also facing a probe into right-wing radicalism in its ranks.

The largest U.S. health insurer, which sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states including New York and California, for months has said that uncertainty over the payments used to make insurance more affordable could cause it to exit markets. The subsidies are available to low-income Americans who buy individual health insurance on the exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump have promised to repeal and replace the law, but have disagreed over the details, creating uncertainty at a time when insurers must submit plans and premium rates for 2018.  Planning and pricing for ACA-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations,  Anthem spokeswoman Leslie Porras said.

With only 20 working days to go before a lengthy August recess, some Republican lawmakers say a bipartisan agreement could help clear a legislative schedule crammed with other top priorities, including a separate budget resolution, tax reform, infrastructure and an increase in the federal debt limit. In December 2013, Republican Representative Paul Ryan, now speaker of the House of Representatives, and Democratic Senator Patty Murray worked out a two-year deal that canceled some spending cuts in fiscal 2014 and 2015 in return for some longer-term spending reductions. The Ryan-Murray agreement was promptly enacted into law. A bipartisan deal could avert a restrictive spending plan that would cap funding for U.S. agencies and a government shutdown threatened by President Donald Trump.  I think what we need is another Ryan-Murray sort of proposal,  said Republican Representative Mike Simpson, a senior member of the House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee, which is in charge of writing annual spending bills. Speaking to reporters after a House Republican meeting, Simpson said the idea was in the early stages. Republicans, who control the House and Senate, have lashed out at deep spending cuts that Trump has proposed. But they are divided over how much top-line spending should be appropriated next year, including for a military buildup Trump wants. A bipartisan negotiation is just one of several options. Another would rush one massive spending bill for fiscal 2018 through the House in July, instead of the dozen separate appropriations bills that Congress tries to write every year. Doing so would allow Republicans to tout an accomplishment to their constituents in August during a year that has so far seen few legislative achievements. Given the limited time to write such a bill, Ryan might have to resort to just passing a  national security  spending bill that would fund the military and other security activities. Some Republicans want to boost military spending to $640 billion, which would require deep cuts to non-defense programs that are popular among Republican moderates.   Congress must also pass a budget resolution to facilitate tax reform legislation. The House Budget Committee hopes to mark up such a measure before June 30, panel members said.

The U.S. index provider said on Tuesday it would add 222 China-listed stocks to its Emerging Markets Index, tracked by around $1.6 trillion, in what analysts and investors described as a gesture designed to end a four-year impasse with regulators over China's remaining market controls. But they said it could still take as long as a decade for MSCI to include Chinese shares at the country's full weighting, citing ongoing uncertainty over the pace of reform, the risk of regulatory shifts and weak corporate governance.  MSCI is at a crossroads. There has been a bit of a stand-off between MSCI and the Chinese regulators, with both parties keen for inclusion to happen - but there are still all these issues unresolved,  said Douglas Morton, Head of Research Asia at Northern Trust Capital Markets.  The government does step in to support the market. From an international investor's point of view, there are concerns that this is not a freely floated index,  said Morton, noting Western governments were not immune to similar interventions. Although China has made strides with its liberalization agenda, it has also proved willing to temporarily row-back on reforms at times of crisis. Beijing intervened heavily in the stock market during the 2015 crash, imposing a raft of capital controls only months before the International Monetary Fund made a decision to include the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies.     MSCI has been in discussions with Chinese regulators and global investors for four years over whether to add yuan-denominated shares to the benchmark, but long excluded them because of restricted access to China's equity markets. The company said it could add a selection of 222 large-cap stocks at a tiny weight of just 0.73 percent, because these shares can be easily traded through a Hong Kong-China  Connect  link. Increasing that weighting will require further market liberalization, from allowing capital to flow more freely in and out of equities to addressing the high number of stocks that are suspended for long periods. The MSCI logo is seen in this June 20, 2017 illustration photo.Thomas White/IllustrationLong March Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI, said he could not provide an indicative timeline for full inclusion, or an initial weighting increase.  It's really in the hands of the Chinese stakeholders, they are dictating the timing,  he told reporters. Global investors Schroders, Robeco and Manulife asset management estimated full inclusion could take as long as a decade - longer than already protracted processes for South Korea and Taiwan.  I think it could take five to 10 years for China to be represented at half its total weight in the global indices. In terms of the uplift in inclusion factor, I'd be surprised if they make a following adjustment next year,  said David MacKenzie, head of Asian Equity Management at Schroders.  And China still has hearts and minds to win elsewhere. Despite MSCI's move, Mark Makepeace, CEO of MSCI rival FTSE Russell, which compiles the other major emerging market benchmark, told Reuters that many investors continued to have reservations about the China market.   The obligations of China with respect to opening up to international investors in the event of inclusion need to be clear,  he said in an interview. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's securities watchdog, said in a statement that inclusion was  both an opportunity and a challenge for reform  and that China would continue to try to internationalize its market while promoting stability at home.  A  share inclusion and an influx of institutional investors should help promote Beijing's reform agenda over the long term, but investors worry the addition of the new shares, the bulk of which will be in China's troubled financial and industrial sectors, also poses near-term risk.  In our experience, many Chinese A-share managements have yet to fully grasp the duties imposed by a listing, not to mention inclusion in a global index,  said Gary Greenberg, head of emerging markets at Hermes Investment Management, in a note.  The ability to communicate with foreign investors, even in companies with worldwide operations, tends to be less than world class. For businesses with top line revenues that can top $15 billion, this should have been fixed by now.

Mutual funds are heavily favored by retail investors, while ETFs draw an increasingly diverse set of clients, including fast-trading hedge funds. The heavy buying helped take the pressure out of a market grappling with weaker oil prices, soft economic data, a rotation out of go-go technology names and an interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the second this year. Stock fund outflows were $7.7 billion the week before. Yet market volatility has remained below its historical averages.  There's a lot of complacency in the market,  said Neil Constable, head of the global equity team at GMO LLC.  It feels a lot like late 2006, early 2007.  In recent weeks the spread between short and long-term U.S. government bonds has narrowed, a  curve flattening  that could portend lower economic growth and inflation forecasts. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 96 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007. Constable said fast-rising growth stocks have become increasingly expensive and investors should favor higher-quality shares that could hold up better if a market downturn comes. Yet, by contrast, falling yields and a sinking premium for long-term bonds could boost growth stocks further. In that case,  this reach for yield trade, and this reach for growth trade, will continue to manifest,  Constable said.

Trump,Ron Wyden,Scott Gottlieb,US,HEALTH,FDA,GENERICDRUGS,Science,United States","sector":"Life","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration moved on Wednesday to prevent pharmaceutical companies from  gaming  the system to block or delay entry of generic rivals. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a blog post that the agency plans to hold a public meeting on July 18 to identify ways pharmaceutical companies are using FDA rules to place obstacles in the way of generic competition.  We know that sometimes our regulatory rules might be 'gamed' in ways that may delay generic drug approvals beyond the time frame the law intended, in order to reduce competition,  he said in the blog post.  We are actively looking at ways our rules are being used and, in some cases, misused.  The move comes as President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Congress search for ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Trump is preparing to put out an executive order on drug pricing, according to media reports, and last week U.S. Senator Ron Wyden introduced a bill to require companies to explain the reasons for significant price increases.  Americans are sick and tired of seeing the cost of their prescription drugs race past their paychecks,  said Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.  The FDA does not include price considerations when deciding whether to approve a new drug, but Gottlieb said the agency can facilitate increased competition by approving lower-cost generics. That means removing some of the obstacles placed by branded companies in the way of generic manufacturers. These obstacles can include limiting the availability of branded products for testing by generic companies, or prolonging negotiations with generic companies over the implementation of shared risk-management programs. Gottlieb said recently that the FDA is evaluating whether to waive a requirement that generic companies and brand companies share a single system to ensure a drug's safe use. The FDA's move comes two days after Republican Senator Chuck Grassley urged Gottlieb in a letter to consider recommendations in two bills co-sponsored by Grassley to enhance access to generic drugs; and encouraged him to work closely with the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to address anti-competitive behavior in the drug industry. Representatives from the pharmaceutical industry's main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, were not immediately available for comment.  Gottlieb said the agency plans to examine policy and program changes, including using its own authorities more forcefully and potentially collaborating more closely with other agencies.

But washing cloth diapers in water-starved Los Angeles wasn’t an environment-friendly alternative, either. Then Dr. Rosemary She read about a way to skip diapers altogether.  Called elimination communication, the method has parents and caregivers tune into a baby’s cues and natural rhythms and bring the child to a toilet when it seems like the right time. Skeptical but determined to find a workable alternative to diapers, She gave it a try as soon as she brought her newborn daughter home from the hospital. “I put her over a potty, gently held her legs, supported her belly, and she went,” she said in a phone interview. “It was kind of mind-blowing.” She and her husband, Dr. Jeffrey Bender, extoll the benefits of going diaper-free in an editorial published today in Pediatrics. She is a pathologist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Bender is a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles. “For young families interested in protecting the environment for future generations, who want to save some money and keep their kids healthy, this is a good option,” he told Reuters Health.   “It’s not for everyone, and we don’t want people to feel bad if they can’t do it,” he said. “We really want people to hear about it as an option.” He would like pediatricians to spread the word about the benefits of going diaper-less.  Elimination communication not only spares the environment, it may stave off urinary tract infections and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, skin infections, Bender said. His practice is filled with cases of MRSA, and he tells parents that the best way to prevent MRSA abscesses is to get their children out of diapers. Bender and She believe keeping babies’ bottoms bare also could improve parent-infant bonding, speed toilet training and make it easier for toddlers to walk unimpeded by bulky padding. But Dr. Valerie Kimball, a professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, is not sold on the health benefits of elimination communication and sees no reason to introduce the subject with already overburdened parents in her pediatric practice, she said in a phone interview. During her 14 years as a children’s doctor, Kimball has heard about infants going diaper-free from a handful of parents whose own parents or grandparents brought the practice from Asia and Eastern Europe. She would endorse the technique but would only raise the subject with parents who told her they already were considering elimination communication, she said. “I wouldn’t want to put this out there and have people feel guilty,” she said. “There are so many other things I’d rather have them worry about,” such as breastfeeding and providing their children with healthy food. “There are a lot of pressures, and this would be one other pressure. If someone came to me and asked about it, I would say, ‘give it a try,’ but I don’t think I would necessarily recommend it,” she said. Some of Bender’s patients’ parents and grandparents told him they learned about the practice in their home countries, El Salvador and Bangladesh, for example.  Before She seriously considered going diaper-free, her mother mentioned that in her native Taiwan in the 1940s, in the decade before disposal diapers came on the American market, a caretaker would hold an infant over a latrine, whistle, and the child would urinate.  “I thought that was the most ridiculous thing I ever heard, and I laughed at her,” She said. “And here I am really supporting this idea and this option for young parents.” She and Bender took turns caring for their diaper-less daughter, who is now 5, and enjoyed competing over which one of them had fewer accidents.  But it would have been difficult for daycare providers to care for a baby without diapers. So when the couple returned to work, they hired a nanny.  They didn’t at first realize that the nanny had her own experience with elimination communication. After she started working for She and Bender, the nanny learned that her Taiwanese grandmother had cared for her without diapers as an infant, too.

The study, released on Wednesday, said weak performance among asset managers was driving the shift toward lower research revenues. New regulations that will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly was another factor, it said.   The traditional investment management industry has posted poor results over the last decade, with more than 80 percent of active managers underperforming their benchmarks, McKinsey said in its report. As a result, funds are becoming more selective about how they spend their research dollars, the global management consulting firm said. In addition, a new European regulation called Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II, means banks will be required to put price tags on their research. Previously, research was bundled within trading commissions with asset managers and hedge funds determining how to allocate their research budgets through a vote. Banks have not yet slashed research department jobs, despite the outlook for shrinking revenues, but McKinsey said big cuts could come in the next three or four years.  For banks to compete, McKinsey said they must invest in new types of research that their investor clients find useful, including those that incorporate technologies like big data and artificial intelligence. They must also offer more dynamic pricing for research and reposition coverage to focus on geographic regions where they have proven expertise, McKinsey added.

Chastened by an election which left her Conservative Party short of a majority in parliament and reopened debate on the nature of Britain's EU exit, May also sidelined reform on social care, education and corporate governance. May's two-year program, known as the Queen's Speech and prepared by ministers, was read out by Queen Elizabeth at parliament's opening ceremony. She has yet to secure a deal with Northern Ireland's DUP party to prop up her government. The queen told lawmakers from both the upper and lower houses of parliament that the government is committed to building  the widest possible consensus  on Brexit, working with parliament, devolved administrations, business and others.  My government's priority is to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union,  the queen said. The traditionally ceremonial address, usually dominated by pageantry, was a crucial testing ground for May's ability to run the country during its most challenging period for generations.     Her authority has been badly damaged just as Britain begins Brexit negotiations. Four militant attacks have raised questions about her grip on national security, and the death of at least 79 people in a tower block fire has become a flashpoint for public anger at her party's record in government.  The election result was not the one I hoped for, but this government will respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent,  May said in remarks introducing the policy plan.  First, we need to get Brexit right. That means getting a deal which delivers the result of last year’s referendum and does so in a way that commands maximum public support.  The shift to a more consultative tack drew a cautious welcome from business groups, which worry that May's plan focuses more on controlling immigration than protecting the economy.  Her new approach will be tested almost immediately, when she travels to Brussels on Thursday for a summit of EU leaders. Related CoverageTalks to support UK PM May's Conservatives making progress, Northern Irish party saysUK Foreign Secretary Johnson says Trump's visit to Britain will go aheadLawmakers will have to approve the speech in a vote, expected on June 29, that will be a de facto vote of confidence. Minority governments are a rare occurrence in British parliamentary politics where the electoral system usually produces a governing majority. May is under increasing pressure to do a deal with the DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) to support her government after nearly two weeks of talks. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, whose surprisingly strong election performance damaged May, called the speech  thin gruel . He said the government was ignoring the need for important domestic reforms to promote social justice.  A threadbare legislative program from a government that has lost its majority and apparently run out of ideas altogether,  he told parliament. The Queen delivered the speech in a toned-down ceremony that dispensed with a horse-drawn procession to parliament, and she swapped her crown for a blue hat. The changes to the ceremony were planned and due to a lack of rehearsal time. Britain's Queen Elizabeth sits next to Prince Charles during the State Opening of Parliament in central London, Britain June 21, 2017.Stefan Rousseau/PoolShe was accompanied by Prince Charles after her 96-year-old husband, Philip, was taken to hospital with an infection.  Brexit Focus As London sweltered in unseasonably hot weather, about 250 protesters gathered outside parliament after the speech, blaming the deadly fire in west London on years of Conservative cuts and demanding the fall of May's government.  May apologized for the government's inadequate response to that fire and acknowledged the country faced  difficult times .  Not every problem can be solved by an act of parliament,  she said.  Our response to disaster and acts of terror which take the lives of innocent people must be this: compassion, unity, resolve.   The legislative program spelt out a Brexit-dominated set of policies and indicated May was keen to secure broad support for leaving the EU - a change in tone from the strident approach she set out before the June 8 election. Slideshow (14 Images) While this will be a government that consults and listens, we are clear that we are going to see Brexit through, working with parliament, business, the devolved administrations and others to ensure a smooth and orderly withdrawal,  she said. A briefing document issued alongside the speech said the government would consult more closely with businesses and other interested parties to  test and validate positions and to continue to build support from the business community as we move forward .  This welcome change in tone needs to be backed by clarity and action now,  the Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry lobby group, Carolyn Fairbairn, said.   Firms will expect all politicians to put pragmatism before politics, starting with Brexit,  she said. Manufacturers' group EEF said industry needed more information on how the benefits of the EU's single market and customs union would be maintained throughout Britain's exit.  There must be a much closer partnership with industry if we're to avoid economic chaos when we leave the EU,  EEF Chief Executive Terry Scuoler said.  May's program for government was largely restricted to the technical work of making sure Brexit can happen: a bill that sets out how the government will transpose huge swathes of EU law into British law and separate bills on related topics such as immigration, customs and fisheries.  Beyond Brexit, the plan included a promise to pay more attention to public concerns about austerity, but did not alter the government's commitment to bring down the budget deficit. It also outlined plans to allow sectors such as electric vehicles and satellite technology to maintain a competitive edge, as well as promising to deliver an industrial strategy that spread prosperity across the country. May's plans will need the support of Northern Ireland's DUP, which is expected to use its 10 votes to back her in exchange for more funding to the province, policies geared toward boosting its economy and assurances that Brexit will not cut it off from the neighboring Irish Republic. But that deal has yet to be announced, and on Tuesday the DUP said the talks were not going as was expected. The party should not be taken for granted, it said.

There is no deadline. My hope is that we can get it done by the end of the year, but there are a lot of people who think that is completely unrealistic,  Lighthizer told a Senate Finance Committee hearing to discuss the USTR's budget. He said reaching a NAFTA deal by year-end was a  very, very quick timeframe (and) we're not going to have a bad agreement to save time.  Under U.S. law, Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer, will be the principal U.S. negotiator on NAFTA, although U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will have a major role. The renegotiation of the 23-year-old NAFTA was a key campaign promise of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to shrink trade deficits with other countries. While the talks are expected to begin in mid-August, Lighthizer said discussions were underway with Canada and Mexico to firm up a start date.  We are in the process right now talking to our negotiating partners about when the first day of the meeting will be,  he added. A number of senators urged Lighthizer to avoid lengthy negotiations, which they warned would hurt sales by American businesses and farmers. Lighthizer was also pressed on the Trump administration's investigation into whether foreign steel and aluminum imports threaten U.S. national security. Findings of the investigations are expected by the end of June. Democratic Senator for Missouri Claire McCaskill expressed concern that possible sweeping tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum would impact American manufacturers.  I've got businesses in Missouri who use raw materials which aren't made in the United States and they are very worried about the impact a decision in this area will have on their costs of producing goods, but they are also worried about any other national security blockades,  she said. Lighthizer said while steps were needed to crack down on foreign steel and aluminum flooding the American market, it was likely that an  exclusion process  would be introduced whereby U.S. businesses could apply to import products not made in the United States.  Situations where there are legitimate cases of a manufacturer who needs a steel product or aluminum product not made in the United States should go in and I think they will be accommodated. In most of those cases, it will be accommodated with an exclusion,  he added.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which include Arab and Kurdish fighters and are supported with air strikes by a U.S.-led coalition, began an offensive two weeks ago to seize the northern city from Islamic State, which overran it in 2014. Slideshow (19 Images)Nouri Mahmoud, spokesman for the Kurdish YPG militia which is part of the SDF, told Reuters Islamic State had been ousted from the suburb of Kasrat al-Farj as the SDF moved in along the southern riverbank from the west. When the campaign began the SDF had Raqqa, which sits on the Euphrates' northern bank, surrounded from the north, west and east. Although Islamic State controlled the south bank of the river, coalition air strikes had destroyed the bridges connecting it to the city. The SDF is now trying to enact a siege of the city by taking the southern bank. The forces are a couple of kilometers from achieving this aim. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said on Wednesday SDF forces had moved along the southern river bank to reach the eastern edge of Kasrat al-Farj, in the area between the new and old bridges into Raqqa.  Islamic State is also facing defeat in its Iraqi stronghold of Mosul and is being forced into retreat across much of Syria, where Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria is its last major foothold.

Executives report being busier than ever at this year's Paris Airshow, the oldest and biggest aerospace expo in the world, which featured aerial acrobatics by Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet. But they caution that foreign arms sales take years to complete, and NATO governments must get through lengthy budget and bureaucratic processes before they can raise military spending to meet a NATO target for members to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence.  We're seeing some growth, but I like to be pragmatic. I'm not seeing a big tick up in defence spending across the board,  Leanne Caret, who heads Boeing's defence business, told Reuters in an interview. Her division generates about 40 percent of its revenues overseas, a big change from just several years ago. Boeing officials expect steady gains in weapons sales, but warn against expectations for any kind of  gold rush  despite U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to boost military spending, saying there may be more of a shift in what platforms and weapons programmes are in demand. Recent increases in tensions between Russia and the United States have raised concerns about another arms race, but top officials in both countries agree that there will not be a mad rush to bulk up on weapons. Moscow's top arms trade official, Dmitry Shugaev, told reporters at the show that Russian weapon makers remained competitive despite Western sanctions, but the cyclical nature of the business and budget constraints are dampening prospects for a big surge in global arms sales. He also expressed scepticism that NATO members would rapidly increase their military budgets, despite pledging to move toward the 2 percent goal. Trump's public declarations that NATO members are not pulling their weight may have had some impact. Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics business leader Orlando Carvalho said national security budgets and military systems' demand outside the United States is beginning to increase  especially with the focus that the president has put on NATO.  In 2016, total world military expenditure rose 0.4 percent to $1.69 trillion, according the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The European Union's Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici also cited that risk, warning that European countries needed to match political pledges to boost military spending with actual resource commitments.  There is now a window of opportunity for investing more in European defence ... but as with all windows, a window closes if you don't go through it,  he said. Germany and other European countries are boosting military spending, concerned about terrorism and Russia's increasingly assertive military stance after its annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, but the increases are likely to be more gradual than dramatic. The outlook is a bit more rosy in the missile defence arena, where Western concerns about rapid advances in technology by North Korea, China and Iran, as well as Russia's increased military activities, are driving orders for a range of defensive systems, according to U.S. and European executives.  The threat is absolutely increasing and it's increasing rapidly,  said Tim Cahill, vice president of air and missile defence systems at Lockheed.  In every region around the world, the level of interest in integrated air and missile defence has been going up in the last few months.  Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon Co's Integrated Defense Systems, said he was meeting with officials from countries that had not shown any interest in missile defence systems just four or five year ago.  Back then, they didn't see a ballistic missile threat Or they didn't see Russia as a threat, but now that has changed,  he said.

There is no deadline. My hope is that we can get it done by the end of the year, but there are a lot of people who think that is completely unrealistic,  Lighthizer told a Senate Finance Committee hearing to discuss the USTR's budget. He said reaching a NAFTA deal by year-end was a  very, very quick timeframe (and) we're not going to have a bad agreement to save time.  Under U.S. law, Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer, will be the principal U.S. negotiator on NAFTA, although U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will have a major role. The renegotiation of the 23-year-old NAFTA was a key campaign promise of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to shrink trade deficits with other countries. While the talks are expected to begin in mid-August, Lighthizer said discussions were underway with Canada and Mexico to firm up a start date.  We are in the process right now talking to our negotiating partners about when the first day of the meeting will be,  he added. A number of senators urged Lighthizer to avoid lengthy negotiations, which they warned would hurt sales by American businesses and farmers. Lighthizer was also pressed on the Trump administration's investigation into whether foreign steel and aluminum imports threaten U.S. national security. Findings of the investigations are expected by the end of June. Democratic Senator for Missouri Claire McCaskill expressed concern that possible sweeping tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum would impact American manufacturers.  I've got businesses in Missouri who use raw materials which aren't made in the United States and they are very worried about the impact a decision in this area will have on their costs of producing goods, but they are also worried about any other national security blockades,  she said. Lighthizer said while steps were needed to crack down on foreign steel and aluminum flooding the American market, it was likely that an  exclusion process  would be introduced whereby U.S. businesses could apply to import products not made in the United States.  Situations where there are legitimate cases of a manufacturer who needs a steel product or aluminum product not made in the United States should go in and I think they will be accommodated. In most of those cases, it will be accommodated with an exclusion,  he added.

He said Assad was an enemy of the Syrian people, but not of France and that Paris' priority was fighting terrorist groups and ensuring Syria did not become a failed state. His comments were in stark contrast to those of the previous French administration and echo Moscow's stance that there is no viable alternative to Assad.  The new perspective that I have had on this subject is that I have not stated that Bashar al-Assad's departure is a pre-condition for everything because nobody has shown me a legitimate successor,  Macron said in an interview with eight European newspapers.   My lines are clear: Firstly, a complete fight against all the terrorist groups. They are our enemies,  he said, adding attacks that killed 230 people in France had come from the region.  We need everybody's cooperation, especially Russia, to eradicate them.  Failed State He said the second priority was ensuring the stability of Syria so that it did not become a failed state. In more than six years, the Syrian conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven more than 11 million from their homes. Until now, France has been a backer of the Syrian opposition. It has demanded the conflict be resolved through a credible political transition based on U.N. Security Council resolutions negotiated between Syria's warring parties with the United Nations in Geneva. However, Macron's election victory has offered an opportunity for Paris to re-examine its policy on Syria with some considering the previous administration's stance too intransigent and leaving it isolated. Macron made no mention of the United Nations' role in the interview.   My deep conviction is that there needs to be a diplomatic and political roadmap. We will not resolve this solely militarily,  he said.     France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was in Moscow on Tuesday pushing for closer co-operation with Russia as part of what he said could drive relations to a renewed  spirit of trust . Macron appeared to put his faith firmly in convincing Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek a solution.  I don't think he has an unshakeable friendship with Assad. He has two obsessions, fighting terrorism and avoiding a failed state, and so that's why convergent views on Syria appear,  Macron said.  He said he believed it would be possible to work with Putin to fight terrorism and find a solution to the crisis, although he made clear Paris would no longer let the use of chemical weapons in Syria go unpunished.  The use of chemical weapons will see a response, including by France alone,  he said.  France will therefore be completely aligned with the United States on this.

The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver said a lower court judge erred in dismissing Ghailani's lawsuit over being forbidden to pray Jumu'ah, a Muslim prayer held on Fridays, at the Florence, Colorado, Supermax prison where he is serving a life sentence without parole. Ghailani, 43, a Tanzanian native and former al-Qaeda operative, was the first former detainee at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, military prison to be tried in a U.S. civilian court. A Manhattan federal jury convicted him in 2010 of conspiring to damage or destroy government property in connection with the Aug. 7, 1998 bombings, which killed 224 people. Ghailani had challenged the legality of the prayer ban and other  special administrative measures  (SAMs) imposed on him because of his past ties to terrorism and terrorist groups. In Wednesday's decision, Circuit Judge Stephanie Seymour said the ban did not violate Ghailani's right to freely exercise his religion under the Constitution's First Amendment. But she said Ghailani could try to show that the ban violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which has a different standard of proof. FILE PHOTO: Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, the first Guantanamo detainee to have faced a U.S. civilian trial, is pictured in this undated FBI photograph obtained June 9, 2009.  FBI/Handout viaFile PhotoGhailani  need not plead facts showing that the actions of which he complains were not reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,  or did not advance and were not the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest, Seymour wrote. The appeals court also dismissed as moot Ghailani's claims over other SAMs that the government allowed to expire in June 2015. It returned the case to U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello in Denver. Sean Connelly, who argued Ghailani's appeal in November, in an email said he was pleased the decision requires the government to justify denying Ghailani's  right to engage in the group prayer required by his religion.  A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice declined to comment. In a handwritten brief, Ghailani had said prison officials imposed the SAMs based on  speculation  he might  commit an act of terror  while in prison. He called this a type of  post-hoc rationalization  that Congress tried to prevent when passing the RFRA. The appeals court panel originally included Neil Gorsuch, who became a U.S. Supreme Court justice in April. He did not participate in Wednesday's 2-0 decision.

Turkey has refused to allow German lawmakers to make what they see as a routine visit to the base, saying that Berlin needs to improve its attitude towards Turkey first. Turkey was infuriated when Germany, citing security concerns, banned some Turkish politicians from campaigning on its soil, where many Turks live. Ankara responded by accusing Berlin of  Nazi-like  tactics and reigniting a dispute over Incirlik.  The German Bundestag (parliament) regrets very much that  conditions for the continued stationing of the Bundeswehr in Incirlik are not met,  the Bundestag said in a document that laid out its decision. It said a transfer of the 280 German troops from Incirlik to an air base in Jordan should go ahead swiftly. The Bundestag said on Wednesday its members must have access to troops stationed abroad to fulfill its constitutional duties. German armed forces are subordinated to parliament, not the government, meaning lawmakers have oversight of the troops. Wednesday's approval followed an earlier government decision that troops must move. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, running for a fourth term in the September election, stressed earlier this month that Germany and Turkey have mutual interests and must keep talking even after the withdrawal. Critics accuse Merkel of cosying up to President Tayyip Erdogan to secure his help in stemming the flow of migrants to western Europe. Relations between the NATO allies have soured significantly in the past year. Turkey reacted angrily to German and European criticism of a domestic security crackdown after a failed coup attempt last July.

Mehmet Altan, an economics professor and journalist, and his brother Ahmet were detained in September and charged with giving coded messages in a television talk show a day before the abortive July 15 military coup, according to state media. The brothers both face potential life sentences if convicted in their trial, which opened this week. They have denied the charges, saying it was ridiculous to interpret their comments in the program - during which Mehmet Altan talked about the long history of military involvement in Turkish politics - as incitement to overthrow the government.   If Rousseau were alive today and had shared his views on TV, he would be taken into custody for giving subliminal messages,  Altan told the court, referring to enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.  There were no subliminal messages on that TV program... I have been detained for a non-existent message, over a non-existent crime,  he said according to a copy of his defense statement posted online. The government blames followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen for masterminding the coup, and has waged a crackdown on suspected Gulen supporters since then. Some 150,000 police, soldiers, judges and civil servants have been sacked or suspended, drawing criticism from rights groups and Western allies who fear an attempt to silence dissent. Tens of thousands of people have been arrested.  Turkish officials reject the criticism, saying the extent of the crackdown is justified by the gravity of the threat to the Turkish state in the wake of the coup attempt, when soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets, bombing parliament and other key buildings in an attempt to seize power. Gulen has denied any involvement in the failed coup, and Altan said he had no knowledge of it.  Surely I wasn't aware of the coup attempt. I know that I stand here today just because I did not applaud the slaughter of democracy by the government,  he told the court. Rights groups have voiced concerns over the trial of the Altans, who are among 100 journalists detained in the last year.   There is no possible causal link between the defendants' news articles and the failed coup of July 2016,  said Gabrielle Guillemin from the British rights group Article 19, adding that the charges were part of a  politically motivated campaign of harassment against journalists and other dissenting voices . The TV show's presenter, Nazli Ilicak, a journalist, columnist and former lawmaker, was also arrested.  I am not an enemy of Erdogan. I am just an opponent. Is it a crime to oppose?  Ilicak told the same court a day earlier. More than 200 writers worldwide, including Margaret Atwood, Russell Banks and JM Coetzee, and other public figures have signed a petition protesting against the arrests of the Altans. In his comments on the television program the day before the coup attempt, Mehmet Altan referred to  another structure  within the Turkish state which he said was closely watching developments.  It is not certain when it will take its hand out of the bag and how it will take its hand out of the bag,  Altan had said.

They said hundreds of troops with dozens of armored vehicles including tanks had surged into the Bir Qassab some 75 km (45 miles) southeast of Damascus towards the Badia region that skirts the borders with Jordan and Iraq in an assault that began on Tuesday. Government forces and their allies on Wednesday took control of the Bir Qassab area, state television quoted a military official as saying. One rebel source said there had been advances by the government side. Bir Qassab straddles the route to the eastern suburbs of  Damascus, near the Dumeir air base, and is a key rebel supply line towards areas they control further southeast.  Bir Qassab fell to Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels after it was abandoned a few months ago by Islamic State (IS) militants beating an eastward retreat to reinforce their urban bastion, Raqqa, against a U.S.-backed coalition offensive, and oil rich Deir al Zor province, which borders Iraq. Bir Qassab, a rugged, desolate area, was a former stronghold that had given Islamic State a springboard for attacks on state-controlled territory just to the east of Damascus and a base for maintaining their grip on large swathes of the Badia region.  The (Syrian) regime and militia ground attack started this dawn and our forces are holding on to their positions,  said Saad al Haj, spokesman for Osoud al Sharqiya, one of the largest rebel groups operating in the area.  With (the help of) intensive Russian bombing they are trying to advance but we are repelling them,  al-Haj added. President Bashar al-Assad's forces, aided by Iranian-backed militias, have engaged in a race with FSA rebels in recent weeks to seize areas in the southeastern desert vacated by retreating Islamic State insurgents.  Backed by Iran, Iraqi Shi'ite groups are spreading across the Badia,  said Abu Yaqoub, a commander in the Ahmed Abdo Martyrs Brigade, an FSA rebel group whose fighters were involved in the battles. The army and Russian planes had been waging a relentless bombing campaign on Western-vetted rebel hideouts in the region and making steady gains, taking over several areas including the strategic Tal Dakwa mountain range, northeast of Bir Qassab.  The government offensive is part of a major campaign to recapture full control of the vast Syrian Badia, where the advance of the army and Iranian-backed militias southeast of the ancient central town of Palmyra has brought them within reach of the Iraqi frontier for the first time in years. This move has also effectively encircled FSA-controlled desert territory stretching to the Jordanian and Iraqi borders and close to the Tanf garrison where U.S. forces are based. Iranian-backed forces have also been trying to advance towards the base even after repeatedly being bombed by the U.S.-led coalition. U.S. forces said on Tuesday they had shot down an armed  pro-Syrian regime  drone near the garrison. A Western intelligence source identified the drone as Iranian. The coalition's presence in Tanf, on the Damascus-Baghdad highway, was meant to stop Iranian-backed groups from opening an overland route between Iraq and Syria, intelligence sources have said.

Conner signed the deal to add the Shenzhen-based airline to a list of launch customers for the new jet at the Paris Airshow, calling it  great to finish up this way  and expressing satisfaction that it was with an  all-Boeing customer.  The deal for jets worth $1.2 billion was signed at an emotional ceremony at Boeing's air show base as sales vice president Ihssane Mounir hailed a  very good friend, mentor and boss.  Donghai Chairman Wong Cho-Bau said he was happy to sign Conner's last deal but could not resist a final tweak of the negotiations, joking that he wanted  early delivery positions . He also said he was considering other purchases from Boeing to expand the group's fleet. Conner, previously chief executive of Boeing's planemaking division, is due to retire officially at the end of the year but will wind up most day-to-day activities after the show. FILE: Ray Conner (L), Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO, speaks as Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing Chairman, President and CEO, looks on during ceremonies marking the centennial of The Boeing Company in Seattle, Washington July 15, 2016.Jason RedmondConner joined Boeing as a mechanic 40 years ago on the 727 assembly line, working his way up to become the company's sales chief and then boss of the commercial planemaking division. He was replaced as head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes last November by former General Electric executive Kevin McAllister.    The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the  What's Next?  conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016.Jim YoungConner was credited with cementing a shift in the company's strategy for single-aisle jets and focusing on market share. Six months into the job, he faced a four-month grounding of the 787 Dreamliner due to battery problems, from which Boeing emerged without losing any customers but with wounded pride, and set about stabilizing production of the new high-tech jet. But he clashed with unions over employment and efforts to make Boeing more competitive against Europe's Airbus. His departure marks a turning point coinciding with the planned retirement later this year of Airbus sales chief John Leahy, another industry veteran who went head to head with Conner in pursuit of deals worth tens of billions of dollars.  Ray is the best salesman I have ever known at Boeing and a friend,  Philippe Petitcolin, chief executive of engine supplier Safran (SAF.PA), told Reuters.

Seattle's Mariners, Seahawks, Sounders FC, Storm and Reign said they had coordinated back-to-back matches and other activities this week to mark LGBT Pride Month, a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people (LGBT).      The first pride match will pit the Sounders, a soccer club that competes in the top men's soccer league in the United States and Canada, against Orlando City SC on Wednesday evening. Other pride matches were to feature Major League Baseball team the Mariners hosting the Detroit Tigers, Women's National Basketball Association team the Storm playing the Phoenix Mercury, and National Women's Soccer League team the Reign hosting FC Kansas City. The Seahawks, a professional American football franchise, would not host a pride match because it was off season. But it was planning other events, including lighting its stadium's iconic arches in the rainbow colors that symbolize LGBT pride, a team spokesman said on Tuesday. The teams said they had come together in the hope of spreading a message of acceptance to as many fans as possible.  With the unique place that sport has in our culture, it's incredibly important that teams take advantage of their platforms in order to make a difference,  said Adrian Hanauer, the owner of the Sounders FC in a statement. It was the first time that the entire professional sports roster of a city was banding together to champion LGBT rights, said Hudson Taylor, the executive director of non-profit Athlete Ally, which helped bring the teams together. Discrimination against LGBT athletes was most visible in locker rooms, with only one openly out athlete competing in U.S. professional men's sports leagues among some 4,000 of his peers, he said at the press conference.  Locker rooms continue to be among the least safe spaces for LGBTQ youth,  said Taylor.  Every day we hear from members of the athletic community who remained scared about competing as their true selves.  In 2015, an international study commissioned by LGBT groups and the government of Australia found 80 percent of respondents had witnessed or experienced homophobia in a sporting context. LGBT Pride Month takes place in June in the United States to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, which marked a turning point for gay rights in the United States.

Thiem suffered a solitary break as the 30-year-old Dutchman, ranked 42nd in the world, went 5-3 up before serving out the set.  The 23-year-old Thiem was again under pressure as the unforced errors started to pile up and had to dig deep to save further break points at 2-2 and 4-4 in the second. Haase finally got the break he wanted two games later, firing an audacious lob and slapping a desperate and risky crosscourt forehand that Thiem could not return to go 6-5 up.

Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley said his office filed a lawsuit in a state court in St. Louis against Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson and units of Endo International Plc. Hawley said the three companies knew their opioid products were addictive and potentially life-threatening, but  engaged in a deliberate campaign of fraud to convince Missouri doctors and consumers otherwise.   They used bogus front organizations and fake research; they used fraudulent advertising and deceptive trade practices,  Hawley said in remarks prepared for a news conference.  And they repeatedly lied about the true risks of the drugs they sold.  Hawley said the lawsuit accuses the companies of violating Missouri's consumer protection laws and its Medicaid statutes and seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and civil penalties. The case made Missouri the third state to sue drug manufacturers over their opioid marketing and sales practices. Last week a bipartisan group of state attorneys general announced an investigation. Purdue, J&J; and Endo were previously sued in similar lawsuits by the Ohio and Mississippi attorneys general, who also targeted Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Allergan Plc. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. J&J;'s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit said in a statement it acted appropriately and responsibly, adding that its opioid pain medications were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and carry mandated warnings about their known risks. Purdue, which manufactures OxyContin, said it denied the allegations but shared Hawley's concerns about the opioid crisis and was  committed to working collaboratively to find solutions.  Endo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said its  top priorities include patient safety and ensuring that patients with chronic pain have access to safe and effective therapeutic options.  The FDA this month asked Endo to withdraw its long-lasting opioid painkiller Opana ER from the market. Beyond the states' cases, similar lawsuits have been filed by local governments, including two California counties; the cities of Chicago and Dayton, Ohio; three Tennessee district attorneys; and nine New York counties.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/missouri-opioids-idUSL1N1JI0ZI"},

The main fire, which erupted on Saturday and spread with breathtaking speed, killed 64 people as they tried to flee in cars or were engulfed in flames in remote villages in a hilly region about 200 km (125 miles) northeast of Lisbon. More than 150 people have been injured. Victor Vaz Pinto, commander of the civil protection agency, said the fire in the area near the town of Pedrogao Grande had been put out. It was the biggest single blaze ever registered in the Iberian country. Another serious fire continued to burn to the north of Pedrogao Grande, forcing the evacuation of several villages. But abnormally high temperatures are forecast to fall in coming days and should help the firefighters' efforts. Firefighters work to put out a forest fire in the village of Capelo, near Gois, Portugal June 21, 2017.Rafael MarchantePrime Minister Antonio Costa has requested explanations for what went wrong in the initial response by emergency services. As the immediate danger from the fires subsides, demands for answers could rise. Police have said the fire was caused by dry lightning strikes and spread so quickly due to an unusually dangerous mix of low humidity, extremely high temperatures and powerful winds.

Oil prices touched seven-month lows despite larger-than-expected declines in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories. Oil has fallen 20 percent this year, set for its biggest slide for the first half of the year since 1997, as a global glut continues to undermine efforts by major producers to reduce output. The downturn has hemorrhaged the S&P; energy index, making it the worst performing sector among the 11 major indexes this year. The index fell more than 14 percent during the period, while the S&P; 500 rallied 8.83 percent. Shares of oil majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron were down about 1 percent, dragging on the S&P; 500 and Dow.  I think there is a bifurcation between short and long term. Clearly, to this point the Goldilocks scenario and earnings have pushed stock prices higher but oil has perhaps tempered some sentiment near-term,  said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  If oil falls below $40, one would see pressure on overall earnings, not just the energy sector.  Investors are also mindful of the impact of inflation on the pace of future interest rate hikes, with a tug-of-war between financial stability and inflation playing out among the Federal Reserve's policymakers. Dallas and Chicago Fed chiefs Robert Kaplan and Charles Evans expressed concerns regarding weak inflation, which remains stubbornly below the central bank's 2 percent target. However, Boston Fed head Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States poses financial stability risks. At 12:37 p.m. ET (1637 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.39 points, or 0.17 percent, at 21,429.75, the S&P; 500 was down 1.1 point, or 0.05 percent, at 2,435.93. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 34.95 points, or 0.56 percent, at 6,222.98. Biotechs were among the biggest gainers on the index with Celgene, Regeneron and Amgen trading up between 2 percent and 5 percent. Eight of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the energy index's 1.64 percent fall leading the decliners.

For the study, researchers examined how often fathers of young children participated in parenting activities like caregiving, making meals and playing outside and how much they weighed in on decisions related to nutrition, health and discipline when their kids were 2 and 4 years old.  By age 4, kids were 30 percent less likely to be obese if their fathers increased the amount of time they spent taking children outside for walks and play, compared to those whose dads remained more hands-off or even reduced their involvement between their kids’ second and fourth birthdays.  Each additional daily caregiving task fathers handled - such as help with getting dressed, baths, brushing teeth and bedtime routines - was associated with an additional 33 percent reduction in their child’s odds of becoming obese, the study found.  “It is possible that when fathers are more involved, the total amount of time both parents dedicate to child caregiving increases - it’s not just the mother providing care but the father as well,” said lead study author Michelle Wong of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.  “When both parents are more involved, the quality of care might also increase,” Wong said by email.  About 9 percent of U.S. kids aged 2 to 5 are obese, as are about 18 percent of youth aged 6 to 11, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  To assess the influence fathers might have on the risk of obesity early in childhood, researchers examined data from a nationally representative group of about 10,700 children born in 2001 who were followed until first grade, when kids are typically 6 to 7 years old.  All of the fathers lived at home with their kids in two-parent households but were not the primary caregivers. On average, fathers worked about 46 hours a week and mothers worked about 18 hours a week.  From ages 2 to 4, the proportion of children who were overweight decreased from about 14 percent to 8 percent. Over that same period, the proportion of kids who were obese declined from about 6 percent to 4 percent.  About one-quarter of fathers increased the amount of time they put into caregiving tasks and play time during the study period, while 30-40 percent decreased the amount of time they spent on these activities.  Even though some fathers got more involved in decision-making during the study, this didn’t appear to influence kids’ odds of obesity.  The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how fathers’ involvement with kids directly impacts children’s’ odds of obesity.  Other limitations include its reliance on fathers to accurately recall and report how much they did with their kids, the authors note in Obesity. Because the study only included two-parent households, the findings also might not apply to children living with only one caregiver.  “So, this study is telling us that when both parents are in the home, and regardless of how many hours each works outside the home, when fathers are more involved in caregiving responsibilities children are less likely to be obese,” Dr. Julie Lumeng, a researcher at the University of Michigan CS Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  Fathers’ involvement in playtime may have many benefits for kids, noted Philip Morgan, a researcher at the University of Newcastle in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study.  “When fathers take children outside to play, they both experience the benefits of physical activity, which reduces the risk of obesity,” Morgan said by email. “Indeed, being outside is beneficial as this form of leisure time activity usually displaces alternative unhealthy behaviors such as sitting in front of screens and/or eating poor quality foods.” This doesn’t mean mothers or other adults can’t provide the same opportunity, however, said Dr. Stephen Daniels of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Parents should be a team to ensure that kids get the proper diet and the best opportunities to be outdoors and engage in physical activity,” Daniels said by email. “However, it is important to emphasize that good lifestyle can also be developed in single parent families. Dads can clearly be helpful, especially in the area of physical activity, but this can also happen in other ways with other adult role models.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sqxmxp Obesity, online June 1, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-fathers-child-obesity-idUSKBN19C2EF"},

Trump,Ron Wyden,Scott Gottlieb,US,HEALTH,FDA,GENERICDRUGS,Science,United States","sector":"Life","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration moved on Wednesday to prevent pharmaceutical companies from  gaming  the system to block or delay entry of generic rivals. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a blog post that the agency plans to hold a public meeting on July 18 to identify ways pharmaceutical companies are using FDA rules to place obstacles in the way of generic competition.  We know that sometimes our regulatory rules might be 'gamed' in ways that may delay generic drug approvals beyond the time frame the law intended, in order to reduce competition,  he said in the blog post.  We are actively looking at ways our rules are being used and, in some cases, misused.  The move comes as President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Congress search for ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Trump is preparing to put out an executive order on drug pricing, according to media reports, and last week U.S. Senator Ron Wyden introduced a bill to require companies to explain the reasons for significant price increases.  Americans are sick and tired of seeing the cost of their prescription drugs race past their paychecks,  said Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.  The FDA does not include price considerations when deciding whether to approve a new drug, but Gottlieb said the agency can facilitate increased competition by approving lower-cost generics. That means removing some of the obstacles placed by branded companies in the way of generic manufacturers. These obstacles can include limiting the availability of branded products for testing by generic companies, or prolonging negotiations with generic companies over the implementation of shared risk-management programs. Gottlieb said recently that the FDA is evaluating whether to waive a requirement that generic companies and brand companies share a single system to ensure a drug's safe use. The FDA's move comes two days after Republican Senator Chuck Grassley urged Gottlieb in a letter to consider recommendations in two bills co-sponsored by Grassley to enhance access to generic drugs; and encouraged him to work closely with the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to address anti-competitive behavior in the drug industry. Representatives from the pharmaceutical industry's main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, were not immediately available for comment.  Gottlieb said the agency plans to examine policy and program changes, including using its own authorities more forcefully and potentially collaborating more closely with other agencies.

In an interview with eight European newspapers, Macron said there were tensions between western and eastern Europe because of their geopolitical backgrounds, but no conflict.   Poland's nationalist-minded government has been embroiled in a dispute with the EU for over a year after a series of reforms which Brussels says weakens the independence of the judiciary and risk undermining democratic checks and balances. Meanwhile, Hungary's crackdown on non-government bodies that criticize government and its overtures to Russia have unsettled fellow EU member states and Brussels, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban one of the most eurosceptic leaders in the bloc.  European countries that do not respect the rules should pay the full political consequences,  Macron said in the interview, a transcript of which Reuters has seen. Speaking a day ahead of a European Council summit in Brussels, Macron said the EU would be weakened if it allowed members to flout rules.  There is a double betrayal. They decide to abandon EU principles, turn their back on Europe and have a cynical approach to the Union which gives them money, without respecting its values,  Macron said.  In the interview which touched on Europe, security and the fight against militant Islam, and the war in Syria, Macron called U.S. President Donald Trump's policymaking  unpredictable  and a source of discomfort for the world. He expressed hope that the United States could be brought back into the Paris climate accord.  I hope that Trump changes his mind. Because everything is linked. We cannot fight against terrorism effectively without taking action on climate change,  Macron said.    Europe, Macron said, needed to adopt a genuine common defense and security policy in order to better protect itself. The bloc needed to be better at defending its borders, dealing with migration and handling asylum demands, he said. He renewed his call for a euro zone budget, saying the single currency area would be weakened without one, and expressed confidence Germany was not wholly opposed to the idea. France's youngest leader since Napoleon, Macron wants to turn the Franco-German couple into a force for closer integration in Europe. But years of French economic underperformance and ambivalence about reforms have sapped German confidence in its neighbor.  If we want to go to the next phase, we need a deeper integration within the euro zone. And that's why I vigorously defend the idea of a euro zone budget.  He added:  My feeling is that Germany is not completely opposed to this.       On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she could think about a euro zone budget if it helped tackle structural reforms.

The panel plans to consider the bill on Tuesday and the full House will vote in mid-July, said Representative Bill Shuster, a Republican who chairs the committee.  This is about saving the taxpayers' money,  Shuster told reporters Wednesday.  Maintaining the status quo is unacceptable.  In the wake of the forced removal of a United Airlines passenger in April from his seat, the airline banned the practice. Shuster's bill would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. It would also require the U.S. Transportation Department to clarify passenger compensation regulations and would bar the use of cell phones and mobile devices for phone calls during flights. The bill also requires large and medium-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers, and airlines would have to post a prominent link on their website on services offered in the event of a widespread computer outage. Many airlines have been hit by computer system outages over the last year. The most controversial proposal is to privatize air traffic control. Earlier this month, Trump unveiled a plan to modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. Shuster said airlines would have three seats on the 13-member board - one for major airlines, one for cargo carriers and one for regional airlines. The Trump administration has proposed giving airlines two seats on the board, while Shuster last year proposed giving airlines four seats. Shuster aims to address concerns from private plane owners and rural airports by barring the new entity from charging general aviation operators user fees. The chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, John Thune, said Tuesday that he was not planning to include air traffic control privatization in the FAA reauthorization, a committee aide said. Shuster's bill would reauthorize the FAA for six years and also has provisions to speed up a decision by the Transportation Department on whether to allow expanded commercial drone use. Critics say the plan would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. The administration and Shuster say they would not charge the private entity for the government's air traffic control assets and would bar Congress from reviewing fees charged by the board. Executives from United, Hawaiian Airlines Inc, American Airlines Inc and Southwest Airlines Co, strongly back the proposal. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. It is unclear whether privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two.

Republicans in the chamber have been working for weeks behind closed doors on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as Obamacare. The effort has been plagued from the start by tensions between moderates and conservatives, which surfaced again on Tuesday. Democrats have also criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, staging a protest on the Senate floor on Monday.  Republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it,  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer charged.  President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obamacare. The 2010 law extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. Related CoverageSenate to release health bill at 0930 EDT Thursday: senatorsThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month. Trump has urged the Republican-led Senate to pass a more  generous  bill than that approved by the House, whose version he privately called  mean,  according to congressional sources. An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under the House plan, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate healthcare bill would be different from the House version, but he did not elaborate. Protestors gather during a demonstration against the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act, outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinIn the Senate, moderates including Senator Shelley Moore Capito have argued for a long, seven-year phase-out to the Medicaid expansion that happened under Obamacare. But Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, said on Tuesday the phase-out in the bill might just be three years. Capito said on Tuesday she was also concerned the Senate healthcare plan might cap Medicaid spending and shift it to a lower growth rate in 2025.  That's an issue,  she said. Conservatives Wary Slideshow (6 Images)Senate conservatives also seemed wary of the emerging bill. Ted Cruz, a member of a core group of 13 Republicans who have been working on the legislation, told reporters the bill did not yet do enough to lower health insurance premiums.  If it is going to pass, the bill is going to have to make meaningful steps to reduce premiums,  he said. Given the opposition of all Senate Democrats to repealing Obamacare, Republican leaders will need the support of at least 50 of the chamber's 52 Republicans to ensure passage. McConnell announced a discussion draft would be laid out on Thursday. The bill will be brought to the Senate floor once the CBO has assessed its cost and impact,  likely next week,  McConnell said. Thune said the bill was not yet finalized, saying:  We're trying to get definitive determinations  on a range of issues. Vice President Mike Pence predicted that new healthcare legislation would be enacted this summer.  I want to assure you, before this summer is over ... President Donald Trump and this Congress will keep their promise to the American people, and we will repeal and replace Obamacare,  Pence told a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers.

The letter is the latest in a string of missives from Democrats concerned about Icahn's dual role as a special adviser to President Donald Trump on regulation and as a major investor in heavily regulated industries.  Icahn has an 82 percent stake in oil refiner CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N). He has also recommended the White House change the biofuels program that would reduce costs to CVR and other refining companies.   Recent reports about Mr. Icahn’s actions with respect to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program have raised significant ethical and legal concerns given his oil refinery business interests,” the letter read. Signing the letter were Reps. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Bobby Rush of Illinois; Diana DeGette of Colorado; Paul Tonko of New York; and John Sarbanes of Maryland. They called on Pruitt to respond by the end of the month with details about procedures in place at EPA to prevent Icahn from influencing policy for personal gain. The agency runs the Renewable Fuel Standard program, a regulation requiring increasing amounts of biofuels in the nation's gasoline.  Earlier this month, five Democratic senators had also asked the EPA to hand over documents relating to Icahn's role in shaping biofuels policy at the agency. And in May, eight Democratic senators asked U.S. regulators to investigate Icahn’s biofuels activities. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission responded that it was not investigating but would help the EPA with any probe that it was conducting. [L1N1J21PC] An official at the EPA Office of Inspector General declined to comment on whether an inquiry was under way. Icahn was named as an unpaid special adviser to Trump in December. In February, he proposed shifting the responsibility for blending biofuels to fuel dealers from refiners.  Icahn has said the proposal is not self-dealing because it would benefit many refining companies, not just CVR. White House officials have said the EPA is considering the proposal.

The Islamist militants' bloody insurgency has prevented farmers from planting or harvesting crops for years in the northeast, where more than 5 million people need food aid and about 1.5 million are on the brink of famine, aid agencies say.  Investing in agricultural assistance today will provide food for tomorrow, and can ensure people have a source of food even when they are cut off from other forms of aid,  said Nourou Macki Tall of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The delivery of fertiliser and cereal, pulse and vegetable seeds targets those who can access land yet have been hit hardest by the conflict, such as the internally displaced, refugees and host communities, Tall said in a statement. They will also receive food rations from the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure the seeds are planted ahead of the imminent rainy season, and not eaten instead, the FAO said.  Eighty percent of the people in the area are farmers, and need support to return to their farms,  said Alhaji Maina Gana, chairman of the Fune local government area in Yobe state. Boko Haram's campaign to create an Islamic state is in its eighth year with little sign of ending. It has claimed more than 20,000 lives and uprooted 2.7 million people in the northeast. A U.N. official said this month the WFP had scaled back aid due to a lack of funds, and was now aiming to supply food to 1.4 million people instead of the 1.8 million intended. At least half of government food aid sent northeast for people driven from their homes by Boko Haram has been  diverted  and never reached them, a state official said on Sunday.

With only 20 working days to go before a lengthy August recess, some Republican lawmakers say a bipartisan agreement could help clear a legislative schedule crammed with other top priorities including tax reform, infrastructure and an increase to the federal debt limit. In December 2013, Republican Representative Paul Ryan, now speaker of the House of Representatives, and Democratic Senator Patty Murray worked out a two-year deal that canceled some spending cuts in fiscal 2014 and 2015 in return for some longer-term spending reductions. The Ryan-Murray agreement was promptly enacted into law. Some Republicans also view bipartisanship as a way to avoid a restrictive spending plan that would cap funding for U.S. agencies and a government shutdown that President Donald Trump threatened in May.  I think what we need is another Ryan-Murray sort of proposal,  said Republican Representative Mike Simpson, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee that is in charge of writing annual bills to fund federal programs. Speaking to reporters after a closed meeting of House Republicans, Simpson said the idea was in the early stages of consideration. Republicans, who control both the House and Senate, have lashed out at some of the deep spending cuts that Trump has proposed. But they are divided over how much top-line spending should be appropriated next year, including for a military build-up that Trump wants. A bipartisan negotiation was just one of several options House Republicans are mulling. Another would rush one massive spending bill for fiscal 2018 through the House in July, instead of the one-dozen separate appropriations bills that Congress tries to write every year. Doing so would allow Republicans to tout an accomplishment to their constituents in August during a year that has so far seen few legislative achievements. Given the limited time to write such a bill, Ryan might have to resort to just passing a  national security  spending bill that would fund the military and other security activities. Some Republicans want to boost military spending to $640 billion. Besides dealing with next year's spending bills, Congress must also pass a budget blueprint that could facilitate passage of a major tax reform measure being written behind closed doors.

Fitch has also affirmed Bank Saint-Petersburg's (BSPB) Long-Term IDRs at 'BB-'. The Outlooks on both banks are Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS AND VRS The downgrade of CBM mainly reflects the increased volume of exposures that Fitch considers to be potentially high risk. The downgrade also reflects significant double leverage at the level of CBM's holdco, which may mean upstreaming of dividends and/or liquidity from the bank is required to help service the holdco's debt. Given these risks, Fitch believes the bank's credit profile is more commensurate with a 'BB-' rating. The two banks' IDRs continue to be driven by their intrinsic financial strength, as reflected in their Viability Ratings (VR) of 'bb-'. The VRs in turn reflect the banks' significant franchises, adequate performance and capital adequacy, and comfortable funding and liquidity profiles. However, the ratings also take into account potential weaknesses in the banks' asset quality and the still challenging operating environment. CBM CBM's reported asset quality metrics are adequate: non-performing loans (NPLs; 90 days overdue) were a low 2% at end-1Q17. However, Fitch also identified a significant volume (RUB127 billion at end-2016, equal to 1.2x end-1Q17 Fitch Core Capital (FCC)) of potentially risky loans, reverse repos, interbank and bond placements, which are currently performing, although some were restructured. These increased from RUB74 billion at end-1Q16, mostly due to Fitch's reassessment of the riskiness of some exposures, but also due to moderate additional net issuance. These potentially risky exposures include: - RUB57 billion (52% of FCC at end-1Q17) of high risk corporate loans to borrowers with high leverage/weak financial performance - RUB17 billion (16%) related-party construction exposure - RUB31 billion (29%) of weak reverse repo exposures with high counterparty risks and/or weak, illiquid collateral with limited discounts - RUB22 billion (20%) of blank interbank and bond exposures to weak Russian financial institutions, which could be fiduciary in nature; according to CBM, this exposure reduced to RUB5 billion (5%) in June 2017 Of somewhat lower credit risk, are exposures (through loans, reverse repos and interbank placements) to two large Russian banks and two property developers of a combined RUB65 billion (61% of FCC at end-1Q17). Some of these exposures may be fiduciary, in Fitch's view. CBM's ability to absorb losses on these exposures is significant, driven primarily by its robust pre-impairment profit, which was equal to about RUB44 billion (or 6% of average gross loans) in 2016. Loan impairment charges have also been significant (equal to 4.7% of loans in 2016, and an annualised 2.9% in 1Q17), but net income has remained sound (ROE of 11% in 2016 and 17.6% (annualised) in 1Q17). CBM's regulatory core capital buffer is moderate. At end-May 2017, the regulatory core Tier 1 and Tier 1 ratios were 7.1% and 10.5% (the latter boosted by the USD700 million perpetual AT1 issue in May), exceeding the regulatory minimum levels (including capital conservation buffer) by 1.4pts and 3.3pp, respectively. The FCC ratio was a more solid 10.8% at end-1Q17, supported mainly by lower provisioning in IFRS as opposed to regulatory accounts. CBM's capitalisation should also be viewed in the context of significant 1.6x double-leverage at the level of the bank's holding company, Concern ROSSIUM, which also holds stakes in non-financial businesses. The holdco had around RUB40 billion of debt at end-1Q17 and is largely reliant on upstreaming of liquidity and dividends to service this, potentially representing a significant burden for CBM. Liquidity risk is reasonably well managed, despite significant balance sheet concentrations, because lumpy placements are covered with related asset exposures and liquidity. Thus large customer deposits placed by CBM's biggest corporate client and most of short-term direct repo funding are used to fund a large reverse repo exposure collateralised by quasi-sovereign bonds and some corporate loans. Fitch estimates that even if the largest customer leaves CBM, at end-1Q17 the bank's remaining liquidity buffer net of refinancing needs for 2017 (these include mostly short-term money market placements and put options on local bonds) would be sufficient to repay 15% of other customer deposits. Fitch conservatively deducts from the liquidity buffer some of CBM's short-term interbank and reverse repo placements equalling to RUB92 billion (4% of end-1Q17 liabilities) as in the agency's view these are long-term credit exposures rather than short-term money market placements. BSPB BSPB's asset quality is reasonable given reserve and collateral coverage of problem exposures. NPLs accounted for 5% of gross loans at end-1Q17, while restructured exposures made up a further 10%. NPLs were fully covered by reserves. The coverage of NPLs and restructured loans was 79%, which is reasonable as most restructured exposures are performing and secured by revenue-generating real estate with reasonable LTVs of about 60%. Capitalisation is satisfactory. The FCC ratio rose slightly to 13% at end-1Q17 from 12% at end-2016 due to deleveraging. The regulatory Tier 1 ratio was a lower 9.5% at end-4M17 (compared with the minimum 7.25%, including the capital conservation buffer), mainly due to higher provisions in local GAAP. BSPB is planning a RUB3 billion equity injection in 3Q17, which would boost capital ratios by about 0.6pp. BSPB's net interest margin has remained reasonable at around 4% over the credit cycle. Commission and trading income has also been rather stable at 1%-2% of average assets in 2013-1Q17. These underpin BSPB's pre-impairment profit, which has been approximately equal to a solid 5% of average gross loans, enabling the bank to absorb credit losses and remain profitable. The bank's ROE was 7% in 2016 and the target for 2017 is 10%, which seems achievable based on 1Q17 results. The bank is mainly funded by customer accounts, which made up 79% of funding net of direct repos at end-1Q17. Customer funding is diversified, with 60% being rather granular retail accounts and the 20 largest depositors (mainly corporate) making up only 15% of the total. Repo funding is sizable (17% of liabilities) and used to finance carry trades in short-term market instruments. BSPB has an adequate cushion of liquid assets, which net of market funding maturing within one year covered customer accounts by a comfortable 22% at end-4M16. SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS The '5' Support Ratings of CBM and BSPB reflect Fitch's view that support from the banks' private shareholders cannot be relied upon. The Support Ratings and Support Rating Floors of 'No Floor' also reflect that support from the Russian authorities, although possible given the banks' significant deposit franchises, cannot be relied upon due to their still small size and lack of overall systemic importance. DEBT RATINGS CBM's senior unsecured debt is rated in line with the bank's Long-Term IDRs. The banks' subordinated debt ratings are notched down once from the banks' VRs, which incorporates zero notches for incremental non-performance risk and one notch for higher loss severity relative to senior unsecured debt holders. The rating of CBM's perpetual additional Tier 1 notes has been affirmed at 'b-' and is now three notches below the bank's 'bb-' VR. The affirmation reflects reduced notching of these instruments at low rating levels. The notching reflects (i) incremental non-performance risk relative to the bank's VR due to the option to cancel coupon payments at CBM's discretion; and (ii) likely high loss severity in case of non-performance due to the instrument's deep subordination. RATING SENSITIVITIES Upside potential for CBM's ratings would require a marked improvement of its asset quality and a strengthening of capitalisation through higher core capital ratios and/or reduced risks stemming from double leverage at the holdco level. An upgrade of BSPB's ratings would require a strengthening of its franchise and credit metrics. Negative rating pressure for both banks may stem from a sharp asset quality deterioration resulting in material capital erosion or a significant liquidity squeeze.

Iraq's Kurds have brushed aside international warnings that their planned Sept. 25 referendum could trigger conflict with Baghdad at a time when the fight against Islamic State is not yet won. Iraq's neighbors Turkey, Iran and Syria, all oppose secession, fearing that separatism will spread to their own ethnic Kurdish populations.  We are exercising our democratic right ... As people in Turkey voting for their constitutional reform exercised their own democratic right, so we are exercising our democratic right to see what the people of Kurdistan want,  Hemin Hawrami told a gathering at the Turkish think-tank SETA in Ankara. He was referring to a referendum in April in which Turks voted to hand President Tayyip Erdogan sweeping new powers. Hawrami said the referendum concerned only Iraqi Kurds and had no relation to Kurds in other parts of the region, adding that the vote was not an attempt to change Iraq's existing international borders.   We expect Turkey and other countries to understand the legitimate aspirations of Kurdistani people. We will start a serious long, patient process (of dialogue) with Baghdad,  he added. Baghdad's Shi'ite-led government has rejected any move by the mostly Sunni Muslim Kurds to press unilaterally for independence, insisting that any decision about the future of the country should involve all its other parts. Hisham al-Alawi, Iraq's ambassador to Ankara, told the same panel on Wednesday that Iraq's constitution had been approved by a majority of Iraqis and demonstrated that the people had agreed to remain unified.  The fact that the overwhelming majority of Iraqis voted for this current constitution that identifies Iraq as a united, federal, democratic country is a clear indication that... we have agreed to be part of a unified united Iraq,  al-Alawi said.

May's Conservative party pledged in policy proposals before a June 8 election to fold the SFO, which prosecutes high-level fraud and corruption in British business, into the National Crime Agency (NCA) - a government department whose remit runs from tackling organised crime to child protection. The Conservatives said the move would  strengthen Britain's response to white collar crime , but the plan was roundly criticised by senior lawyers who said it risked undermining the fight against complex economic crime and had not been justified. Some legislators also sprang to the defence of the SFO, which reached settlements this year with Rolls-Royce and Tesco to end investigations into, respectively, bribery allegations and an accounting scandal. May's failure to win a parliamentary majority in the June election forced her to pare back the government's ambitions. The proposal to abolish the SFO was notably absent from Wednesday's Queen's Speech, in which the government outlined its policy programme. Private-sector lawyers said the SFO appeared to have won a reprieve.  It does look as if the SFO is safe but if she (May) does try to absorb it into the NCA, she will find that the policy meets fierce resistance and I would expect her to be defeated on any vote in Parliament,  said Stephen Parkinson, a lawyer at Kingsley Napley. Lawyers said the SFO's unprecedented move on Tuesday to criminally charge Barclays and four former senior executives over alleged crimes during the credit crisis showed it had the skills to take on the British establishment. Ben Rose, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose, said dropping the abolition plans would mean the government had  made the right decision for the wrong reasons; political expediency . But he added:  The SFO needs a political champion and proper resource rather than to be treated as a political football.  The Queen's speech, prepared by ministers and read out by Queen Elizabeth, comes as May is still trying to secure a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to shore up her government. Aides to May said the government remained committed to some policies not mentioned in the speech.  What we're saying on that is that we will consult widely and decide the next steps forward,  a spokesman said. Duncan Hames, director of anti-corruption group Transparency International UK, said the government  appears to have heard the deafening chorus of expert voices saying it (SFO abolition) was a bad idea.  But he said lingering uncertainty would blight the SFO's reputation and stability.  The government should, without delay, make a definitive statement laying this issue to rest,  he said. The SFO declined to comment. (Additional reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Adrian Croft)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-sfo-idUSL8N1JI3ZJ"},

The delivery of fertiliser and cereal, pulse and vegetable seeds targets those who can access land yet have been hit hardest by the conflict, such as the internally displaced, refugees and host communities, Tall said in a statement. They will also receive food rations from the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure the seeds are planted ahead of the imminent rainy season, and not eaten instead, the FAO said.  Eighty percent of the people in the area are farmers, and need support to return to their farms,  said Alhaji Maina Gana, chairman of the Fune local government area in Yobe state. Boko Haram's campaign to create an Islamic state is in its eighth year with little sign of ending. It has claimed more than 20,000 lives and uprooted 2.7 million people in the northeast. A U.N. official said this month the WFP had scaled back aid due to a lack of funds, and was now aiming to supply food to 1.4 million people instead of the 1.8 million intended. At least half of government food aid sent northeast for people driven from their homes by Boko Haram has been  diverted  and never reached them, a state official said on Sunday. Nigeria's humanitarian response plan for 2017 has received less than a third of a requested $1.05 billion to date, the U.N.'s Financial Tracking Service shows.

LHP Zach Britton (forearm strain) had his first rehab start Tuesday for Class A Aberdeen. He threw a scoreless inning with a strikeout, walk and double play on 12 pitches.  I had really, really good movement which was kind of the issue I was fighting with the injury,  Britton told the Orioles' website.  That was a real positive.  Britton was procedurally transferred to the 60-day disabled list to open a spot on the 40-man roster. He is still eligible to return to Baltimore on July 4. RHP Dylan Bundy will make his next regularly scheduled start. However, he will then get pushed back in rotation for some extra rest, according to manager Buck Showalter.

Tillman is winless in his past eight starts and has an 8.39 ERA in 39 2/3 innings.  It's frustrating but you keep thinking about the same thing over and over again you're not going to get anywhere,  Tillman said.  You've got to buy into the process and keep working.

The lefty suffered the loss, giving up five runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out three over 42/3 innings. He gave up two home runs, both solo shots, one to Carlos Gomez in Texas' four-run first and another to Nomar Mazara in the fifth. Liriano gave up two home runs for only the second game all season.

It's never fun to slump, but it happens in baseball,  Gallo said.  It's not my first and it's probably not going to be my last, so you just got to continue to grind through it. For me, it's just about having little wins throughout the little slump. Like, I had a walk yesterday; I felt good about that. Still seeing some pitches.  Gallo has grown since a year ago, when he appeared completely lost at times. He's seeing more pitches, working counts, and putting more balls in play. Pitchers have adjusted, though, keeping pitches out of the middle of the plate and luring him to chase balls up and away. Said manager Jeff Banister:  You're going to live with some degree of that. As soon as he hits one of those pitches up 475 feet you won't call it a chase anymore. The next time he gets two or three hits, we'll be talking about another story. There is still growth period to be had for young 20-year-olds.  LHP Cole Hamels will continue his minor-league rehabilitation tour, starting on Wednesday for Double-A Frisco. He is set to throw 80 pitches. The start marks his second as he works his way back from an oblique strain. Hamels is expected to need a third rehab start, though manager Jeff Banister did not rule out a return to the Rangers on Monday in Cleveland. 3B Adrian Beltre hit a home run, his 2,960th career hit, which also gave him 1,079 extra-base hits, moving him past Cal Ripken Jr. and into 23rd on the all-time list. He also had two RBIs, which gave him 1,585, moving him past Harmon Killebrew and into tie for 35th all-time with Miguel Cabrera. OF Carlos Gomez continued to blister Toronto's Francisco Liriano, going 1-for-2 with a solo home run in a four-run first inning against the lefty in Texas' 6-1 victory over the Blue Jays on Tuesday. For his career, Gomez is a .500 hitter, going 11-for-22, with three home runs and five strikeouts against Liriano.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6LWPXQ7W"},

I tried to do this and I tried to do that and it never came around,  Hicks told Detroit-area reporters before the game.  I don't want to look at (being released) as a blessing, but it opened my eyes a little bit. I changed a lot that offseason as far as my swing and since then it's been good to go.

The embattled Finance Minister Alfredo Thorne on Monday asked the opposition-controlled Congress for a vote of confidence amid threats of a censure, and promised to step down immediately if he did not win support. If confirmed, Thorne will become the first Peruvian finance minister in decades to fail to secure a vote of confidence from Congress - a blow to Kuczynski, who won last year's election as a former Wall Street investor and World Bank economist promising to deliver stronger economic growth and a cleaner government. Representatives of the rightist opposition party Popular Force that holds a majority of seats in Congress said they would not renew their confidence in Thorne in a vote scheduled for the plenary, starting at 2:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT).  Everything is pointing to us having a new finance minister (Thursday),  said Carlos Bruce, a ruling party congressman. It was not immediately clear who would replace Thorne, a former JPMorgan executive who tried to cut taxes and revive infrastructure projects before heavy flooding and a corruption scandal set back the country's growth prospects. Kuczynski, a centrist, is widely expected to appoint another business-friendly finance minister. Thorne was accused of interfering in an autonomous institution after a leaked audio recording surfaced in which he appeared to ask the comptroller to approve a modification to a $520 million airport contract in exchange for a bigger budget. Thorne denied he used funding for the comptroller's office to secure a favorable review of the contract change, which Kuczynski's government had promised to nix on the comptroller's recommendation. Markets in Peru have been largely calm throughout the Thorne controversy. But the political battle has laid bare the hostilities between the executive and Congress that have dogged Kuczynski's first year in government and could disrupt his plans going forward. Three ministers have already left Kuczynski's original cabinet amid controversy, including his transportation minister, who, like Thorne, had been a top campaign advisor when he won last year's presidential election. Shortly after voting on Thorne, Congress will question the interior minister amid concerns that he has not done enough to curb street crime.

The unidentified youth, together with a 13-year-old who is too young to be investigated, is suspected of having fired the gun from a garden or house window at a group of cyclists that included King Maha Vajiralongkorn, a regular visitor to Bavaria, and his entourage.  A toy pistol, a soft air pistol, was used. First it was fired at a group of cyclists, one of whom was the King of Thailand,  said Thomas Rauscher, prosecutor in the southern town of Landshut. Neither the king nor any of his entourage was hurt. Prosecutors said the king's household said they had no interest in charges being brought in the case.

Representatives at the Thai Embassy in Berlin were not available for comment. The Royal Household in Bangkok did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Later, more shots were allegedly fired at the king's car in the small, historic town of Erding, some 35 kilometres (22 miles) from Munich, said the prosecutor. The 14-year-old is being investigated for attempted grievous bodily harm and it was unclear whether the boys knew who they were shooting at, said the prosecutor. His office will decide whether to charge the teenager with a criminal offence. The incident took place on June 10 at about 11 p.m. (2100 GMT).

The Alliance for Prosperity, a U.S.-led initiative, aims to stem the flow of migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador by funding development projects and security crackdowns on the region's criminal gangs. The Alliance, launched in 2014 by the previous U.S. administration, committed $750 million of U.S. funding over five years to create jobs and cut murder rates and corruption.  It is being re-tooled under President Donald Trump to boost policing and private sector investment. Speaking at a conference in Miami to re-launch the alliance last week, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said he hopes the deal will give citizens of the region the security and economic opportunity to remain in their home countries.  But scholars and activists said the Alliance's aims to cut regulation and encourage investment in infrastructure megaprojects threatens to worsen often violent displacement. Giant hydroelectric dams, luxury tourist enclaves and intercity transport links, often backed by foreign private investors, are among the major drivers of displacement in Central America, according to migrant charities.  Billy Kyte, a campaign leader for rights charity Global Witness, said the Alliance's silence on the property rights of regular people means more could be driven from ancestral homes.  At the moment the plan is a recipe for increased poverty and insecurity, and will likely cause further forced displacement,  Kyte told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Rights organizations Amnesty International and Oxfam said the strategy sticks to a model based on private investment that has failed to stem migration for four decades, and voiced concern that human rights abuses might follow. The U.S. State Department did not respond to written questions or telephone calls on its Central American policy.  The three countries, collectively known as the Northern Triangle, and the Inter-American Development Bank announced $2.5 billion of funding for infrastructure projects on June 14, ahead of the meeting with U.S. leaders in Miami. The Bank said in a statement that planned infrastructure development would create jobs and make countries in the region more competitive.  Civil society groups will be included in panels that monitor projects and policies will safeguard environmental and indigenous rights, said spokesman John Ferriter.  Danger for Rights Defenders Alexander Main, Senior Associate at the Center for Economic and Policy Research think tank, said emerging details of the new alliance point to a weakening of basic labor and land rights. He expects an intensification of the kind of mining, hydroelectric and industrial farming projects that jeopardize the livelihoods of indigenous communities and small-scale farmers, and have led to violence against activists.  We can anticipate that U.S.-backed security forces will continue to prioritize the protection of investor 'rights' over the rights of communities and their leaders, as we have seen... most notoriously (in) the killing of environmental leader Berta Caceres in Honduras,  Main told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Caceres was killed in March 2016 for leading opposition to the $50 million Agua Zarca dam that threatened to displace hundreds of indigenous people.  Caceres' nephew Silvio Carrillo, a film producer who is campaigning for her killers to be brought to justice, said the alliance stands to benefit business and political elites whose interests are opposed to regular people, who stand to lose land.  Civil society organizations in Honduras fear the new deal will perpetuate long-standing U.S. policies which they say exploit the region's bountiful natural resources at the expense of long-term prosperity for the majority. Yolanda Gonzalez Cerdeira, coordinator of the Jesuit Migrant Service for Central America, a network of Christian migrant charities, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that projects which the United States and Bank count as successes are often ruinous on the ground.  Cerdeira cited the much-lauded Indura tourist resort, a hotel and golf resort on Honduras' east coast, which displaced the indigenous Garifuna Barra Vieja community. The indigenous people, who have called the site home for more than 200 years, lost their title to the land, had homes ransacked, were displaced by military police, and had false charges levied against them, said Cerdeira.

The Supreme Court could now act at any time. The lower court rulings blocked the 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States to give the government time to implement stronger vetting procedures. In the court papers, Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall said the lower courts had wrongly second-guessed the president on national security policy when reviewing the March 6 executive order.  The president expressly determined that the order’s provisions are needed to promote national security, but the lower courts here ... nullified that judgment,  he wrote.

In an abortive attack that Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said could have been far worse, the man likely made the bomb at his home in the Brussels borough of Molenbeek, a known hotbed of radicalized Muslims, investigators said.  There are also indications that the suspect had sympathies for the terrorist organization IS,  the prosecutors said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State. While little is known about the dead man, who was shot by a soldier on Tuesday evening, any confirmed militant links could fit it into a pattern of recent attacks in European cities claimed by IS, including in London, Paris and Berlin. There was no immediate claim of responsibility on Wednesday. Molenbeek, a poor borough with a big Moroccan Muslim population, gained notoriety after an Islamic State cell based there mounted suicide attacks on Paris in November 2015 that killed 130 people. Associates of that group attacked Brussels itself four months later, killing 32 people. A counter-terrorism prosecutor said the man, who a security source named as Oussama Zariouh and was identified officially as O.Z., was a 36-year-old Moroccan citizen. He set off his bomb on a crowded station concourse below ground at 8:44 p.m. (2.44 p.m. ET), prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said. Walking up to some passengers,  he grabbed his suitcase, while shouting and causing a partial explosion. Fortunately, nobody was hurt,  Van Der Sypt said. Related CoverageBrussels station attacker was secretive lonerBrussels attacker may have supported Islamic State: prosecutorsThe suitcase, later found to contain nails and gas bottles, caught fire and then detonated a second time more violently as the man ran downstairs to the platforms. He then ran back up to the concourse where commuters had been milling around and rushed toward a soldier shouting  Allahu akbar  - God is greatest, in Arabic. The soldier, part of a routine patrol, shot him several times. Bomb disposal experts checked the body and found he was not carrying more explosives. Police raided the man's home overnight, Van Der Sypt said.  Molenbeek Mayor Francoise Schepmans told reporters that Zariouh was on police files over a drug case last year and was divorced. Bruno Struys, a Belgian author who writes on Islamist militants, said Zariouh had lived in Belgium since 2002, was married from 2004-2007 and moved to Molenbeek in 2013.

It said he was self-employed, single, came from Nador on Morocco's Mediterranean coast and graduated from the nearby university at Oujda in 2002.  Posts on the page showed an interest in Islamic charity but no obvious support for militant organizations. Along with Arab musicians, he posted a liking for Canadian pop diva Celine Dion.  We Will Not Be Intimidated  Prime Minister Michel insisted that Belgium, which has been the most fertile European recruiting ground for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, would not bow to threats that have seen combat troops become a permanent fixture at public spaces in Brussels. Slideshow (15 Images) We will not let ourselves be intimidated,  Michel said.  We will go on living our lives as normal.  The Belgian capital, home to the headquarters of NATO and the European Union, took a heavy hit to its tourist industry after last year's deadly attacks at Brussels airport and in the Brussels metro. In Tuesday's incident, visitors and residents out enjoying a hot summer's evening on the ornate Renaissance town square, the Grand Place, close to Central Station, were cleared quickly away by police. Smoke billowed through the 1930s station's marble halls, sending people fleeing, well aware of last year's attacks at Brussels airport and on the metro, as well as of a string of Islamic State-inspired assaults, most recently in Britain.  Such isolated acts will continue in Brussels, in Paris and elsewhere. It's inevitable,  Brussels security consultant Claude Moniquet, a former French agent, told broadcaster RTL. With Islamic State under pressure in Syria, he said, attacks in Europe may increase, though many would be by  amateurs .

Argentina's benchmark Merval stock index slumped 5 percent, while the peso currency dropped as much as 2 percent to 16.47 per dollar. MSCI said it needed more signs that center-right President Mauricio Macri's pro-market reforms were  irreversible  to reincorporate the country's shares into its emerging markets index, which guides major developing country stock allocations worldwide by investment funds.  All the ingredients are there,  MSCI head of index management research Sebastien Lieblich said on a Wednesday conference call.  It remains only to be seen if the ingredients will be maintained over time.  Argentina's inclusion as an index constituent would have encouraged funds to invest in Argentina to match or outperform that gauge. The Merval index had risen nearly 25 percent in 2017 ahead of Tuesday's decision in part because investors were betting on an upgrade, which could have triggered inflows.  The expectations generated in recent months have turned into disappointment,  Buenos Aires investment advisor Portfolio Personal said in a note. Argentina's surprise launch of a 100-year bond on Monday was three times oversubscribed, a sign of investor confidence in the longevity of Macri's reforms. On assuming office in December 2015, Macri declared Argentina open for business after more than a decade of sweeping state intervention, including capital controls, had choked off much foreign investment. MSCI in 2009 had relegated Argentine stocks to its  frontier  index, which encompasses smaller and less developed stock markets. Investors said the MSCI decision did not change fundamental optimism about Argentina, where the economy is expected to grow around 3 percent this year after falling 2.3 percent in 2016, and inflation is seen at half last year's 40 percent.  It probably makes us a bit more negative in the very short term, but in the long term what we're focused on is the direction of the reforms,  said Leigh Innes, lead portfolio specialist for frontier markets strategy at T Rowe Price. While Macri has gotten rid of many investment obstacles including a holding period for foreign capital, investors are still wary of high capital gains taxes and the market regulator's ability to intervene in company affairs. Macri has proposed a capital markets reform addressing those issues, but it remains stalled in the opposition-controlled congress.  The local market is still hard to access,  said Asha Mehta, senior portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management in Boston.

Sterling rose after a Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane said he expected to back a rate increase this year. The currency sagged on Tuesday after BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise UK interest rates after three policymakers had voted in favor of a hike last week.      Commodity-linked currencies such as the Canadian dollar and Norwegian crown fell in step with lower oil prices.      The dollar will bump along just like this and perhaps strengthens a bit if we see tax reform from Washington,  said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco in New York.     Top Republicans from the U.S. Congress and Trump administration vowed on Tuesday to complete tax reform by the end of 2017.     The greenback rose earlier this week in reaction to comments from New York Fed President William Dudley who said a tightening U.S. labor market would rekindle inflation, which would leave open the possibility of another rate hike by year-end after two increases so far this year.     The dollar index was down 0.07 percent at 97.695, slightly below a one-month high of 97.871 reached on Tuesday.     The greenback weakened most on the day against the pound following Haldane's hawkish view, which ran counter to his perceived dovish reputation.      If his opinion is shifting then that is potentially significant news for rates going forward,  said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London.     Investors were also closely watching political developments, with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists Party (DUP) to form a government.               Sterling was down as much as 0.6 percent based on Tuesday's close in New York before halving that decline, which brought it to $1.2659.       Meanwhile, global benchmark oil prices touched seven-month lows on Wednesday on worries about oversupply. That put downward pressure on currencies whose economies are reliant on oil and commodity exports.     The Norwegian crown hit near a one-month low against the dollar, and last traded at 8.5376 crowns per dollar, down nearly 0.1 percent on the day.     The Canadian dollar traded at C$1.3328 per dollar, down 0.5 percent from late on Tuesday. ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 12:23PM (1623 GMT)  Description      RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct        YTD Pct                                               Previous   Change      Change                                               Session                 Euro/Dollar      EUR=        $1.1143        $1.1134     +0.08%     +5.99%  Dollar/Yen       JPY=        111.5100       111.4200    +0.08%     -4.59%  Euro/Yen         EURJPY=     124.25         124.09      +0.13%     +0.90%  Dollar/Swiss     CHF=        0.9743         0.9750      -0.07%     -4.27%  Sterling/Dollar  GBP=        1.2656         1.2629      +0.21%     +2.59%  Dollar/Canadian  CAD=        1.3323         1.3264      +0.44%     -0.80%  Australian/Doll  AUD=        0.7546         0.7579      -0.44%     +4.59%  ar                                                                   Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=     1.0858         1.0855      +0.03%     +1.32%  Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=     0.8803         0.8813      -0.11%     +3.35%  NZ               NZD=        0.7206         0.7239      -0.46%     +3.82%  Dollar/Dollar                                                        Dollar/Norway    NOK=        8.5365         8.5436      -0.08%     -1.16%  Euro/Norway      EURNOK=     9.5145         9.5090      +0.06%     +4.72%  Dollar/Sweden    SEK=        8.7607         8.7810      -0.15%     -3.81%  Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=     9.7637         9.7784      -0.15%     +1.92%             (Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho in London; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)       ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL8N1JI4RF"},

Chastened by an election which left her Conservative Party short of a majority in parliament and reopened debate on the nature of Britain's EU exit, May also sidelined reform on social care, education and corporate governance. May's two-year program, known as the Queen's Speech and prepared by ministers, was read out by Queen Elizabeth at parliament's opening ceremony. She has yet to secure a deal with Northern Ireland's DUP party to prop up her government. The queen told lawmakers from both the upper and lower houses of parliament that the government is committed to building  the widest possible consensus  on Brexit, working with parliament, devolved administrations, business and others.  My government's priority is to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union,  the queen said. The traditionally ceremonial address, usually dominated by pageantry, was a crucial testing ground for May's ability to run the country during its most challenging period for generations.     Her authority has been badly damaged just as Britain begins Brexit negotiations. Four militant attacks have raised questions about her grip on national security, and the death of at least 79 people in a tower block fire has become a flashpoint for public anger at her party's record in government.  The election result was not the one I hoped for, but this government will respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent,  May said in remarks introducing the policy plan.  First, we need to get Brexit right. That means getting a deal which delivers the result of last year’s referendum and does so in a way that commands maximum public support.  The shift to a more consultative tack drew a cautious welcome from business groups, which worry that May's plan focuses more on controlling immigration than protecting the economy.  Her new approach will be tested almost immediately, when she travels to Brussels on Thursday for a summit of EU leaders. Related CoverageTalks to support UK PM May's Conservatives making progress, Northern Irish party saysUK Foreign Secretary Johnson says Trump's visit to Britain will go aheadLawmakers will have to approve the speech in a vote, expected on June 29, that will be a de facto vote of confidence. Minority governments are a rare occurrence in British parliamentary politics where the electoral system usually produces a governing majority. May is under increasing pressure to do a deal with the DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) to support her government after nearly two weeks of talks. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, whose surprisingly strong election performance damaged May, called the speech  thin gruel . He said the government was ignoring the need for important domestic reforms to promote social justice.  A threadbare legislative program from a government that has lost its majority and apparently run out of ideas altogether,  he told parliament. The Queen delivered the speech in a toned-down ceremony that dispensed with a horse-drawn procession to parliament, and she swapped her crown for a blue hat. The changes to the ceremony were planned and due to a lack of rehearsal time. Britain's Queen Elizabeth sits next to Prince Charles during the State Opening of Parliament in central London, Britain June 21, 2017.Stefan Rousseau/PoolShe was accompanied by Prince Charles after her 96-year-old husband, Philip, was taken to hospital with an infection.  Brexit Focus As London sweltered in unseasonably hot weather, about 250 protesters gathered outside parliament after the speech, blaming the deadly fire in west London on years of Conservative cuts and demanding the fall of May's government.  May apologized for the government's inadequate response to that fire and acknowledged the country faced  difficult times .  Not every problem can be solved by an act of parliament,  she said.  Our response to disaster and acts of terror which take the lives of innocent people must be this: compassion, unity, resolve.   The legislative program spelt out a Brexit-dominated set of policies and indicated May was keen to secure broad support for leaving the EU - a change in tone from the strident approach she set out before the June 8 election. Slideshow (14 Images) While this will be a government that consults and listens, we are clear that we are going to see Brexit through, working with parliament, business, the devolved administrations and others to ensure a smooth and orderly withdrawal,  she said. A briefing document issued alongside the speech said the government would consult more closely with businesses and other interested parties to  test and validate positions and to continue to build support from the business community as we move forward .  This welcome change in tone needs to be backed by clarity and action now,  the Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry lobby group, Carolyn Fairbairn, said.   Firms will expect all politicians to put pragmatism before politics, starting with Brexit,  she said. Manufacturers' group EEF said industry needed more information on how the benefits of the EU's single market and customs union would be maintained throughout Britain's exit.  There must be a much closer partnership with industry if we're to avoid economic chaos when we leave the EU,  EEF Chief Executive Terry Scuoler said.  May's program for government was largely restricted to the technical work of making sure Brexit can happen: a bill that sets out how the government will transpose huge swathes of EU law into British law and separate bills on related topics such as immigration, customs and fisheries.  Beyond Brexit, the plan included a promise to pay more attention to public concerns about austerity, but did not alter the government's commitment to bring down the budget deficit. It also outlined plans to allow sectors such as electric vehicles and satellite technology to maintain a competitive edge, as well as promising to deliver an industrial strategy that spread prosperity across the country. May's plans will need the support of Northern Ireland's DUP, which is expected to use its 10 votes to back her in exchange for more funding to the province, policies geared toward boosting its economy and assurances that Brexit will not cut it off from the neighboring Irish Republic.

An ageing population is the result of increased life expectancy and lower fertility rates, and puts pressure on stretched healthcare systems, pensions and social care. One in four Europeans is aged 60 or older, with the number set to increase, at a time when mistrust of immigrants runs high in many European countries.  The 2017 revision of  World Population Prospects  - a report by the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division - said that by 2050, more than a third of Europe's population was predicted to be aged 60 or older.  Below are some key facts from the U.N. report. Globally, the number of people aged 60 or more is predicted to more than triple by 2100, rising to 3.1 billion from 962 million. The percentage of the population aged 60 or more in Africa, the world's youngest continent, is expected to rise to nearly 20 percent in 2100 from 5 percent in 2017. Globally, life expectancy has risen to 69 years for men and 73 years for women, from 65 years for men and 69 years for women, between 2000 and 2005. Fertility rates have fallen in nearly all parts of the world, including Africa - the region with the highest rates - where they have dropped to 4.7 children per woman from 5.1 children per woman in 2000 - 2005. Europe is an exception to this trend, with fertility rates increasing to 1.6 children per woman in 2010 - 2015 from 1.4 children in 2000 - 2005. With fertility levels of 4.3 children per woman, the population of the world's 47 least developed countries is expected to reach 1.9 billion people in 2050. The world's population has reached 7.6 billion people and every year it grows by some 83 million people. China, with a population of 1.4 billion, and India, with a population of 1.3 billion, remain the world's two most populous countries. In about seven years, India's population is expected to surpass that of China. The population of Nigeria, the world's seventh largest country, is projected to surpass that of the United States and become the world's third largest by 2050. There are 102 men for every 100 women.

Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley said his office filed a lawsuit in a state court in St. Louis against Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson and units of Endo International Plc. Hawley said the three companies knew their opioid products were addictive and potentially life-threatening, but  engaged in a deliberate campaign of fraud to convince Missouri doctors and consumers otherwise.   They used bogus front organizations and fake research; they used fraudulent advertising and deceptive trade practices,  Hawley said in remarks prepared for a news conference.  And they repeatedly lied about the true risks of the drugs they sold.  Hawley said the lawsuit accuses the companies of violating Missouri's consumer protection laws and its Medicaid statutes and seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and civil penalties. The case made Missouri the third state to sue drug manufacturers over their opioid marketing and sales practices. Last week a bipartisan group of state attorneys general announced an investigation. FILE PHOTO: Bottles of prescription painkiller OxyContin, 40mg pills, made by Purdue Pharma L.D. sit on a shelf at a local pharmacy, in Provo, Utah, U.S., April 25, 2017.George Frey/File PhotoPurdue, J&J; and Endo were previously sued in similar lawsuits by the Ohio and Mississippi attorneys general, who also targeted Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Allergan Plc. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. J&J;'s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit said in a statement it acted appropriately and responsibly, adding that its opioid pain medications were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and carry mandated warnings about their known risks. Purdue, which manufactures OxyContin, said it denied the allegations but shared Hawley's concerns about the opioid crisis and was  committed to working collaboratively to find solutions.  Endo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said its  top priorities include patient safety and ensuring that patients with chronic pain have access to safe and effective therapeutic options.  The FDA this month asked Endo to withdraw its long-lasting opioid painkiller Opana ER from the market. Beyond the states' cases, similar lawsuits have been filed by local governments, including two California counties; the cities of Chicago and Dayton, Ohio; three Tennessee district attorneys; and nine New York counties.

United Party for National Development (UPND) leader Hakainde Hichilema, who is facing treason charges for impeding a motorcade for President Edgar Lungu, had been moved from a prison in Lusaka to the maximum security facility outside the capital on June 9. Magistrate Ireen Wishimanga said the opposition leader and five others should be moved to a prison near the court while she hears a separate case in which Hichilema wants a minister to be charged with contempt of court for allegedly saying he was in prison because he refused to recognize Lungu as president.  ..the order given by this court...

Prison warders drove Hichilema and his co-accused to Lusaka Central Prison immediately after the court case. Hichilema was arrested in April when police raided his home and charged him with trying to overthrow the government, a case which has stoked political tensions in what is regarded as one of Africa's more stable and functional democracies following a bruising election last year.

Europe's STOXX 600 fell 0.2 percent, extending the previous session's losses slightly. Both euro zone stocks and blue chips fell 0.2 percent. Financial services, insurance and banking stocks were among the worst performers, punished by heavy losses from British subprime lender Provident Financial. Provident plummeted as much as 20 percent after warning that disruption from the reorganisation of its consumer credit division would weigh on its results for the rest of the financial year.  We had been concerned about rising impairments and customer attrition in the consumer credit division as the new model was implemented. The transition appears to have been more painful than expected,  said Liberum analysts. Belgium's KBC was the worst-performing on the banking index, down 4 percent as its investor day got off to a disappointing start. KBC released a new core equity tier 1 target, a key metric of banks' solvency, of 16.6 percent, and analysts at KBW said the new figure did not leave room for excess capital distribution.  We expect the share price may be on the weak side before further details are disclosed during the day,  they said. A supply glut weighing on crude prices compounded losses, sending the oil and gas index to a near seven-month low. Italy's equity market provided some relief, however, as banks UBI Banca, BPER Banca, UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo all gained between 2.5 percent to over 5 percent after Intesa offered to buy the good assets of two troubled Veneto banks. Italy benchmark jumped 1.3 percent on the back of this positive development for its banking sector. Retail stocks were also weighed by Belgian food retailer Colruyt falling 6.7 percent after its full-year results missed consensus. Despite some glum company updates on the day, the latest first-quarter results figures highlight the reasons for investors’ belief in underlying strength among European companies. STOXX 600 companies have on average reported earnings 10.2 percent above estimates, beating the 4 percent average surprise factor (since 2011) and the 6 percent surprise factor over the past four quarters, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data showed. Of the 300 companies reporting first quarter revenues to date, 74.3 percent exceeded analyst estimates, against 53.6 percent in a typical quarter.

Counterterrorism Office, giving a Russian a top job at the world body's headquarters in New York. Russia's Ambassador to International Organizations in Vienna, Vladimir Voronkov, told Reuters he met with Guterres on Tuesday. Reuters exclusively reported his appointment earlier on Wednesday. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said that in his new role, Voronkov would  provide strategic leadership to U.N. counterterrorism efforts, participate in the decision-making process of the United Nations and ensure that the cross-cutting origins and impact of terrorism are reflected in the work.  Haq said Voronkov had more than 30 years experience with the Russian foreign service, working primarily on U.N. issues.  Countering terrorism is one of the things that most countries can work with Russia on,  said a senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.   We have very different views on what counts as a terrorist and what counts as an appropriate response to terrorism from Russia, but at least it's a discussion we can have more easily than we can have on political affairs or peacekeeping,  the diplomat said.  Nationals from four of the five veto-wielding powers on the U.N. Security Council - the United States, Britain, France and China - have for the past decade held senior U.N. posts at the world body's headquarters in New York.  An American heads U.N. political affairs, a Frenchman has run peacekeeping, a Briton has been in charge of humanitarian affairs, and a Chinese national has run economic and social affairs. For the past seven years a Russian has headed the Vienna-based U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.   It is fair to say that the Russians are under-represented at the U.N. at the most senior levels,  the senior Western diplomat said. The 193-member United Nations General Assembly approved the creation of a U.N. Counterterrorism Office last week, which will help states implement a global counterterrorism strategy adopted by the General Assembly in 2006. The strategy, which has been reviewed every two years, aims to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, measures to prevent and combat terrorism, build states' capacity to do so, and ensure respect for human rights and the rule of law as the basis for the fight. The appointment of Voronkov ends speculation among some diplomats that Moscow may have wanted its ambassador to the Washington, Sergei Kislyak, to do the job. Kislyak has become embroiled in controversy after some U.S. lawmakers raised concern about his meetings with officials of President Donald Trump's administration. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign with Moscow. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump. Russia has denied any such interference. Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and James Dalgleish","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-extremists-russia-idUSKBN19C1Z3"},

The Baltic Sea has become an area of rising tensions between Moscow and the Western military alliance. Earlier this month, Russia scrambled a fighter jet to intercept a nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 strategic bomber it said was flying over the Baltic, in an incident that had echoes of the Cold War. A video of Wednesday's incident broadcast on a TV channel run by the Russian Ministry of Defense showed an F-16 flying parallel with the minister's plane at a short distance. It was not clear which air force the F-16 belonged to. A Russian Sukhoi-27 fighter jet was then seen inserting itself between the F-16 and the minister's plane before tilting its wings from side to side to show the missiles it is carrying. The F-16 was then seen leaving the area.  NATO said it had tracked three Russian aircraft over the Baltic on Wednesday, including two fighter jets which it said did not respond to air traffic control or requests to identify themselves.  As is standard practice whenever unknown aircraft approach NATO air space, NATO and national air forces took to the sky to monitor these flights,  a NATO official said.  When NATO aircraft intercept a plane they identify it visually, maintaining a safe distance at all times. Once complete, NATO jets break away,  the official said. The alliance said it had no information about who was on board the planes. Shoigu's plane had been en route to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad for a meeting to discuss how well Russia's western flank was defended. Footage of what happened was filmed by someone on Shoigu's plane. The RIA news agency reported that NATO aircraft had also tracked Shoigu's plane when he returned after his meeting later on Wednesday, albeit at a greater distance. The Kremlin referred questions about the incident to the defense ministry, which did not immediately comment. It has said in the past that all Russian flights over the Baltic are conducted in strict accordance with international law. Russian politicians called the episode the latest in a string of  provocations,  a day after the Russian defense ministry said an RC-135 U.S. reconnaissance plane had swerved dangerously near a Russian fighter jet over the Baltic and that another RC-135 had been intercepted. The Pentagon disputed that, saying the U.S. aircraft  did nothing to provoke this behavior  and that the Russian intercept had been unsafe.  In another episode, Sweden said on Wednesday it had called in Russia's ambassador for talks after a Russian fighter jet buzzed a Swedish military jet on an electronic intelligence gathering mission over the Baltic on Monday.  The Russian plane's actions were out of the ordinary ... in terms of the distance between the planes which was at certain times very small,  the Swedish military said in a statement.

Nuclear is now the largest low-carbon power source in Europe and the United States, about three times bigger than wind and solar combined, according to IEA data. But most reactors were built in the 1970s and early 80s, and will reach the end of their life around 2020. With the average nuclear plant running for 8,000 hours a year versus 1,500-2,000 hours for a solar plant, governments must expand renewable investments to replace old nuclear plants if they are to meet decarbonisation targets, IEA Chief Economist Laszlo Varro told Reuters.  The ageing of the nuclear fleet is a considerable challenge for energy security and decarbonisation objectives,  he said on the sidelines of the Eurelectric utilities conference in Portugal. Renewables have grown rapidly in the past decade but about 20 percent of new low-carbon capacity has been lost from the decommissioning of nuclear plants in the same period, he said.  This is just a taste of thing to come,  Varro said. Russia and India were building new plants, while China was bringing a new plant online every quarter, Varro said. However, he said future projects in Japan were uncertain after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, while there was less appetite for new nuclear projects in Europe and the United States. Financing new nuclear plants has become more challenging, partly because several new builds were running over budget, while in the United States nuclear has been struggling to compete against plants run on cheap shale gas. Governments who chose the renewables route would have to consider upgrading power grids and invest in power storage to offset the variable nature of renewable generation, while those choosing nuclear would need to offer financial support as Britain has done for its plans, Varro said. Wind and solar generation was expanding rapidly, but the pace needed to increase to meet climate stabilisation goals.  At the moment it is not quickly enough,  he said. The biggest challenge was in Europe and the United States, where nuclear energy capacity was steady or falling, he said.  If we do not keep nuclear in the energy mix and do not accelerate wind and solar deployment, the loss of nuclear capacity will knock us back by 15 to 20 years. We do not have that much time to lose,  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/nuclear-carbon-iea-idUSL1N1JI140"},

Intesa said it would only take on the two banks at a symbolic price if they were stripped of all bad loans and legal risks, and if the deal had no impact on its own capital ratios and dividend policy. A source close to the matter said Intesa, the only bank known to have made a bid so far, had offered 1 euro. Italy is scrambling to prevent the two banks, which have a capital shortfall of 6.4 billion euros ($7.13 billion) and are bleeding deposits, from being wound down under European banking rules. Those rules would impose losses on senior bondholders and large depositors -- a politically unpalatable prospect in Rome ahead of national elections next year. Pressure to find a solution has increased since Spain's Banco Popular was rescued by Santander this month in a deal orchestrated by European authorities. In Popular's case, no state money was used and Santander is seeking around 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion) of capital from shareholders to help to it take on Popular. Intesa's role is part of a new plan by the Rome government that would effectively liquidate Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca with the help of taxpayer money to reduce losses for the banks' private investors. The plan involves splitting the two banks' assets into  bad  and  good  banks. The bad bank would take on their soured debts and be financed partly by the state, with junior bondholders and shareholders also taking a hit, sources have said. But the conditions set by Intesa, viewed as the most likely taker for the healthier parts of the two banks, are so demanding that a deal risks being seen as gift to the Milanese bank. It is also not clear whether the European Commission, which must authorise the use of state aid, would approve the plan. Intesa said that for its offer to proceed legislation was needed to ensure it would be shielded from all integration and restructuring charges as well as  risks, obligations and claims due to events occurred prior to the sale.  Such charges would cover among other things the heavy job cuts that are expected at the two banks, which currently employ around 11,000 people in total. They would also cover legal risks stemming from a scandal over the mis-selling of shares by the two banks to their own customers in exchange for loans. The cost to the Italian state could be about 5 billion euros, one banker familiar with the matter said. The European Commission declined to comment. The Italian treasury had no immediate comment.  Intesa wants to have its cake and eat it too,  said Vincenzo Longo, an analyst at IG markets.  They want the state to take on all the problems. I doubt that the deal can be done on these terms.  Another analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said he was skeptical that the plan would meet EU banking rules as Intesa was effectively demanding that the two Veneto banks be recapitalised before taking any of their assets. The two banks, from the north-eastern Veneto region, have a combined market share of only 3 percent at the national level, with loans totalling about 40 billion euros. They had planned to merge, creating Italy's eighth-biggest bank by assets. $1 = 0.8973 euros Additional reporting by Francesca Landini and Valentina Za; Writing by Silvia Aloisi.

The U.S. S&P; 500 financial sector was last down about 0.4 percent while the European Stoxx Europe 600 Financial Services index was down 1.3 percent. The financial sector fell as the U.S. Treasury yield curve held near 10-year lows. A drop in oil prices to near seven-month lows also put pressure on energy shares as investors discounted evidence that major producers are sticking to a deal to cut output. The U.S. Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend, rising on gains in biotechnology stocks. So far this year, oil has lost 20 percent in value, its weakest performance for the first six months of the year since 1997. Brent crude was last down 43 cents, or 0.93 percent, at $45.59 a barrel. U.S. crude was down 33 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $43.18 per barrel.  Oil has perhaps tempered some sentiment near-term,  said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  If oil falls below $40, one would see pressure on overall earnings, not just the energy sector.  MSCI's all-country world equity index was last down 0.58 points or 0.12 percent, at 465.71. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last down 26.95 points, or 0.13 percent, at 21,440.19. The S&P; 500 was down 0.18 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,436.85. The Nasdaq Composite added 33.13 points, or 0.54 percent, to 6,221.17. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 0.23 percent to 1,527.1. The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds flattened to 96 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007. Five-year note yields, which are highly sensitive to rate policy, rose to a four-week high of 1.80 percent on Tuesday. Thirty-year bond yields, which are largely driven by future expectations of growth and inflation, meanwhile dropped to 2.72 percent on Wednesday, the lowest since Nov. 9.  I think the market may be pricing in a little higher odds of another rate hike before the end of the year, and that is helping drive some of the flattening,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. Hawkish comments from the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane were also seen as hurting short-term bonds on Wednesday. The dollar edged higher against the yen after data showed U.S. existing home sales posted a surprise increase in May, soothing some concerns about a real estate slowdown. Gold steadied after sliding to a five-week low in the previous session. Spot gold prices were last up $1.68, or 0.14 percent, at $1,244.49 an ounce.

MSCI said it needed more signs that center-right President Mauricio Macri's pro-market reforms were  irreversible  to reincorporate the country's shares into its Emerging Markets Index.     Macri has repealed the capital controls and foreign exchange restrictions that drove MSCI to downgrade Latin America's No. 3 economy to  frontier  status.

Shares of Pampa Energia SA  led the losses, dropping 8.5 percent.     The index had risen nearly 25 percent in 2017 as traders anticipated increased inflows from funds tracking the MSCI index. As those expectations faded, the peso weakened 1 percent to a record low.      There is no longer any rush for passive funds to get in, and those who have been buying in advance of an expected reclassification will probably now look to take some money off the table,  strategists at Itaú BBA wrote in a note to clients.     However,  we still have a positive view of the current domestic dynamics in Argentina, both political and economic.

Switzerland-based Gategroup was acquired last year by Chinese conglomerate HNA, and this year combined with former Air France-KLM division Servair. The company, with annual sales of around 4.5 billion Swiss francs ($4.6 billion), says it currently has a strong presence in the Americas, western Europe, Africa, and in Asia-Pacific countries such as Japan.  We don't intend to be the only player in China. We'd like to be the most important, but it is a competitive market,  Xavier Rossinyol told Reuters at the Paris Airshow. It is the first time Gategroup has had a chalet at the air show, where it has been enticing current clients and potential new customers with food cooked by Michelin-starred chefs. Rossinyol said the plan was to combine the network of Servair, Gategroup and HNA in mainland China, and that he expected significant progress in this over the next year. As a Chinese company, HNA has better access to the key players such as airlines and airports, he said.  The idea is to use HNA to access the market and then to bring our industrial standards on health, production and efficiencies,  he said. The acquisition of Gategroup by HNA sent ripples through the airline catering market and rival dnata said in April it was also looking for more deals. Lufthansa's LSG unit is another competitor. Rossinyol said Gategroup's priority was growing its own business, but acquisitions could be possible.  Yes there are gaps.

Elovitch, who controls the telecoms company through holding company Eurocom Group, was held for questioning and then released on 5 million shekels ($1.4 million) bail by a Tel Aviv court on Wednesday. He has denied any wrongdoing. The case focuses on Bezeq's 2015 acquisition of the remaining stake in its satellite TV unit, YES, from parent company Eurocom. The ISA said it suspects Elovitch acted in a conflict of interest and that Bezeq executives are suspected of interfering with operations connected to that deal over the following year to artificially impact financial reports. Elovitch and two senior officers at YES - both of whom were remanded to house arrest while denying wrongdoing - are suspected of fraud, financial reporting crimes and obstruction of justice, the ISA said.

Intesa said it would only take on the two banks at a symbolic price if they were stripped of all bad loans and legal risks, and if the deal had no impact on its own capital ratios and dividend policy. A source close to the matter said Intesa, the only bank known to have made a bid so far, had offered 1 euro. Italy is scrambling to prevent the two banks, which have a capital shortfall of 6.4 billion euros ($7.13 billion) and are bleeding deposits, from being wound down under European banking rules. Those rules would impose losses on senior bondholders and large depositors -- a politically unpalatable prospect in Rome ahead of national elections next year. Pressure to find a solution has increased since Spain's Banco Popular was rescued by Santander this month in a deal orchestrated by European authorities. In Popular's case, no state money was used and Santander is seeking around 7 billion euros ($7.9 billion) of capital from shareholders to help to it take on Popular. Intesa's role is part of a new plan by the Rome government that would effectively liquidate Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca with the help of taxpayer money to reduce losses for the banks' private investors. The plan involves splitting the two banks' assets into  bad  and  good  banks. The bad bank would take on their soured debts and be financed partly by the state, with junior bondholders and shareholders also taking a hit, sources have said. But the conditions set by Intesa, viewed as the most likely taker for the healthier parts of the two banks, are so demanding that a deal risks being seen as gift to the Milanese bank. It is also not clear whether the European Commission, which must authorise the use of state aid, would approve the plan. Intesa said that for its offer to proceed legislation was needed to ensure it would be shielded from all integration and restructuring charges as well as  risks, obligations and claims due to events occurred prior to the sale.  Such charges would cover among other things the heavy job cuts that are expected at the two banks, which currently employ around 11,000 people in total. They would also cover legal risks stemming from a scandal over the mis-selling of shares by the two banks to their own customers in exchange for loans. The cost to the Italian state could be about 5 billion euros, one banker familiar with the matter said. The European Commission declined to comment. The Italian treasury had no immediate comment.  Intesa wants to have its cake and eat it too,  said Vincenzo Longo, an analyst at IG markets.  They want the state to take on all the problems. I doubt that the deal can be done on these terms.  Another analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said he was skeptical that the plan would meet EU banking rules as Intesa was effectively demanding that the two Veneto banks be recapitalised before taking any of their assets. The two banks, from the north-eastern Veneto region, have a combined market share of only 3 percent at the national level, with loans totalling about 40 billion euros. They had planned to merge, creating Italy's eighth-biggest bank by assets. $1 = 0.8973 euros Additional reporting by Francesca Landini and Valentina Za; Writing by Silvia Aloisi.

With opposition parties abstaining, the Social Democrats (PSD) and their junior coalition partner ALDE voted 241-7 to topple Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu in a no-confidence motion on Wednesday. They withdrew their support from him a week ago, saying he had failed to uphold an ambitious governing program that had won the coalition a sweeping election victory in December and a comfortable parliamentary majority. A push by Grindeanu's government to decriminalize some corruption offences triggered massive street protests in February, the biggest in Romania since the collapse of Nicolae Ceausescu's communist rule in 1989. The unrest forced the government to rescind its decriminalization decree. Observers say many Social Democrats have been unhappy with Grindeanu's failure to relax the anti-corruption rules, and want a new premier to do more to protect party seniors facing graft charges, including PSD leader Liviu Dragnea. Related CoverageRuling Social Democrats to unveil new name on Monday: leaderGrindeanu refused to resign, accusing Dragnea, who holds the party in a tight grip, of trying to centralize all power. Centrist President Klaus Iohannis, who has said he will only approve a candidate for prime minister who does not face pending investigations or trials, has called political parties for consultations on Monday.

I'm absolutely convinced the president will continue to be interested in Romania’s stability and that ... on Monday he will accept our ruling coalition's nomination for a prime minister. If he have a PM designated on Monday, we may have new cabinet approved by the end of next week.  The leu currency eased away from a four-and-a-half-year low against the euro and rose 0.3 percent after the vote, reflecting market relief that policy gridlock could soon end.  Some political uncertainties have dissipated,  ING Romania chief economist Ciprian Dascalu said.  The no-confidence vote revealed that there is a parliamentary majority that can support a new government, theoretically.  The PSD's governing program envisions further tax cuts and public sector wage and pension cuts.

The Scotsman captured the only two PGA Tour titles of his career last season and started the 2016-17 campaign with top-10 finishes in Malaysia, China, and Mayakoba.  He has since struggled, however, and now hopes to draw on happy memories at TPC River Highlands.   I haven't played nearly as good as I expected to. But at the same time, I almost expected it (a dip) coming off last year, my best year as a pro by a long way,  Knox, who will tee off with twice Travelers winner Bubba Watson and Australian Marc Leishman in Thursday's opening round, told reporters.  So maybe it was inevitable that it was going to be a slight downwards turn. But recently my game feels pretty good.  All in all, I'm excited to be here, and hopefully this year the Travelers Championship can get me going a good kick start to a big summer.  Knox, who missed the cut at last week's U.S. Open, will be among a star-studded field headed by world number three Rory McIlroy, Australian Jason Day, two-times major winner Jordan Spieth and Watson. Northern Irishman McIlroy, who also missed the cut last week at Erin Hills in his first event back from a month-long layoff with a niggling rib problem, will be making his Connecticut debut on a par-70 layout that should suit his style of play. Birdies will be especially crucial to success this week given that the tournament has produced a winning score of 10 under or lower every year since 1994. No other golfer in the field knows more about going low at TPC River Highlands than Jim Furyk, whose final-round 58 last year is the lowest round ever on the PGA Tour. The 17-times PGA Tour winner will be joined in Connecticut by another member of the sub-60 club in world number 12 Justin Thomas, who enters the week in great form. In addition to three wins this season, Thomas has three top-10 finishes in his last four starts, including a share of ninth place at the U.S. Open, and leads the PGA Tour in birdie average and is fourth in scoring average.

The Baltic Sea has become an area of rising tensions between Moscow and the Western military alliance. Earlier this month, Russia scrambled a fighter jet to intercept a nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 strategic bomber it said was flying over the Baltic, in an incident that had echoes of the Cold War. A video of Wednesday's incident broadcast on a TV channel run by the Russian Ministry of Defense showed an F-16 flying parallel with the minister's plane at a short distance. It was not clear which air force the F-16 belonged to. A Russian Sukhoi-27 fighter jet was then seen inserting itself between the F-16 and the minister's plane before tilting its wings from side to side to show the missiles it is carrying. The F-16 was then seen leaving the area.  NATO said it had tracked three Russian aircraft over the Baltic on Wednesday, including two fighter jets which it said did not respond to air traffic control or requests to identify themselves.  As is standard practice whenever unknown aircraft approach NATO air space, NATO and national air forces took to the sky to monitor these flights,  a NATO official said.  When NATO aircraft intercept a plane they identify it visually, maintaining a safe distance at all times. Once complete, NATO jets break away,  the official said. The alliance said it had no information about who was on board the planes. Shoigu's plane had been en route to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad for a meeting to discuss how well Russia's western flank was defended. Footage of what happened was filmed by someone on Shoigu's plane. The RIA news agency reported that NATO aircraft had also tracked Shoigu's plane when he returned after his meeting later on Wednesday, albeit at a greater distance. The Kremlin referred questions about the incident to the defense ministry, which did not immediately comment. It has said in the past that all Russian flights over the Baltic are conducted in strict accordance with international law. Russian politicians called the episode the latest in a string of  provocations,  a day after the Russian defense ministry said an RC-135 U.S. reconnaissance plane had swerved dangerously near a Russian fighter jet over the Baltic and that another RC-135 had been intercepted. The Pentagon disputed that, saying the U.S. aircraft  did nothing to provoke this behavior  and that the Russian intercept had been unsafe.  In another episode, Sweden said on Wednesday it had called in Russia's ambassador for talks after a Russian fighter jet buzzed a Swedish military jet on an electronic intelligence gathering mission over the Baltic on Monday.  The Russian plane's actions were out of the ordinary ... in terms of the distance between the planes which was at certain times very small,  the Swedish military said in a statement.

Grassley) By Toni Clarke WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration moved on Wednesday to prevent pharmaceutical companies from  gaming  the system to block or delay entry of generic rivals. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a blog post that the agency plans to hold a public meeting on July 18 to identify ways pharmaceutical companies are using FDA rules to place obstacles in the way of generic competition.  We know that sometimes our regulatory rules might be 'gamed' in ways that may delay generic drug approvals beyond the time frame the law intended, in order to reduce competition,  he said in the blog post.  We are actively looking at ways our rules are being used and, in some cases, misused.  The move comes as President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Congress search for ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Trump is preparing to put out an executive order on drug pricing, according to media reports, and last week U.S. Senator Ron Wyden introduced a bill to require companies to explain the reasons for significant price increases.  Americans are sick and tired of seeing the cost of their prescription drugs race past their paychecks,  said Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. The FDA does not include price considerations when deciding whether to approve a new drug, but Gottlieb said the agency can facilitate increased competition by approving lower-cost generics. That means removing some of the obstacles placed by branded companies in the way of generic manufacturers. These obstacles can include limiting the availability of branded products for testing by generic companies, or prolonging negotiations with generic companies over the implementation of shared risk-management programs. Gottlieb said recently that the FDA is evaluating whether to waive a requirement that generic companies and brand companies share a single system to ensure a drug's safe use. The FDA's move comes two days after Republican Senator Chuck Grassley urged Gottlieb in a letter to consider recommendations in two bills co-sponsored by Grassley to enhance access to generic drugs; and encouraged him to work closely with the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to address anti-competitive behavior in the drug industry. Representatives from the pharmaceutical industry's main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, were not immediately available for comment. Gottlieb said the agency plans to examine policy and program changes, including using its own authorities more forcefully and potentially collaborating more closely with other agencies.

The six have been convicted of murdering Sergeant Abdallah al-Motweli, who guarded the house of a judge who helped to sentence Egypt's former president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood to 20 years in prison. Sisi, who in 2013 headed the military that ousted Mursi after mass protests against his rule, has until Thursday to commute the death sentence of the six. Their sentence can no longer be appealed after Egypt's top court this month upheld their conviction.  The most important recommendation is protecting the six young men's right to life, which only the president can currently do through commuting the sentences,  the Geneva-based Committee for Justice (CFJ) said on Wednesday. In a detailed 30-page report based on a review of court records and interviews with their families and lawyers, the CFJ highlighted what it said were several violations faced by the defendants, who have come to be known as the  Mansoura Six , a reference to the Nile Delta city where they were tried. The report focused on several violations: the defendants were forcibly disappeared, not legally arrested, and were tortured into confessing. Their confessions were taped and aired by the police before prosecutors questioned them, the report also said, in violation of Egypt's penal code. Egyptian authorities do not comment on cases after a court has issued a verdict. The Interior Ministry denies all allegations of abuse. The Mansoura Six were kept in illegal detention centers, denied access to lawyers, and were kept in inhumane conditions, CFJ's report also said. Court records seen by Reuters show the judge based his verdict on police investigations that cite  secret  sources which officers refused to reveal in court. Amnesty International also urged Sisi to intervene to prevent the execution of the six men.  The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

With opposition parties abstaining, the Social Democrats (PSD) and their junior coalition partner ALDE voted 241-7 to topple Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu in a no-confidence motion on Wednesday. They withdrew their support from him a week ago, saying he had failed to uphold an ambitious governing program that had won the coalition a sweeping election victory in December and a comfortable parliamentary majority. A push by Grindeanu's government to decriminalize some corruption offences triggered massive street protests in February, the biggest in Romania since the collapse of Nicolae Ceausescu's communist rule in 1989. The unrest forced the government to rescind its decriminalization decree. Observers say many Social Democrats have been unhappy with Grindeanu's failure to relax the anti-corruption rules, and want a new premier to do more to protect party seniors facing graft charges, including PSD leader Liviu Dragnea.

Centrist President Klaus Iohannis, who has said he will only approve a candidate for prime minister who does not face pending investigations or trials, has called political parties for consultations on Monday.

The blue chip FTSE 100 was down 0.3 percent at 7,447.79 points at its close, weighed down by another weak session for oil stocks as the oil price headed lower. The FTSE hit a session low after Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane signalled he would back a rise in interest rates in the second half of this year, which also sent sterling higher. The Queen's Speech, which included Prime Minister Theresa May's legislative agenda for the next two years, appeared to have little impact on British shares. Provident Financial was the biggest individual faller, plummeting up to 20 percent after it warned that disruption from the reorganisation of its consumer credit division would weigh on its results for the rest of the financial year. Analysts at Liberum said they had been concerned about rising impairments and customer attrition in the division as the new model was implemented, but the transition was  more painful than expected.   The sheer speed of the deterioration has taken us by surprise, particularly after a reassuring Q1 interim management statement on May 12,  they added. Its losses also weighed on Hargreaves Lansdown, the second-worst blue-chip performer. Gains by Whitbread and Centrica were a bright spot, however. Costa Coffee and Premier Inn owner Whitbread was the top performer among UK and European shares, up 3.4 percent after reporting sales rose 7.6 percent in the first quarter.  If the consumer gets squeezed by inflation, then they will have to cut back, but probably more on the bigger-ticket items in the short term,  said Greg Johnson, analyst at Shore Capital.  Affordable treats, lower-ticket leisure expenditure will probably outperform bigger-ticket items such as houses.  With most of its hotels in the UK, Whitbread was also well positioned to benefit from a potential rise in 'staycations', Johnson said. Energy firm Centrica rose as investors cheered the sale of its two biggest gas plants to a subsidiary of Czech energy company EPH. London-focused house builder Berkeley Group also made gains among lacklustre mid-caps, up 2.1 percent after its full-year results beat expectations with a 53 percent increase in profits before tax. However, it warned uncertainty related to Brexit could cut into demand for houses.  Full-year 2016/2017 is likely to represent peak profits for Berkeley Group,  said Colin Sheridan, analyst at Davy Research.  The results are strong, however, and the market is likely to be encouraged by comments that selling trends in London have improved into the end of the financial year,  he added.

The pound had earlier sunk beneath $1.26 for the first time since mid-April as investors worried about Prime Minister Theresa May struggling to find the support she needs for her government, which lost its parliamentary majority in elections just under two weeks ago. But it reversed those falls as the chief economist's speech was published, trading up as much as 0.6 percent on the day to reach $1.2710, before easing back to $1.2666 by 1545 GMT. That still left it almost a cent higher than its earlier trough. Against the euro, the pound was up 0.2 percent at 87.98 pence. Haldane's comments ran contrary to those of Governor Mark Carney, who had driven the pound lower on Tuesday by saying  now was not the time  to begin to raise rates. Bets on a rate hike within the next year surged. Short sterling contracts for December reversed all of their gains since Carney's speech, showing markets pricing in a greater than 50 percent chance of the Bank raising rates by then. British gilt futures also shed around 25 ticks and government bond yields hit session highs.  Here are some hawkish comments that are causing the market to price a greater probability of tightening, and sterling is responding to that,  said Barclays currency strategist Hamish Pepper, in London.  There was a period of time in which it was all about politics for the currency – how big the political risk premium should be and so on – but for a while now we’ve been trading more like a normal currency, where data surprises and central bank rhetoric drives the normal kinds of reactions.  The UK's blue chip FTSE 100, which tends to fall as sterling rises because most of its multinational constituents earn in foreign currencies, hit a session low after the comments and was last down 0.3 pct. The Queen's Speech, which featured a promise from the prime minister to listen more closely to businesses' concerns about Britain leaving the European Union, appeared to have little impact on the currency, which has fallen around 15 percent against the dollar since the vote for Brexit a year ago. At a time of unprecedented political uncertainty, May is under increasing pressure to secure a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to prop up her government after nearly two weeks of talks.  The only situation where I could see massive downside (for sterling) materialising is if the government collapses or Labour (the left-wing opposition party) gets the chance to form a government,  said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX strategy with Bank of Montreal in London.

May took responsibility for shortcomings in the response to the fire a week ago, and pledged that victims would receive more support.

Traffic passes a new housing development in Kensington where 68 apartments will be assigned to rehouse families who lost their homes in the Grenfell Tower fire, in London, Britain, June 21, 2017.Hannah McKayCommunities minister Sajid Javid said that 68 apartments were newly built social housing in Kensington Row, where private properties can cost as much as 3.5 million pounds ($4.43 million). He added that these were the first batch of permanent new homes to rehouse residents of Grenfell Tower. Police said that 79 people were dead, or missing and assumed dead, after the blaze rapidly spread through the 24-storey block. The tragedy shone a spotlight on London's economic divide, as it happened a few hundred meters (yards) away from one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country. Slideshow (4 Images)The upmarket neighborhoods of London's Kensington district have proved hugely popular with foreign buyers in recent years, and pressure had been growing to ensure that victims of the fire were not relocated outside of the borough when many properties nearby stand empty for much of the year. Opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for government to requisition unoccupied properties in the area to rehouse residents. Properties for sale on Kensington Row are priced between 1.5 million and 3.5 million pounds, according to housebuilder Berkeley Group's website. The development is just a mile away from Grenfell Tower.  The government said that the new homes will be a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom flats across two blocks, and that developer St Edward was committing extra staff to the project to fast-track its completion.

The quest for a parliamentary majority has forced the British prime minister to curb her ambitions for far-reaching domestic reforms. Her agenda, read out by Queen Elizabeth at the opening of parliament on Wednesday, will now focus on paving the way for leaving the European Union. Yet shaky support means even this blueprint could stay stuck on the drawing board. Less than a fortnight after the electoral drubbing that erased her slim majority, May struck a conciliatory tone. The two-year programme for government carried only the faintest trace of the bold manifesto presented a month earlier. Promises to reform pensions, schools and social care were dumped or diluted. Plans to rein in executive pay and give workers a greater role in corporate governance were also notable by their absence. The stripped-down plan reflects political reality. May’s Conservative party is hoping to secure the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party to secure a parliamentary majority for its agenda. Even if the talks succeed, the government will be vulnerable to rebellion from within its own ranks. Timing is the other consideration. Almost three months of the two-year Brexit process have already ticked by. In the time that remains, the government needs to pass a raft of legislation to prepare for leaving the EU. This includes transcribing existing European laws into British statute, as well as crafting policies on issues such as trade, immigration and agriculture. Of the 27 pieces of legislation outlined on Wednesday, almost a third relate to Brexit. Yet parliamentary backing for this agenda is far from assured. Despite her consensual noises, May has not backed away from the vision of Brexit she set out earlier this year: leaving the EU single market and customs union, and sharply limiting immigration. The election result has cast doubt on popular support for that project. It has emboldened parliamentarians who favour a softer approach. Even if Theresa May can cobble together a loose coalition and fend off challenges to her leadership, her stripped-down agenda remains a work in progress.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

May left out a range of unpopular policies as she attempts to pass the government plan, known as the  Queen's Speech , without her own parliamentary majority. A spokesman for May said that the government remained supportive in principle of some of the policies that were not formally included in the speech. Below are some of the proposals mentioned - and left out - in the policy plan as well as comments by May's spokesman.  You can read full details of the proposals here: here Brexit         As Britain departs the EU, the UK government plans the following: -  As we enter the negotiation phase we will look to intensify this work in order to test and validate positions and to continue to build support from the business community as we move forward,  the government said of Brexit. - May said her plan for Brexit would help to strengthen the United Kingdom, by supporting major industries in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. She said she was  determined to deliver the best Brexit deal  and  Committed to keeping our country safe, enhancing our standing in the wider world and bringing our United Kingdom closer together.  - A  Great Repeal Bill  to convert EU law into British law - A standalone customs regime for Britain, with flexibility to accommodate future trade arrangements and changes to Britain's VAT and excise regimes. - A trade bill to let Britain operate its own independent trade policy when it leaves the EU. - A bill to repeal EU law on immigration to end free movement, and make migration of EU nationals subject to UK law. May's spokesman said that the government remained committed to its target to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands. - Bills on fisheries and agriculture to enable Britain to manage its waters and support farmers - A nuclear safeguards bill to establish a new regulatory regime following Britain's departure from Euratom. Economy - Britain's government said it would pay greater heed to public concerns about austerity but stuck with the broad outlines of its plans to reduce the budget deficit. - The document also outlined plans for infrastructure projects, such as the next phase of the High Speed 2 rail line. - There will be a bill to put into law the changes in National Insurance contributions announced in last year's budget and autumn budget update. What's Not There - May's plan made no mention of a proposal to reintroduce selective schooling and the spokesman said that grammar schools would not be considered in the next two years. - It also did not mention a plan for elderly people pay more for their social care, a proposal that was dubbed the dementia tax by opponents. The government is committed to getting consensus over any changes in social care, the spokesman said. - May's government did not mention plans to clamp down on executive pay and give workers a greater say in their company's strategy. But the government is still committed to those plans, according to the spokesman. - It also did not mention a proposal to roll the Serious Fraud Office into a broader, national crime fighting body.    - There was no mention of a proposal to vote on lifting a ban on hunting foxes with dogs. The spokesman said that fox hunting was not a priority. - There was no mention of a planned state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, which had been expected to happen this year. The spokesman said that this was because a date for the visit had yet to be fixed. Corporate Policy Although the government omitted some high-profile corporate policies from the Queen's Speech, other measures were included. - The government said it would put forward proposals  to ensure that critical national infrastructure is protected to safeguard national security  - That would allow the government to  scrutinize significant foreign investment  and  will give the UK Government powers to intervene in those transactions which raise national security concerns . Energy     - The Conservative Party had pledged to introduce a safeguard tariff cap that would extend price protection for some vulnerable customers to more people on the poorest value tariffs.  - The Queen's Speech says the government remains committed to extending the price protection to more of those on the poorest value tariffs, but does not make reference to a cap.  -  We are considering the best way to do this - whether through action by the regulator or legislation.  However the spokesman said it remained the government's intention for there to be some kind of cap. Cars     - The government said it would allow the regulatory framework to keep pace with changes in technology for electric cars, and provide for the installation of charging points for electric- and hydrogen-powered cars. - It also promised to extend compulsory insurance to cover automated vehicles. - There will also be a civil liability bill to bring down the cost of insurance premiums by reducing the cost and quantity of whiplash claims. Housing - The government pledged to crack down on unfair fees on tenants, capping holding deposits for renters and taking other measures to make the private rental market more affordable.    - The government also pledged to bring forward proposals to  help ensure more homes are built .  Space Britain outlined its plan for  making the UK the most attractive place in Europe  for commercial spaceflights by pledging to: - secure continued growth in the UK space sector to achieve a 10 percent share in the global space economy by 2030 - introduce new powers to license a wide range of commercial spaceflights, which will include space planes, spaceports, satellite operation and vertically launched craft. - develop a new regulatory framework to ensure the safety of commercial spaceflight, a separate framework for operational insurance, and measures to prevent unauthorized access and interference with spacecraft.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.  Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.    Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'     These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.  Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.  Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment's $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury's nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.  Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.  Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.  A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.  Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.  Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.  “The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.   Being Mindful of Tax Planning   Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.  “It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”  Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”  Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.  Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.  New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.  “From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.  Coal Interest Dates to 2011  Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.  Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.  Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.  Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.  Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.  Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.  But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.

Demand for this debt has ratcheted up in recent weeks as investors have re-evaluated the pace of global monetary tightening against the backdrop of stubbornly low inflation and falling oil prices. That was in evidence even before Germany's auction with yields, which normally rise ahead of new sales as investors make room in portfolios for the new supply, grinding lower. After the debt office announced it would sell just 800 million euros of the bonds despite the high demand, yields fell further to touch their lowest level since mid-April. The gap between long- and short-dated bond yields was the lowest it has been this year, a trend called curve flattening which develops when investors start to question the long-term path for monetary policy and interest rates.  As yields are turning downward there is more juice at the longer end and this is drawing interest,  DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz said.  It is a continuation of this bullish flattening mode we have seen in recent days as we see crude prices dropping with low inflation expectations.  A slump in oil prices to multi-month lows has reinforced the weak outlook for inflation that the euro zone central bank cited for its cautious approach at a meeting earlier this month. Weak consumer price growth has also made investors question whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will be able to raise interest rates again this year after a hike last week. A U.S. policymaker said on Tuesday that low yields meant the central bank would have to be careful about raising rates further. The Bank of Japan said it will lag well behind the Fed in dialling back its massive stimulus programme, with inflation far from its 2 percent target. German 30-year bond yields were down 2 basis points at 1.05 percent on Wednesday, having hit a two-month low of 1.035 percent earlier in the session. Ten-year equivalents were flat at 0.27 percent. Two-year yields were up 1.6 bps fraction lower at minus 0.652 percent, which meant the gap to thirty-year equivalents shrank to its lowest level since late December at around 168 bps. The same trend has been particularly noticeable in the United States where its curve is the flattest it has been in a decade .

The emails, obtained under a freedom-of-information request, showed Akzo Nobel employees sending non-public information to government officials, and officials consulting with the company on how to respond to questions from parliament. The Dutch government has no formal role in the takeover process involving private companies, but Economic Affairs Minister Henk Kamp has been outspoken in his opposition to deals including PPG's offer for Akzo and Bpost's bid for PostNL. However, after rejected approaches by would-be foreign buyers towards Unilever and Akzo, the government has begun considering new laws or rules to protect multinationals from unwanted takeovers. PPG walked away from its final offer for Akzo of 26.3 billion euros on May 31, citing opposition from the company's boards and the Dutch government. On March 9, Akzo sent two emails to the ministry hours before Kamp appeared in public to say an Akzo Nobel takeover would not be in the Dutch national interest. Later Kamp introduced draft legislation giving listed companies the right to reject foreign buyers for a year.

Crude inventories fell 2.5 million barrels in the week to June 16, surpassing analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.1 million barrels, as imports rose marginally by 56,000 barrels per day. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell by 1.08 million barrels, EIA said. Crude initially climbed on the report, but quickly retreated. By 11:24 a.m. (1524 GMT), U.S. crude futures were down 10 cents at $43.41 a barrel and Brent crude fell 23 cents to $45.79 a barrel. The price gains in the report's immediate aftermath were hard to sustain because they were not structural changes said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. “U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles are significantly higher compared with their five-year averages, which will weigh on prices,  Kumar said.  Meanwhile, oil output in the country is still rising despite recent declines in oil prices.” U.S. crude production has been steadily growing and last week rose to 9.35 million bpd, up 20,000 bpd from the previous week, the EIA said. Gasoline stocks fell 578,000 barrels, compared with analysts' expectations for a seasonally unusual 443,000-barrel gain, which had been seen as bearish in the market. Stocks of the motor fuel had also risen unexpectedly by 2.1 million barrels in the previous week, despite the start of the summer driving season.  Gasoline demand rebounded smartly to more normal levels for this time year, giving credence to the view that some of the lackluster demand was weather-related,  said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose 1.1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 465,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. Refinery crude runs fell by 104,000 bpd as utilization rates fell 0.4 percentage point to 94 percent of total capacity, EIA data showed.

The storm took the life of a 10-year-old boy who was struck and fatally injured by a log dislodged by a large wave while he stood near shore in the Gulf Coast community of Fort Morgan, Alabama, the Baldwin County Coroner said. The boy, whose name was not immediately disclosed, was vacationing with and his family at the shore. No other casualties have been reported from the storm.  Cindy's wind speed remained at maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (85 km) per hour, down from 60 miles (95 km) per hour on Tuesday, and the storm center was located about 135 miles (215 km) south of Lake Charles, Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center said Wednesday in an afternoon update.  Two tornados were reported about 4 miles (6.4 km) northwest of Biloxi, Mississippi, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and readied emergency vehicles and the Louisiana National Guard. As of noon, he said there were no reports of significant flooding or damage, but there were worries of tornadoes. Alabama also declared a state of emergency, Texas increased its state of preparedness and Florida's governor warned residents in the northwest part of his state to stay alert for flooding and heavy rain. The storm has had limited impact on oil production in the Gulf. About 17 percent of oil production in the Gulf was shut in and 40 platforms, or about 5 percent, were evacuated. Expected rains and wind could disrupt regional refineries that are home to some 2.3 million barrels per day of refining capacity.  Sabine Pilots, which guides ships in and out of the ports of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange, Texas, suspended some operations on Wednesday, a spokesperson said.  The storm, moving northwest at nearly 9 miles (14 km) per hour, was expected to make landfall along the Texas-Louisiana border, near major Exxon Mobil Corp., Motiva Enterprises and Total SA refineries. Outages at refineries could drive up gasoline prices.  The big story here is going to be a large area of rain across the southern portion of the U.S.,  said Matt Rogers, president and co-founder of Commodity Weather Group.  Cindy could drop between 6 and 9 inches (15-23 cm) of rain and bring as much as 15 inches to some parts of southeastern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and cause  life-threatening flash flooding,  the NHC said. The storm could cause a surge of up to 3 feet (0.91 meters) in isolated areas and possibly spawn tornados from southern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations ahead of the storm but expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. Energy companies with operations in the Gulf of Mexico reported little impact on production. Shell suspended some well operations and Anadarko Petroleum, ENI and Enbridge said they had evacuated non-essential personnel. The Gulf of Mexico region is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. New Orleans residents were told to expect about 6 inches of rain from the storm, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in a press conference, about half the amount previously forecast.   There was little impact on air travel. At 4 p.m., New Orleans airport reported eight flights canceled and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson had seven flights canceled, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service.  There were reports of voluntary evacuations from some coastal communities in Texas, including the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County, near where the storm was expected to hit land. The Tennessee Valley Authority said it was lowering some lake levels to add water storage capacity for rains from Cindy. TVA provides electricity to more than 9 million people in parts of seven southeastern states, along with flood control for the Tennessee River system. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. Most meteorologists forecast this year will be more active than normal.

Jeanette Manfra, the department's acting deputy undersecretary of cyber security, would not identify which states had been targeted, citing confidentiality agreements. She reiterated that there was no evidence that any actual votes were manipulated.  As of right now, we have evidence that election-related systems in 21 states were targeted,  Manfra told the Senate Intelligence Committee, which investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Systems were breached in a smaller number of states, she said, but did not give a specific figure. Department officials had said about 20 states had been probed by hackers working on behalf of the Russian government, but recent news media reports had suggested the number could have been far higher. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate panel, expressed frustration at Manfra's refusal to identify which states had been targeted.  I just fundamentally disagree,  he said. Warner on Tuesday sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly asking the agency to disclose more information about hacking attempts on state and local election systems. Arizona and Illinois last year confirmed that hackers had targeted their voter registration systems. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Kremlin orchestrated a wide-ranging influence operation that included email hacking and online propaganda in order to discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump, a Republican, win the White House. Manfra and other officials testifying on Wednesday reiterated that U.S. elections are resilient to hacking in part because they are decentralized and largely operated on the state and local level. Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, expressed skepticism at that assertion, saying only a small amount of votes in key battleground states would need to be altered to tip the scales of an election.  A sophisticated actor could hack an election simply by focusing on certain counties,  King said.  I don't think it works just to say it’s a big system and diversity will protect us.  Russia has repeatedly denied responsibility for any cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election. Trump has inconsistently said Russia may or may not have been responsible for the hacking but has dismissed allegations that his associates colluded with Moscow as  fake news.

Consumers are relying less and less on devices such as cameras, radios and televisions, and services such as taxis and stores, replacing them with programs in their iPhones and other high-end phones, according to Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income. Companies like Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Uber Technologies Inc have enticed consumers with convenience and low prices through their phones. As a result, they have upended traditional retailers, entertainment outlets and transportation services, Rieder said in an article published on Wednesday.  Technological innovation is disrupting traditional business models of many industries, putting a lid on prices and influencing inflation in the economy overall,  he wrote. The core rate of the consumer price index, the U.S. government's broadest inflation gauge, increased 1.7 percent year-on-year in May, the smallest such rise since May 2015, the Labor Department said last week. On Monday, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans, when asked about Amazon's proposed $13.7 billion buyout of up-market grocer Whole Foods Market Inc at an event in New York, said new competitors with a technological edge entering in major industries pose possible long-term implications that inflation will remain low. Some of the recent pullback in inflation also stemmed from lower energy prices resulting from global oversupply, analysts said. This technological shift will likely persist, Rieder said, making it difficult for inflation to meet the Fed's 2 percent target,  which policymakers deem optimal to support stable economic growth.  This is an increasingly challenging paradigm to execute upon today in the more modern commerce era we live in,  Rieder said.  We believe both investors and policymakers need to abandon an overly rigid view of price change.

Sisi is under pressure to balance IMF-austerity reforms to fix Egypt's economy while limiting the financial impact on poorer Egyptians who are key to re-electing him for a second term in next year's presidential election.  The social package, which will benefit more than 90 percent of citizens will, as announced by the president, include an increase in monthly food subsidies,  a finance ministry statement said. Sisi on Tuesday announced a raft of new spending, including more than doubling monthly food subsidies effective starting July 1, a freeze to taxes on agricultural lands, and an increase of 15 percent in civil servant pensions. The lion's share of the social spending allocation will be channeled into monthly food subsidies, which will increase to 50 pounds per person from 21 currently, a hike that will cost the state an additional 38 billion pounds in the coming fiscal year's budget, which begins in July. The social package aims to compensate Egyptians battered by inflation that hit a three-decade high after the central bank floated the pound currency in November as part of a $12 billion International Monetary Fund lending programme. Since the flotation, Egypt has seen its pound's value fall by half and inflation exceed 30 percent. With the goal of putting Egypt's economy back on track after years of turmoil drove foreign investors and tourists away, the three-year IMF programme also includes higher taxes and energy subsidy cuts. The government aims to maintain a previously announced budget deficit target of 9.1 percent despite the introduction of the new social package, the finance ministry said. Most Vulnerable Economists said the social package is in line with the IMF deal which they expected would hit the country's poorest.  We knew the reforms would put pressure on vulnerable groups, and compensating them was always part of the IMF deal,  said Mohamed Abu Basha, EFG Hermes economist. Reham El-Dessouki, an economist at Arqam Capital, said the social package could have a positive effect as it may prevent a decline in economic growth that is dependent on spending power.  It also prevents the undermining of social and political support for the economic reform programme by providing support for low- and middle-income Egyptians in the first year or two of the programme, which are the most difficult,  Dessouki said. Sisi had promised to protect the country's poorest from the outcome of economic reforms necessary to secure the IMF programme, but analysts say his popularity has suffered in recent months as prices soared. This year, Sisi has often praised Egyptians for coping with austerity measures and promised the outlook will improve, constantly touting financial figures in his speeches to show an improving economy.  Our foreign reserves have increased by unprecedented rates,  Sisi said in a speech on Wednesday.  This is only the beginning ... our increasing monetary reserves, exports and local production - all indicators that calm our hearts and assure us that we're on the right path.

In a manifesto document ahead of Britain's June 8 election, Britain's ruling Conservatives - who emerged as the largest party but lost their parliamentary majority - said corporation tax would be cut to 17 percent by 2020.  I expect there will be a need to take action on corporation tax in coming years because in some countries, from the U.S. to Britain, but also on other continents, there are many considerations where we can't simply say we'll ignore them,  Schaeuble told a real estate conference. He said that if Germany continued to pursue a modest fiscal policy in the coming years and remained competitive, the government would probably have wiggle room of around 15 billion euros (dollars) per year. Schaeuble also promised that his and Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives would also act to boost home ownership levels in Germany if re-elected in September. While more than 70 percent of European households own a flat or house on average, only around 45 percent of Germans do, he said, and added while this was related to Germany's history of war and division, Germans should gradually catch up. Turning to the European Central Bank), Schaeuble said that while the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy had helped to tackle the financial crisis in recent years, the longer that policy was applied, the greater the risk of  unwanted side effects . He also warned that investors' risk appetite could  grow excessively  given low capital market yields, while there could be negative effects for the stability of financial markets or delays in carrying out urgently-needed structural reforms due to a lack of disciplinary pressure from the markets.  I'm one of those who would welcome it if we could lay the groundwork for exiting ultraloose monetary policy,  Schaeuble said, adding that the recovery in the euro zone made this more feasible while the danger of deflation has been  indisputably banished . Despite rising housing prices, Schaeuble said he did not think the German real estate market was overheating, saying there was no credit-financed real estate market bubble. He said not all inflated prices on the housing market endangered overall financial market stability and added that would only happen if rising real estate prices, excessive lending and loosening lending standards all came together. But he warned that a slight loosening in bank lending standards for the first time since 2010 could be  an initial warning sign . Schaeuble said the rescue of Spain's Banco Popular, which was wound down by European authorities, showed that the EU's resolution fund, restructuring fund and restructuring authority were working as it happened  without any contagion risks for Spanish and other EU bank and financial institutions .

Oil prices pared brief gains to trade lower, hovering near seven-month lows, putting pressure on the market. The commodity has fallen 20 percent this year as a global glut continues to weigh despite efforts by major producers to reduce output. Oil prices are on track for their biggest slide in the first half of any year since 1997. The downturn has hemorrhaged the S&P; energy index, making it the worst performing sector among the 11 major indexes this year. The index fell more than 13 percent during the period, while the S&P; 500 rallied 8.85 percent.  I think there is a bifurcation between short and long term. Clearly, to this point the Goldilocks scenario and earnings have pushed stock prices higher but oil has perhaps tempered some sentiment near-term,  said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  If oil falls below $40, one would see pressure on overall earnings, not just the energy sector.  Investors are also mindful of the impact of inflation on the pace of future interest rate hikes, with a tug-of-war between inflation and the future of financial stability playing out among the Federal Reserve's policymakers. Dallas and Chicago Fed chiefs Robert Kaplan and Charles Evans expressed concerns regarding weak inflation, which remains stubbornly below the central bank's 2 percent target. However, Boston Fed head Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States poses financial stability risks. At 10:58 a.m. ET (1458 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.93 points, or 0.06 percent, at 21,454.21, the S&P; 500 was up 2.24 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,439.27. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 36.79 points, or 0.59 percent, at 6,224.82. Biotechs were the biggest gainers on the index with Celgene, Regeneron and Amgen trading up between 2 percent and 5 percent. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.97 percent fall leading the decliners. The financial sector fell 0.8 percent as U.S. Treasury yield curve held near 10-year lows. Goldman Sachs was off 0.4 percent and Bank of America fell 1 percent, weighing on the Dow and the S&P.; Caterpillar's 1.9 percent fall and General Electric's 1.1 percent fall dragged on industrials. Adobe Systems was up 3.4 percent at $145.71 after the software forecast current-quarter above analysts' estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,479 to 1,221.

But they took on more resonance this year after a spate of Islamic State attacks on Copts meant to stoke sectarian divisions.

Brazil's President Michel Temer will meet Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg in Oslo on Friday to discuss cooperation including Norway's program to help Brazil's efforts to restrict logging and the clearance of forests by farmers. Wealthy from producing oil and gas, Norway is the biggest foreign donor to protect tropical forests from Brazil to Indonesia, partly because they are big natural stores of greenhouse gases and help to slow climate change. The Amazon is suffering a  worrying upward trend  in deforestation since 2015 after  impressive achievements  over the previous decade, Norway's Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen wrote to his Brazilian counterpart Jose Sarney Filho this month. Norway's annual contributions to an Amazon Fund, to which it has paid $1.1 billion since 2008 based on Brazil's progress in slowing deforestation, were now set to fall, he wrote in the letter seen by Reuters. FILE PHOTO: An aerial view of a tract of Amazon jungle cleared by loggers and farmers near the city of Novo Progresso, Brazil September 22, 2013.Nacho Doce/File Photo Even a fairly modest further increase (in deforestation) would take this number to zero,  he added. Filho wrote back on June 19 saying that data  indicate that we may have stopped the rising curve of deforestation recorded from August 2014 through July 2016. We hope that the new data will soon reveal a downward trend.  He said that Brazil has an  unwavering commitment to sustainability, to curbing deforestation and to the full implementation of its targets to reduce emissions under the Paris Agreement  to combat global warming. Brazil's deforestation climbed to 8,000 square kilometres (3,088 square miles) in 2016 - about the size of Greece's Mediterranean island of Crete - from 6,200 in 2015. Losses were far below 19,000 sq km in 2005, Brazilian satellite data show. Under current benchmarks, a rise in annual Amazon deforestation rates to 8,500 square km or above will mean no annual payments from Norway, Norwegian officials say.  Norway promised at the 2015 Paris summit to extend its partnership with Brazil until 2020, assuming success in slowing deforestation. It also has projects in forest nations including Brazil, Indonesia, Guyana and Tanzania. Editing by Pritha Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-brazil-amazon-idUSKBN19C23R"},

The deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels ended more than 50 years of war and was hailed by the United Nations as having an unprecedented focus on women's rights, recognizing they suffered the conflict in different ways. Talks included female peace negotiators from both sides and a gender commission to ensure women's voice were heard. But such progress could be undermined as there is little women's participation in the peace building process, according to research this month by GPaz, a Colombian rights group. So far 11 committees have been created to monitor and ensure that what was pledged in the accord is put into practice. But women make up just six of the 45 people appointed - or 13.3 percent - on the peace monitoring committees.  The accord states the need for the effective and balanced participation of women,  said Beatriz Quintero, head of the National Women's Network, composed of rights groups across Colombia.  We're saying the committees don't have to have absolute gender parity, be precisely 50-50, but 13 percent women's participation is very low,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  We're calling on both sides to ensure that during the accord's implementation the gender focus isn't lost,  she said.  The government last week said more women would be appointed to peace monitoring committees by the end of June.  We reaffirm the importance of further strengthening scenarios for the participation of women in the country and a real commitment to mainstreaming the gender approach in the implementation of the final accord,  the office of the government's high peace commission said in a statement. The U.N. Women agency says having women at the negotiating table increases the chance of a peace agreement lasting 15 years by 35 percent, while ensuring they play a key role in constructing peace also raises the chances that it will last. Colombia's peace accord pledges to improve access to land for women farmers through a land bank and subsidies. It also promises to investigate military forces or rebel fighters who raped women. About 20,000 Colombians, most of them women and girls, have been victims of rape and sexual violence, a weapon used by all sides in Colombia's war, government data shows. As part of the peace deal, the FARC is expected to hand over the last batch of its weapons to the U.N. on June 27. Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Astrid Zweynert.

Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef was appointed on Wednesday to replace Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was stripped of his positions and removed as second in line to the throne of the world's biggest oil exporter. King Salman made his son Mohammed bin Salman, 31, his heir and crown prince. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, who was wounded in an al Qaeda assassination attempt in 2009, put down an al Qaeda bombing campaign and kept close ties to the U.S. intelligence community where he had a reputation as safe and reliable. A son of the late Crown Prince Nayef who had served as interior minister since 1975 until his death from a heart attack in 2012, Prince Mohammed had been closely identified with the formidable and effective security structure built by his father. His replacement by his nephew sidelines Prince Mohammed but keeps the security file in the hands of the Nayef branch of the Al Saud family, which is likely to reassure other royals as power is increasingly consolidated by King Salman and his son. Mohammed bin Nayef had strong personal support from the security forces and intelligence apparatus, said Jane Kinninmont, a Middle East expert at Chatham House.  The interior ministry thus stays with the descendants of Prince Nayef, but with less experience at the helm,  she wrote on Twitter. Prince Abdulaziz studied in Riyadh before entering private business, but after King Salman ascended to the throne in 2015 he was appointed adviser to the Royal Court for matters including border control, according to Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television. He recently became adviser to the defense minister. Generation of Young Leaders The new interior minister, who attended Dhahran Ahliyyah School and King Saud University, is part of a new batch of young leaders who have rocketed to the kingdom's upper ranks since King Salman took over.  Younger Saudis regard their ascent as evidence their generation is taking a central place in modernizing and reforming a country whose patriarchal traditions have for decades made power the province of the older generations.  The interior ministry portfolio will play a key role in implementing the reforms as well as fighting militancy and dealing with dissent at home. FILE PHOTO - Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef of Saudi Arabia confers with a member of his delegation during a high-level meeting on addressing large movements of refugees and migrants at the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 19, 2016.Lucas Jackson/File PhotoSaudi Arabia follows the ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Sunni Islam, but sees Islamist militants as posing the biggest threat to its own stability. Islamic State denounces the Al Saud family as ungodly rulers for their alliance with the United States and has staged attacks in the country. Senior Wahhabi clerics, whose influence in Saudi society forms part of a covenant with the royal family dating back 250 years, endorse execution by beheading for offences that include apostasy, adultery and sorcery, oppose women driving or working and describe Shi'ites as heretics. The clerics sharply differ, however, from al Qaeda and Sunni militants of Islamic State in opposing violent revolt against the government. Saudi Arabia crushed a campaign of al Qaeda attacks in 2003-06 but has been hit by Islamic State bombings in the past two years. Saudi security police closely monitor Saudis with suspected connections to militants and have detained more than 15,000 suspects in the years since al Qaeda's campaign.     Taking the Security Reins The new interior minister has little experience compared to his uncle in fighting militancy as he takes the reins of an extensive policing and intelligence apparatus which critics say has been used to stamp out dissent both from Islamists and more secular activists. Michael Hanna, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank The Century Foundation, wrote on Twitter that Mohammed bin Nayef's removal also represented  the loss of a long-standing, trusted U.S. (counter-terrorism) partner . The other main internal security concern in Saudi Arabia is in Qatif, home to about one million mostly Shi'ite Muslims in the oil-producing Eastern Province. Since 2011 frequent protests have shaken the area. While mostly peaceful, Shi'ites angry at what they say is repression of their community have sometimes attacked security forces. Diplomats and analysts will be keen to establish where the new, young interior minister stands on the big issue facing Saudi Arabia: reconciling social change and a young population with conservative tradition and an oil-dependent economy. They will also be anxious to see to what extent he sticks with or changes the policies of his uncle in a kingdom where ultimate power lies with the king. U.S. embassy cables released by WikiLeaks showed Mohammed bin Nayef relatively hawkish on Iran, asking U.S. officials on how best to protect key infrastructure  when at war with Iran . During his five years in charge of the interior ministry, the government's tolerance for dissent has shown no sign of loosening as a steady stream of activists have been detained and imprisoned on charges that include talking to foreign media.

Mohammed bin Salman, 31, was appointed crown prince by his father King Salman on Wednesday, replacing his cousin who is 26 years his senior. This made the prince, who already oversaw defense and energy policy, the most powerful figure in the country by some stretch after the octogenarian monarch. The decision represents a social and cultural sea change, with the ruling baton set to be passed to a much younger generation in a country where patriarchal traditions have long made power the province of the old.  If Mohammed bin Salman becomes king in his 30s, he would be the youngest monarch of the modern state. The royal decree was a vote of confidence in a man widely lauded by younger Saudis but regarded warily by many older conservatives. He has embraced the media in a distinct departure from the normally secretive Saudi ruling class, with his bearded features rarely off TV screens or street billboards.  His elevation signaled an affirmation of his policies as the blueprint for the future of the Saudi economy, as well as of his more hawkish and interventionist foreign policy. On the economic front, he has announced sweeping changes labeled Vision 2030 aimed at ending the kingdom's reliance on oil. As well as diversifying the economy, the plans include pushing for women to have a bigger economic role and the partial privatization of state oil firm Saudi Aramco - reforms that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. The prince's foreign policy is meanwhile reshaping the kingdom's role on the regional and global stage. He is regarded by diplomats and analysts as a prime mover behind the decision to go to war in Yemen and, more recently, to lead Gulf Arab states in severing links with neighboring Qatar. Confrontational, Aggressive Both decisions were indicative of a far more confrontational Saudi foreign policy, a break from the consensual style of Gulf Arab policymaking favored by previous generations of dynastic rulers, as the Sunni Muslim kingdom moved to act aggressively to counter the influence of Shi'ite power Iran. Yemen represents a proxy war between the two regional powerhouses, with Riyadh supporting the ousted government against Iranian-backed Houthi forces. Qatar has been accused by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies of supporting terrorism and cozying up to Iran, all of which Qatar denies.  The marked policy shift follows what some hawkish Saudi officials regard as a decade of growing Iranian influence across the Middle East, amid concerns that Washington, under former President Barack Obama, turned a blind eye to what Riyadh sees as a pernicious expansion of Iranian activity in Arab nations.  The rise of MbS (Mohammed bin Salman) will likely mean even more hawkish foreign policy moves from Saudi Arabia and more intensified efforts to confront Iran,  said Helima Croft, Global Head of Commodity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets.   Under MbS's watch the kingdom has launched a costly war in Yemen and spearheaded a surprise blockade of fellow GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) member Qatar. The key question is what comes next in this quest to counter Iranian influence? Is the Qatar blockade simply the opening act?   FILE PHOTO: Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman during a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, May 30, 2017.Pavel Golovkin/Pool/File PhotoRapid Rise to Power Prince Mohammed has had a rapid ascent to power: little more than two years ago he was almost unknown in the kingdom, but he quickly came to be regarded as the power behind its throne.  He was propelled into the domestic and international limelight when his father Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud became Saudi Arabia's seventh king in 2015 and he was named deputy crown prince - behind his cousin whom he has now replaced - and defense minister. He heads the Council for Economic and Development Affairs which oversees all elements of policy that touch on the economy or social issues like education, health and housing. He also chairs the supreme board of Aramco, making him the first member of the ruling family to directly oversee the state oil company, long regarded as the preserve of commoner technocrats.  Now, with his elevation to crown prince, he has the kind of wide-ranging power and influence previously unseen in a figure outside the king. For many Saudis, the kingdom's new economic and foreign policy directions have become inextricably associated with the prince who has built a strong public profile with media interviews, mainly about his economic ambitions. Outside Saudi Arabia, that rapid advance and the sudden changes to long-standing policies on regional affairs, energy and its economy have prompted unease, adding an unpredictable edge to a kingdom that allies long regarded as a known quantity.  Inside the country, opinions are divided.  Among many older Saudis, there has been considerable scepticism. They have seen previous economic reform plans come and go with only limited results, and are wary of rapid changes in one of the world's most conservative societies.  Some fear that Prince Mohammed's changes will simply serve to cause social ruptures or that however clever his policy changes, deep seated problems in Saudi bureaucracy will prevent any meaningful implementation.  But his Vision 2030 has prompted admiration among many younger Saudis who regard his ascent as evidence that for the first time their generation is taking a central place in running a country.  Prince Mohammed's establishment of a think-tank, the Misk Foundation, which focused on education, youth, arts and social media issues, appeared to showcase that preoccupation with compatriots of his generation.       MbS is very popular among Saudi youth and has a window of opportunity to try and reshape the Kingdom through Vision 2030,  said Kristian Ulrichsen, a Gulf expert at the U.S. Baker Institute.   If he succeeds, he could be on the throne for decades.

This action follows the placement of CBI's 40% shareholder, Qatar National Bank (QNB) on RWN (see 'Fitch Places Nine Qatari Banks on Rating Watch Negative' dated 21 June 2017 at www.fitchratings.com) to reflect the significant uncertainty for the Qatari banking system resulting from the decision of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and some other Arab countries to sever diplomatic and logistical ties with Qatar. While some discussions have taken place to resolve the crisis, it is becoming more likely that the crisis will be sustained and will negatively impact Qatar's economy. Ultimately, the Qatari sovereign ability to support QNB could weaken and its IDR, which is driven by potential sovereign support, could be downgraded. This in turn could impact QNB's ability to provide support to CBI. CBI's Viability Rating (VR) of 'b+' is unaffected. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs AND SUPPORT RATING CBI's IDRs and SR are driven by institutional support from QNB (AA-/RWN/F1). Fitch views CBI as a key affiliate of QNB and CBI is QNB's only presence in the UAE, which is considered an important market for the Qatari Group. The ratings also reflect our belief that any required support would be easily manageable for QNB given the small size of CBI in relation to QNB. However, our view of potential support is somewhat constrained by QNB's minority 40% stake in CBI, which is the maximum allowed under UAE law for foreign ownership. QNB's IDRs are based on potential support available from the Qatari authorities, if necessary. In Fitch's view, this support would flow through QNB to CBI given the role it plays for QNB. A downgrade of QNB's IDRs would trigger a downgrade of CBI's IDR. When assessing CBI's IDRs, Fitch takes the viewthat the Qatari authorities will not place a moratorium on support towards banking subsidiaries in countries in dispute in retaliation. VR CBI's VR primarily reflects the bank's limited franchise, less diversified business model than peers, weak but improving asset quality metrics and weak capital ratios in light of the bank's high loan growth strategy. The VR also takes into account the clean-up of CBI's balance sheet through the write-off of legacy impaired loans, tightened underwriting standards, albeit with a still limited track record, and the intrinsic ordinary support, including liquidity support, the bank enjoys from QNB. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SUPPORT RATING CBI's IDRs and SR are sensitive to a change in QNB's IDRs or a change in Fitch's view of CBI's strategic importance to its parent. In turn, QNB's IDRs are sensitive to a change in the Qatari authorities' ability or propensity to provide support if needed. In the very unlikely event that the Qatari authorities place a moratorium on support towards banking subsidiaries in countries in dispute in retaliation, extraordinary support from QNB would be discounted; CBI's IDR would then be driven by its VR and could be downgraded. VR Further evidence of CBI implementing its strategy, building its franchise and growing its balance sheet with no material deterioration in the bank's risk indicators could contribute to an upgrade. Upside for the VR could also arise from improvements in the underlying asset quality and capital ratios. In the very unlikely event that the Qatari authorities place a moratorium on support towards banking subsidiaries in countries in dispute in retaliation, ordinary support from QNB would be discounted and CBI's VR could be downgraded.

Nike, whose products are already sold on Amazon through third-party and unlicensed dealers, could build an additional $300 million to $500 million of revenue in the United States or 1 percent of its global sales through its expansion as a wholesale dealer on Amazon, Goldman Sachs said in a client note.  Through the partnership, Nike could weed out excess, discounted inventory available at the marketplace through third-party retailers and sell more full-price products through the online channel, according to the note.  Nike shares were the top percentage gainer among Dow-listed stocks. The stock has been the worst performer among Dow stocks over the past three months.  The news comes as Nike said it would cut 2 percent of its global workforce and eliminate a quarter of its shoe styles to become nimbler in the face of intensifying competition and fast-changing consumer trends.     Nike vs. Sporting Goods retailers this year    Taking this step would give Nike direct economic exposure to a large and fast growing distribution channel, while improving the brand presentation and expanding access to millennial shoppers,  Goldman analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann said.  A potential partnership would lead to more competition for sporting goods retailers such as Dick's Sporting Goods Inc (DKS.N) that are seeing some market share gains due to the bankruptcies of The Sports Authority and other smaller, regional chains.  Shares of Dick's Sporting fell as much as 8 percent in early trading to hit a near one-and-a-half-year low, while Hibbett Sports Inc (HIBB.O) fell as much as 6 percent to hit a more than seven-year low.  Other chains such as Finish Line Inc (FINL.O) hit a near 7 year low, while Foot Locker Inc (FL.N) hit a more than three year low.   We expect pressures on bricks and mortar retail for the foreseeable future to result in pockets of inventory excess,  Drucker Mann said. However, it would help Nike to make its brand more visible by working with Amazon to control inventory from unlicensed dealers, she added.

A preliminary investigation found evidence of a possible cover-up of the case, which occurred during the tenure of then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, in the 1980s and 1990s, the government said. The task force that carried out that investigation was set up to find out how much the central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia, lost during a foray into currency trading more than 20 years ago, the office of Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a statement. The task force  found that the extent of losses is larger than what was reported to Cabinet and Parliament,  the statement said. The investigation came just months after Mahathir formed a new political party aimed at toppling Najib, his former protégé, who has been linked to a multi-billion-dollar financial scandal tied to state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). The 1MDB scandal is at the centre of a clutch of civil suits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, which is seeking to seize assets believed to have been bought using money stolen from the state fund. Najib has denied any wrongdoing and has been cleared of any wrongdoing by Malaysia's attorney-general.

The world's fifth-largest economy has attracted more foreign investment than any other country in Europe but May has said her government should have the power to scrutinize significant foreign investment and intervene when it concerns critical assets such as nuclear power.  The proposal was included in the government's two-year policy plan set out on Wednesday, one of the few planned changes to British business that was mentioned in the 82-page document known as the Queen's Speech.   This will ensure that foreign ownership of companies controlling important infrastructure does not undermine British security or essential services, it said.  It is important that we protect national security, while remaining an open and liberal international trading partner and a global champion of free trade and investment.  May, who became prime minister after Britain voted to leave the EU last June, faced one of her first major challenges when she gave the go-ahead for a $24 billion plan for a Chinese-backed nuclear power plant in southwest England. She ultimately approved the deal but said her government would take a more cautious approach over similar foreign investments in the future. Before a botched gamble on a snap election cost her party its majority in parliament, May had set out a raft of proposals for corporate Britain, including curbing soaring levels of executive pay and giving workers a greater say on strategy.  A spokesman for the prime minister said the government remained committed to improving corporate governance, after the proposal was not listed in the policy document.  The government could try to introduce changes to corporate pay by seeking to get companies to support their plans without bringing in primary legislation, or by changing the rules within existing legal frameworks without the need to pass fresh laws though parliament.  The government is expected to publish its plans for corporate governance in a green paper in the coming months.  We were expecting a stripped-back Queen's Speech and that's what we got, but business leaders will actually be pleased to see the tighter focus on the most immediate challenges,  said Stephen Martin, Director General of the Institute of Directors.  The scale of the task ahead is significant and business confidence, in light of our present political limbo, is low.

A day after the launch of the 737 MAX 10 at the world's biggest air show in Paris, United said it would convert an order for 100 other 737 MAX planes to the new model. Gerry Laderman, United senior vice president, said the MAX 10 had  the best economics of the family , a boost for a plane Boeing designed to plug a gap in its range at the top end of the market for single-aisle jets, following runaway sales of the rival Airbus A321neo. The United deal brought the number of MAX 10s covered by air show order announcements to a higher than expected total of more than 320, though more than half were conversions and underlying new orders and commitments for Boeing stood closer to 160. Despite the interest in the MAX 10, analysts expect passenger jet orders at the Paris Airshow to fall short of recent boom years, as airlines digest a flood of deliveries. But over the longer term, Boeing sees an industry in rude health, forecasting 41,030 passenger and freight plane deliveries worth more than $6 trillion over the next two decades, up from 39,620 in a similar projection a year ago. Boeing's projection includes a 5 percent increase in the 20-year forecast for deliveries of single-aisle aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, the cash cows of the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers. In a sign of that interest, aircraft leasing company Avolon announced a provisional deal to buy 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s worth $8.4 billion at list prices and said it would have a  hard look  at possible orders for the MAX 10.

The European planemaker has seen arch-rival Boeing grab most of the headlines so far, but could turn to one of its top buyers as a potential wild card for the show, industry sources said. AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes remained in Paris on Tuesday after signing a data deal with Airbus and picking up an airline award, and could use the opportunity to evaluate jets at attractive prices as new orders wane. Asked by Reuters whether he would return to the show on Wednesday, a move that would typically signal he is in the market to buy, Fernandes said,  We'll see . A Boeing 737 Max takes part in a flying display.Pascal RossignolAirbus declined to comment. Aviation Services Boeing's head of airplane developments meanwhile said he was  very optimistic  about the chances of establishing the business case for a mid-market jet project to open up new routes from the middle of the next decade. Air travel has been on a sharp uptrend, led by emerging economies as China looks set to replace North America as the world's biggest transport market in the coming years. Slideshow (10 Images)But China's economic expansion is slowing even as it remains above 6 percent a year. Boeing trimmed its 20-year forecast for average global traffic growth to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent. With demand for new jets cooling, planemakers are seeing greater opportunities in aviation services.  Boeing forecast that market could be worth $8.5 trillion over 20 years, growing at an average 4 percent a year. Airbus launched a digital services platform on Tuesday, which it said could crunch data to help airlines improve maintenance, reduce fuel burn and optimize routes. Bigger Not Better?  In a symbolic change likely to rankle with its European rival, Boeing ditched its forecast for very large four-engined airplanes such as the Airbus A380 and its own 747-8. For the first time, it lumped these models with large two-engined jets such as the Boeing 777 and the largest Airbus A350. Boeing has long argued that the  very large  category is on its way out as airlines switch to smaller twinjets. Both manufacturers have had to cut production of four-engined jumbos.

Four men are charged with the killings of the 71 men, women and children at the height of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015. They and seven others are also charged with the smuggling of hundreds of people across Europe. The one Afghan and three Bulgarians facing murder charges were led into the Hungarian courtroom in handcuffs by armed police wearing face masks on the opening day of their trial. The bearded Afghan man, named as Lahoo Samsooryamal and described as leader of the smuggling gang, smiled at the media as he entered. He carried a folder in his hands bearing the words  Allahu Akbar  (God is Great). The bodies of the 59 men, eight women and four children, from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, were found inside the abandoned truck on August 26, 2015.  The 71 victims, due to the small space, inability to move, a lack of air and overheating ... died shortly after they set off on the journey,  the Kecskemet court said in a statement posted on its website before the hearing.      Before their deaths they continuously banged on the sides of the lorry and shouted.   The deaths shocked Europe as it struggled to cope with the massive influx of migrants. It was the worst incident of its kind on the route across the Balkans taken by hundreds of thousands fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Prosecutor Gabor Schmidt spoke for five hours in court on Wednesday, listing 26 counts of people-smuggling, with the journey in which the 71 died as one of the last cases.  He said that as the migrant crisis peaked in 2015, the defendants stepped up their operation to maximize profits, taking up to 100 people a day from Hungary to Austria or Germany, mostly along the M1 motorway connecting Budapest with Vienna. Before the August incident, the defendants had carried many migrants in similar conditions, causing  significant physical and mental suffering , the prosecutor said. Cries Ceased Schmidt said the Afghan defendant had promised to pay 3,500 euros to one of the Bulgarian defendants to drive the Volvo freezer truck from the Serbian-Hungarian border to Germany.

The three others in the smuggling gang followed the truck in cars, and were in phone contact during the journey. The migrants started banging on the sides of the vehicle and shouting 30-40 minutes after departure.  Schmidt said the driver of the truck repeatedly told his Afghan boss about the cries for help, but was told not to stop to open the doors. He obeyed.  The defendants were aware that the people inside the Volvo were shouting and banging ... because they could not breathe,  the prosecutor told the court.

The prosecutor said the Afghan had told one of the other defendants by phone that  he wanted the victims to die  and that if they did, the bodies should be dumped later.  The gang stopped twice to check the engine's coolant water and refuel, but did not open the doors. At one stop, no more shouting could be heard. The convoy drove across to Austria and abandoned the vehicle near Parndorf.  They were aware that the victims locked up inside the lorry would suffocate unless let out,  the prosecutor said.  All victims ... died within three hours, at the latest, after the start of the journey.  The four defendants are also charged with smuggling other migrants over several months. Seven other men are charged only with smuggling. Only six of the seven, who are all Bulgarians, appeared in court in the Hungarian city of Kecskemet. Authorities said one was still on the run.

OPEC and allied outside producers agreed on May 25 to extend an existing supply cut into 2018, but oil has declined sharply since on rising production from the United States and Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempt from cutting output.   We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,  Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said after a cabinet meeting, according to the website for the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).   But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members.  The reason for the discussion is an increase in the levels of United States production which members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had not predicted, Zanganeh said.   The comment is the first hint from an OPEC minister of possible further action, although OPEC delegates downplayed the idea of a new cut, citing the difficulty of getting the exempt producers to cap output. Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the current supply cut because of production losses caused by unrest, and Iran was given a small increase so it could recover market share lost while under Western sanctions.  I don't think so unless Iran would accept being included in the cut,  said one source close to OPEC, asked if the idea of a new reduction was likely to move forward. Three other OPEC delegates in comments to Reuters dismissed the idea of a new cut. To be sure, sources told Reuters this month that OPEC discussed cutting output further when it met on May 25 and could revisit the proposal should inventories remain high and continue to weigh on prices. For now though, key oil ministers including Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih are of the view that the market is heading in the right direction. Russia said on June 11 there was no need to review the agreement.

Mohammed bin Salman, 31, was appointed crown prince by his father King Salman on Wednesday, replacing his cousin who is 26 years his senior. This made the prince, who already oversaw defense and energy policy, the most powerful figure in the country by some stretch after the octogenarian monarch. The decision represents a social and cultural sea change, with the ruling baton set to be passed to a much younger generation in a country where patriarchal traditions have long made power the province of the old.  If Mohammed bin Salman becomes king in his 30s, he would be the youngest monarch of the modern state. The royal decree was a vote of confidence in a man widely lauded by younger Saudis but regarded warily by many older conservatives. He has embraced the media in a distinct departure from the normally secretive Saudi ruling class, with his bearded features rarely off TV screens or street billboards.  His elevation signaled an affirmation of his policies as the blueprint for the future of the Saudi economy, as well as of his more hawkish and interventionist foreign policy. On the economic front, he has announced sweeping changes labeled Vision 2030 aimed at ending the kingdom's reliance on oil. As well as diversifying the economy, the plans include pushing for women to have a bigger economic role and the partial privatization of state oil firm Saudi Aramco - reforms that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. The prince's foreign policy is meanwhile reshaping the kingdom's role on the regional and global stage. He is regarded by diplomats and analysts as a prime mover behind the decision to go to war in Yemen and, more recently, to lead Gulf Arab states in severing links with neighboring Qatar. Confrontational, Aggressive Both decisions were indicative of a far more confrontational Saudi foreign policy, a break from the consensual style of Gulf Arab policymaking favored by previous generations of dynastic rulers, as the Sunni Muslim kingdom moved to act aggressively to counter the influence of Shi'ite power Iran. Yemen represents a proxy war between the two regional powerhouses, with Riyadh supporting the ousted government against Iranian-backed Houthi forces. Qatar has been accused by Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies of supporting terrorism and cozying up to Iran, all of which Qatar denies.  The marked policy shift follows what some hawkish Saudi officials regard as a decade of growing Iranian influence across the Middle East, amid concerns that Washington, under former President Barack Obama, turned a blind eye to what Riyadh sees as a pernicious expansion of Iranian activity in Arab nations.  The rise of MbS (Mohammed bin Salman) will likely mean even more hawkish foreign policy moves from Saudi Arabia and more intensified efforts to confront Iran,  said Helima Croft, Global Head of Commodity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets.   Under MbS's watch the kingdom has launched a costly war in Yemen and spearheaded a surprise blockade of fellow GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) member Qatar. The key question is what comes next in this quest to counter Iranian influence? Is the Qatar blockade simply the opening act?   FILE PHOTO: Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman during a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, May 30, 2017.Pavel Golovkin/Pool/File PhotoRapid Rise to Power Prince Mohammed has had a rapid ascent to power: little more than two years ago he was almost unknown in the kingdom, but he quickly came to be regarded as the power behind its throne.  He was propelled into the domestic and international limelight when his father Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud became Saudi Arabia's seventh king in 2015 and he was named deputy crown prince - behind his cousin whom he has now replaced - and defense minister. He heads the Council for Economic and Development Affairs which oversees all elements of policy that touch on the economy or social issues like education, health and housing. He also chairs the supreme board of Aramco, making him the first member of the ruling family to directly oversee the state oil company, long regarded as the preserve of commoner technocrats.  Now, with his elevation to crown prince, he has the kind of wide-ranging power and influence previously unseen in a figure outside the king. For many Saudis, the kingdom's new economic and foreign policy directions have become inextricably associated with the prince who has built a strong public profile with media interviews, mainly about his economic ambitions. Outside Saudi Arabia, that rapid advance and the sudden changes to long-standing policies on regional affairs, energy and its economy have prompted unease, adding an unpredictable edge to a kingdom that allies long regarded as a known quantity.  Inside the country, opinions are divided.  Among many older Saudis, there has been considerable scepticism. They have seen previous economic reform plans come and go with only limited results, and are wary of rapid changes in one of the world's most conservative societies.  Some fear that Prince Mohammed's changes will simply serve to cause social ruptures or that however clever his policy changes, deep seated problems in Saudi bureaucracy will prevent any meaningful implementation.  But his Vision 2030 has prompted admiration among many younger Saudis who regard his ascent as evidence that for the first time their generation is taking a central place in running a country.  Prince Mohammed's establishment of a think-tank, the Misk Foundation, which focused on education, youth, arts and social media issues, appeared to showcase that preoccupation with compatriots of his generation.       MbS is very popular among Saudi youth and has a window of opportunity to try and reshape the Kingdom through Vision 2030,  said Kristian Ulrichsen, a Gulf expert at the U.S. Baker Institute.   If he succeeds, he could be on the throne for decades.

Last year nearly 40 percent of U.S. wind contracts were signed by corporate power users, along with university and military customers. That's up from just 5 percent in 2013, according to the American Wind Energy Association trade group. These users also accounted for an unprecedented 10% of the market for large-scale solar projects in 2016, figures from research firm GTM Research show. Just two years earlier there were none.  The big reason: lower energy bills. Costs for solar and wind are plunging thanks to technological advances and increased global production of panels and turbines. Coupled with tax breaks and other incentives, big energy users such as GM are finding renewables to be competitive with, and often cheaper than, conventional sources of electricity. The automaker has struck deals with two Texas wind farms that will soon provide enough energy to power over a dozen GM facilities, including the U.S. sport utility vehicle assembly plant in Arlington, Texas that produces the Chevrolet Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon.  The company is already saving $5 million a year worldwide, according to Rob Threlkeld, GM's global manager of renewable energy, and has committed to obtaining 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050.   It's been primarily all driven off economics,  Threlkeld said.  Wind and solar costs are coming down so fast that it made it feasible.  (For a graphic showing the corporate green-energy rush, see: tmsnrt.rs/2spS81j ) Growing corporate demand for green energy comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is championing fossil fuels and targeting environmental regulations as job killers. This month he announced the United States will withdraw from the landmark Paris Agreement to fight climate change, a move that was condemned by several prominent U.S. executives, including General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt. Trump’s administration, however, has made no moves to target federal tax incentives for renewable energy projects, thanks mainly to bipartisan support in Congress. Many Republican lawmakers hail from states that are major solar or wind energy producers, among them Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa. U.S. companies, meanwhile, are pursuing their own clean-energy agendas independent of Washington politics. Over the past four years, corporations have contracted for about 7 gigawatts of renewable energy – enough to power more than 1 million homes. That number is expected to rise to 60 GW by 2025, according to the Edison Foundation Institute for Electric Innovation, a utility-backed non-profit based in Washington D.C. Growth in renewables for years was driven by utilities laboring to meet tough state mandates to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in places such as California. Early corporate adopters included Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), leading-edge companies with progressive company cultures, deep pockets and major power needs. Now mainstream industries are stepping in as costs have plummeted. Wind-power costs have dropped 66% since 2009, according to the American Wind Energy Association, while the cost to install solar has declined 70% since 2010, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group.  This year alone, home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N), wireless provider T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O), banker Goldman Sachs and food producer General Mills (GIS.N) announced major purchases of renewable energy. Power to the Ppa Such deals can take many forms, but most are so-called power purchase agreements. Known as PPAs, these are roughly 10-to-20-year contracts in which the owner of a large solar or wind project sells electricity to large customers, often at rates lower than those charged by utilities. These agreements allow energy users to buy renewables at attractive prices with no upfront investment. FILE PHOTO: A man views solar panels on a roof at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., on June 18, 2007.Kimberly White/File Photo These agreements also help companies avoid outages if the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. The massive wind farms and solar plants that support these contracts often supply electricity straight to the grid rather than feed it directly to corporate customers' plants and offices. Companies get the benefit of clean energy without cutting themselves off from the security of the grid. The arrangement also saves companies from having to do it all themselves. Mark Vanderhelm, vice president of energy for Wal-Mart, said the retailer is about half way to its goal of sourcing 50% of its power from renewable sources by 2025. While the chain has installed solar panels atop hundreds of stores, it has purchased much of its green energy via two PPAs.  For us to meet our goals, we wouldn't be able to get there by doing it all on site. We just fundamentally don't have enough roof space,  Vanderhelm said. He said Wal-Mart is seeing roughly single-digit percentage savings with its green-power contracts. Furniture retailer IKEA is a notable exception to the PPA trend, preferring to own the renewable-energy assets that serve its U.S. business, including rooftop solar systems on most of its buildings and two wind farms in Texas and Illinois. The approach is part of the Swedish company's long-term corporate strategy of owning all of its stores, factories and the land on which they're built. A rooftop panel system is shown on the roof of a new IKEA store in Burbank, California, U.S., June 19, 2017.  Photo taken June 19, 2017.Nichola GroomDemand from big corporations has benefited a host of wind and solar developers including Pattern Energy (PEGI.O), First Solar (FSLR.O) and NextEra Energy (NEE.N). BNB Renewable Energy Holdings LLC, a privately held New York-based developer, said corporations now make up about half its business.   There is a convergence right now where price is low and their sustainability commitments are high,  said Jos Nicholas, a managing partner with BNB. The developers or owners of the projects, meanwhile, get the stability of long-term contracts plus those federal tax breaks. The solar credit is worth up to 30 percent of a project's value. For wind, the most popular tax credit is a maximum of 2.4 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced for a decade.  Ambitious Goals Since 2014, nearly 100 large global companies have committed to transitioning to 100% renewables through a partnership with The Climate Group, a nonprofit that's working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Roughly two corporations a month are joining that effort, according to Amy Davidsen, the organization's executive director for North America. In addition to GM, U.S. companies that have made the commitment include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Nike Inc (NKE.N). Still, many big firms remain on the sidelines because they lack an overall corporate sustainability mandate, view renewables as having unattractive returns or because the contracts are too long, according to a 2016 PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. Many small- and medium-sized businesses have a hard time benefiting too. They don't consume enough energy to negotiate large, lowest-cost PPAs like the big guys. Smaller projects, such as installing rooftop solar panels, tend to depend heavily on state and local incentives that come and go.  The 2020 expiration of the federal tax incentives is another concern. But industry watchers expect U.S. companies will continue their ambitious public commitments to boost renewable energy use even if those breaks aren't renewed. General Mills, for instance, sees climate change as a major threat to the agricultural supply chain behind products such as Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt. The company has a goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent by 2025.  If the front end of that business model breaks down -- Mother Nature -- we're in a world of hurt,  the company's chief sustainability officer, Jerry Lynch, said.

It will also start to fit new fixed recorders to both short-range and long-range jets that can store 25 hours of voice and data information on a single recorder.  Currently, the  black boxes  of an aircraft are two separate recorders, one for voice and one for flight data, with the voice recording only covering two hours.  The ejectable or  deployable  recorders would separate from the tail during a crash and float, emitting a distress signal. Flight recorders at present emit acoustic signals for 30 days after a crash, giving search teams fewer than three weeks to locate them in what can be deep waters. Recommended by investigators after an Air France A330 jet crashed in 2009, the idea came to the fore after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 in March 2014, for which the recorders still have not been found. The new ejectable recorder, which Airbus calls the Automatic Deployable Flight Recorder (ADFR), is made by L3 Technologies (LLL.N) and can record up to 25 hours of voices from the cockpit and flight data.  The ejectable black box is also aimed at the other longer-range planes made by Airbus such as the A321LR, the A330 and the A380. The long-range planes would have both an ejectable and fixed recorder, while short-haul aircraft from the A320 family will be fitted with two of the fixed recorders, Airbus said.

She met and fell in love with Mokhtar, a teacher who fled Iran and ended up in Calais. She now risks 10 years in jail. Beatrice Huret, a former nursing aide who voted and even   campaigned for the National Front, regrets nothing of her  unlikely encounter - except that she is accused of people trafficking and could be put behind bars.  I knew I should not do it but I did not imagine this would be the consequence,  says Huret, whose case will be ruled on by a court next week.  They know I did this out of love,  she told Reuters.  What bothers me the most is to be put in the same bag as others who made people pay for the crossing, people who profited from misery of the refugees.  Mokhtar, who wants his family name withheld because he fears jeopardizing his situation, now lives in England on the opposite side of the sea from Calais, the French port city from which thousands like him have sought to reach Britain, many without success. He crossed the English Channel in a small boat he bought for a 1,000 euros ($1,115) and which Huret helped him choose, setting out with two others from the village of Dannes about 50 km south of Calais and a similar distance from the shores of England.  I said farewell to him that morning,  says Huret, a little wistfully.  I did not say until next time, I said farewell. I was sure I was never going to see him again.  Mokhtar and Huret was a meeting against all odds. Her deceased husband had been a policeman who also voted for the National Front, a party that says France has no duty to welcome migrants who have fled to Europe in record numbers from war and strife in Africa and the Middle East. Huret, who now devotes her time to aiding needy people, once   even handed out leaflets for the party of Marine Le Pen, who lost the presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron last month, but won a seat in parliament along with seven other National Front politicians in a follow-up parliamentary election on June 18. Politics aside, the encounter would almost certainly never have happened if Huret had not stopped to offer a hitchhiker a ride in her car to the entrance of The Jungle, a vast camp the hitcher shared with thousands of migrants, among them Mokhtar. Shocked at the squalor she saw, Huret chose to take action, launching an appeal for funds to aid Jungle residents, visiting the site again and meeting Mokhtar, one of several camp dwellers who had stitched their lips together to draw media attention to their plight. That was in March 2016.  We exchanged glances and something immediately clicked. It clicked,  she reminisces. When asked some time later to put a few migrants up in her house, Huret discovered one of them was the same Mokhtar.  I already knew I had fallen in love. That was it, I was smitten,  she says.  I didn't even know his first name.  Walking along the beach from which he set off for Britain in June 2016 , Huret said:  People say distance dulls the emotions but no it gets stronger each time. As for the rest we don't talk about it. We live it day by day.  A court is expected to rule on June 27 on Huret's case, where she faces a maximum potential sentence of 10 years in prison. She says Mokhtar, a former Farsi language teacher, has applied for asylum in Britain. (This story has been refiled to change hitchhikers to a hitchiker.)

It will also start to fit new fixed recorders to both short-range and long-range jets that can store 25 hours of voice and data information on a single recorder.  Currently, the  black boxes  of an aircraft are two separate recorders, one for voice and one for flight data, with the voice recording only covering two hours.  The ejectable or  deployable  recorders would separate from the tail during a crash and float, emitting a distress signal. Flight recorders at present emit acoustic signals for 30 days after a crash, giving search teams fewer than three weeks to locate them in what can be deep waters. Recommended by investigators after an Air France A330 jet crashed in 2009, the idea came to the fore after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 in March 2014, for which the recorders still have not been found. The new ejectable recorder, which Airbus calls the Automatic Deployable Flight Recorder (ADFR), is made by L3 Technologies (LLL.N) and can record up to 25 hours of voices from the cockpit and flight data.  The ejectable black box is also aimed at the other longer-range planes made by Airbus such as the A321LR, the A330 and the A380. The long-range planes would have both an ejectable and fixed recorder, while short-haul aircraft from the A320 family will be fitted with two of the fixed recorders, Airbus said. However, some in the industry have expressed doubts over ejectable black boxes, saying they could deploy accidentally, while others have said they would prefer live streaming of data.

Investigations into the calamitous fire are just beginning and will probably take years to complete. But it has already exposed one persistent problem: Britain’s disastrous approach to housing.  The most obvious sign of this problem is the pathetic pace of new construction. On average, the country has built 150,000 new units over the last five years – less than half of what’s needed to keep the country well-housed. But neglect runs deeper through the sector. The industry suffers from a shortage of trained building workers, lax quality standards, ineffective regulation and inadequate maintenance of public housing.  Britain could certainly do better, if it really wanted to. The country has the money and the organisational skills to build more and better new residences, to create new neighbourhoods and to step up the pace and quality of renovation. Anyone who is in doubt about how to proceed could look to France, Germany or some other successful European country where housing is treated as an essential common good.  The poor track record suggests that British people do not actually care very much about doing better. Despite the repeated protestations of politicians, decent shelter for all is just not very high on the national agenda. The lack of a strong social commitment leaves a policy vacuum which has been filled by the lobby groups that gain from the status quo: homeowners, builders and local governments. They have created a dense web of counterproductive rules and practices.  Other nations have their own unnecessarily dysfunctional systems. America’s approach to healthcare is an excellent example. The United States spends far too much and gets too little, yet refuses even to consider copying cheaper and more successful systems in other affluent countries. The deep problem is the lack of a U.S. consensus about the good of universal care. There are many small reforms, but anything like a substantial reformation is politically impossible.  Or consider the persistent shortfalls of Greek tax collection. Analysts at the Dianeosis think tank estimate evasion costs the government 6 per cent-9 percent of GDP each year. Then there is the problem of unemployment in Italy and France. Both countries have for decades commissioned expert reports on job creation, which governments have all but ignored. For all these issues, better solutions are well known but the national commitment to adopt them is lacking.  Over time, the politically powerful groups which gain from the existing system become ever more entrenched, making new approaches more difficult to imagine. But the power of these groups is more a symptom than a cause. They would be swept aside if the national agenda changed.  And priorities do sometimes shift. In the 1960s, few economic habits were as entrenched in developed countries as industrial pollution. Powerful corporate lobbyists warned that mandatory emissions limits threatened economic calamity. They were overruled. Pollution fell dramatically: emissions of sulphur dioxide in North America have dropped by 70 percent since 1970, according to Clio Infra data.  Around the world, the anti-pollution consensus is now strong enough to steamroll over all opposition. Volkswagen and other makers of diesel cars may have hoped to cheat or lobby their way out of reducing small particle emissions, but discovered that the environment now matters more than fuel economy. Recently, environmental awareness has extended to climate change. Even oil companies now profess to be in favour of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.  The pollution revolution was essentially cultural. Country by country, people changed their hierarchy of values. Clean air and water for all became more important goals than any company’s desire for higher profit or increased physical production.  The lesson from the action on pollution and the inaction on so many other persistent problems is that when bad national habits are accepted as normal, nothing less than a cultural revolution will do. The recognition of this hard truth helps to explain why Emmanuel Macron, the new president of France, called his campaign book “Revolution” and insisted that the national will to change is more important than a “thousand detailed proposals”.  Good luck to him and any imitators. The changes required to solve deep-set problems all require a stronger sense of shared national purpose. Everyone pays taxes and everyone should have decent housing, healthcare and jobs. In the last few decades, it has seemed that history was moving in the opposite direction, away from larger and more responsible governments and towards a more individualistic and privatised approach to policy.  Still, history is unpredictable. A year ago, almost no experts thought Macron’s promise of revolutionary improvements would propel him to the presidency and his party to an absolute majority in parliament. Perhaps it is significant that the Grenfell Tower fire has provoked great indignation. After all, hope and anger are the stuff revolutions are made of.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The bloc's executive European Commission published a draft amendment late on Tuesday to its  MiFID II  law that comes into force in just six months' time. The law toughens up transparency requirements by pushing more trading out of the  dark  and onto public platforms. The Commission said an amendment was needed  in light of alleged nascent industry initiatives  that build on  ambiguity  in the law. It follows concerns at the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which said in April that banks executing a client's share order in-house were teaming up with each other and  high frequency traders  to act as a virtual trading platform, a service that needs a licence. The Commission said there should be a clear separation between a bank dealing on its own account, and the multilateral trading seen on a platform. Under the amendment, a bank would not be dealing on its own account if it was carrying out a  de facto riskless  transaction, meaning none of its own capital was on the line. The industry has four weeks to respond to the Commission's proposals. Reporting by Huw Jones, editing by David Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eu-markets-regulations-idUSL8N1JI4JS"},

James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois, opened fire last Wednesday at the baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, wounding Republican leader Steve Scalise, authorities say. Hodgkinson's social media accounts indicated strong anti-Republican views and an FBI agent said on Wednesday items found on his body included a piece of paper with the names of six members of Congress but no context attached. FBI Special Agent Timothy Slater did not identify the members and said there was no evidence to indicate they were targets. He said authorities found a laptop computer, a cell phone and a digital camera in Hodgkinson's car but an analysis of the items showed that he did not place any online posts of threats or references to lawmakers or the baseball game. Hodgkinson had expressed anti-Republican views online but Slater said,  There were no threats whatsoever.  Authorities also found 200 rounds of ammunition in a storage locker Hodgkinson had rented in April in Alexandria, Slater said. The shooting occurred as 25 to 30 Republican members of the House and Senate had gathered for an early morning practice a day before the annual charity congressional baseball game against Democrats. Scalise, No. 3 in the House of Representatives Republican leadership, was shot in the hip and remains hospitalized. Hodgkinson was fatally wounded in a shootout with police. Slater said authorities have not yet determined a motive and the FBI probe continues.  He was known to have an anger management problem,   Slater said at a news conference, adding later that Hodgkinson was on medication and  struggling  in a number of ways, including a difficult personal life.

It also makes it easier to create parts from materials that are traditionally difficult to shape, such as titanium. But manufacturers are having to overcome a variety of challenges, such as bringing down costs and winning over regulators, to turn potential into profits.  It is nice to print, it's fancy, it's beautiful, but there are three conditions - it has to be cheaper, lighter, and faster,  Premium Aerotec CEO Thomas Ehm told Reuters at the Paris Airshow. Premium Aerotec has set up a team of five people to screen the suitability of its thousands of parts for the 3D printing process, with the focus on those criteria. The German company, which specialises in metal and carbon fibre composite aircraft structures, has identified 50 titanium parts for the A350 plane that it plans to print, with 10 of those already in serial production using the process. It also already prints six components for the refuelling system of the A400M military transporter. Titanium is currently the only material where 3D printing offers a cost advantage, Ehm said, because it is traditionally expensive to buy and hard to machine. Around 30 percent of the costs of production using the new technology is the printing itself, Ehm said, while the rest is in preparing and finishing the part. For example, supports are needed to hold up the component while it is being printed, which then have to be cut off afterwards. The company currently uses printers made by Concept Laser and EOS and has invested 15-20 million euros so far at its site in Varel, northern Germany. Premium Aerotec is also working with Daimler on a project to explore whether the costs of printing can be brought down enough to make it viable for aluminium parts, which Ehm said would be game-changing for the industry.  This is when (our) factory with the five or six machines will change to a big hangar with 100 machines,  he said. Another challenge is achieving certification for parts created using new processes or materials for the aerospace industry, where demands are stringent.  With all the new technology and ideas, the manufacturers, designers and inventors have to pinch themselves and ask how long is it going to take to get into a reliable manufacturing and certified situation,  Phil Seymour, CEO of aviation consultants IBA told Reuters. One issue with the certification of 3D printed parts is making sure each one has the same shape and the same qualities. German engine maker MTU Aero Engines, which also uses printers from EOS, said the layers involved increased the risk of the part failing. It currently prints one part and is planning a further six.  One-third of parts could be 3D printed, but it will take time,  CEO Reiner Winkler said at the air show. After taking the initial individual 3D printed parts to the authorities, Ehm said Premium Aerotec was now close to getting certification for the process as a whole, which would allow it to print parts.

The move comes as President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Congress search for ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Trump is preparing to put out an executive order on drug pricing, according to media reports, and last week U.S. Senator Ron Wyden introduced a bill to require companies to explain the reasons for significant price increases.  Americans are sick and tired of seeing the cost of their prescription drugs race past their paychecks,  said Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. The FDA does not include price considerations when deciding whether to approve a new drug, but Gottlieb said the agency can facilitate increased competition by approving lower-cost generics. That means removing some of the obstacles placed by branded companies in the way of generic manufacturers. These obstacles can include limiting the availability of branded products for testing by generic companies, or prolonging negotiations with generic companies over the implementation of shared risk-management programs. Gottlieb said the agency plans to examine policy and program changes, including using its own authorities more forcefully and potentially collaborating more closely with other health agencies. Representatives from the pharmaceutical industry's main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, were not immediately available for comment.

Nike, whose products are already sold on Amazon through third-party and unlicensed dealers, could build an additional $300 million to $500 million of revenue in the United States or 1 percent of its global sales through its expansion as a wholesale dealer on Amazon, Goldman Sachs said in a client note.  Through the partnership, Nike could weed out excess, discounted inventory available at the marketplace through third-party retailers and sell more full-price products through the online channel, according to the note.  Nike shares were the top percentage gainer among Dow-listed stocks. The stock has been the worst performer among Dow stocks over the past three months.  The news comes as Nike said it would cut 2 percent of its global workforce and eliminate a quarter of its shoe styles to become nimbler in the face of intensifying competition and fast-changing consumer trends.     Nike vs. Sporting Goods retailers this year    Taking this step would give Nike direct economic exposure to a large and fast growing distribution channel, while improving the brand presentation and expanding access to millennial shoppers,  Goldman analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann said.  A potential partnership would lead to more competition for sporting goods retailers such as Dick's Sporting Goods Inc (DKS.N) that are seeing some market share gains due to the bankruptcies of The Sports Authority and other smaller, regional chains.  Shares of Dick's Sporting fell as much as 8 percent in early trading to hit a near one-and-a-half-year low, while Hibbett Sports Inc (HIBB.O) fell as much as 6 percent to hit a more than seven-year low.  Other chains such as Finish Line Inc (FINL.O) hit a near 7 year low, while Foot Locker Inc (FL.N) hit a more than three year low.   We expect pressures on bricks and mortar retail for the foreseeable future to result in pockets of inventory excess,  Drucker Mann said. However, it would help Nike to make its brand more visible by working with Amazon to control inventory from unlicensed dealers, she added.

BPS's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) was recently downgraded to 'BBB-'/Stable from 'BBB'/Negative (see  Fitch Downgrades Banca Popolare di Sondrio to 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable , dated 20 June 2017 at www.fitchratings.com). The OBG are rated 'AA', at Italy's Country Ceiling and seven notches above the bank's 'BBB-' Long-Term IDR. The Outlook of the OBG is Stable, mirroring that of Italy's IDR and the significant buffer against a downgrade of BPS's Long-Term IDR due to the several uplift factors applied in the covered bonds rating analysis. Fitch maintains an IDR uplift of two notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of six notches and a recovery uplift of two notches. All else being equal, the 'AA' rating of BPS OBG is vulnerable to a downgrade if the Long-Term IDR of BPS is downgraded to 'B+' or below, as per our rating sensitivities on the OBG programme (see  Fitch Takes Actions on 3 Mid-Sized Italian Banks' OBG Programmes , dated 5 June 2017, available at www.fitchratings.com).

The new deal, which goes until 2024, comes a week after longtime Olympics sponsor McDonald's Corp bowed out of its sponsorship deal early, citing a change in the company's priorities as it tries to hold down costs. Intel joins about a dozen global Olympics sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co and Samsung about six months after Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba signed on until at least 2028. The IOC has been trying to make the Olympics more technologically savvy and appeal to younger people through its online content network, the Olympic Channel. IOC President Thomas Bach, who signed the deal with Intel's Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich at a press conference in New York, said Intel's sponsorship will open up new experiences for athletes, fans and spectators including in virtual reality. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but IOC sources have previously told Reuters that major sponsors pay about $100 million per four-year cycle, which includes one summer and one winter games. The IOC has been looking to hike the cost of those deals, sources previously said. Intel said it would provide 5G wireless technology, virtual reality, artificial intelligence platforms, and drones to the Games.  We'll allow people online to feel like they are there,  Krzanich said about technology that will be used at the Games. Intel's business has undergone big changes in recent years. In March, it agreed to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15 billion in a bid to expand its reach beyond its core microprocessor business, which has faced declines along with the personal computer market. The IOC is looking to sign pricier deals while brands are trying to figure out whether exclusive Olympics sponsorship rights offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC. Intel may be seeking to expand its reach in Asia, which is preparing to host three consecutive Olympic Games. South Korea's Pyeongchang is staging the 2018 winter games, Tokyo the 2020 summer Olympics and Beijing the 2022 winter games. The IOC is deciding between Paris and Los Angeles for the 2024 summer games. (Reporting by Liana B.

The surprisingly hawkish tone of Haldane in a speech added new uncertainty about monetary policy at a time when Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to form a stable government and as Britain begins its Brexit negotiations with Brussels. Sterling - which plunged after the Brexit vote last year as investors bet there was little chance of the BoE following the lead of the U.S. Federal Reserve and raising rates - gained about a cent against the U.S. dollar. British share and government bond prices fell. The comments from Haldane came a day after BoE Governor Mark Carney sought to dampen the prospect of a hike, saying he wanted to see how the economy copes in the coming months as Britain starts the process of leaving the European Union. Investors have been on edge about the possibility of a policy shift in the world's fifth-biggest economy since last week when the BoE's policymakers voted by a narrower-than-expected margin of 5-3 to keep rates on hold at a record low. All three of the votes in favour of higher rates were cast by external rate-setters. Haldane's comments on Wednesday represented the first sign of a shift in thinking among the internal members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Until now, he has been seen as largely supportive of keeping rates low. Haldane said in a speech published on Wednesday that he voted to keep rates on hold last week because he had not seen signs of a pickup in wage growth and there was  still some chance  of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the economy. But he signalled that he was likely to switch position soon, given the strength of the global economy and the resilience of Britain's economy to last year's Brexit vote.  Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year,  he said in a speech.  The first 25 basis-point rise in UK interest rates for 10 years seems like a momentous step. But it would still leave monetary policy highly accommodative by any historical metric.  Investors are now trying to work out the likely thinking of other members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, a job which has been complicated by the departure of two of its members, only one of whom has so far been replaced. Sam Hill, an economist with RBC Capital, said he would be checking the central bank's weekly calendar - which is usually published on Friday afternoons - to see if Ben Broadbent, the BoE's deputy governor for monetary policy whose views have largely aligned with Carney's, was due to speak soon.  I think it's really important to see what Broadbent thinks. That will really shape expectations,  Hill said. The BoE's next policy announcement is due on Aug. 3. It is not clear if the one vacant seat on the usually nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will be filled by then. One of the three MPC members who backed a rate hike last week, Kristin Forbes, will leave the BoE this month and it is not clear how her successor Silvana Tenreyro is likely to vote. The BoE has given signals before that it was getting ready to raise rates only for its plans to be knocked off course. In 2015, Carney said a hike was likely - shortly before a plunge in global oil prices that took inflation to zero. Dust Cloud of Uncertainty In August last year the BoE cut interest rates to 0.25 percent and took other measures to give the economy a boost after signs of a sharp slowdown caused by the referendum decision in June to leave the European Union. In the end, Britain's economy withstood the referendum shock better than expected in 2016, although it has shown signs of a slowdown since the start of this year as the fall in the value of the pound pushes up inflation and pinches consumer spending. Haldane listed several factors behind his shifting view. These included a recent jump in the country's main inflation rate to 2.9 percent - far above the BoE's 2 percent target - and signs in the bond market that  policy actions rather than words  were what counted for investors. He also said Britain's economy appeared a bit less reliant on consumers whose spending has been pinched by inflation. The BoE said earlier on Wednesday that business investment plans were strengthening and sterling weakness was boosting export volumes. However, Haldane said he wanted to wait for a clearing of the  dust-cloud of uncertainty  that was thrown up by the inconclusive outcome of Britain's election.  It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers,  he said.

Nipco's investment subsidiary bought 60 percent of Mobil Oil Nigeria from Exxon Mobil Corp. in October, when the U.S. giant pulled out of downstream fuel distribution in Nigeria. Nipco, which was founded in 2001, now owns 66.7 percent of the fuel retailer, according to an offer document seen by Reuters. It is offering minority shareholders 417.12 naira per share for the 3.23 percent of the capital, or 11.6 million shares, it needs, the same price it paid Exxon last year and a 75 percent premium to Wednesday's market price of 238.36 naira. The offer ends on June 29. Shares in Lagos-listed Mobil Oil have lost 10 percent this year, giving the company a market value of 85.95 billion naira ($282 mln). The shares rose 74 percent last year. The downstream oil industry in Africa's biggest economy is consolidating as multinational oil firms divest to focus on upstream exploration with higher margins, especially given the backdrop of lower crude prices. Nigeria exports nearly 2 million barrels of oil a day but imports the bulk of its refined products because its refining capacity is unable to meet the country's daily fuel needs of 40 million litres. Mobil Oil rival Oando has now shifted away from being a fuel distributor to explore for oil and gas. It sold a 60 percent stake in its downstream business last year to Vitol and Helios Investment Partners for $210 million. Mobil was founded in 1951 and operates more than 200 petrol stations in Nigeria. It also owns three plants that manufacture lubes, petroleum jelly, and insecticides in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos.

But the two-year-old boy and his mother found themselves in a perilous situation when four gunmen and suicide bombers attacked the building and started indiscriminately shooting at people. Emad lives with his parents and two siblings in a small rented house in the northern city of Gorgan.  His father, Mohammad Hossein Esmaeilnejad, has been out of work for two months, a disability in one of his legs making it difficult for him to find a new job.

I have spent all my money and borrowed from everybody I can. No one lends us money any more,  she said. Emad suffers from Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), a rare disease caused by the body's inability to produce specific enzymes.  On June 7 this year, Emad's father went to post office to send a letter to the president and ask for help.   That day I prayed to God: 'If you fix things, it will be great. If not, I will not ask anyone for help again',  Esmaeilnejad said. Emad's mother took the boy to parliament to make a desperate plea for support.  Someone told me to go to parliament to ask for help.

Everyone was running away. Everyone was trying to find a way to save themselves. Some made it. But many were killed,  Emad’s mother said. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Tehran attacks in which 17 people were killed. Gunmen simultaneously attacked the mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini in southern Tehran.

Pictures of Emad, being passed by security forces through a window from an upper floor, were widely published in local and international media and won attention for the boy's condition.  The health minister visited us. He was very friendly,  Emad's father said. The minister has ordered Emad to be immediately treated at government cost. He has even agreed to send Emad abroad if necessary. Esmaeilnejad said the photo solved half of his problems.  But the rest of problems are still there. I am unemployed and have no home,  he said.

Suncor Energy was among the most influential gainers, rising 1.7 percent to C$38.75. Cenovus Energy shares, which were battered in the previous session by news the company would replace its chief executive and sell some assets, partially recouped losses, rebounding 3.1 percent to C$9.73.

But the two-year-old boy and his mother found themselves in a perilous situation when four gunmen and suicide bombers attacked the building and started indiscriminately shooting at people. Emad lives with his parents and two siblings in a small rented house in the northern city of Gorgan.  His father, Mohammad Hossein Esmaeilnejad, has been out of work for two months, a disability in one of his legs making it difficult for him to find a new job.  Zahra Khorasani, Emad's mother, told Reuters they had spent all their savings on finding treatment for the child's rare disease.  Emad has been in surgery three times. I have spent all my money and borrowed from everybody I can. No one lends us money any more,  she said. Emad suffers from Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), a rare disease caused by the body's inability to produce specific enzymes.  On June 7 this year, Emad's father went to post office to send a letter to the president and ask for help.   That day I prayed to God: 'If you fix things, it will be great. If not, I will not ask anyone for help again',  Esmaeilnejad said. Emad's mother took the boy to parliament to make a desperate plea for support.  Someone told me to go to parliament to ask for help.

Everyone was running away. Everyone was trying to find a way to save themselves. Some made it. But many were killed,  Emad’s mother said. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Tehran attacks in which 17 people were killed. Gunmen simultaneously attacked the mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini in southern Tehran. Slideshow (10 Images) I told myself I might live or die. Whatever God wants will happen,  Khorasani said. She is happy that her son could not hear the traumatic gunshots because of his poor hearing. Emad's mother grabbed him and ran. In one of the corridors, security forces gave them bullet proof vests and evacuated them from the building. Pictures of Emad, being passed by security forces through a window from an upper floor, were widely published in local and international media and won attention for the boy's condition.  The health minister visited us. He was very friendly,  Emad's father said. The minister has ordered Emad to be immediately treated at government cost.

The country is both the world's largest producer and consumer of the packaging and soldering metal.  But its interaction with the rest of the global tin market has in the past been severely constrained by a 10 percent export duty.  Before that tax came into effect at the start of 2008, China had been a net exporter of refined tin. In the period after, it became a net importer, albeit one with steadily diminishing appetite. The export tax disappeared at the beginning of this year. Don't worry if you didn't notice. Even China's producers didn't see the change coming. Now they are starting to react, with Yunnan Tin, China's and the world's largest producer, gearing up to start overseas shipments. A resumption of Chinese exports will be welcome news to short-position holders on the London Metal Exchange (LME) tin contract, which has for months been starved of stocks liquidity and gripped by persistent tightness.  But might the return of China to the global tin stage herald a more profound shift in how this metal is priced?  Graphic on China's refined tin trade 2004-2017: tmsnrt.rs/2rUu5mv Delayed Reaction There has been no discernible reaction to the lifting of the export tax at the start of this year.  China's exports of refined tin were a miniscule 232 tonnes over the January-April period.  That's because there was no consultation or advance warning from China's Commerce Ministry.  The only clue that something had changed was the omission of refined tin from the annual list of commodities qualifying for an export tax. The resounding official silence may be down to the fact that this looks like a preemptive move to avert a potentially embarrassing World Trade Organization complaints process set in motion by the United States last year. It's taken local producers several months to confirm that the tax is indeed no more.  And now one, Yunnan Tin, is capitalizing on its removal by preparing to export tin under a so-called  processing  deal.  What this means is that the company can import raw materials without paying value-added tax as long as they are used to produce metal for export, which of course is now also tax-free.  Yunnan Tin, it is worth noting, is by some margin the world's largest producer with refined output last year of 76,000 tonnes, more than the next three largest producers combined.  It is also a major importer of raw materials from across the border in Myanmar. Such imports totaled 473,000 tonnes last year. That's a bulk weight figure. Industry association ITRI estimates it translates into 50,000 tonnes of contained tin.  Relief for London Market...?  Yunnan Tin's  YT  brand is one of six Chinese producer brands deliverable against the LME's tin contract.  Which desperately needs some fresh stocks liquidity.  LME inventory stands at just 1,730 tonnes, or an even more marginal 1,480 tonnes if metal that has been earmarked for physical load-out is excluded.  Unsurprisingly, the front part of the curve is tight, with cash metal commanding a premium of $120 per tonne over three-month metal as of Tuesday's close. This backwardated structure has been a near constant in the London tin market for over two years. But that's because stocks have been so low over the same period.  Rebuilds have been relatively small and short-lived and the London market gives every appearance of having to generate a cash premium just to keep any stocks liquidity at all.  Compare and contrast with the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), which had 4,440 tonnes of tin in its warehouse system at the end of last week.  That's probably symptomatic of broader availability in mainland China, ITRI suggesting there was  some stock  built up in the first quarter of this year.  The association's takeaway is that a renewed flow of metal from China to the rest of the world will cut the current VAT-based price differential between the two markets and, in time, lead to  a rebalancing of pricing, with LME prices falling and China prices rising . Graphic on LME stocks and spreads: tmsnrt.rs/2sSZHxK ...Or a Threat?  The breaching of the great tin wall of China should have some short-term positives for the London market in terms of stocks liquidity and a consequent dissipation of the tightness that has become almost hard-wired into the LME contract. But does it also pose a longer-term threat? The LME tin contract has seen trading activity shrink dramatically over the last couple of years from over 2 million lots in both 2013 and 2014 to 1.4 million last year.  The trend shows no sign of abating, with volumes sliding another 16 percent over the first five months of 2017.  Even within the context of the broader decline in LME activity, tin is something of a stand-out.  The London market is largely being kept alive because just enough players still want to use it as a pricing benchmark.  The obvious alternative would be the ShFE but there is still sufficient wariness about what drives Shanghai pricing to prevent any collective switch.  The ShFE tin contract, launched in 2015, has largely escaped the attention of the flash investment crowds that have roiled other mainland commodity markets.  But the ratio of open interest to volume is still low, averaging under 4 percent in January-April, which suggests a significant element of speculative day-trading.  The ratio on the LME contract, by contrast, averaged 17.5 percent over the same period, implying larger positions being held for longer, indicative of more  trade  hedging presence.  The LME's price-reference franchise looks fragile but OK. For now at least.  But as the market adjusts to the reality of Chinese exports, it will also become ever more Asia-centric.  There is only one European producer brand listed as LME good delivery; that of Belgium's Metallo Chimique. And right now there are no live LME tin stocks outside of Asian locations. The 120 tonnes at Rotterdam have been canceled prior to drawdown.  London tin, in other words, looks ripe for a serious challenge from another exchange, particularly an Asian one.  The resumption of Chinese tin exports after a near-decade hiatus may herald more than a simple readjustment of London-Shanghai pricing. It threatens a much more profound reconfiguration of global pricing.          Editing by Dale Hudson","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/china-tin-ahome-idUSL8N1JI48I"},

The tender offer for the agreed 5.3 billion euro ($5.9 billion) deal at 66 euros per share runs through to the end of Thursday, June 22, and was made conditional on securing 67.5 percent of the shares in the German drugmaker. The investors earlier this month lowered the minimum acceptance threshold from 75 percent and postponed the cut-off date by two weeks. While German takeover rules bar Bain and Cinven from amending their offer a second time, they could make a renewed bid with Stada's approval within a year of the first attempt failing. Even though institutional investors typically tender shortly before the deadline, the bidders have grown increasingly uneasy about the slow uptake, sources close to them have told Reuters. A relatively large 27 percent of shares are held by individual non-professional investors, many of whom are elderly, according to the sources. Only about half of these retail investors are expected to tender, with the rest expected to ignore or forget letters from custodian banks informing them of the offer. At a premium of 49 percent over the share price before initial reports emerged that a takeover was on the cards, the offer is widely regarded as attractive, after Stada organised a fiercely competitive auction between two buyout consortia. Complicating things further for Stada's suitors, index tracking funds that cannot tender, are seen as holding about 12 percent of the shares. The sources said that Bain and Cinven are fearing that some of the abstaining shareholders might be speculating that a rival bidder is lying in wait. Private equity firms Advent and Permira last month decided not to tie up with Shanghai Pharmaceuticals to make a counter bid for Stada, sources told Reuters at the time.

In a blog post on its website, Oscar Health said it was looking to expand or begin coverage in parts of Ohio, Texas, New Jersey, Tennessee and California and had also filed to continue selling health insurance to businesses, individuals and families in New York in 2018. The announcement comes as the U.S. Congress is working to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) popularly known as Obamacare.

The letter is the latest in a string of missives from Democrats concerned about Icahn's dual role as a special adviser to President Donald Trump on regulation and as a major investor in heavily regulated industries.  Icahn has an 82 percent stake in oil refiner CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N). He has also recommended the White House change the biofuels program that would reduce costs to CVR and other refining companies.   Recent reports about Mr. Icahn’s actions with respect to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program have raised significant ethical and legal concerns given his oil refinery business interests,” the letter read. Signing the letter were Reps. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Bobby Rush of Illinois; Diana DeGette of Colorado; Paul Tonko of New York; and John Sarbanes of Maryland. They called on Pruitt to respond by the end of the month with details about procedures in place at EPA to prevent Icahn from influencing policy for personal gain. The agency runs the Renewable Fuel Standard program, a regulation requiring increasing amounts of biofuels in the nation's gasoline.  Earlier this month, five Democratic senators had also asked the EPA to hand over documents relating to Icahn's role in shaping biofuels policy at the agency. And in May, eight Democratic senators asked U.S. regulators to investigate Icahn’s biofuels activities. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission responded that it was not investigating but would help the EPA with any probe that it was conducting. [L1N1J21PC] An official at the EPA Office of Inspector General declined to comment on whether an inquiry was under way. Icahn was named as an unpaid special adviser to Trump in December. In February, he proposed shifting the responsibility for blending biofuels to fuel dealers from refiners.  Icahn has said the proposal is not self-dealing because it would benefit many refining companies, not just CVR. White House officials have said the EPA is considering the proposal.

In a blog post on its website, Oscar Health said it was looking to expand or begin coverage in parts of Ohio, Texas, New Jersey, Tennessee and California and had also filed to continue selling health insurance to businesses, individuals and families in New York in 2018. The announcement comes as the U.S. Congress is working to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) popularly known as Obamacare. Major insurers have abandoned the program in some states due to uncertainty over whether the government will keep paying subsidies for the Obamacare individual health insurance system at a time when insurers must submit plans and premium rates for 2018.  We're confident that when the dust settles, the market for health insurance will stabilize in time for 2018,  Oscar Health said in its blog post.  For all of the political noise, there are simply too many lives at stake for representatives in Washington, D.C. not to do what's right for the people,  the company, founded in 2012, said. Of the six states, Tennessee and Ohio would be completely new markets for Oscar. Working with partner the Cleveland Clinic, the company is looking to sell health insurance in five counties in northeast Ohio in 2018. Oscar has already enrolled members in San Antonio, Texas, for 2017 and is seeking to begin operating in the state capital of Austin and expand offerings into greater San Antonio for 2018. The company, which did business in New Jersey in 2015 and 2016, filed to return to the state with offerings to businesses and individuals in 14 counties. Oscar said it is also seeking approval from California regulators to expand into east Los Angeles county to serve both individuals and small businesses.

People in 45 countries are unable to feed themselves, said the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which issues alarms about food shortages to the U.S. government. Furthermore, it said there is still a risk of famine looming over Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, and South Sudan, despite the international community committing about $2.2 billion to address the various crises since January.  Additional contributions to emergency appeals, particularly in these four countries, are urgently needed to prevent large-scale loss of life,  FEWS NET said in a statement. The United Nations says it has so far received only a quarter of the $23.5 billion needed for humanitarian assistance programs worldwide this year.  However, famine risk will not fully recede until substantive efforts are made to resolve ongoing conflict and improve access,  FEWS NET added.  The agency said it had increased the number of people it expects to need emergency food aid over the course of 2017.  Its estimate rose to 81 million from the 70 million it predicted in January, due to a series of factors, including below average rainfall in the Horn of Africa. The new estimate was up 20 percent on last year and 70 percent on 2015, it said. Other causes included access to new data, continuing wars and outbreaks of cholera in Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan.  Separately on Wednesday, the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said the situation in the three countries was  rapidly escalating downwards and out of control .  Without treatment for malnutrition, more people will fall ill. And a child who survives cholera will be even further malnourished,  IFRC Secretary General Elhadj As Sy said in a statement.   It is the most vicious of vicious spirals,  he added. Earlier, a U.N.-backed report said conflict-ridden South Sudan was no longer classified as being in famine although the situation remained critical. In Yemen, war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 3 million others and ruined much of the impoverished country's infrastructure, pushing nearly half its provinces on the verge of famine, according to the U.N.. In Nigeria, some 1.5 million people are on the brink of starvation in the northeast regions, hit by an eight-year insurgency by Boko Haram Islamists. In Somalia, more than 3 million people do not have enough to eat as the country suffers the effects of repeated rain failures and decades of conflict.

She met and fell in love with Mokhtar, a teacher who fled Iran and ended up in Calais. She now risks 10 years in jail. Beatrice Huret, a former nursing aide who voted and even   campaigned for the National Front, regrets nothing of her  unlikely encounter - except that she is accused of people trafficking and could be put behind bars.  I knew I should not do it but I did not imagine this would be the consequence,  says Huret, whose case will be ruled on by a court next week.  They know I did this out of love,  she told Reuters.  What bothers me the most is to be put in the same bag as others who made people pay for the crossing, people who profited from misery of the refugees.  Mokhtar, who wants his family name withheld because he fears jeopardizing his situation, now lives in England on the opposite side of the sea from Calais, the French port city from which thousands like him have sought to reach Britain, many without success. He crossed the English Channel in a small boat he bought for a 1,000 euros ($1,115) and which Huret helped him choose, setting out with two others from the village of Dannes about 50 km south of Calais and a similar distance from the shores of England.  I said farewell to him that morning,  says Huret, a little wistfully.  I did not say until next time, I said farewell. I was sure I was never going to see him again.  Mokhtar and Huret was a meeting against all odds. Her deceased husband had been a policeman who also voted for the National Front, a party that says France has no duty to welcome migrants who have fled to Europe in record numbers from war and strife in Africa and the Middle East. Huret, who now devotes her time to aiding needy people, once   even handed out leaflets for the party of Marine Le Pen, who lost the presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron last month, but won a seat in parliament along with seven other National Front politicians in a follow-up parliamentary election on June 18. Politics aside, the encounter would almost certainly never have happened if Huret had not stopped to offer a hitchhiker a ride in her car to the entrance of The Jungle, a vast camp the hitcher shared with thousands of migrants, among them Mokhtar. Shocked at the squalor she saw, Huret chose to take action, launching an appeal for funds to aid Jungle residents, visiting the site again and meeting Mokhtar, one of several camp dwellers who had stitched their lips together to draw media attention to their plight. That was in March 2016.  We exchanged glances and something immediately clicked. It clicked,  she reminisces. When asked some time later to put a few migrants up in her house, Huret discovered one of them was the same Mokhtar.  I already knew I had fallen in love. That was it, I was smitten,  she says.  I didn't even know his first name.  Walking along the beach from which he set off for Britain in June 2016 , Huret said:  People say distance dulls the emotions but no it gets stronger each time. As for the rest we don't talk about it. We live it day by day.  A court is expected to rule on June 27 on Huret's case, where she faces a maximum potential sentence of 10 years in prison. She says Mokhtar, a former Farsi language teacher, has applied for asylum in Britain. (This story has been refiled to change hitchhikers to a hitchiker.)

May previously said she would tackle high household energy prices if she was re-elected by introducing a cap on standard variable tariffs that could affect about 17 million families.   We have committed to extending the price protection currently in place for some vulnerable energy consumers to more of those on the poorest value tariffs,  the government said on Wednesday, as it set out its policy plan. Britain's Secretary of State for Energy, Greg Clark, told energy regulator Ofgem in a written letter seen by Reuters to  proceed without delay  and to advise him on what it intends to do regarding helping customers on the poorest value tariffs. Ofgem, which in theory has the power to impose a cap on energy prices, said it would shortly be setting out the work it has underway.  We share the government's concern that the energy market needs to work better for all consumers and that energy companies need to do more to help loyal consumers get a better deal,  a spokesman said. Clark said Ofgem's response would inform the government's decisions on tackling the energy tariff issue. However, Britain's energy retailers took the government's announcement as a signal against a market-wide price cap.  (The government) may end up intervening to make sure that unfair practices are remediated but they have removed the manifesto promise and language around capping prices,  Centrica Chief Executive Iain Conn told journalists on Wednesday. Analysts previously said the government would likely decide against imposing a blanket cap on energy prices in favor of a curb on prices for the most vulnerable customers. Shares in Centrica, which through British Gas is the largest energy supplier in Britain, were up around 2 percent after the company announced the disposal of two gas plants. However, shares remain around 11 percent lower than last October, when May first suggested possible market intervention. Shares in SSE, Britain's second largest supplier were flat, but are down around 7 pct from last October.

(CBQ), Doha Bank (DB), Qatar Islamic Bank (S.A.Q) (QIB), Al Khalij Commercial Bank P.Q.S.C. (AKB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB), Ahli Bank QSC (ABQ), International Bank of Qatar (Q.S.C) (IBQ) and Barwa Bank Q.S.C. (Barwa) on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). A full list of rating actions is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link above. This action follows the placement of the Qatari sovereign on RWN (see Fitch Places Qatar's 'AA' IDR on Rating Watch, dated 12-Jun-2017 on www.fitchratings.com.) and reflects significant uncertainty around the Qatari banking system resulting from the decision of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Egypt and some other Arab countries to sever diplomatic and logistical ties with Qatar. While some discussions have taken place to resolve the crisis, it is becoming more likely that the crisis will be sustained and will negatively impact Qatar's economy. Ultimately, the sovereign ability to support the banking system could weaken and all nine banks' Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs), which are driven by potential sovereign support, could be downgraded. The RWN on the Viability Ratings (VRs) reflects the heightened risks that this crisis places on the banks' operating environment, funding and liquidity and earnings and profitability, if the imposed isolation lasts for a sustained period. Depending on business model and funding and liquidity profile, the current crisis might affect some banks more than others, although we expect all banks to be affected to a certain extent. This is on top of Fitch's current expectation that economic growth will slow in 2017 and 2018, reflecting a less benign fiscal environment, contraction in current spending and a focus on fiscal efficiency leading to a slowdown of both private and public sector growth. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, Support Ratings (SRs) and Support Rating Floors (SRFs) The IDRs, SRs and SRFs of all Qatari banks reflect Fitch's expectation of an extremely high probability of support from the Qatari authorities for domestic banks in case of need. This reflects Qatar's strong ability to support its banks, as indicated by its rating (AA/RWN), combined with Fitch's belief of a strong willingness to do so. The latter is based on a track record of sovereign support between 2009 and 1Q11 when some banks received capital injections to enhance their capital buffers and the government purchased some problematic assets from the banks following the financial crisis. The government owns stakes in all Qatari banks. The government has demonstrated a strong commitment to its banks and key public sector companies, which has been reaffirmed during this crisis. The sovereign's capacity to support the banking system remains very strong owing to solid sovereign reserves and revenues, mostly from hydrocarbon production, but could weaken if the current crisis is prolonged. Qatari banks' SRFs are not differentiated due to franchise or level of government ownership because we see an extremely high probability that all rated Qatari banks would receive support should they require it. This belief also partly reflects the risk of contagion (small number of banks and high concentration of the banks in the system) and the importance of the banking system in building the local economy. As a result, Fitch equalises all Qatari banks' SRFs and IDRs at 'A+'. QNB is the exception, rated one notch higher at 'AA-' to reflect its flagship status, its role in the Qatari banking sector and its close business links with the state. The RWN on the Long-Term IDRs of all banks mirrors the RWN on the Qatari sovereign. In assigning the current IDRs, Fitch considers that the Qatari authorities will not place a moratorium on deposit withdrawals from or debt repayment to the countries in dispute in retaliation. VR The VRs for Qatari banks range from 'bbb+' for QNB, 'bbb-' for CBQ, DB, QIB and ABQ, to 'bb+' for the remaining four banks. Size and market share are a key differentiating consideration. The RWN on the banks' VRs reflects the heightened uncertainty resulting from the political crisis. A prolonged period of isolation is likely to have negative impact on the operating environment, further impact tightened liquidity and further increase cost of funding, as investors demand higher pricing due to greater uncertainty. Depending on the business model and funding and liquidity profile, the current crisis might affect some banks more than others, although we expect all banks to be affected to a certain extent. Our current assessment assumes that the Qatari Riyal / USD peg remains in place. QNB's VR of 'bbb+' reflects the bank's dominant franchise in Qatar, close links to the Qatari government and experienced senior management. It also reflects the bank's ability to access additional funding if needed. Profitability is stronger than most peers due to its lower-cost domestic funding base and higher margins from international operations. The VR also reflects the bank's higher risk appetite (as indicated by the bank's recent acquisitions and by strong expansion plans outside Qatar) and slightly weaker core capital and leverage ratios than peers, which benefit from 0% risk weighting on higher levels of government lending than other Qatari banks. High loan and deposit concentrations, which would otherwise constrain the rating, are mitigated by QNB's largest borrowers and depositors being primarily lower-risk Qatari government-related entities. QNB has a very large short USD position compared with peers, which could pressure the bank's foreign currency liquidity given the increase in foreign currency shortage in the market. CBQ's VR of 'bbb-' reflects the bank's strong and established franchise in Qatar and solid management quality. It also reflects deterioration in CBQ's asset quality metrics in the real estate and contracting sectors in Qatar and the weak performance of the bank's Turkish subsidiary (Alternatifbank; BBB-/Stable), which accounts for about 14% and 16% of CBQ's balance sheet and impaired loans, respectively). The asset quality deterioration reflects the bank's higher risk appetite than peers, although the bank's new strategy is to aim for lower-risk lending, which should eventually strengthen the balance sheet. Fitch expects asset quality metrics to continue to deteriorate before stabilising in 2018. Loans and deposits are concentrated, although CBQ's concentration levels are better than most domestic banks'. Following a recent rights issue, CBQ's ability to raise additional core capital in the short-to medium-term will likely be limited. We view CBQ's capitalisation as only adequate, which is reflected in the VR. The VR also takes into account the bank's adequate funding and liquidity profile. High impairment charges have significantly weakened profitability, which we expect to remain the case until 2018. DB's VR of 'bbb-' reflects the bank's well-established franchise in Qatar, sound management quality, a relatively more diversified funding franchise than peers, albeit with increasing reliance on foreign deposits, and the bank's adequate capitalisation. Asset quality is reasonable, but DB has historically had a higher impaired loans ratio than most peers. The VR also reflects DB's higher exposure to the real estate and contracting sectors (43% of loans at end-2016), which heightens risks. QIB's VR of 'bbb-' reflects the bank's established franchise in Qatar, solid management quality, sound asset quality, and solid funding and liquidity profile, with a franchise that is more diversified than many peers. Both financing and deposits are concentrated, in common with the sector, although deposits are less concentrated than peers' due to a strong retail component. The VR also takes into account the bank's adequate profitability, and satisfactory capital and leverage ratios compared with peers. In Fitch's view, QIB's aggressive 46% financing growth in 2015 was a sign of a potential rise in the bank's risk appetite, but growth has reduced in line with peers since 2016. ABQ's VR of 'bbb-' reflects the bank's reasonably conservative risk appetite and well-balanced business model, despite a small domestic franchise. The VR also reflects high concentrations on both sides of the balance sheet and an increasing proportion of non-domestic deposits. It also considers the bank's solid management quality, adequate liquidity, healthy internal capital generation capacity, sound asset quality and profitability ratios that compare well with peers. The bank has also been lengthening its funding profile. Capital ratios are solid, but Fitch views a high level of capital as necessary for ABQ's loan book concentration. AKB's VR of 'bb+' reflects the bank's small franchise and undiversified business model, as well as sound management quality, conservative risk management and healthy asset quality. There are high concentrations on both sides of the balance sheet. The VR also factors in the bank's acceptable capital ratios. Funding and liquidity remain adequate, but reflect a rise in large non-domestic deposits and significant asset/liability mismatches. The bank has proven its ability to grow its lending business according to management's plan. AKB's profitability remains weaker than most domestic peers'. QIIB's VR of 'bb+' reflects the bank's limited franchise and high sector and single name financing concentrations, which increase the bank's risk profile and the risk of fluctuation in asset quality. The VR also factors in QIIB's sound funding profile, with a more diversified funding base than most peers. QIIB's sound capital and leverage ratios, together with strong liquidity, also support the VR. IBQ's VR of 'bb+' reflects the bank's narrow, niche private banking franchise. It also reflects a concentrated funding base, primarily sourced from high-net-worth individual deposits and high single name lending concentrations. We view the bank's risk appetite as more aggressive than peers', reflecting the bank's high related-party lending. The VR also reflects significantly increased funding costs and a rising share of non-resident deposits, although these are still below the sector average. However, the VR also factors in the bank's solid management quality, reasonable capitalisation and sound liquidity. Concentration levels are high and above those of most peers, but they are mitigated by the largest exposures being mainly to government-related entities or to large blue-chip corporates. Asset quality metrics are broadly in line with peers' and we expect the bank's concentrations to reduce as IBQ implements its growth plans. Barwa's VR of 'bb+' predominantly reflects the bank's limited franchise and small size, but also the benefits of the bank's solid ties to the Qatari government (54% stake), which help to generate business flows, in both financing and funding. The VR also takes into account the bank's solid management quality, sound asset quality and reasonably strong profitability, as well as high lending concentrations and fairly significant restructuring in 2016. Barwa's capital ratios are solid, but should be viewed against the bank's concentrated balance sheet. The VR takes into account adequate funding and liquidity, although the funding base is more concentrated than peers'. Barwa and IBQ have entered into discussions for a three-bank merger with Qatar's Masraf Al Rayan. However, these discussions are still in early stages and do not have any impact at this stage on Barwa's and IBQ's ratings. SPVs AND SENIOR DEBT The ratings of debt issued by the banks' special purpose vehicles (SPV) are in line with the parents' Long- and/or Short-Term IDRs, because Fitch views the likelihood of default on any senior unsecured obligation issued by the SPVs the same as the likelihood of the default of the bank. In assessing the ratings of QIB, QIIB and Barwa, we considered important differences between Islamic and conventional banks. These factors include closer analysis of regulatory oversight, disclosure, accounting standards and corporate governance. Islamic banks' ratings do not express an opinion on the bank's compliance with sharia. Fitch will assess non-compliance with sharia if it has credit implications. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SRs AND SRFs The IDRs, SRs and SRFs are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions around the Qatari authorities' ability to provide timely support to the banking sector, including repayment of all senior deposits and debt, be they domestic or international. The RWN on all banks' IDRs is expected to be resolved at the same time as the RWN on the sovereign. A downgrade of the sovereign would result in a downgrade of all nine banks' IDRs. In the very unlikely event that the Qatari authorities place a moratorium on deposit withdrawals from or debt repayment to the countries in dispute in retaliation, some banks' IDRs would be downgraded to 'Restricted Default' ('RD'). VR Developments in the current crisis could be rapid and could significantly impact the banks. It is likely that the most immediate impact will be on the operating environment, funding and liquidity, cost of funding and performance. Any strong impact on any of these factors will trigger a downgrade of the VRs, although the impact may not be as pronounced or simultaneous for all banks. Banks with lower reliance on non-domestic deposits (such as IBQ, Barwa and QIIB) may be more immune to the above-mentioned pressures. In contrast, a weakening operating environment is expected to exert more pressure on the bank with the strongest company profile in Qatar, such as QNB as the flagship bank. Increased competition for domestic deposits will impact the liquidity profile and funding costs of all banks to varying degrees. We would expect margins to come under strain across the banking system. The current crisis could also affect the ability of all banks to raise foreign term funding and to term out their funding profiles. Fitch would expect the first large impacts to be visible in 2H17. Any large loss stemming from QNB's very large short USD position could also lead to a downgrade of the bank's VR. SPVs AND SENIOR DEBT The ratings of debt issued by the SPVs are sensitive to changes in their parents' IDRs.

Dan Schultz, president of Lockheed's Sikorsky helicopter unit, said the CH-53K King Stallion was performing better than expected in testing and had been approved by the Pentagon for full-rate production ahead of schedule. The Marines expect to declare the CH-53K ready for combat use in 2019.  Everybody needs heavier-lift helicopters,  Schultz, who flew earlier model CH-53 helicopters while serving in the Marines, told reporters at the Paris Airshow. Schultz declined to estimate how many additional CH-53K helicopters could be sold beyond the 200 aircraft to be bought by the Marines, but industry sources say another 100 aircraft could be sold to U.S. allies and potentially the U.S. Navy. The German defence ministry is expected later this month or early next to take the first step in an acquisition process for a new heavy-lift helicopter that will pit the CH-53K against Boeing Co's CH-47 Chinook, a twin-engine helicopter that has been in production for decades. It would then release formal requirements next year and award a contract a year later. Schultz said the CH-53K was a new design that could carry inside an entire pallet or Humvee, a big advantage over earlier models, and 12,200 kg (27,000 lbs) externally - more than triple the external load carrying capacity of the predecessor CH-53E. He said the cost was currently around $88 million a copy, but Lockheed and the Navy were implementing steps to further lower costs. Foreign orders could also help drive down costs by increasing economic order quantities. Experts say the cost of the Chinook would be far lower to buy, but it would take more flights to accomplish the same mission, given its lower carrying capacity. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Morel, the government's chief test pilot for the aircraft, said pilots and maintainers were consulted heavily before Sikorsky began designing the helicopter, resulting in an aircraft that was much easier to fly and service than other helicopters. He said the Navy, which oversees Marine Corps aviation, was studying if it could save money and time by eliminating some test points no longer needed given the helicopter's strong performance. Germany's competition for around 40 aircraft is the first on the horizon, and both Lockheed and Boeing are trying to forge ties with German firms that could provide components for the helicopters, and work on maintenance in coming years. Israel has asked for pricing and availability for 20 aircraft, but could potentially order more, Schultz said. In coming years, Japan could also look at orders since it now operates an earlier CH-53 model, Schultz added. Gene Cunningham, vice president of global sales for Boeing's defence unit, said the CH-47 was a strong contender for the German competition, saying it helped meet Germany's desire for a low-risk, affordable solution. Other NATO allies include Britain, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy also operate Chinooks, so a decision to buy the CH-47 would make it easier for the German military to operate together with other militaries, Cunningham said in an interview.  That seems to be a big factor as well with the German government,  Cunningham said.  The high availability rate of the aircraft would assure the mission readiness of Germany as a partner.

Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto and several buyout funds are also preparing bids for Ducati, which is being put up for sale by German carmaker Volkswagen. A deal with Harley-Davidson would bring together the maker of touring bikes like the Electra Glide that are symbolic of America with a leading European maker whose high-performance bikes have a distinguished racing heritage. Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson has hired Goldman Sachs to work on the deal, one source familiar with the matter said, adding tentative bids are expected in July. Volkswagen, whose Audi division controls Ducati – maker of the iconic Monster motorbike – is working with investment boutique Evercore on the sale which will help it fund a strategic overhaul following its emissions scandal. Based in the northern Italian city of Bologna, Ducati is on the wish list of private equity funds KKR, Bain Capital and Permira, which are all working on the deal, said the sources who declined to be identified as the process is private. Ducati was launched in 1926 as a maker of vacuum tubes and radio components and its Bologna factory remained open in World War Two despite being the target of several bombings. Ducati racers have won the Superbike world championship 14 times, with Carl Fogarty and Troy Bayliss its most successful riders. Harley-Davidson, which commands about half the U.S. big-bike market, was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the start of the last century and was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the great depression. Demand for Harley's motorcycles continues to be slow as its loyal baby boomer demographic ages and rivals such as the Indian brand bike maker Polaris Industries Inc and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd offer discounts. Bidding Field Evercore has sent out information packages to a number of potential suitors including Ducati's previous owner Investindustrial, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Investindustrial bought a stake in Ducati before the financial crisis, subsequently taking control of the business before selling it to Audi in 2012. It is now looking to compete with heavyweight private equity firms and large industry players to regain control. Volkswagen, Audi, Harley-Davidson, KKR and Bain Capital declined to comment while Bajaj, Investindustrial and Permira were not immediately available. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, is seeking to move beyond an emissions-cheating scandal that has tarnished its image and left it facing billions of euros in fines and settlements. A successful deal for Ducati, which last year made revenues of 593 million euros, would show that VW boss Matthias Mueller is serious about reversing his predecessor's quest for size. VW said last June it would review its portfolio of assets and brands, rekindling speculation among analysts that  non-core  businesses could be put up for sale. VW hopes to raise between 1.4 and 1.5 billion euros from the sale of Ducati, valuing it at 14-15 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of about 100 million euros, the sources said. The German car maker wants a valuation that reflects trading multiples of similar trophy assets in the automotive industry such as Italian car maker Ferrari which trades at almost 30 times its forward earnings. Yet it may need to compromise on price as some of the bidders would struggle to pay as much as 1.5 billion euros for Ducati, several sources said. Price expectations have already proved challenging for some industry players who recently decided against bidding. Indian motorcycle firm Hero MotoCorp and its rival TVS Motor Company initially expressed interest in Ducati but were put off by its price tag and decided to walk away, the sources said. German car marker BMW and Japanese motorcycle makers Honda and Suzuki have also decided against bidding for Ducati, sources close to the companies told Reuters. A BMW spokesman confirmed the German firm is not interested in Ducati while Hero and TVS were not immediately available for comment. Another source close to VW said the sale of Ducati may not be finalised before the annual EICMA motorcycle show in Milan in mid-November as VW wants to find the right buyer and the sales process may take time.

People in 45 countries are unable to feed themselves, said the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which issues alarms about food shortages to the U.S. government. Furthermore, it said there is still a risk of famine looming over Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria, and South Sudan, despite the international community committing about $2.2 billion to address the various crises since January.  Additional contributions to emergency appeals, particularly in these four countries, are urgently needed to prevent large-scale loss of life,  FEWS NET said in a statement. The United Nations says it has so far received only a quarter of the $23.5 billion needed for humanitarian assistance programs worldwide this year.  However, famine risk will not fully recede until substantive efforts are made to resolve ongoing conflict and improve access,  FEWS NET added.  The agency said it had increased the number of people it expects to need emergency food aid over the course of 2017.  Its estimate rose to 81 million from the 70 million it predicted in January, due to a series of factors, including below average rainfall in the Horn of Africa. The new estimate was up 20 percent on last year and 70 percent on 2015, it said. Other causes included access to new data, continuing wars and outbreaks of cholera in Somalia, Yemen and South Sudan.  Separately on Wednesday, the head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said the situation in the three countries was  rapidly escalating downwards and out of control .  Without treatment for malnutrition, more people will fall ill. And a child who survives cholera will be even further malnourished,  IFRC Secretary General Elhadj As Sy said in a statement.   It is the most vicious of vicious spirals,  he added. Earlier, a U.N.-backed report said conflict-ridden South Sudan was no longer classified as being in famine although the situation remained critical. In Yemen, war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 3 million others and ruined much of the impoverished country's infrastructure, pushing nearly half its provinces on the verge of famine, according to the U.N.. In Nigeria, some 1.5 million people are on the brink of starvation in the northeast regions, hit by an eight-year insurgency by Boko Haram Islamists. In Somalia, more than 3 million people do not have enough to eat as the country suffers the effects of repeated rain failures and decades of conflict.

The association between levels of tiny particles known as PM 2.5 in the air and death from liver cancer or from any cause was strongest for people with the least advanced cancers, researchers report in the International Journal of Cancer. “Our study suggests that liver cancer patients may be another susceptible group that could benefit from reductions in air pollution,” study co-author Sandrah Eckel of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles said by email. The liver may be at a high risk because it is responsible for helping the body process toxic materials that enter from the outside, she added. PM 2.5 pollution is made up of small particles and droplets less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These particles, which are tiny enough to enter the bloodstream through the lungs, are usually the product of combustion - including smoke and fumes from industrial sources and power plants, vehicle engines, wildfires or indoor cooking fires. Air pollution has been shown to increase lung cancer risk, but it may affect other cancers as well, the study team writes. The U.S. has standards to control air pollution, but some areas like Los Angeles still go above the allowed levels, Eckel noted. Globally, air pollution may be as much as 10 times the U.S. standard, she said. To see if there is a link between air pollution and liver cancer survival, the researchers used data on over 20,000 patients with the most common form of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma.  The researchers included all patients who were diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 and listed in the California Cancer Registry. The research team also used air pollution measurements from the areas where patients lived based on data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Quality System database. They found that people who were exposed to higher levels of PM 2.5 pollution after being diagnosed were significantly more likely to die from liver cancer or any cause. For people with localized liver cancer, higher levels of pollution exposure were tied to a 31 percent higher risk of death from any cause compared to people with the same stage cancer exposed to the least pollution. For those whose cancer had spread to nearby tissues, the increased risk associated with higher pollution exposure was 5 percent and for those whose cancer had spread further in their body, the added risk was 10 percent.  The risk differences were similar for death from liver cancer, the researchers note. Researchers adjusted for factors that might influence the analysis, like the patients' socioeconomic status, distance from the pollution monitoring station and the size of the city they lived in. A strength of the study is having included all liver cancer patients in the state registry for a good representation of this population, the authors note. One limitation is that researchers didn’t have much information about patients’ personal details and behaviors, like weight, alcohol consumption and whether they had hepatitis A or B.  “There is increasing evidence that particulate air pollutants can lead to early death from cardiorespiratory disease as well as a range of cancers including liver cancer,” Neil Thomas of the University of Birmingham in the UK said by email. People can try to reduce their exposure by using air filters, wearing masks and avoiding indoor pollution like burning candles, but the most important step is to put pressure on lawmakers to improve air quality, said Thomas, who was not involved in the study. “Air pollution reduction should be the goal of everyone for their own health and that of future generations,” Thomas said. “We generally recommend that people monitor their local air quality index,” said Eckel, noting that in the U.S., local data from the EPA's air quality monitoring system can be found on the AirNow.gov website. “On high pollution days, you might want to stay indoors, close the windows, and clean the air indoors using filters,” Eckel said, and drivers should roll up their windows on busy roads.

May previously said she would tackle high household energy prices if she was re-elected by introducing a cap on standard variable tariffs that could affect about 17 million families.  We have committed to extending the price protection currently in place for some vulnerable energy consumers to more of those on the poorest value tariffs,  the government said on Wednesday, as it set out its policy plan. Britain's Secretary of State for Energy, Greg Clark, told energy regulator Ofgem in a written letter seen by Reuters to  proceed without delay  and to advise him on what it intends to do regarding helping customers on the poorest value tariffs. Ofgem, which in theory has the power to impose a cap on energy prices, said it would shortly be setting out the work it has underway.  We share the government's concern that the energy market needs to work better for all consumers and that energy companies need to do more to help loyal consumers get a better deal,  a spokesman said. Clark said Ofgem's response would inform the government's decisions on tackling the energy tariff issue. However, Britain's energy retailers took the government's announcement as a signal against a market-wide price cap.  (The government) may end up intervening to make sure that unfair practices are remediated but they have removed the manifesto promise and language around capping prices,  Centrica Chief Executive Iain Conn told journalists on Wednesday. Analysts previously said the government would likely decide against imposing a blanket cap on energy prices in favour of a curb on prices for the most vulnerable customers. Shares in Centrica, which through British Gas is the largest energy supplier in Britain, were up around 2 percent after the company announced the disposal of two gas plants. However, shares remain around 11 percent lower than last October, when May first suggested possible market intervention. Shares in SSE, Britain's second largest supplier were flat, but are down around 7 pct from last October.

Any erosion of central bank independence is likely to spook investors even more. Foreigners were net sellers of local bonds last week, dumping 2.2 billion rand ($169 million) worth of debt, the biggest weekly sell-off since early February, Johannesburg Stock Exchange data showed. Offshore investors then sold 1.1 billion rand in bonds on Monday, after the idea of changing the central bank's mandate was floated, buying back 1.5 billion rand worth on Tuesday when the Reserve Bank said it would fight the proposal in court. South African pension funds have already cut their holdings in local government bonds to the lowest level in nearly 4-1/2 years because of political turbulence in the country. But yield-hungry foreign investors -- who are the largest holders of South African government bonds -- have been more resilient so far. This is partly because South Africa is in the Citi WGBI index, followed by many funds, and local debt is rated investment grade by two major agencies. If it lost that rating over central bank independence, up to $10 billion could flow out, analysts have estimated. S&P; Global Ratings has already warned South Africa that its rating could be cut deeper if the government meddles with the central bank. The dispute -- triggered by Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane recommending that the Reserve Bank's mandate of maintaining currency and price stability be changed so that it can focus on economic growth -- could hardly have come at a worse time. South Africa has just sunk into recession, had its credit rating downgraded, and is echoing to calls for President Jacob Zuma to resign, which he shows no sign of doing so. John Peta, Old Mutual Global Investors head of emerging market debt, said his firm bought South African debt after a March cabinet shake-up that sent yields higher. But it had now cut back on the ongoing political noise and as yields fall.  No previous government in South Africa has even hinted at (changing the central bank mandate) and Zuma's people now doing it is pretty disconcerting,  Peta said.  So if they do make more noise in that direction certainly the market will take notice Too Optimistic Morgan Stanley analysts said they believe investors are too optimistic about a resolution on the uncertainty.  We are bearish on South Africa,  the analysts wrote in a note, adding:  We believe that the main factors supporting the currency and bonds – attractive real bond yields and a gradually improving terms of trade – will start to lose importance gradually as evidence grows that recent political changes continue to have negative macroeconomic consequences.  Investors were already shaken in late March when Zuma dismissed respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan, triggering credit ratings downgrades to  junk  status. The yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose to a 4-month high of 9.2 percent in the aftermath of Gordhan's axing, but has since recovered to 8.55 percent. In another blow to investor confidence Moody's and Fitch have warned that new rules, which raised the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30 percent from 26 percent, could deter investment. The rules are meant to redress the exclusion black people experienced during apartheid, which ended in 1994. The Chamber of Mines, which represents mining firms, plans to challenge the new rules in court.  There is no light in the tunnel for growth,  Richard Segal, an emerging debt strategist at Manulife Asset Management.  If inflation comes down, you could see some interest rate cuts which could help a bit, but the overall picture for the South African markets is still uninspiring.

All allowances, bonuses and financial benefits for civil servants and military personnel cancelled, amended or suspended in September 2016 have been restored and backdated by a royal decree issued by King Salman ( Saudi Arabia slashes ministers' pay, cuts public sector bonuses , Reuters, Sept. 26, 2016). The decision coincides with the alteration of the succession in favour of the king’s son Mohammad bin Salman and relieves the previous crown prince of all his posts. The distribution of largesse to coincide with changes in the succession is common in monarchical systems to cement loyalty to the ruler and the chosen heir. Saudi successions have normally been accompanied by generous financial packages for employees on the government payroll and distributions have also been made at other times of political stress. The government has been gradually relaxing some austerity measures in recent months and signalling it would go further. The decision to pair the change in succession with a relaxation of austerity is not surprising but there are questions about its affordability in the medium term. Austerity Austerity measures were introduced by the government in response to the sharp drop in oil prices and revenues (tmsnrt.rs/2sTgvoG). Saudi Arabia’s earnings from petroleum exports shrank to $134 billion in 2016, from $322 billion in 2013, the last full year before oil prices slumped (“Annual Statistical Bulletin”, OPEC, 2017). As spending outstripped income, the country’s foreign reserves were depleted by $116 billion in 2015 and another $81 billion in 2016, according to statistics from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. Saudi Arabia’s official foreign assets have fallen by a third to $500 billion at the end of April 2017, from a peak of $746 billion in August 2014 (“Monthly Statistical Bulletin”, SAMA, April 2017). The combination of spending controls, increases in taxes and utility fees, and higher oil prices at the end of 2016 and in early 2017 narrowed the budget deficit and stemmed the depletion of reserves. But austerity has provoked complaints from Saudi citizens and a broad slowdown in the private-sector economy, which relies heavily on government spending and oil revenues as the ultimate source of almost all activity. According to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, the decision on Wednesday to reverse cuts for civil servants and military personnel was necessary to ensure a decent life for the kingdom’s citizens. Sustainability Foreign reserves declined by $35 billion in the first four months of the year; the reversal of austerity coupled with lower oil prices means the decline could accelerate in the rest of 2017. Saudi Arabia still has room to manoeuvre. The kingdom’s remaining reserves stand at $500 billion. It has little foreign debt. And the eventual sale of shares in state oil firm Aramco should raise additional funds. But reserves are depleting at an unsustainable rate of $100 billion per year, plus or minus $20 billion (tmsnrt.rs/2rV1m0N and tmsnrt.rs/2sqfPWh). Saudi Arabia maintains a fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, which means the country probably needs to keep minimum reserves of $200-300 billion to preserve confidence or risk a run on the peg. In the meantime, the country is bogged down in an expensive armed conflict in Yemen which appears to have reached a stalemate. Military and political competition with Iran, the kingdom’s traditional enemy, is escalating, and Saudi Arabia has promised to buy billions of dollars of extra armaments from the United States. The government has outlined ambitious plans to move the economy away from dependence on oil and public-sector jobs to non-oil industries and the private sector. The decision to restore public-sector salaries and bonuses is inconsistent with the policy of encouraging a shift to private-sector employment. Pacing Reforms So far the economic transformation plan has been long on rhetoric and short on substance. Tough decisions on spending lie ahead and will test the government’s resolve. The recent Article IV consultation between the Saudi government and the International Monetary Fund concluded the kingdom could afford to take longer to balance its budget (“IMF staff completes 2017 Article IV mission to Saudi Arabia”, IMF, May 17). “The government is adapting its fiscal policy to lower oil prices. The aim of bringing about a large, sustained, and well-paced fiscal adjustment to achieve a balanced budget is appropriate,” the IMF said in May. “The target of balancing the budget, however, does not need to be met in 2019 ... given Saudi Arabia’s strong financial asset position and its low debt.” “A more gradual fiscal consolidation to achieve budget balance a few years later would reduce the effects on growth in the near term while still preserving fiscal buffers to help manage future risks.” But given the government’s swift turnaround on austerity, it remains unclear how it will close the persistent budget and current account deficits. If something cannot go on forever, it will stop, noted the late Herbert Stein, chief economic adviser to then-U.S. president Richard Nixon. The kingdom has comfortable financial reserves but they will not last forever. (Editing by Dale Hudson)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-reform-kemp-idUSL8N1JI47H"},

The stock index surged 5.5 percent, its largest single-day rise since August 2015, to 7,335 points, its highest level since December 2015. Trading volume was the largest this year. Fund managers said the appointment of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, previously deputy crown prince, to be first in line for the throne was not unexpected, but came sooner than anticipated. He has been the catalyst for radical reforms to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil exports, ranging from a plan to sell a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco and dozens of other institutions and reinvest the money in non-oil industries, to tough austerity plans to eliminate a huge budget deficit.  For the first time in two years, investors will feel reassured that the economic reform plan Vision 2030 will not be scrapped,  said Ayham Kamel, director of the Middle East and North Africa at consultancy Eurasia Group. As defence minister Prince Mohammed has overseen the war in Yemen and taken a tough line towards Iran, so some analysts fear his promotion could raise geopolitical tensions. But investors were not focusing on geopolitics on Wednesday. National Commercial Bank, the biggest listed lender which is expected to help arrange the privatisation programme and play a major role in funding some of the new non-oil industries, soared 10 percent. Mining company Ma'den jumped 9.7 percent. Mining is a key sector in Prince Mohammed's plans to cut the kingdom's reliance on oil. Real estate developers were also strong, especially those that are working with the government on projects. Emaar the Economic City, which is developing an industrial city near Jeddah, shot up 10.2 percent. To mark Prince Mohammed's promotion, the government said it was restoring financial allowances to civil servants retroactively to last September. This did not appear to involve a lot of money - Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital, estimated 8 or 9 billion riyals ($2.1 billion to $2.4 billion) - but it lifted investor sentiment. The market was also buoyed by news that index compiler MSCI would, as expected, start to consider whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging market status. An upgrade would probably take effect in 2019, eventually attracting tens of billions of dollars of fresh foreign money. Iyad Ghulam, senior equities analyst at NCB Capital, said the MSCI news might give the market support for the medium term.  We expect the market to rise 20 to 30 percent from the day of the MSCI announcement on putting Saudi on the short list until the decision date in June 2018,  Ghulam said. Food maker Almarai jumped 9.1 percent to close at 90.00 riyals on Wednesday; it hit an all time intra-day high of 90.70 riyals. EFG Hermes predicts Almarai would see up to $405 million of passive fund inflows from an MSCI upgrade, plus up to $183 million if FTSE decides this September to upgrade Saudi Arabia. Oil Elsewhere in the Gulf, Brent oil's fall to below $46 a barrel - to levels not seen since November, before global oil producers agreed to cut output to prop up prices - hurt stock markets. While not disastrous for countries that have embarked on austerity programmes, it could mean governments have less room to boost spending this year than hoped. Dubai's index lost 1.0 percent as Dubai Financial Market, the only listed exchange in the Gulf, fell 3.4 percent. The Abu Dhabi index closed near flat. In Qatar, the index sank for a fourth consecutive day to its lowest close in 17 months. Petrochemical producer Industries Qatar fell 2.7 percent. The index has shed 11.6 percent since June 5, when Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states cut diplomatic and trade links with Doha.

The company said it was consolidating its two customer engagement centres into a single expanded operation in Dundee, Scotland, where 250 new positions would be created. Tesco set out a plan last October to reduce operating costs by 1.5 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) over three years.

The retail sector is facing unprecedented challenges and we must ensure we run our business in a sustainable and cost-effective way, while meeting the changing needs of our customers,  said Matt Davies, UK CEO of Tesco.  We realise this will have a significant effect on colleagues in the Cardiff area,  Davies said. In February, Tesco detailed plans to replace 1,700 deputy managers at its  Express  convenience stores and in January it proposed a reorganisation of its distribution network with a net loss of 500 jobs.

Nuclear is now the largest low-carbon power source in Europe and the United States, about three times bigger than wind and solar combined, according to IEA data. But most reactors were built in the 1970s and early 80s, and will reach the end of their life around 2020. With the average nuclear plant running for 8,000 hours a year versus 1,500-2,000 hours for a solar plant, governments must expand renewable investments to replace old nuclear plants if they are to meet decarbonization targets, IEA Chief Economist Laszlo Varro told Reuters.  The ageing of the nuclear fleet is a considerable challenge for energy security and decarbonization objectives,  he said on the sidelines of the Eurelectric utilities conference in Portugal.  Renewables have grown rapidly in the past decade but about 20 percent of new low-carbon capacity has been lost from the decommissioning of nuclear plants in the same period, he said.  This is just a taste of thing to come,  Varro said. Russia and India were building new plants, while China was bringing a new plant online every quarter, Varro said. However, he said future projects in Japan were uncertain after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, while there was less appetite for new nuclear projects in Europe and the United States. Financing new nuclear plants has become more challenging, partly because several new builds were running over budget, while in the United States nuclear has been struggling to compete against plants run on cheap shale gas. Governments who chose the renewables route would have to consider upgrading power grids and invest in power storage to offset the variable nature of renewable generation, while those choosing nuclear would need to offer financial support as Britain has done for its plans, Varro said. Wind and solar generation was expanding rapidly, but the pace needed to increase to meet climate stabilization goals.  At the moment it is not quickly enough,  he said. The biggest challenge was in Europe and the United States, where nuclear energy capacity was steady or falling, he said.  If we do not keep nuclear in the energy mix and do not accelerate wind and solar deployment, the loss of nuclear capacity will knock us back by 15 to 20 years. We do not have that much time to lose,  he said. Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclear-carbon-iea-idUSKBN19C1UL"},

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday existing home sales increased 1.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.62 million units last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales declining 0.5 percent to a rate of 5.55 million units. Sales were up 2.7 percent from May 2016. The number of homes on the market rose 2.1 percent, but supply was down 8.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 24 straight months on a year-on-year basis. The median house price increased to an all-time high of $252,800, a 5.8 percent jump from one year ago, reflecting the dearth of properties on the market.  We have a housing shortage, we may even use the term housing crisis in some markets,  NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.  House price gains have also been helped by an unemployment rate that is at a 16-year low. Mortgage rates also remain favorable by historical standards. At the current sales rate, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.7 months one year ago. The median number of days homes were on the market in May was 27, the shortest time frame since NAR began tracking data in 2011. Despite robust demand for housing, the sector has shown some recent signs of strain.

Nuclear is now the largest low-carbon power source in Europe and the United States, about three times bigger than wind and solar combined, according to IEA data. But most reactors were built in the 1970s and early 80s, and will reach the end of their life around 2020. With the average nuclear plant running for 8,000 hours a year versus 1,500-2,000 hours for a solar plant, governments must expand renewable investments to replace old nuclear plants if they are to meet decarbonization targets, IEA Chief Economist Laszlo Varro told Reuters.  The ageing of the nuclear fleet is a considerable challenge for energy security and decarbonization objectives,  he said on the sidelines of the Eurelectric utilities conference in Portugal.  Renewables have grown rapidly in the past decade but about 20 percent of new low-carbon capacity has been lost from the decommissioning of nuclear plants in the same period, he said.  This is just a taste of thing to come,  Varro said. Russia and India were building new plants, while China was bringing a new plant online every quarter, Varro said. However, he said future projects in Japan were uncertain after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, while there was less appetite for new nuclear projects in Europe and the United States. Financing new nuclear plants has become more challenging, partly because several new builds were running over budget, while in the United States nuclear has been struggling to compete against plants run on cheap shale gas. Governments who chose the renewables route would have to consider upgrading power grids and invest in power storage to offset the variable nature of renewable generation, while those choosing nuclear would need to offer financial support as Britain has done for its plans, Varro said. Wind and solar generation was expanding rapidly, but the pace needed to increase to meet climate stabilization goals.  At the moment it is not quickly enough,  he said. The biggest challenge was in Europe and the United States, where nuclear energy capacity was steady or falling, he said.  If we do not keep nuclear in the energy mix and do not accelerate wind and solar deployment, the loss of nuclear capacity will knock us back by 15 to 20 years. We do not have that much time to lose,  he said. Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/nuclear-carbon-iea-idUSL8N1JI3LF"},

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday existing home sales increased 1.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.62 million units last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales declining 0.5 percent to a rate of 5.55 million units. Sales were up 2.7 percent from May 2016. The number of homes on the market rose 2.1 percent, but supply was down 8.4 percent from a year ago. Housing inventory has dropped for 24 straight months on a year-on-year basis. The median house price increased to an all-time high of $252,800, a 5.8 percent jump from one year ago, reflecting the dearth of properties on the market.  We have a housing shortage, we may even use the term housing crisis in some markets,  NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.  House price gains have also been helped by an unemployment rate that is at a 16-year low. Mortgage rates also remain favorable by historical standards. At the current sales rate, it would take 4.2 months to clear inventory, down from 4.7 months one year ago. The median number of days homes were on the market in May was 27, the shortest time frame since NAR began tracking data in 2011. Despite robust demand for housing, the sector has shown some recent signs of strain.

Oil has lost 20 percent in value this year as a global oversupply continues to weigh on prices despite efforts by major producers to reduce output. Oil prices are on track for their biggest slide in the first half of any year since 1997. Brent crude pared early losses to trade slightly lower at $45.90, while U.S. crude was marginally up at $43.53 after Iran's oil minister said OPEC members were considering further output cuts. The downturn has hemorrhaged the S&P; energy index, making it the worst performing sector among the 11 major indexes this year. The index fell more than 13 percent during the period, while the S&P; 500 rallied 8.85 percent.  With oil entering the so-called bearish territory, the market is looking at the negatives of lower oil prices and not necessarily the benefits of lower oil prices,  said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial.  If oil prices continue to move lower, obviously that would be bad for inflation or even result in disinflation.  Investors are also mindful of the impact of inflation on the pace of future interest rate hikes, with a tug-of-war between inflation and the future of financial stability playing out among the Federal Reserve's policymakers. Dallas and Chicago Fed chiefs Robert Kaplan and Charles Evans expressed concerns regarding weak inflation, which remains stubbornly below the central bank's 2 percent target. Both Kaplan and Evans are voting members on the Fed's rate-setting committee. However, Boston Fed head Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making. At 9:41 a.m. ET (1341 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.93 points, or 0.02 percent, at 21,463.21, the S&P; 500 was up 1.36 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,438.39 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 19.07 points, or 0.31 percent, at 6,207.10. Eight of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the financial index's 0.36 percent fall leading the decliners. Healthcare led the three gainers, with a rise of 0.65 percent. UnitedHealth and Johnson and Johnson rose about 0.5 percent and were among the biggest boosts on the Dow. Adobe Systems was up 3.4 percent at $145.71 after the software forecast current-quarter above analysts' estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,250 to 1,231. On the Nasdaq, 1,310 issues rose and 886 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-idUSL3N1JI431"},

U.S. crude        prices were up 0.09 percent at $43.55 a barrel. Oil is one of Canada's major exports.            At 9:37 a.m. EDT (1337 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3301 to the greenback, or 75.18 U.S. cents, down 0.3 percent.     The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3263, while it touched its weakest since Thursday at C$1.3304.     The Bank of Canada's top two officials said last week that rate cuts put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates need to be kept at near-record lows.                  If the Bank of Canada caught markets by surprise last week in laying the groundwork for interest rate hikes, it may have been because traders missed - or ignored - signals the central bank was already sending.                  Canadian government bond prices were mixed across a flatter yield curve, with the two-year            down 2 Canadian cents to yield 0.921 percent and the 10-year             rising 2 Canadian cents to yield 1.498 percent.     The Bank of Canada will auction C$3 billion of 10-year bonds on behalf of the federal government. The bidding deadline is 12 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT).     Falling oil prices have helped support Canadian government bonds and  should support today's auction,  Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a research note.

The ratings are programme ratings and apply only to senior unsecured issuance whose terms Fitch believes to be commensurate with non-preferred treatment under Germany's revised resolution regime in force since 1 January 2017. There is no assurance that notes issued under the programme will be assigned a rating, or that the rating assigned to a specific issue under the programme will have the same rating as the programme rating. KEY RATING DRIVERS SENIOR NON-PREFERRED DEBT RATINGS The programme ratings are driven by and equalised with SCB AG's Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of 'A-'/'F2'. Fitch views that the likelihood of default on senior unsecured notes under this programme would reflect the likelihood of default of the bank. SCB AG's IDRs are driven by the bank's Viability Rating (VR) of 'a-', and by institutional support because it is our view that, if needed, SCB AG would benefit from strong support from its ultimate parent, Banco Santander, S.A. (Santander, A-/Stable/F2/a-). As Santander's main operating subsidiary in Germany SCB AG is deeply integrated within the operations of its intermediate parent Santander Consumer Finance, S.A. (SCF, A-/Stable/F2/bbb+). The VR reflects SCB AG's solid business model and franchise in Germany, which result in strong pricing power and adequate risk-pricing, and considerable flexibility to mitigate earnings pressure from a low interest-rate environment. RATING SENSITIVITIES SENIOR NON-PREFERRED DEBT RATINGS The ratings are primarily sensitive to changes in SCB AG's IDRs. A downgrade of SCB AG's IDRs could be driven either by a downgrade of Santander's or SCF's IDRs or by a weakening propensity of institutional support. The latter could be signalled, for example, by the sale of a significant stake in SCB AG or if we believe that Santander no longer views SCB AG as a core entity. An upgrade of SCB AG's IDRs would require an upgrade of Santander's or SCF's Long-Term IDRs accompanied by either a continued very strong propensity to support SCB AG or an upgrade of SCB AG's VR. An upgrade of SCB AG's VR would require major revenue diversification and sustainable strengthening of the bank's capital and liquidity buffers. A downgrade of the VR could result from excessive growth, a failure to maintain an adequate risk-return profile in mortgage and SME lending, strong margin pressure in consumer finance, severe deterioration of German households' creditworthiness triggering significant asset quality pressure or sharp capital erosion due to insufficient capital injections from Santander.

New York Fed President William Dudley and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren both took the view this week that keeping interest rates low may pose risks to the economy.                               “I think the market may be pricing in a little higher odds of another rate hike before the end of the year, and that is helping drive some of the flattening,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.     Five-year note yields           , which are highly sensitive to rate policy, rose to a four-week high of 1.80 percent on Tuesday. They last traded at 1.78 percent.     Thirty-year bond yields            , which are largely driven by future expectations of growth and inflation, meanwhile dropped to 2.72 percent on Wednesday, the lowest since Nov. 9.     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                flattened to 96 basis points, the narrowest since December 2007.     With no major economic data due this week investors were focused on Fed speakers.     Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell will speak on Thursday and Friday. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also due to speak on Friday.     Hawkish comments from the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane were also seen as hurting short-term bonds on Wednesday.     Haldane said he would likely vote for a rate hike later this year, striking a more hawkish tone than BoE Governor Mark Carney and adding to signs of a split at the central bank.

But prospects for a clean early resolution to the sale of the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash chips remain unclear as Western Digital (WDC.O), Toshiba's chips business partner, has launched legal action to prevent a deal without its consent. The consortium has offered around 2 trillion yen, a Toshiba spokesman said. Bain plans to be the biggest investor, providing 850 billion yen ($7.7 billion) in equity, three sources briefed on the matter said. The bid was less than a rival 2.2 trillion yen offer from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) and its partner U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. It was also hastily put together but has the implicit stamp of approval from the Japanese government which is keen to keep key semiconductor technology under domestic control. Toshiba cannot afford to ignore the government because it needs its help with plans including the decommissioning of domestic nuclear power plants and as overseas nuclear power projects are currently in limbo after the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear unit. Some analysts believe that talks over the hotly contested deal have become so complex that only a government-orchestrated  solution is viable, but others doubt that the group will provide the necessary leadership the chip unit needs.  There are many parties involved in this consortium,  said  Atsushi Osanai, a professor at Waseda University Business School. Related CoverageBain to be biggest investor in Toshiba chip unit, putting up $7.7 billion: sourcesJapan trade ministry asks Western Digital to join Japan Government-Bain consortium for Toshiba chip unit: sources It has undergone so many twists and turns during its formation process, that I'm skeptical about whether it can promptly make bold decisions. In that sense, Broadcom or Foxconn would be better suited.  Toshiba said in a statement it took into consideration concern about technology transfers, job security for its domestic workforce and prospects of clearing regulatory reviews in its decision. While Bain will be the biggest investor, it will obtain around half the amount in financing from South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), the sources said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) will each provide 300 billion yen in equity, while the core banking unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T) will provide 550 billion yen in financing. FILE PHOTO - A logo of Toshiba Corp is seen on a printed circuit board in this photo illustration taken in Tokyo July 31, 2012.Yuriko Nakao/File PhotoThe numbers have yet to be finalised and are still subject to change, one of the sources said.   A representative for DBJ was not immediately available to comment. All other members of the consortium as well as Toshiba declined to comment on the details of the deal. In a Hurry  Toshiba is rushing to clinch an agreement by June 28, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. It needs to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. Following the announcement, Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, reasserted in a statement that Toshiba was in breach of their joint venture contracts and said that a U.S. court hearing on its request for an injunction was scheduled for July 14. Japan's trade ministry, which has arranged much of the winning bid, is in talks with Western Digital, trying to persuade it to join the consortium, two separate sources familiar with the matter said. But Western Digital is reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that high-level technology for NAND chips, which provide long-term data storage, could be leaked to rival SK Hynix, they added. SK Hynix said it had joined the consortium because it sees new business opportunities with the deal. Although the South Korean chip maker is strong in DRAM chips, which help electronic devices perform multiple tasks at once, it is relatively weak in NAND.  Suitors that lost out refrained from comment on Wednesday. A representative for Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment. Silver Lake declined to comment. Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker which also bid, did not respond to requests for comment. Formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), the Taiwanese firm's consortium includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and computing giant Dell Inc. Toshiba's shares ended 2 percent lower. They are down about 30 percent since problems at Westinghouse surfaced late last year but have come some way off lows as talks about the chip unit sale progressed.

The RBI voted 5-1 to keep the repo rate at 6.25 percent earlier this month, but issued a slightly less hawkish statement after consumer inflation eased to 2.99 percent in April, below its 4 percent target. Ravindra H. Dholakia, a professor who is one of three non-RBI members, was the lone dissenter, voting to lower the repo rate by 50 basis points by strongly arguing that inflation had eased enough to justify a rate cut. The vote marked the first non-unanimous decision in the five meetings since the MPC was formed last September. However, the rest of the panel, including Governor Urjit Patel, wanted more evidence that inflation would ease, while expressing concern that prices would accelerate later this year.  Considering the high uncertainty clouding the near-term inflation outlook, there is a need to avoid premature policy action at this stage,  Patel said, according to the minutes.  There is also a need to be alert to elements that may have a significant influence on the inflation outcome over the medium-term.  The RBI's caution contrasts with the views of some investors and government officials, who want monetary stimulus to boost an economy that grew a slower-than-expected 6.1 percent in January-March. Such calls were given further impetus as data after the RBI's June 6-7 meeting showed inflation easing further to 2.18 percent in May, the lowest in at least five years. That would place it at the lower end of the RBI's projection of 2 to 3.5 percent in April to September. India will post one more inflation data next month before the next policy meeting on Aug. 1-2. MPC members acknowledged positive factors such as easing crude and commodity prices, but reiterated concerns on risks such as elevated inflation expectations and core inflation, in line with its June statement. Scheduled government pay hikes, increases in minimum purchase prices for agricultural products and higher spending because of loan waivers to distressed farmers were other risks to inflation cited by MPC members. The RBI in June projected inflation could accelerate to 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in October-March, potentially above its 4 percent target. However, Dholakia, known for his dovish views, dissented strongly, arguing inflation would continue to ease because of factors such as good rainfalls, and wanted to focus on boosting employment and reducing poverty.  Becoming too overcautious under such circumstances is against the principle of prudence,  Dholakia said.  I, therefore, strongly plead to the MPC to effect a 50 basis points cut in the policy rate without losing any time.

After May lost her majority in parliament with a botched gamble on a snap June 8 election, she is trying to secure the backing of the DUP's 10 lawmakers, though talks have dragged on for nearly two weeks. While the details are still to be thrashed out, a deal is considered likely. The DUP knows a deal with May is its best chance to secure extra cash for Northern Ireland while the Conservatives know that the DUP do not want risk a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn, who has appeared beside Sinn Fein leaders in the past. When asked whether a deal would be finalised this week, the DUP source said:  It does not look likely.   Talks are continuing,  said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. DUP sources said on Tuesday that May's party needed to give greater focus to discussions and added that the DUP could not be taken for granted. While the two parties are largely aligned on domestic issues and Brexit, the talks have snagged on the extent of financial support that Northern Ireland will get as part of any deal, according to sources. One issue that has caused friction in talks is air passenger duty - an excise duty on passengers flying from airports in the United Kingdom - which the DUP want to be scrapped so that Belfast can compete with Dublin's airport. In its manifesto, the DUP said it would pursue the abolition of air passenger duty and cut value added tax for tourism businesses.

Despite funding 31 million euros ($34.5 million) worth of projects in South and Southeast Asia between 2009 and 2015, the EU's vague objectives and a lack of local commitment meant the investments were not as effective as had been hoped, it said.  Trafficking in human beings is a highly profitable crime, a gross violation of human rights and a global security threat,  said Bettina Jakobsen of the European Court of Auditors.  The EU must better prioritize how and where it spends its available resources so that the level of activity matches its financial commitments,  she said in a statement.

Some of the problems highlighted - a lack of meetings with government in Indonesia and technical problems in Bangladesh. The Luxembourg-based European Court of Auditors, which oversees EU spending, said the EU should adjust its programs to suit local needs so as to improve their effectiveness.

Cindy was located about 165 miles (265 km) south of Morgan City, Louisiana, early on Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (95 km) per hour, the NHC said. The storm was moving northwest at nearly 8 miles (13 km) per hour, and forecasters said they expected this motion to continue until it hits the coast. Cindy was projected to produce 6 to 9 inches (15-23 cm) of rain that could reach up to 12 inches in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and cause  life-threatening flash flooding,  the NHC said.  It's a little stronger than it was yesterday, but the overall track is looking to be the same,  said Stephen Strum, vice president of extended forecast services at Weather Decision Technologies in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Rain will cause the biggest impact and fall most heavily from New Orleans to the Florida Panhandle, Strum added. After the storm moves inland, it will track into the Tennessee Valley so that flooding concerns will continue through the weekend. Heavy rains and wind could disrupt oil supplies at the massive refining and production centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could drive up prices for consumers. The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is along that coast, also home to 51 percent of total U.S. gas processing capability. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations ahead of the storm but said Tuesday it expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. Royal Dutch Shell said on Tuesday that it suspended some offshore well operations, but production was so far unaffected. Anadarko Petroleum Corp said it had evacuated non-essential staff from its Gulf of Mexico facilities. The storm could cause a surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) in isolated areas and possibly spawn tornados from southern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. Most meteorologists forecast this year will be more active than normal.

Even with Amazon’s 364-day loan, which is also the thirteenth largest in the past two decades, US bridge financing of about US$57bn this year is 21% lower than the same period last year, including deals closed and in process, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. As a result, fee income for banks arranging and syndicating the bridge facilities and longer-term funding is being squeezed. Bridges are usually replaced with permanent financing, including equity and bonds. “Everyone is hoping that Amazon/Whole Foods is the start of the next wave, but there’s no telling if that’s the case or if there won’t be anything else big until there’s more clarity around tax policy etc,” a senior banker said. Amazon.com said it expects to fund its US$13.7bn merger with debt that could include senior unsecured notes, term loans, bridge loans, or any combination, along with cash on hand. The Whole Foods acquisition, which according to Thomson Reuters ranks as the eleventh biggest global retail deal and the fourth biggest US retail deal on record, will help boost fee income for lenders at the tail end of a tough first half. Bridge financing so far this year roughly matches volume in the same period of 2015, and is the lowest since about US$31bn four years ago. Earlier this year, several high-profile insurance company mergers were scuttled by US antitrust rulings, and the lack of action on tax, trade and healthcare legislation is stifling the pace of new M&A;, bankers noted. Faster Takeout Some of this year’s borrowers are replacing bridges more quickly with permanent financing, expecting little regulatory scrutiny or opposition to their M&A; deals, several bankers and analysts said. At the same time, companies are taking advantage of ongoing lofty investor demand for bonds and other debt, and looking to lock in still low borrowing costs. “Given the robustness of the capital markets, and given the current situation with a lot of borrowers not having significant antitrust issues, borrowers have elected to hit the bond market immediately versus waiting a couple of months,” another banker said. “They feel good about closing their acquisitions, and there’s a quick takeout of the bridge.  The swifter pace of swapping from a bridge to bonds, as well as the reduced overall loan volume, is weighing on total fees earned by lending banks. Fee income from providing bridge loans is US$109m so far this year, a 47% slump from the same time last year, according to a Freeman Consulting Services analysis based on LPC data. The fees earned from arranging permanent financing on those loans have also declined, although more modestly, by around 21% to US$172m. US medical supplier Becton Dickinson’s US$15.7bn bridge loan to buy medical technology company C R Bard, this year’s largest US bridge financing, is an example of the quicker turnaround to longer-term debt. “The Becton Dickinson bond offering closed less than a month after the acquisition was announced and the bridge was arranged,” said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman. “In cases like this, bridge loan fees are likely to be relatively low. This trend is a primary reason why bridge loan fees have declined at a sharper pace than volumes in the last year.” (Reporting by Lynn Adler; Editing By Chris Mangham and Jon Methven)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-bridge-idUSL1N1JI0KV"},

Signs of a growing glut of supply sent Brent crude futures skidding back to $45.50 a barrel before talk of more OPEC cuts halted the slide and steadied government debt yields and Wall Street futures prices. Poorly performing banking stocks continued to hold down Europe's main markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt though they too were off their lows as energy firms began to recover. The earlier slide in energy costs had boosted bond prices and flattened yield curves as investors priced in lower inflation for longer, while safe-haven flows underpinned the Japanese yen. The spread between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds shrank to the smallest since 2007 as investors wagered the Federal Reserve might have to delay further rate hikes. Thirty-year German debt yields bonds also tumbled back towards two-month lows, adding to a more than 20-basis-point drop over the past month and ahead of what will now be a closely watched sale of 30-year debt in Berlin later. The recent setback for crude and commodity prices as well some equity markets is partly down to doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump's promised multi-trillion dollar stimulus programme, which had raised hopes of boosting inflation and growth.  Brent now the lowest since mid-November: remember that whole reflation thing? No, neither does the market,  Rabobank analysts told clients, referring to Brent crude futures, which have slid almost 10 percent this month. Oil had nudged its way back above $46 ahead of U.S. trading. It shed 2 percent on Tuesday, taking U.S. crude futures 20 percent off recent highs and thus into official bear territory, a red flag to investors who follow technical trends. It also meant oil was on course for its worst start to a year since 1991. In Asia there had been muted reaction to global index provider MSCI's decision to add the first batch of mainland Chinese stocks to its popular emerging equity benchmark. Indexes in Shanghai and Shenzen moved around 0.5 percent higher after the decision, which could ultimately bring $340 billion of foreign capital to the so-called A-share market. The commodity and bond market turbulence and falls in Europe pushed MSCI's all-country share index down 0.2 percent after its 0.7-percent slide on Tuesday compounded by a weak close on Wall Street . Joining the Club The acceptance of some Chinese  A  shares into MSCI's Emerging Markets Index was seen as a symbolic win for Beijing after three failed attempts. Yet the step is still a small one. Only 222 stocks are being included and, with a weighting of just 5 percent, they will account for only 0.73 percent of the Emerging Markets Index. MSCI estimated the change, due around the middle of next year, would drive inflows of between $17 billion and $18 billion. China's market cap is roughly $7 trillion. The index provider set out a laundry list of liberalisation requirements before it would consider further expansion.  We suspect that it will be a long time before this happens,  wrote analysts at Capital Economics.  While China's weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index may ultimately rise to 40 percent or so, this rise is likely to be slow.  The upshot is that any initial boost to equities is likely to be small.  MSCI also said it would consult on adding Saudi Arabia to the emerging markets benchmark and that Nigeria will remain a frontier market, but it shocked many emerging market investors by declining to upgrade Argentina from the frontier market category. In currency markets, the overnight flight from oil and into long-dated government bond benefited the safe-haven yen which climbed to 111.120 per dollar before running out of steam. Against a basket of currencies the dollar was steady at 97.736 having touched a five-week peak overnight. The euro stood at $1.1152 after hitting a three-week low, while sterling rallied as Bank of England's chief economist said he was likely to back an increase in interest rates a day after the bank's governor had said the time was not right. Having slid back under $1.26 and towards 90 percent per euro, the pound raced all the way back to $1.27 and 87.75 pence per euro.  If his opinion is shifting then that is potentially significant news for rates going forward,  said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London, adding Haldane has typically been one of the most dovish BoE members.

A sharp drop in inflation, which is well below the current target of 4.5 percent, has convinced the administration it needs to set a lower goal for 2019. Government officials, however, are still discussing whether to lower the target to 4.25 percent or a more aggressive 4.00 percent. The National Monetary Council, the country's top economic policy body made up by the finance and planing ministers and the central bank chief, is scheduled to decide on the 2019 target at its next meeting on June 29.  It is better to opt for a target that does not signal monetary policy decisions in the short-term,  said the official, adding that a majority in the economic team agrees with that view.  Its best to opt for a target that is closer to market expectations for that year.  Annual inflation at the end of 2019 is seen at 4.25 percent, according to a weekly central bank survey of economists. A target below 4.25 percent could prompt the central bank to significantly reduce the pace of interest rate cuts in coming months in order to lower inflation expectations. The official said that the council still has to monitor the evolution of inflation expectations before making a final decision. A second, lower-level official confirmed most members of the economic team preferred a moderate target cut. The central bank has already signaled it could dial back the pace of rate cuts amid a political crisis that threatens to unseat Temer and derail his austerity agenda to plug a widening fiscal deficit. A sharp drop in annual inflation, which hit a 10 year low of 3.60 percent in May, has pushed the central bank to cut 400 basis points from its benchmark Selic rate in less than a year. Economists polled by Reuters in late May were split on whether the central bank would opt for a symbolic inflation target cut to 4.25 percent or a more aggressive move to 4.0 or 3.5 percent. Both the finance minister and central bank declined to comment for the story, saying the decision will be taken next week by the council. The planing ministry did not respond to an email seeking comments. (Reporting by Alonso Soto; Editing by Bernard Orr)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-inflation-target-idUSL1N1JH222"},

PrivatBank was taken under state control with the backing of Ukraine's top creditor, the International Monetary Fund, after risky lending practices left it with a capital shortfall of more than $5.5 billion. The nationalisation has so far cost taxpayers $4.3 billion, but an Ernst and Young audit of the lender's 2016 annual report shows that, as forecast by the central bank, additional funds are needed to meet capital adequacy requirements, the sources said. This recapitalisation will be carried out in two steps: 22.5 billion hyrvnias will be injected soon after the audit is officially published and 16 billion hryvnias at a later stage, the source said. This will be a further burden on Ukraine's already strained public finances and will mean more has been spent on recapitalising PrivatBank since December than the annual defence budget amid a long-running conflict with Russia-backed rebels. The government will have to officially approve any additional capitalisation. The finance ministry, which is responsible for managing PrivatBank, could not immediately be reached for comment. Earlier this year the central bank said almost all PrivatBank's corporate loans had gone to insider companies and former shareholders, who include powerful tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, Ukraine's fifth richest man. Kolomoisky has rejected the central bank's assessment of the health of PrivatBank's loan portfolio and accused the regulator of unfairly targeting the bank. Reducing PrivatBank's lending to shareholders was one of the tasks mandated by the IMF under a $17.5 billion aid-for-reforms bailout programme. PrivatBank failed to meet the deadline and its nationalisation became the culmination of a broader banking sector cleanup, which closed dozens of lenders that were seen as little more than personal piggy banks for their owners. Kolomoisky's control of strategic industries, including energy and media holdings, has put him at the centre of ongoing power battles among the political elite since street protests ousted Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich and the pro-Russian rebellion erupted in the east.

The delivery, a sign of improved relations between Hamas and Egypt after years of friction, was the first official import of Egyptian diesel to Gaza since Hamas took over the enclave in 2007 and could provide seven hours of power for three days.     Fuel from Egypt used to be smuggled through tunnels, many of them now destroyed by Cairo, which said they were conduits for weapons and militants battling Egyptian forces in the neighboring Sinai peninsula - an allegation denied by Hamas. Gaza's power plant has been off-line for two months due to a payment dispute between the Palestinian Authority, based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Gaza's Hamas Islamist rulers. The Palestinian Authority has cut payments for its Israeli electricity supply, arguing that Hamas is not reimbursing its share of the cost, and Israel has therefore cut the power supply by almost a third.  A Palestinian man walks as fuel tankers enter Gaza's power plant through the Rafah border between Egypt and southern Gaza Strip June 21, 2017.Ibraheem Abu MustafaDiesel tankers, flying the Egyptian and Palestinian flags, crossed into Gaza two days after the Israeli supply cuts began. Slideshow (5 Images)The imports were agreed at talks in Cairo this month between Gaza's Hamas chief, Yehya Al-Sinwar, and Egyptian security officials. Sources close to those negotiations said the deal was also facilitated by Mohammad Dahlan, a Fatah rival of Abbas living in Abu Dhabi.   Any worsening of the energy crisis could cause the collapse of health services, local health officials said. Hospitals largely rely on generators for power, as do Gaza residents who can afford the high cost of fuel to run them. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's decision to cut the payments was coupled with calls from Palestinian officials for Hamas to relinquish control of Gaza, which Hamas seized from fighters loyal to Abbas's Fatah movement in 2007.     The one million liters (264,000 gallons) in the shipment on Wednesday could be followed by another one million liter delivery later in the day or on Thursday, the Hamas-appointed deputy finance minister in Gaza, Youssef al-Kayali, said.

The action by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) marks a milestone in Asia's third-biggest economy, which allowed futures trading in commodities since 2003. But it will still keep out foreign investors, banks, mutual funds and other institutions from investing in derivatives. The move to open up to category III AIFs, licenses that are mainly granted to hedge funds, could expand liquidity in the market, thus providing companies more hedging opportunities and improving price discovery. Category III AIFs may participate in all commodity derivative products, but will not be able to invest more than 10 percent of the investable funds in one underlying commodity, SEBI said in a statement. These investors will also be allowed to use leverage, SEBI said.  The commodity derivatives markets in India lack the desired liquidity and depth for efficient price discovery and price risk management,  SEBI said. Market participants such as National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Ltd welcomed SEBI's plan given volumes in Indian commodity futures have fallen to 67 trillion rupees ($1.04 trillion) in 2015/16 from 170 trillion rupees in 2012/13.  The presence of AIFs, will spur the infusion of research based information, capital, innovation and new trading strategies in India's commodity markets,  Mrugank Paranjape, managing director of Multi Commodity Exchange Of India Ltd . Goldman Sachs Investments (Mauritius), Blackstone GPV Capital, Matthews Asia Growth Fund and InterContinental Exchange (ICE) are among foreign investors that hold stakes in Indian commodity exchanges, which would benefit from increased trading. The move to open up commodity derivatives to hedge funds will now raise hopes India will gradually open commodity markets to other participants. SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi took over in March, pledging to make developing commodity markets a key plank of his tenure.  The market regulator has opened window for institutional investors.

The delivery, a sign of improved relations between Hamas and Egypt after years of friction, was the first official import of Egyptian diesel to Gaza since Hamas took over the enclave in 2007 and could provide seven hours of power for three days.     Fuel from Egypt used to be smuggled through tunnels, many of them now destroyed by Cairo, which said they were conduits for weapons and militants battling Egyptian forces in the neighboring Sinai peninsula - an allegation denied by Hamas. Gaza's power plant has been off-line for two months due to a payment dispute between the Palestinian Authority, based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Gaza's Hamas Islamist rulers. The Palestinian Authority has cut payments for its Israeli electricity supply, arguing that Hamas is not reimbursing its share of the cost, and Israel has therefore cut the power supply by almost a third.  A Palestinian man walks as fuel tankers enter Gaza's power plant through the Rafah border between Egypt and southern Gaza Strip June 21, 2017.Ibraheem Abu MustafaDiesel tankers, flying the Egyptian and Palestinian flags, crossed into Gaza two days after the Israeli supply cuts began. Slideshow (5 Images)The imports were agreed at talks in Cairo this month between Gaza's Hamas chief, Yehya Al-Sinwar, and Egyptian security officials. Sources close to those negotiations said the deal was also facilitated by Mohammad Dahlan, a Fatah rival of Abbas living in Abu Dhabi.   Any worsening of the energy crisis could cause the collapse of health services, local health officials said. Hospitals largely rely on generators for power, as do Gaza residents who can afford the high cost of fuel to run them. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's decision to cut the payments was coupled with calls from Palestinian officials for Hamas to relinquish control of Gaza, which Hamas seized from fighters loyal to Abbas's Fatah movement in 2007.     The one million liters (264,000 gallons) in the shipment on Wednesday could be followed by another one million liter delivery later in the day or on Thursday, the Hamas-appointed deputy finance minister in Gaza, Youssef al-Kayali, said.

There was no word of casualties in the incident at  Pigcawayan town, which is about 190 km (120 miles) south of Marawi City, where fighting between government troops and pro-Islamic State militants has entered its fifth week.  The enemy made a hasty withdrawal, leaving behind 31 hostages, among them 12 youngsters,  Brigadier General Restituto Padilla told Reuters.      He said another 20 civilians who were trapped in the area because of the crossfire were also rescued. Police said about 300 armed men from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) stormed the school early on Wednesday. Padilla, however, said later only about 50 militants were involved. Related CoveragePhilippines says school hostage drama over, 31 captives freedMilitary officials were initially not certain if any hostages were taken and whether they included children. Community leaders in the area were called in to help in negotiations to rescue the hostages, Padilla said.  It's over ... but we're also on guard because they might carry out other attacks,  said Padilla.

Asked earlier if they would be freed, Mama said:  Yes. We're not kidnappers.  Slideshow (5 Images)Both Pigcawayan and Marawi are on the large southern island of Mindanao. Some members of the BIFF have joined fighters from two more powerful Islamist factions, the Maute group and Abu Sayyaf, who occupied the town of Marawi a month ago and have been battling government forces there since. But Padilla said the incident at Pigcawayan was not related to the fighting in Marawi.  This has come from a group that has long committed harassments,  he said. The seizure of Marawi and the dogged resistance by the rebels there who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State has alarmed Southeast Asian countries.

(Reuters) - Georgia Republican Karen Handel won the most expensive congressional race in history on Tuesday, avoiding a Democratic upset in a race that was widely seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump. By a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent, the former Georgia secretary of state defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff, a political newcomer who sought to wrest control of a suburban Atlanta district that has elected Republicans to Congress since the 1970s.       The election will not significantly change the balance of power in Washington, where Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress. But it could give Republicans a boost in confidence as they struggle to advance health and tax legislation that has been bogged down by infighting and investigations into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in last year's presidential election. Handel said at her victory rally that she knew it was going to  require all hands on deck  for Republicans to hold on to the district.  Tonight I stand before you, extraordinarily humbled and honored at the tremendous privilege and high responsibility that you ... have given me,  Handel told a boisterous crowd that chanted Trump's name. Ossoff and Handel both tried to focus on local issues and avoided mentioning Trump, whose approval rating sits at 37 percent, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.  But that did not stop Trump from weighing in on Twitter, urging voters to support Handel before the election and celebrating her victory afterward.  Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you!  he posted Tuesday night. Karen Handel, Republican candidate for Georgia's 6th Congressional District, makes an appearance before supporters prior to giving her acceptance speech at her election night party at the Hyatt Regency at Villa Christina in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 20, 2017.Bita HonarvarSpending on the race reached at least $57 million, nearly twice the previous record, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. The special election was held to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price after Trump appointed him as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats celebrated the fact that they had turned a conservative stronghold into a competitive district.  We showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible we could fight (that) we could fight,  Ossoff told supporters. Slideshow (14 Images)But the defeat was sure to prompt soul-searching in a party that is shut out of power in Washington and has steadily lost influence at the state level in recent years. Despite spending more than $30 million, Ossoff lost the district by a wider margin than Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Democrats also lost a special election in neighboring South Carolina on Tuesday, where Republican Ralph Norman easily prevailed over Democrat Archie Parnell in a seat formerly held by Republican Mick Mulvaney, who is now serving as Trump's budget director. Democrats are 0 for 4 in congressional elections this year, having earlier lost races to fill vacant seats in Kansas and Montana.  All the Fake News, all the money spent = 0,  Trump wrote on Twitter. Republicans, meanwhile, can now breathe a sigh of relief with the knowledge that they can still win in the kind of affluent, educated districts that often favor Democrats - even with a president who has divided voters in their own party.   Do I agree 100 percent with what he does? God, no. But I believe he has the country's best interests at heart,  said Jessica Podalsky, who voted for Handel on Tuesday morning.

Oil has lost 20 percent in value this year as a global oversupply continues to weigh on prices despite efforts by producers to reduce output. Brent crude and U.S. crude futures pared some losses and were up about 0.4 percent. Brent was trading at $46.18, while U.S. crude was at $43.72. The downturn has hemorrhaged the S&P; energy index, making it the worst performing sector among the 11 major indexes this year. The index fell 13.52 percent during the period, while the S&P; 500 rallied 8.85 percent.  With oil entering the so-called bearish territory, the market is looking at the negatives of lower oil prices and not necessarily the benefits of lower oil prices,  said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial.  If oil prices continue to move lower, obviously that would be bad for inflation or even result in disinflation.  Investors are also mindful of the impact of inflation on the pace of future interest rate hikes, with a tug-of-war between inflation and the future of financial stability playing out among the Federal Reserve's policymakers. Dallas and Chicago Fed chiefs Robert Kaplan and Charles Evans expressed concerns regarding weak inflation, which remains stubbornly below the central bank's 2 percent target. Both Kaplan and Evans are voting members on the Fed's rate-setting committee. However, Boston Fed head Eric Rosengren said that the era of low interest rates in the United States and elsewhere poses financial stability risks and that central bankers must factor such concerns into their decision-making. Dow e-minis were up 4 points, or 0.02 percent, with 28,423 contracts changing hands at 8:29 a.m. ET (1229 GMT). S&P; 500 e-minis were down 1 points, or 0.04 percent, with 185,742 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 7.5 points, or 0.13 percent, on volume of 46,814 contracts. U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday, hurt by a sharp drop in oil prices while retail stocks were pulled down by concerns about Amazon.com's plan to boost its apparel business and a rebound in tech stocks petered out. The S&P; technology sector, the main driver of the S&P;'s rally this year, has been hit by concerns over valuation and investors' move into more defensive sectors. Among stocks, Adobe Systems was up 4.4 percent at $147.11 in premarket trading after the software forecast current-quarter above analysts' estimates.

The news follows a string of initiatives by the seller marketplace to catch up to e-commerce rivals, and ultimately set itself apart as a haven for finding treasures online rather than commodity products. In the fall, eBay will guarantee three-day delivery for tens of millions of items for the first time - a logistical feat that Amazon.com Inc has already mastered. EBay has also shifted away from its former core - online auctions - toward fixed-price sales in line with big retailers. Now, eBay will guarantee that the roughly 50,000 new products on its Deals site will be at least as cheap as identical items sold by Amazon, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and other major retailers on the web. Shoppers must contact eBay's customer service team about relevant price disparities to receive a coupon they can apply at checkout. The move may be a jab at Amazon, which cut back on price-matching last year.  Consumers are still very price conscious,  said Hal Lawton, senior vice president of North America at eBay, in an interview.  Post 2009 and 2010, value just became an even stronger consideration for where they shop and what they buy. That really hasn’t waned even though the economy has strengthened.  EBay Deals accounts for more than $1 billion of the company's annual gross merchandise volume — the total value of all goods sold on its websites. Gross merchandise volume for its marketplace was $79.4 billion in 2016.

What got me excited about OpenFin is how they're making technology work across our industry to increase security and speed,  Walker said in an interview.  Walker, who left Goldman in 2016 after 15 years, also pushed for greater cooperation among the banking industry to make financial operations faster and more efficient, including technologies like blockchain.

There was no word of casualties in the incident at  Pigcawayan town, which is about 190 km (120 miles) south of Marawi City, where fighting between government troops and pro-Islamic State militants has entered its fifth week.  The enemy made a hasty withdrawal, leaving behind 31 hostages, among them 12 youngsters,  Brigadier General Restituto Padilla told Reuters.      He said another 20 civilians who were trapped in the area because of the crossfire were also rescued. Police said about 300 armed men from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) stormed the school early on Wednesday. Padilla, however, said later only about 50 militants were involved.

Community leaders in the area were called in to help in negotiations to rescue the hostages, Padilla said.

Asked earlier if they would be freed, Mama said:  Yes. We're not kidnappers.  Slideshow (5 Images)Both Pigcawayan and Marawi are on the large southern island of Mindanao. Some members of the BIFF have joined fighters from two more powerful Islamist factions, the Maute group and Abu Sayyaf, who occupied the town of Marawi a month ago and have been battling government forces there since. But Padilla said the incident at Pigcawayan was not related to the fighting in Marawi.  This has come from a group that has long committed harassments,  he said. The seizure of Marawi and the dogged resistance by the rebels there who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State has alarmed Southeast Asian countries. Government fear Islamic State, on a backfoot in Iraq and Syria, is trying to set up a stronghold in the Muslim south of the mainly Roman Catholic Philippines that could threaten the whole region.

The proposals are part of new legislation the government is putting forward to deal with any future banking crisis.  These contribution requirements are somewhat higher than the current contribution level, but on par with contributions paid in 2010, relative to the size of the banking sector,  the Finance Ministry said in a statement.  In accordance with the directives, the Ministry also proposes that the contributions shall be adjusted in proportion to the risk profile of each institution,  it said. Banking lobby Finance Norway criticised the proposal, estimating it would increase payments by 300 million-400 million Norwegian crowns ($35.15 million-$46.87 million), and arguing instead that payments should be capped at current levels. The new legislation also includes a so-called bail-in mechanism, allowing regulators to convert debt to equity to help prevent a bank from defaulting on its obligations.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said its board had decided to impose a fee of $1,000 every three years, starting from April 1 this year, on each offshore derivative instrument (ODI) subscriber to be collected by the issuer. SEBI also said it would prohibit ODIs that track derivatives except for those issued for hedging purposes, in a statement issued at the conclusion of its quarterly board meeting - sticking closely to draft proposals it issued last month. At the same time, the regulator proposed easing some rules for foreign portfolio investors, including expanding the eligible jurisdictions for registration under this category to more countries with diplomatic tie-ups with India. The change is intended to steer more funds to register as foreign portfolio investors instead of investing through ODIs that track Indian assets, which are harder to oversee for Indian regulators. India has long been suspicious of offshore instruments, such as participatory-notes, or P-notes, because of fears these investments are a conduit for money laundering or the channelling of unaccounted wealth held by Indians abroad into domestic markets. SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi said the goal was not to get rid of products such as P-notes but to provide more regulation and  to make sure that Indian and NRIs (non-resident Indians) don't use that route for investing in India .  The idea is not at all to ban it but to tighten it,  he said at a news briefing. ODIs such as P-Notes were once a popular way to invest in India but they have decreased in popularity as India has eased norms for direct investment. Among other actions on Wednesday, the SEBI also relaxed rules for investors buying distressed companies from banks in an effort to help resolve the country's massive bad debt problem. Investors interested in acquiring companies where banks have swapped part of their loans with equity would not need to make a mandatory open offer provided they were willing to abide with a three-year lock-in and get shareholder approval, SEBI said. SEBI also said it would review the derivatives market and consult stakeholders, without providing further details. Tyagi noted at the briefing the regulator had become concerned about the size of the derivatives market relative to cash markets. Separately, the regulator said it would allow category III alternative investment funds (AIFs), such as hedge funds, to invest in the commodity derivative markets, with some conditions.

BMC's bid for CA, which has a market capitalization of more than $13 billion, would require a large financing package and equity financing from BMC's private equity owners, Bain Capital and Golden Gate Capital, the source said on Tuesday. The source cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. CA and BMC could not immediately be reached for comment. Bain Capital and Golden Gate declined to comment.

Centrica, parent firm of British Gas, sees zero growth potential from traditional energy supply and power generation into the middle of the next decade. Instead, it wants to expand in home services, which includes selling tools to detect boiler breakdowns and the Hive smart thermostat. It also is looking to grow in distributed energy production that offers faster ways of generating electricity and helps businesses better manage their energy needs. Centrica said it expects its Connected Home and Distributed Energy & Power units to break even by 2019 and for revenue by 2022 to increase ten-fold from just 200 million pounds last year.  We must turn ourselves into a 21st century energy and services company,  Chief Executive Iain Conn told analysts on Wednesday. As part of this move, Centrica on Wednesday announced the sale of its two biggest gas-fired power plants to Czech peer EPH for 318 million pounds ($401 million). Centrica's Langage and South Humber power plants, which jointly employ around 130 people, have an installed capacity of 2.3 gigawatts (GW). Centrica's shares were up 2.9 percent at 1119 GMT, making it the second-biggest gainer on London's FTSE 100 bluechip index. Two weeks ago it sold its Canadian oil and gas assets and on Tuesday Centrica also announced the closure of its Rough gas storage site, Britain's largest. In total, Centrica has raised over 900 million pounds from divestments of traditional assets, in line with a 2015 target to divest up to 1 billion pounds worth of assets. Centrica's diversification reflects low power prices, rising renewables and other factors which have also forced European peers to adopt new business models. Germany's RWE and E.ON have each split off their retail, networks and renewables businesses. $1 = 0.7880 pounds Editing by David Goodman and Jason Neely","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/centrica-disposal-idUSL8N1JI0X1"},

Under the draft law, proposed by the European Commission on Wednesday, tax advisers including the Big Four accounting firms, banks and lawyers, would be required to inform authorities about  potentially aggressive tax planning arrangements  set up for their clients. Britain, Ireland and Portugal have already introduced penalties for intermediaries favouring tax avoidance but the new law would apply across the EU, although penalties would be decided by national governments. In Britain, the measure was recently introduced and is estimated to have reduced tax avoidance by  over 12 billion pounds  ($15.2 billion), EU tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici told a news conference. Schemes involving transactions to tax-free jurisdictions, such as Jersey, Guernsey or the Cayman Islands, would have to be reported. The new disclosure obligation would also cover cross-border arrangements whereby companies may shift tax liabilities to EU countries with  preferential tax regimes . The planned legislation is part of a set of measures adopted by the European Union after last year's Panama Papers and other revelations of widespread tax avoidance by wealthy individuals and big companies through carefully constructed schemes. EU officials said examples of preferential regimes would include a tax rebate offered by Malta to foreign-owned companies, which can slash the tax rate to as low as 5 percent; patent box regimes in several EU countries that allow firms to pay less tax on intellectual property revenues; or cross-border tax incentives for specific industries. Tax planning schemes benefiting from these arrangements present  a strong indication of tax avoidance or abuse  and therefore would need to be reported to the tax authorities, the European Commission said. However, EU officials stressed that this does not automatically mean that these arrangements were illegal. The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), a global body, welcomed the proposal as a way to curb abusive tax planning but warned against the risk of a flood of disclosures.  The fear of inadvertent non-compliance and the penalties that will result may drive some tax professionals to over-disclose, just to be on the safe side,  Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at ACCA, said stressing that an excess of information could make the fight against tax avoidance less effective. But some EU lawmakers saw the proposal as having little relevance in tackling tax avoidance. Markus Ferber, a German lawmaker of the European People's Party, the largest in the legislature, said it  will not be a game-changer .  The EU is just not credible as long as there are inner-European tax havens and some member states keep systematically undermining their neighbours' tax base,  he said, adding that tax advisers were likely to avoid disclosure by citing their professional discretion obligations. The draft law dictates  effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties  for non-compliance, but leaves EU states free to decide sanctions or fines at national level. EU leftist lawmaker Fabio De Masi called for tougher sanctions, including the removal of business licences for advisers promoting aggressive tax planning. Under the new law, if there is no intermediary, or the tax adviser is located outside the EU, the obligation of disclosure would fall on the taxpayer using the arrangement. The proposal will need the approval of the European Parliament and all EU states to become law. Some EU states have shown little appetite to move fast in the fight against tax avoidance, saying it could hamper the competitiveness of European companies.

Less than a month after U.S. President Donald Trump called Germany's trade and spending policies  very bad , Merkel used an  appearance alongside veteran German-born U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger to stress that the transatlantic relationship was rooted in  joint convictions, values and understandings.  Merkel, who is seeking re-election for a fourth term in September, said the transatlantic relationship  does not focus on winners and losers, which could never work in the long-run.   It's more about balancing interests. It's more about achieving a win-win situation,  she added, invoking the post-war Marshall Plan with which Washington invested in Germany. Relations between Washington and Berlin have turned tense in recent weeks after differences on climate, trade and defense spilled over into a war of words in which a leading German politician called Trump  the destroyer of Western values . Merkel's words that close transatlantic ties brought benefits to all sides appeared to be a thinly-veiled response to Trump's comments and his approach to the relationship and trade ties in particular.  Kissinger said the new world order shaped by the United States with Europe after World War Two built  the edifice of the rules-based system of the contemporary order.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel attends the weekly cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany June 21, 2017.Stefanie LoosTrump's decision earlier this month to take the United States out of the Paris climate change pact is seen in Berlin as a rejection of a key plank of that rules-based system, which Germany regards as crucial for managing globalisation. Fractious Meeting Ahead Slideshow (2 Images)Merkel will host Trump and other G20 leaders at a July 7-8 summit that is shaping up to be a fractious meeting after he last month criticized NATO allies over their military spending and refused to endorse the global climate change accord. Last month, Trump also tweeted:  We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change . He made those comments a day after Merkel ramped up her doubts about the reliability of Washington as an ally. Merkel said it was important not to forget that George C. Marshall, the U.S. statesman after whom the Marshall Plan was named,  was convinced that good trade and a strong economy in Europe is good for American companies too .  Protectionism, isolationism impedes innovation and in the long-run this is disadvantageous for everybody especially for those who count on isolationism even if they use different terminology for this,  Merkel added, according an official translation into English of her remarks made in German.

Romania's ruling leftists overwhelmingly voted to oust Grindeanu's six-month-old government on Wednesday, opening the way for a new cabinet with a comfortable parliament majority over the next few weeks.      Some political uncertainties have dissipated ... the no confidence vote revealed that there is a parliamentary majority that can support a new government, theoretically,  said Ciprian Dascalu, chief economist at ING Bank in Bucharest.      The Social Democrat Party (PSD) and a coalition partner withdrew support for Grindeanu a week ago saying he had failed to roll out their governing programme, leaving his fate in the balance.     At 1217 GMT, the leu was 0.15 percent stronger on the day, off earlier session highs. However, recent falls still left the unit the worst performer in central Europe, down 1.2 percent since the start of the year. Other regional currencies also firmed.     The forint was a shade stronger, pulling back from a one-month-low caused by Tuesday's decision by the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to push more funds than expected from its three-month deposits into the economy to help cut borrowing costs.     The NBH, seen as the most dovish central bank in central Europe, also lowered its inflation forecasts for the next two years and affirmed its readiness to ease monetary conditions further if below-target inflation persists.      This supports our call of limited HUF appreciation potential going forward as the (NBH) will remain reluctant to end its expansionary monetary policy,  analysts at Raiffeisen Bank said in a note.      We would expect to see HUF underperforming its peers PLN (Polish zloty) and CZK (Czech crown) over the coming months as their central banks are expected to tighten monetary policy earlier.      Before Tuesday's policy meeting, analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the Hungarian base rate staying unchanged at least until the second quarter of 2019.     Czech central bank Governor Jiri Rusnok was quoted as saying on Wednesday that the strength of the crown, trading on the strong side of its former cap on its value at 27 to the euro, could be a reason for a slower rise in interest rates.      A currency dealer said the crown was likely to stay in a range between 26.150-26.450 in the coming days.

Hosszu, whose home city of Budapest hosts the World Aquatics Championship next month, spoke up after the international swimming body FINA recently introduced new restrictions to the annual World Cup pro series. One of the sport's biggest stars, Hosszu has honed her brand for years and cashed in on the pro circuit, raking in dozens of golds and prize money north of $300,000 in each of the past three seasons, while also collecting Olympic and World titles. Her dominance has been so strong that swimming insiders saw the rule changes - limiting the number of events each athlete can enter and mixing up events from contest to contest - as directed at her specifically.  The World Cup has huge potential, but the planned new rule changes are destructive and hypocritical,  Hosszu wrote on her Facebook page.  These rules are risking the future of our sport.  She said individuals' dominance was a fact of life in pro sports and should not be artificially weakened, noting this did not happen in pro basketball or tennis events.  Will the NBA limit one of its biggest stars, LeBron James, in his eighth participation in the big final next year? Will the ATP try to remind (Rafael) Nadal and (Roger) Federer that their time is over?  FILE PHOTO Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszu blows a bubble ring at a training session in Budapest, Hungary July 15, 2015.Laszlo Balogh/File photoBoycott? Hosszu recalled the 1973 boycott by professional tennis players who walked out of Wimbledon in protest after Yugoslavia's Nikola Pilic was not allowed to enter the contest because of a ban by his national association. FILE PHOTO  Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hosszu flips her hair at a training session in Budapest, Hungary July 15, 2015.Laszlo Balogh/File photoWithout calling for a boycott directly, she said:  We must learn from the boycott of Wimbledon... We have to stand up for what we believe in... Even the biggest, most prestigious event is worthless without the best athletes.  FINA declined to comment on Wednesday on Hosszu's remarks. Swim Vortex, a major swimming magazine, dismissed Hosszu's criticisms as self-serving after the rule changes, which were widely seen as trying to break her dominance to make the pro series more open and attractive to viewers. The magazine agreed FINA's sway over the sport could be reduced but said alternatives were already operational in the fledgling World Swimming Association and the Professional Swimmers' Association.  (They) are working on a new model for the future of swimming in consultation with athletes, coaches, officials, media and others,  it said.

Less than a month after U.S. President Donald Trump called Germany's trade and spending policies  very bad , Merkel used an  appearance alongside veteran German-born U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger to stress that the transatlantic relationship was rooted in  joint convictions, values and understandings.  Merkel, who is seeking re-election for a fourth term in September, said the transatlantic relationship  does not focus on winners and losers, which could never work in the long-run.   It's more about balancing interests. It's more about achieving a win-win situation,  she added, invoking the post-war Marshall Plan with which Washington invested in Germany. Relations between Washington and Berlin have turned tense in recent weeks after differences on climate, trade and defense spilled over into a war of words in which a leading German politician called Trump  the destroyer of Western values . Merkel's words that close transatlantic ties brought benefits to all sides appeared to be a thinly-veiled response to Trump's comments and his approach to the relationship and trade ties in particular.  Kissinger said the new world order shaped by the United States with Europe after World War Two built  the edifice of the rules-based system of the contemporary order.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel attends the weekly cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany June 21, 2017.Stefanie LoosTrump's decision earlier this month to take the United States out of the Paris climate change pact is seen in Berlin as a rejection of a key plank of that rules-based system, which Germany regards as crucial for managing globalisation. Fractious Meeting Ahead Slideshow (2 Images)Merkel will host Trump and other G20 leaders at a July 7-8 summit that is shaping up to be a fractious meeting after he last month criticized NATO allies over their military spending and refused to endorse the global climate change accord. Last month, Trump also tweeted:  We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change . He made those comments a day after Merkel ramped up her doubts about the reliability of Washington as an ally. Merkel said it was important not to forget that George C. Marshall, the U.S. statesman after whom the Marshall Plan was named,  was convinced that good trade and a strong economy in Europe is good for American companies too .  Protectionism, isolationism impedes innovation and in the long-run this is disadvantageous for everybody especially for those who count on isolationism even if they use different terminology for this,  Merkel added, according an official translation into English of her remarks made in German.

August Brent crude futures were flat at $46.02 a barrel by 1107 GMT, having fallen earlier to seven-month lows. U.S. crude futures for August delivery were up 4 cents at $43.55, having hit their lowest since September on Tuesday. So far this year, oil has lost 20 percent in value, its worst performance for the first six months of the year since 1997. Compliance with an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day from January reached its highest in May since the curbs were agreed last year.  The slide in oil prices seems to be unstoppable,  said Julius Baer commodities research analyst Carsten Menke.  The supply deal’s effectiveness is increasingly questioned. We believe that downside risks to oil prices from a (disorderly) and early unwinding have risen ... we still see prices trading sideways, spending more time in the high 40s than the low 50s as growing shale output and stagnant western-world oil demand undermine the Middle East's restriction efforts.  Data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed U.S. crude stockpiles last week had dropped more than forecast. Gasoline and distillate inventories rose. A government report on inventories is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday and the official figures often differ sharply from those of the industry group. OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers' compliance with the output deal reached 106 percent in May, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. That means they cut output by more than they were required to do. OPEC compliance with the curbs was 108 percent, while non-OPEC compliance was 100 percent, the source said. Another source confirmed compliance by all producers in May was 106 percent. While compliance is high, it is what went on before the production cut that counts, BMI Research said in a note.

The song, a cover of Simon and Garfunkel's  Bridge Over Troubled Water , also features performances from Leona Lewis, James Blunt and a large choir made up of local people, some of whom survived the blaze. Slideshow (2 Images)A total of 79 people died in the fire, which swept through the 24-storey Grenfell tower on June 14th. Many people are still unaccounted for and authorities have suggested that the death toll will continue to rise as rescue workers continue to search. The single is an initiative of pop impresario and TV talent show judge Simon Cowell. In a departure from the original version of the song, Cowell's version opens with grime artist Stormzy rapping:  That could have been me up there / waving my white plain tee up there , a reference to people trapped in the blaze. Reaction to the song on social media was generally positive, with Twitter user Sarah Styles saying the song was  absolutely beautiful , while user Amy Elizabeth said the song left her  covered in goosebumps . The song was made available for sale and radio play on Wednesday and Cowell tweeted that a video would premiere on British television that evening. All proceeds from the song are to go to the London Community Foundation.

The move by the Nordic region's biggest utility adds to the pressure on the  Big Six  UK suppliers, which are trying to fend off dozens of small competitors and face popular discontent over rising bills and the threat of state intervention in the market. Prime Minister Theresa May's government looks to have backed away from a promised cap on energy prices, but is still looking at ways to protect energy customers facing the poorest value tariffs, according to plans laid out in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday. Like France's Engie, which launched a UK home energy business last month, Vattenfall sees the British market as a useful testbed for services enabled by digital technology. Vattenfall already offers so-called connected home products such as remote heating devices in its Nordic markets and expects to roll out similar energy saving products in Britain. Many utilities hope these innovations, once rooted in the home, will help them build customer loyalty.  Some energy companies want to move away from selling energy, purely as a commodity which presents a risk of a race to the bottom in terms of price,  said Steve Jennings, who leads consultancy PwC's Power and Utilities Sector Practice in the UK. PWC estimates the UK connected home market could be worth around 3 billion pounds up to 2020, while British Gas owner Centrica on Wednesday said revenue from its connected home unit could reach 1 billion pounds by 2022. It gave the forecast as it announced the sale of its two biggest gas-fired power plants to Czech peer EPH for 318 million pounds ($401 million), pushing forward with its own plan to become a nimbler energy supplier. Vattenfall said it made the decision some two years ago to expand internationally, and that it was not concerned by the prospect of a UK price cap since iSupplyEnergy has well below the market average number of customers on more expensive standard tariffs.  We sympathise with the intention (behind a price cap),  said Martijn Hagens, Vattenfall Senior Vice president of customer solutions. Shares in Britain's two largest energy suppliers, Centrica and SSE are down 11 and 7 percent respectively since May first suggested possible market intervention last October. Britain's other big energy suppliers are E.ON, npower, EDF Energy and Iberdrola owned Scottish Power. Engie is also targeting Britain's connected home and services market.  The UK is a place where there is a lot of innovation,  Judith Hartmann, Engie Chief Financial Officer, told Reuters. To entice customers, Engie is offering a rollover promise, which commits it to switch households to the cheapest tariff available once fixed-term contracts run out.

Under a proposed law, the minimum penalty will be raised to eight years from the current six years. Bankers, lawyers and advisors will also be punished more severely under the new law. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority will be given the authority to remove members of a board or management team of financial institutions or to revoke a bank's license if they are found guilty, it said. The initiative will also tighten another law, which was approved in December and comes into effect this month, under which the FSA plans tougher scrutiny of how banks assess the risk of money laundering. The minority government announced the new law after reaching an agreement with opposition party. The new legislation, which will be adopted in parliament in the autumn, comes after possible incidents of money laundering involving Scandinavia's two largest banks, Nordea and Danske Bank. The two banks were investigated by authorities in Moldova and Latvia for possible money laundering between 2011 and 2014 through their overseas branches, according to the Danish newspaper Berlingske. Both banks said they were cooperating in the investigations.

Dozens of them have volunteered to help rebuild the town once the militants have been defeated. The aim of organization they have joined, the Raqqa Civil Council (RCC) is to restore order and keep the peace in a place where further violence could fuel the rise of a new set of extremists with global ambitions. The RCC was established in April by Kurdish and Arab allies of the U.S.-led coalition that began attacking Raqqa this month, to replace militant rule in a part of Syria long beyond President Bashar al-Assad's control. The campaign against Islamic State has accelerated since President Donald Trump took office in January with the militants now facing defeat in both Raqqa and Mosul in Iraq. But the RCC says post-conflict planning in Raqqa has not kept pace. RCC volunteers say they have told the coalition it will take 5.3 billion Syrian lira (about $10 million) a year to restore power and water supplies, roads and schools and that they have nothing but small private donations so far. The dangers of the failure to rebuild after conflict were clear in Iraq following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The post-conflict chaos opened the door to an insurgency that devastated the country and fueled the rise of Islamic State. Mosul and Raqqa are both key centers of the caliphate the group proclaimed in 2014, but Raqqa is its operational headquarters, from where it plotted many of the deadly attacks that have targeted civilians around the world. A U.S. official said Washington stood ready to fund the RCC,  provided they prove themselves inclusive and representative of the communities they govern . Stability The RCC is a diverse team co-led by Arab tribal leader Sheikh Mahmoud Shawakh al-Bursan, who wears tribal robes, and Kurdish civil engineer Leila Mustafa, dressed in a green shirt and jeans. Based in the village of Ain Issa, 50 km (30 miles) north of Raqqa, it has the support of the Syrian Democratic Forces, U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab militia fighting Islamic State.  This is a historic step for Raqqa,  Mustafa said, referring to the dozens of technocrats and tribal leaders at its headquarters, a former government water department building, preparing to govern Raqqa until free elections can be held.  But there is destroyed infrastructure which must be rebuilt,  she said.  Schools must be opened. Water and power stations need funding.   The lack of funding has left the council, whose 70 members include teachers, doctors, engineers and lawyers, with few resources to appease frustrated, displaced Raqqa residents looking for quick solutions when they return to the city. Revenge killings of anyone associated with Islamic State are likely, and such violence could fuel another extremist militant movement, just as revenge killings of al-Qaeda-linked tribes in Iraq helped Islamic State spread its rule there from Raqqa. Abdul Aziz al-Amir, one of 20 representatives of local tribes on the council, is optimistic they can foster social cohesion in the city, where rows of houses and shops have been pulverized by coalition air strikes and Islamic State bombs.

We can help bring stability.  Syria's northern neighbor Turkey disagrees, arguing that a Raqqa council allied to Kurdish militia will expand the power of Syria's Kurds, effective fighters during the six-year-old conflict who have established self-rule in Syria's north. Turkey has battled a three-decade old insurgency by Kurdish PKK fighters in its south east and says Syrian Kurdish militia are an extension of the outlawed PKK. It views their ascendancy as a security threat. The main Syrian Kurdish groups say their goal is only autonomy in a future democratic and federal Syria. The council says some 80 percent of its members are Arabs, with two Arabs and a Kurd as its deputy leaders. European countries share Turkish and U.S. concerns that the RCC acts independently from the Kurdish militia in Raqqa, an overwhelmingly Arab city, but are very worried about post-conflict limbo given the number of attacks on their soil.  For the moment the United States is telling us, 'we're carrying out our war so will see afterwards,  a European diplomat said. The U.S. official said Washington had helped reestablish local governance in other former militant strongholds in Syria and was working with the RCC to ensure it was representative.

Two western military personnel from the coalition appeared in Aloush's office to tell him they could not pay for vehicles to transport food. Aloush told them the council would foot the bill. Just outside Ain Issa, police recruits for Raqqa funded by the coalition engage in a traditional dance to celebrate their graduation, after just 12 days of training.Idris Mohamed, a Kurd who has been named as the future head of security in Raqqa, says 700 have been trained so far. “The goal is to train 3,000 but 10,000 would be great,” he said. His main concern, aside from the Islamic State sleeper cells expected to stage attacks once coalition forces have control, is revenge killings that could bring a new wave of instability. As fellow graduates enjoyed the music, young policeman Adel al-Arabi recounted how Islamic State had killed his brother and cousin. “I watched Daesh behead them in the street,” he said, explaining that he had joined the force to avenge their deaths.

Shares in the country's largest telecom group fell nearly 5 percent on Tuesday when it emerged that the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) raided Bezeq's offices as part of the investigation into deals connected to its controlling shareholder. Bezeq chairman Shaul Elovitch controls the telecoms company through holding company Eurocom Group. The ISA has been questioning Elovitch and will ask the court for him to be allowed to go home, but with restrictions on his travel, an ISA spokeswoman said. Bezeq has said that it does  not have any additional information about the nature and circumstances of the investigation . Eurocom declined to comment and said Elovitch was not immediately available to comment. Eurocom gives Elovitch control over a myriad of assets like satellite operator Spacecom and Enlight Renewable Energy. He is also a close friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a relationship that bars Netanyahu from dealing with all things Bezeq. Israel's financial news websites reported that investigators were focusing on a recent deal in which Bezeq bought control of its satellite TV unit YES from Eurocom and that other executives besides Elovitch had been questioned. Bezeq has dominated Israel's telecom sector for decades and, with a generous dividend policy of distributing all its net profit, is a favourite among foreign investors. Analysts say the ISA investigation is unlikely to impact Bezeq's operations at this stage.  We think that business risk is likely to be negligible at this stage,  Citi analyst Michael Klahr said.  No one has been charged. Each of the companies within the group has their own CEO and management teams which will continue operating as they were for the duration of this investigation.

BoE chief economist Andy Haldane said he was likely to back an increase in interest rates in the second half of this year, which saw sterling surge by almost half a cent, briefly trading above $1.27 and reversing a drop below $1.26 earlier. Haldane's comments struck a more hawkish tone than BoE governor Mark Carney who in a speech on Tuesday said now was not the time to raise interest rates. The comments also highlighted a developing split at the central bank, with three out of eight BoE policymakers voting in favour of a rate hike last week.  The Haldane comments are potentially more significant than the vote last week to the extent that he is firstly a Bank of England insider and secondly he has typically been one of the most dovish members,  said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London.  If his opinion is shifting then that is potentially significant news for rates going forward.  Short sterling contracts for December of this year reversed all of their gains since Carney's speech, pricing in a greater than 50 percent chance of the Bank raising rates by then. Investors were also closely watching political developments in the UK, with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists Party (DUP) to form a government.  The political risk premium embedded in the pound looks like it is set to extend into next week with the DUP and the Conservative Party still not finalising talks,  said Stephen Gallo, currency strategist with BMO Capital Markets in London. Oil prices held near multi-month lows on Wednesday as investors discounted evidence of strong compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers with a deal to cut global output. That pulled the commodity-linked complex of currencies lower with the Norwegian crown languishing close to 5-month lows against the dollar.

Investors will look to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for its interest rate decision due later on Wednesday.  The culprit behind their (commodity currencies) lacklustre performance is the oil price in recent days,  said Valentin Marinov, head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole in London.  The key question for the FX markets on the day is the extent to which the oil price weakness will ultimately grow into a broad-based risk-off move.

Speaking to Reuters on day three of the June 19-25 show, Leahy said:  We will have some orders today, but today's isn't going to be one of our record air shows.  Regarding orders that Airbus could get over the rest of the show, Leahy added that such deals would be  nothing big, but real stuff  - an indirect reference to conversions from existing models that account for more than half of the orders announced so far for Boeing's newly launched 737 MAX 10. Boeing leads the race for net new orders at the air show.  Industry watchers said the veteran Airbus sales chief could pull off a signature last-minute deal to avoid an unusual defeat at the European company's home event. Leahy took issue with claims by Boeing (BA.N) that the Boeing 737 MAX 10 is 5 percent more efficient to operate than the Airbus A321neo, which has outsold the smaller 737 MAX 9 by about four to one.  I am getting to the point where I may run my Pinocchio ad again with the stuff they are saying,  Leahy said, referring to an advertising war between Airbus and Boeing in 2012 over conflicting claims on jet performance. Resale Values Boeing says the 737 MAX 10 is a lighter plane with a longer wing, making it more efficient. Airbus says the A321neo has a larger and more efficient engine, giving it an advantage. An aerial view of an Airbus A380 and an Airbus A321neo during the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris, France, June 21, 2017.Pascal RossignolBoeing's development chief said on Tuesday Airbus marketing risked ignoring the  physics of the universe . Leahy also said Boeing was putting some of its own sales at risk, rather than denting interest in the A321neo.  I don’t think we have a real competitor to worry about there. I think the rest of their product line is going to be cannibalized by that aircraft,  Leahy said of the 737 MAX 10. Slideshow (7 Images) Either the MAX 9 or the MAX 10 is going to survive, but one of them has to go,  Leahy said in an interview at what is likely to be his last major air show as he prepares to retire. He also questioned whether the introduction of a fifth member of the MAX family would allow airlines to preserve the value of their assets for possible resale - a key barometer of aviation finance that influences both old and new prices.  If you bought a MAX 9 in the past I think you have got to worry about your residual values,  Leahy said. Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister  this week denied the 737 MAX 10 would have any financing issues. Leahy said he was not worried about an order for 100 Boeing 737 MAX 10s from United Airlines, converted from other models.  I understand that United have an agreement that they can convert to any member of the MAX family that they want to, and can convert back if they want to, so we don't see that as a competitor to having the A321 one day be introduced to United.  Asked to comment on Leahy's remark, a Boeing spokesman said:  They (United) selected the 10.

In its quarterly economic bulletin published on Wednesday, the central bank said the economy, which last year expanded 1.4 percent, should grow 2 percent next year and 1.8 percent in 2019, which compares to its previous assessment in March, at 1.7 percent and 1.6 percent respectively.  Portugal's GDP growth will be above that projected the whole of the euro zone, somewhat reversing the negative difference accumulated over the past few years,  it said.  The GDP forecast is revised upwards for all of the projected period, reflecting the vigorous dynamics of exports and investment,  it said, adding that the government needs to continue to focus on cutting the budget deficit and public debt. Last year, Portugal reported a budget deficit of 2 percent of GDP - its lowest mark since at least 1975. It expects the country's exports to jump almost 10 percent this year, then rise 6.8 percent in 2018 and add another 4.8 percent the following year. The gross fixed capital formation, which measures investment, slipped 0.1 percent in 2016 but should rise 8.8 percent this year and over 5 percent in each of the following two years. In another upbeat prediction, the central bank said the unemployment rate should fall below 10 percent this year from last year's 11.1 percent and keep falling to hit 7 percent in 2019. It expects the jobless rate to end 2017 at 9.4 percent, which would be its lowest level since 2008. Towards the end of Portugal's 2011-14 economic and debt crisis, unemployment hit a record of over 17 percent and has been falling steadily since as the economy returned to growth after the worst recession since the 1970s.

(INTC.O) has joined Team8, an Israeli creator of cybersecurity start-ups, as a strategic partner and will help with the formation of companies that address the largest cybersecurity problems, Team8 said on Wednesday. Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, joins Team8's syndicate members Microsoft (MSFT.O), Cisco (CSCO.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), AT&T; (T.N), Citigroup (C.N), Accenture (ACN.N), Nokia (NOKIA.HE), Bessemer Venture Partners and Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors. Israel has some 450 cyber start-ups, which receive 20 percent of global investment in the sector. Although the need for security is growing quickly, the proliferation of start-ups means that several companies compete in every subsector. Team8 has already launched two cyber companies, Claroty and Illusive Networks, and two others will follow suit soon. Team8 co-founder and CEO Nadav Zafrir told Reuters that one company will move out of stealth mode in a few weeks while another will do the same in early 2018 without elaborating. He noted that each of the syndicate members has a different perspective on cyber.   Citi enables us to see the world from a financial standpoint. With Intel joining we will see the challenges going forward in cybersecurity like computing, automotive, cloud, mobile and IoT (Internet of Things),  Zafrir said.  Together we can address the (cyber) problems before they emerge.  Intel will also collaborate with Illusive, which catches attackers once they break into corporate networks using deception technologies, to help combat so-called advanced persistent threats (APTs). The alliance between Illusive and Intel extends deception-based cyber security from software to hardware, Illusive said.  Our collaboration with Illusive networks provides users with more effective defenses against sophisticated APTs, in the early stage of the attack, that otherwise go undetected and pose a great threat to enterprises and individuals,  said Jacob Mendel, general manager of Intel's platform security division.

Egypt's parliament last week backed plans for the uninhabited islands under an accord that attracted widespread public criticism. But the deal has been caught in a dispute over which institution has the final say after Egypt's highest administrative court rejected it last year. A separate court suspended the Supreme Administrative Court's verdict. The agreement now sees two courts and parliament in a battle over jurisdiction. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government last year announced a maritime demarcation agreement that cedes control of Tiran and Sanafir islands to Saudi Arabia, an ally which has given billions of dollars of aid to Egypt. Supreme Constitutional Court spokesman Ragab Saleem said:  The Constitutional Court, in cases of contradictory judgments, looks at who has jurisdiction.  It might see one side has jurisdiction, or that neither side has. It might be under the jurisdiction of another entity.  He said the court was not examining whether the deal was constitutional and did not give a timeframe for a decision. State media earlier reported the ruling was made to allow time to decide on the constitutionality of the islands deal. Wednesday's decision only applies to the two courts involved, not to parliament, which has approved the deal. The Egyptian and Saudi governments say the islands are Saudi but have been subject to Egyptian protection since 1950. But the plan caused street protests last year from many Egyptians who say their sovereignty over the islands dates back to a treaty from before Saudi Arabia was founded. Parliamentary leaders and government lawyers say the House of Representatives is the only entity allowed to rule on matters of sovereignty. But in June last year the country's highest administrative court ruled Egypt's sovereignty must stand. The Red Sea deal has become politically sensitive for Sisi's government. Saudi Arabia helped Sisi with aid since he toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. But Egyptians are eager for economic revival after years of political upheaval and after a devaluation of the Egyptian pound, tax rises and subsidy cuts introduced by Sisi's government that have put pressure on their living costs. The islands issue touched national pride, prompting thousands of protesters to take to the streets in April chanting  people want the fall of the regime , a slogan little heard since the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011.

Investigators are also looking at whether payments from foreign clients to Flynn and his company, the now-inactive Flynn Intel Group, were lawful, according to two separate sources with knowledge of the broad inquiry into Flynn's business activities. That includes payments by three Russian companies and a Netherlands-based company, Inovo, controlled by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, they said. The FBI's interest in Kian has not been previously reported. Kian played a central role in securing and overseeing the Inovo contract, two people with knowledge of that project said. It is not clear whether Kian is a target of the criminal investigation or whether investigators are trying to build a fuller understanding of how Flynn's company operated. A person recently interviewed by the FBI in connection with the Flynn investigation said agents from the bureau's criminal division had asked as much about Kian and his work on the project with Alptekin as they had about Flynn. Kian did not respond to repeated requests for comment, nor did the lawyer he recently hired, Robert Trout. The FBI declined to comment. Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to requests for comment. Alptekin declined to comment for this story but last month told Reuters that he was satisfied with the work done by Flynn Intel Group and denied any wrongdoing. The FBI has been investigating whether Flynn's consulting firm lobbied on behalf of Turkey - after being paid $530,000 by Inovo - without making the proper disclosure, Reuters reported earlier this month. The federal investigation is being run by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller has a mandate to investigate contacts between Russia and Trump's 2016 election campaign team and any related matters. Flynn was fired by the Trump administration in February after officials said he mischaracterized a series of phone calls with Russia’s ambassador last December. The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has separately been looking into whether Flynn made false statements in applying for security clearance, said he was also scrutinizing Kian.  I have an interest in Bijan Kian and his interactions with General Flynn based on specific documents already obtained by the Committee,” Elijah Cummings told Reuters in an email. Kelner has sought immunity for Flynn in exchange for his testimony, saying his client  certainly has a story to tell.  Failed Coup Opens a Door In private conversations with potential clients, Kian portrayed himself as a rainmaker for Flynn, tapping into connections cultivated during a five-year tenure as a director at the U.S. Export-Import Bank, according to one person who worked with the firm. Alptekin told Reuters in May that his firm hired Flynn Intel Group to research Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen's activities in the United States, which he suspected were  poisoning  relations between the United States and Turkey. Like Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Alptekin blamed a failed coup in Turkey last July on followers of Gulen. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the attempted coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. Kian oversaw key elements of the project that emerged, including a still-unfinished documentary on Gulen, according to two people involved in the project. Inovo paid Flynn Intel Group a total of $530,000, starting in September, according to a Justice Department filing by the company in March. Flynn Intel Group paid $80,000 to Inovo in  consultancy fees,  according to the filing, which does not provide more detail on why payments were made in both directions. On Sept. 19, Kian and Flynn met in New York with Turkey's foreign minister and energy minister, who is Erdogan's son-in-law, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. In late October, Kian invited staff of the House Homeland Security Committee to Flynn Intel Group's headquarters in Virginia. The meeting was called to show off new mobile phone security technology, but Kian also used the opportunity to try to get a congressional hearing on Gulen, according to a person at the meeting. At that point, the Flynn Intel Group had only disclosed its work for Alptekin's Inovo in a filing with Congress. It had not mentioned Inovo’s ties to Turkey. When Justice Department officials became aware months later that Kian and other Flynn Intel Group officials had met with Turkish officials they insisted on a fuller disclosure, people involved in those discussions said. The Flynn Intel Group made the more detailed disclosure in its March filing with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act that said the work that Flynn and Kian did for Inovo “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” (Reporting by Nathan Layne; Additional reporting by John Walcott, Julia Harte and Jonathan Landay in Washington; Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Ross Colvin)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-kian-idUSL1N1JI0DX"},

Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in early March, shortly after news reports surfaced of his previously undisclosed contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.

Comey accused the president of dismissing him to undermine the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign team and Russian officials.

An area of the Larsen C ice shelf, about as big as the U.S. state of Delaware or the Indonesian island of Bali, is connected by just 13 km (8 miles) of ice after a crack has crept about 175 kms along the sheet, with a new jump last month.  It's keeping us all on tenterhooks,  Andrew Fleming, of the British Antarctic Survey, told Reuters of the lengthening and widening rift, adding  it feels like a niggling tooth  of a child as it comes loose. Ice shelves are flat-topped areas of ice floating on the sea at the end of glaciers. The Larsen C ice is about 200 meters (656 ft) thick with about 20 meters jutting above the water. Big icebergs break off Antarctica naturally, meaning scientists are not linking the rift to man-made climate change. The ice, however, is a part of the Antarctic peninsula that has warmed fast in recent decades.  There is no other evidence of change on the ice shelf. This could simply be a single calving event which will then be followed by re-growth,  Adrian Luckman, a professor at the University of Swansea in Wales, told Reuters. His team reckons the ice will break off within months, perhaps in days or years. An oblique view of a massive rift in the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen C ice shelf is shown in this November 10, 2016 photo taken by scientists on NASA's IceBridge mission in Antarctica.  Courtesy John Sonntag/NASA/Handout via REUTERSRisks for Shipping The ice, about 5,000 square kilometers (1,930 square miles), will add to existing risks for ships as it breaks apart and melts. The peninsula is outside major trade routes but the main destination for cruise ships visiting from South America.  In 2009, more than 150 passengers and crew were evacuated after the MTV Explorer sank after striking an iceberg off the Antarctic peninsula. Fleming said the Larsen C iceberg would add an extra pulse of ice and would be hazardous especially if smaller chunks reached usually ice-free areas in the South Atlantic, rather than staying close to Antarctica's coast. The Larsen B ice shelf nearby broke up in 2002 and some of the ice drifted into the South Atlantic toward the island of South Georgia, east of Argentina. In 2000, the biggest iceberg recorded broke off the Ross ice shelf and was about the size of Jamaica at 11,000 square kms. Bits have lingered for years. The loss of ice shelves does not in itself affect sea levels because the ice is already floating. But their disappearance lets glaciers on land slip faster toward the ocean, thereby raising sea levels. NASA estimates that the Larsen C ice shelf pins back ice on land that would add a centimeter (0.4 inch) to world sea levels, which have gained about 20 centimeters in the past century.

New Jersey-based J&J; has been battling a series of lawsuits over its talc-based products, including Johnson's Baby Powder, brought by around 5,950 women and their families. The company denies any link between talc and cancer. A fifth of the plaintiffs have cases pending in state court in St. Louis, where juries in four trials have hit J&J; and a talc supplier with $307 million in verdicts. Those four cases and most of the others on the St. Louis docket involve out-of-state plaintiffs suing an out-of-state company. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in a case involving Bristol-Myers Squibb Co that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state when the alleged injuries did not occur there. The ruling immediately led a St. Louis judge at J&J;'s urging to declare a mistrial in the latest talc case, in which two of the three women at issue were from out of state. It also could imperil prior verdicts and cases that have yet to go to trial.  We believe the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Bristol-Myers Squibb matter requires reversal of the talc cases that are currently under appeal in St. Louis,  J&J; said in a statement. The question of where such lawsuits can be filed has been the subject of fierce debate. The business community has argued plaintiffs should not be allowed to shop around for the most favorable court to bring lawsuits, while injured parties claim corporations are trying to deny them access to justice. Along with talc cases, large-scale litigation alleging injuries from Bayer AG's Essure birth control device in Missouri and California and GlaxoSmithKline's antidepressant Paxil in California and Illinois are examples of other cases where defendants could utilize the Supreme Court decision. Although he declared a mistrial on Monday, St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison left the door open for the plaintiffs to argue they still have jurisdiction. Plaintiffs lawyer Ted Meadows said he would argue the St. Louis court still had jurisdiction based on a Missouri-based bottler J&J; used to package its talc products, which he said would create a sufficient connection to the state.  It's very disappointing to mistry a case because the Supreme Court changed the rules on us,  said Meadows. The lawsuit decided by the high court on Monday involved claims against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp by 86 California residents and 575 non-Californians over the blood thinner Plavix. Beyond Monday's mistrial, the Supreme Court's ruling could bolster a pending appeal by J&J; of a $72 million verdict in favor of the family of Alabama resident Jacqueline Fox, who died in 2015. A Missouri appeals court had said in May it would wait until the Supreme Court issued its decision to decide the appeal. J&J; has won only one of the five trials so far in Missouri. It previously sought to move talc cases out of St. Louis, but the Missouri Supreme Court in January denied its bid. The company has also cast the St. Louis court as overly plaintiff-friendly and has allowed evidence linking talc to cancer that was rejected by a New Jersey state court judge overseeing over 200 talc cases. The plaintiffs are appealing. The talc verdicts against J&J; led the business-friendly American Tort Reform Association last year to declare the St. Louis state court the nation's top  Judicial Hellhole.  Now J&J; could try to use the Supreme Court ruling to dismiss many of the cases it faces in Missouri, according to legal experts. Corporations facing a large volume of cases in venues chosen by plaintiffs will likely cite the Supreme Court to try to dismiss those claims, said Rusty Perdew, a defense lawyer at the law firm Locke Lord.  You have a bunch of defendants who can go back and say, 'Judge, you got that wrong and you're going to have to dismiss claims by all those plaintiffs,'  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonjohnson-cancer-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JH27C"},

In a complaint filed on Monday in Los Angeles federal court, Denise Daniels said the animated film, featuring color-coded characters representing individual human emotions, mirrors a children's program called  The Moodsters  that she conceived and pitched to Disney every year from 2005 to 2009. Daniels, who lives in Minnesota's Twin Cities area and has appeared on TV shows including  Today  and  Oprah,  said she had an  implied-in-fact  contract with Disney requiring that she be paid from box office, DVD, Blu-Ray, iTunes and merchandise revenue from  Inside Out.  The film has grossed more than $850 million worldwide since its June 2015 release. Daniels said this  extreme success  was not possible without her work, and that Disney should pay her because it is  custom and common in the entertainment industry.  A Disney spokesman, however, said  Inside Out  was an original Pixar creation.  We look forward to vigorously defending against this lawsuit in court,  the spokesman said. Ronald Schutz, a lawyer for Daniels, declined to comment. Daniels was unavailable to comment. The lawsuit is at least the second in three months accusing Disney of stealing a concept for a blockbuster film. In March, the Hollywood screenwriter Gary Goldman, whose credits include the Arnold Schwarzenegger film  Total Recall,  sued Disney for allegedly copying its Oscar-winning animated film  Zootopia  from his work.  Inside Out  follows 11-year-old Riley, voiced by Kaitlyn Dias, as she tries to cope with her family's move to San Francisco from Minnesota. It also shows her dealing with personifications of five emotions: Joy (yellow), Sadness (blue), Fear (purple), Anger (red) and Disgust (green), voiced by Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling. Daniels said this resembled  The Moodsters,  in which characters also had assigned colors: Happiness (yellow), Sadness (blue), Fear (green), Anger (red) and Love (pink). According to her complaint,  Inside Out  director Pete Docter, former Disney Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs and several other Disney executives had access to her pitch. No individuals were named as defendants. In the  Zootopia  case, Disney has denied wrongdoing and asked a federal judge to dismiss Goldman's complaint. The Daniels case is Daniels v. Walt Disney Co et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 17-04527. The Goldman case is Esplanade Productions Inc v. Walt Disney Co et al in the same court, No. 17-02185.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/walt-disney-insideout-idUSL1N1JH15E"},

The city's private home prices have hit record highs for six months in a row, posing a challenge to incoming leader Carrie Lam, who is due to be sworn in by Chinese President Xi Jinping on July 1. The dearth of supply, low interest rates, and the flow of capital from mainland China have pushed prices up over 137 percent since the financial crisis in 2008, making the city one of the world's most expensive property markets. The subsidiaries of Chinese developers Road King Infrastructure Ltd and Shenzhen Investment Ltd beat nine other companies to win the land deal in western New Territories' Tuen Mun district, which is about an hour away from the central business district. The price beat market expectations, which ranged from HK$2.12 billion to 2.6 billion. Based on the land premium, flats at the residential project would have to be sold for at least HK$16,000 per square foot, according to Thomas Lam, senior director at property consultancy Knight Frank. This estimate is over 50 percent higher than the district's current average home price of HK$10,600 per square foot, according to data from property agency Midland Realty.

But prospects for a clean early resolution to the sale of the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash chips remain unclear as Western Digital (WDC.O), Toshiba's chips business partner, has launched legal action to prevent a deal without its consent. The consortium has offered around 2 trillion yen, a Toshiba spokesman said. Bain plans to be the biggest investor, providing 850 billion yen ($7.7 billion) in equity, three sources briefed on the matter said. The bid was less than a rival 2.2 trillion yen offer from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) and its partner U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. It was also hastily put together but has the implicit stamp of approval from the Japanese government which is keen to keep key semiconductor technology under domestic control. Toshiba cannot afford to ignore the government because it needs its help with plans including the decommissioning of domestic nuclear power plants and as overseas nuclear power projects are currently in limbo after the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear unit. Some analysts believe that talks over the hotly contested deal have become so complex that only a government-orchestrated  solution is viable, but others doubt that the group will provide the necessary leadership the chip unit needs.  There are many parties involved in this consortium,  said  Atsushi Osanai, a professor at Waseda University Business School. Related CoverageBain to be biggest investor in Toshiba chip unit, putting up $7.7 billion: sourcesJapan trade ministry asks Western Digital to join Japan Government-Bain consortium for Toshiba chip unit: sources It has undergone so many twists and turns during its formation process, that I'm skeptical about whether it can promptly make bold decisions. In that sense, Broadcom or Foxconn would be better suited.  Toshiba said in a statement it took into consideration concern about technology transfers, job security for its domestic workforce and prospects of clearing regulatory reviews in its decision. While Bain will be the biggest investor, it will obtain around half the amount in financing from South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), the sources said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) will each provide 300 billion yen in equity, while the core banking unit of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T) will provide 550 billion yen in financing. FILE PHOTO - A logo of Toshiba Corp is seen on a printed circuit board in this photo illustration taken in Tokyo July 31, 2012.Yuriko Nakao/File PhotoThe numbers have yet to be finalised and are still subject to change, one of the sources said.   A representative for DBJ was not immediately available to comment. All other members of the consortium as well as Toshiba declined to comment on the details of the deal. In a Hurry  Toshiba is rushing to clinch an agreement by June 28, the day of its annual shareholders meeting. It needs to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its Westinghouse nuclear unit and to dig itself out negative shareholders' equity that could lead to a delisting. Following the announcement, Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant, reasserted in a statement that Toshiba was in breach of their joint venture contracts and said that a U.S. court hearing on its request for an injunction was scheduled for July 14. Japan's trade ministry, which has arranged much of the winning bid, is in talks with Western Digital, trying to persuade it to join the consortium, two separate sources familiar with the matter said. But Western Digital is reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that high-level technology for NAND chips, which provide long-term data storage, could be leaked to rival SK Hynix, they added. SK Hynix said it had joined the consortium because it sees new business opportunities with the deal. Although the South Korean chip maker is strong in DRAM chips, which help electronic devices perform multiple tasks at once, it is relatively weak in NAND.  Suitors that lost out refrained from comment on Wednesday. A representative for Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment. Silver Lake declined to comment. Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker which also bid, did not respond to requests for comment. Formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW), the Taiwanese firm's consortium includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and computing giant Dell Inc. Toshiba's shares ended 2 percent lower. They are down about 30 percent since problems at Westinghouse surfaced late last year but have come some way off lows as talks about the chip unit sale progressed.

Honduras has been named the world's most dangerous place for environmental activists like Benitez - local people battling big business to preserve their ancestral lands from mining, damns, logging, tourism and other mega-developments.   In Honduras, one of the ways to get you out of the way is murder,  said Benitez from his home in the Honduran mountain top village of Santa Elena in western La Paz province. The area of lush mountains and sweeping valleys has become a focal point in a nation on the front line of land activism, with scores of active disputes - and murders - along the way.  Benitez fears he could be next - along with his wife and  children - as he leads opposition to Los Encinos hydroelectric dam on land he claims for the indigenous Lenca people. Four activists have been killed since 2013, including one whose dismembered body was found in a river in 2015, said Benitez, and campaigning has stalled construction of the dam. Norma Allegra Cerrato, Honduran vice minister of human rights and justice, said the government is working to stem violence against activists while other government departments push for the projects they argue are needed for the economy.  Currently we've had a lot of problems with big interests, we even have had deaths and we have to try to avoid this from happening in the country,  Cerrato said.  Honduras is the deadliest place on earth for environmental activism, according to a January report by UK-based watchdog Global Witness, with about 120 activists killed since 2010 but most crimes going unpunished. The dangers involved hit the spotlight when renowned environmentalist Berta Caceres - a prize-winning grassroots campaigner - was gunned down in her home in March last year. Since Caceres' murder, at least seven more activists have been killed, including other members of the organization co-founded by Caceres - the Council of Indigenous Peoples of Honduras (COPINH), according to Global Witness. The latest victim, Jose Santos, an indigenous leader and land rights defender, was shot dead in February in his home. Time for Change Experts says violent conflicts between indigenous groups, companies and the country's business and political elite will continue unless more is done to protect the rights of indigenous people and consult them about projects planned on their land. Under an International Labour Organization (ILO) agreement that Honduras signed in 1989, the government is obliged to ensure projects on indigenous lands win  free, prior and informed consent  from locals. But Honduran indigenous leaders say this rarely happens.  Our territories, our rivers have been stolen and we haven't been consulted,  said Margarita Pineda, whose own fight focuses on land around her native San Jose, another village in La Paz. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the top rights commission in the Americas, there are nearly 840 mining projects, most for gold, in the pipeline or under consideration, covering a third of Honduran territory. Caceres led a decades-long campaign against the construction of the $50 million Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam that threatened to uproot hundreds of Lenca people and destroy livelihoods. Both the government and Desarrollos Energeticos SA (DESA), the private company building the Agua Zarca dam, have denied any involvement in Caceres' murder.  International backers of the dam - the FMO, the Dutch development bank, and a Finnish state investment fund, Finnfund - suspended $20 million in funding following Caceres' murder. In March 2016, Finnfund said in a statement:  FMO and Finnfund will not, for now, make disbursements to the project.   FMO is currently in discussion with the other lenders, the independent facilitator, DESA and other stakeholders in order to realize a responsible exit,  the FMO said on its website.  Margarita Pineda is pictured in San Jose, La Paz, where she works as co-ordinator for MILPAH, (Lenca Indigenous Movement of La Paz), March 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Nicky Milne\nFellow activists vow to honor Caceres's legacy. Standing by a dried-out river bed, Pineda laments the disappearance of gushing rivers and waterfalls that ran through her forested mountains before a dam was built two years ago.   They thought we would sit here with our arms crossed when Berta died. But we have strengthened our fight. We will all die one day so it may as well be for a fair fight,  said Pineda who says she has received death threats from armed men. Armed Guards For Miriam Miranda, head of the Black Fraternal Organisation of Honduras (OFRANEH), danger is a part of life for campaigners.  We're facing a hard fight against companies that are taking over our territories,  said Miranda, who is opposing big tourism projects on the ancestral lands of the Garifuna people.  I've been .. arrested and beaten by the police. I've been kidnapped by hired assassins who wanted to kill us for defending our territory,  she said. The police would not comment on the alleged attacks.  Slideshow (3 Images)Such is the danger that in recent years she and Benitez, along with Caceres and dozens of other Honduran activists, have been granted precautionary measures by the IACHR, which is part of the Organization of American States. This means the IACHR deems their lives to be at risk, and has asked the Honduran government to take steps to protect them. But some activists, including Caceres, refused the offer of government protection, citing mistrust of state security forces. Impunity For rarely are the murderers caught. About 80 percent of murders in the Central American nation go unpunished, including killings of activists, according to IACHR's latest report. In Caceres' case, eight people have been arrested in connection with her murder, including current and former Honduran military personnel. But her family accuses the political elite and state security forces of orchestrating the murder and have demanded an independent investigation, a request the government has denied.  I have encouraged them (Berta's children) to continue with this fight,  Caceres' mother, 80-year-old Austraberta Flores, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Of course it's risky, but if we don't make the sacrifice, it will be impossible to stop the destruction of the country.  Honduras has pledged to do more to protect activists, bring criminals to justice and push forward a law that would better regulate consultations between companies and local communities.  Last year Honduras introduced a scheme aimed at keeping the activists safe - providing protection, including bodyguards and mobile phones, to about 74 people, mostly rights defenders. State prosecutors continue to investigate the murder of Caceres and other activists, said vice minister Cerrato.  Everyone wants immediate results,  she said.  But I don't think it's that easy to obtain such fast results if we want to make an effective and in-depth investigation. We need to be a bit patient.  Activists feel no safer - and vow to keep on fighting, and to the death if that is what is takes.  Our territory is life itself,  said Pineda.  If we don't protect it, who will?

While parents worry they will be unable to pick up their children after classes because of the tumult, teachers are often forced to skip work due to the clashes between protesters and troops.  Yet the Education Ministry has refused to cancel classes at state schools even when spillover from demonstrations poses a risk to children - primarily from the tear gas fired to disperse protesters.  It also has forbidden private schools, which serve about a quarter of the country's primary and secondary school students,  from suspending lessons. The result is that one of the most routine parenting responsibilities - getting children to school - now requires constantly juggling of contingency plans and calculating the odds of getting through protests that have left 75 people dead.  We check Twitter until about 9:30, 10:00 at night and that's when we decide if we're going to take our son to school the next day,  said Ignacio, 33, a telecom engineer who asked that his last name not be used for fear of reprisals.  Sometimes my wife will leave to pick him up and she'll come across barricades or lanes closed on the highway, so we have to figure out if I have to rush from work to get him.  Outraged by triple-digit inflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine, demonstrators gather on main avenues for protests that range from peaceful sit-ins to rock-throwing melees with troops firing rubber bullets and tear gas.    That creates traffic chaos that can disrupt public transportation just as school is letting out. Protesters are demanding that the Socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro address a crippling economic crisis and scrap plans to rewrite the constitution of the South American oil producer. Parents try to delicately explain to their kids why they are not in class while still sheltering them from the country's virulent political discourse, which is increasingly drifting into the lexicon of even elementary school children. Teachers constantly reschedule lessons and tests to compensate for missed days of the academic year, which normally runs from October to July. Parents worry that their kids risk falling behind in their studies if the unrest continues. The protests have disrupted daily life well beyond schools.   They at times prevent deliveries of raw materials to factories, force state agencies to remain closed, and lead shops to preventively shut their doors on rumors that demonstrations are devolving into looting. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the situation. Tear Gas in Classrooms Ruling Socialist Party officials say the protests are part of a violent effort to overthrow Maduro. They say the constant disruptions of public order limit access to education and thus undermine late socialist leader Hugo Chavez’s efforts to invest in  schools FILE PHOTO: School children protect themselves from tear gas during a rally against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela April 26, 2017.Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File PhotoMaduro says private schools have in some cases canceled class as a way of supporting the opposition.  I have ordered an investigation against those owners of private schools that have promoted hatred, racism, violence,  Maduro said in a televised broadcast in May. The Education Ministry last month said it had fined 15 private schools for  permitting, provoking and inciting violent actions in educational facilities and their surrounding areas.  As a result, schools remain open even under extreme circumstances. National Guard troops in late May fired a tear gas canister into the main patio of a school called the Montessori Institute in the city of Barquisimeto, according to a local media report, in an apparent effort to disperse a nearby protest.  When a group of students left the building to escape the fumes, three of them were detained by the National Guard, according to the report. Slideshow (8 Images)A school official said the report was accurate but declined further comment. Two Caracas Catholic schools in separate incidents in April had to evacuate children after they were flooded by clouds of tear gas, according to Reuters witnesses. The schools declined to comment. Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who has become a high-profile critic of the government's handling of protests, recently called on security forces not to fire tear gas near clinics and schools. Under the circumstances, many parents opt to leave kids at home. But this can lead to heightened government scrutiny of schools. Education Ministry officials threatened to shutter one  private school in the central state of Lara, where classrooms went empty for days on end due to parents' safety concerns,  according to two parents of children that study there. They backed off the threat after an inspection determined that teachers were working normal hours, sitting in silent classrooms and maintaining lesson plans, they said. A third parent, who is involved in the parent-teacher association, confirmed the incident but asked that the school not be named to avoid reprisals. Reuters was unable to obtain comment from the school. Caribay Valenzuela, whose two daughters study near the Altamira neighborhood that has been a focal point of protests,  sends them to school with goggles and a handkerchief in case the protests spill over. The 39-year-old routinely picks up her kids early and takes them to her mother's house because her own home is at times hit by tear gas.  They ask me to pick up the kids at 10 a.m. when there are marches to make sure that staff can get home,  Valenzuela said.  Maintaining the routine has been really difficult because they ask me 'Is there school tomorrow? Is it a full day? What are we going to do tomorrow?'

Isracard is a unit of Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest lender. A new regulation requires that Hapoalim and top rival Leumi sell off their credit card units in the coming years. Teva was left without a permanent chief executive in February after Erez Vigodman stepped down, leaving new management to restore confidence in the world's biggest generic drugmaker after a series of missteps. Then chairman Yitzhak Peterburg replaced Vigodman on a temporary basis. At Isracard Desheh replaces Ronen Stein, deputy CEO of Hapoalim. Under new rules, a manager at the credit card companies cannot also serve as a member of board of management at a bank. Desheh served as deputy CFO at Teva from 1989 to 1996 before becoming CFO of Scitex and then Check Point Software Technologies. He returned as Teva's CFO in 2008 and was acting CEO from October 2013 to February 2014.

Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters on Wednesday that changes could include more closely coordinated connecting - or feeder - flights, and a joint decision on schedules to soften head-to-head competition in some markets. The comments at the Paris Airshow come two months after the chairman of both airlines, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum said they had  to work with a better synergy.  The carriers currently have an interline agreement allowing their passengers to connect between each other's flights. “We are minded to accelerate a greater joining of the hip, of what we do, there’s a lot of work going on there to extract value for the shareholder,” Clark said. The push by their state owner comes amid pressure on profits at both airlines. Emirates' annual profit fell in the year ended March 31 for the first time in five years. Flydubai's 2016 profit fell for a second consecutive year. A  rationalisation of assets and airport utilisation  by Emirates and flydubai could extend the life of Dubai International Airport, Clark said. Emirates operates an exclusively wide-body fleet of Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft, whereas flydubai operates narrow-body Boeing 737s. Dubai Airport, the hub for both airlines and the world's busiest for international travel, has become increasingly congested during peak periods. It handled 30.1 million passengers in the first four months of the year, up 7.8 percent on the same period last year. Clark has previously warned congestion at the airport, which is expected to hit its maximum capacity of 118 million passengers a year by 2023, could limit Emirates' growth. Dubai is expanding a new airport, Al Maktoum International, which is slated one day to be capable of handling 240 million passengers a year. The expansion has been delayed and Clark signalled Emirates' plans to move there by 2025 have been pushed back until sometime between 2026 and 2030. Dubai Airport Chief Executive Paul Griffiths told Reuters its goal remained to deliver a  capacity of 120 million passengers per year by 2025.   However, given the scale of that project and the unprecedented complexity of the relocation of the Emirates hub, it is sensible for Emirates to build contingencies into its plan,  he said.

The Ahmadiyah identify themselves as Muslims, but believe another prophet followed the Prophet Mohammed, who founded Islam. Many mainstream Muslims and hardline groups accuse the sect and other Muslim minorities of apostasy. A mob of 1,000 people beat to death three Ahmadis in an unprovoked attack in a village in Banten province, west of Jakarta, in 2011 and activists say the group continues to face discrimination.  Indonesia's reputation for tolerance has come under renewed scrutiny since Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian, was sentenced last month to two years in prison for blasphemy in a trial that came after mass Islamist-led rallies and raised religious tensions to the highest in years. Sixteen people from the village of Manislor in West Java, representing 1,400 members of the sect, told the ombudsman on Tuesday that their lives had been damaged by not having IDs for five years, said Syamsul Alam Agus, executive secretary of One Justice Foundation, a nonprofit organization. Some were unable to register their marriages, Agus said, adding in one case an Ahmadi was refused treatment at a hospital because of a lack of ID. According to Agus, in order to obtain ID documents, Ahmadis had to sign a form stating they were Muslims while reading the Shahada, an Islamic creed declaring belief in the oneness of God and Muhammad as God's prophet.  Not giving an electronic ID card to Manislor's Ahmadiyah followers is not only a violation of human rights, but also breaking the law,  Agus said. Indonesia requires a person to state their religion on official ID cards. The ombudsman felt there had been maladministration at the local Kuningan government where Manislor is located, but had not formally issued any recommendation, said Ahmad Su'adi, an ombudsman official, adding that  the state cannot force people  to denounce or join a religion. The Kuningan government could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, but in a June 2016 post on its website, the head of the Kuningan regency, Acep Purnama, defended its refusal to hand out identity documents to followers of Ahmadiyah and an animist belief, Sunda Wiwitan.   We are not discriminating or being intolerant... But this is an issue of principle that has to be resolved together and must be accepted by all Kuningan people. This isn't about majority or minority,  he was quoted as saying. Earlier this month, the government of Depok city near Jakarta sealed off a mosque frequently used by Ahmadis during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, according to media reports. Muslims make up nearly 90 percent of Indonesia's 250 million people but there are sizeable communities of Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and people who adhere to traditional beliefs.

Fuel oil, the residue left over after initial crude refining, has become scarce in Asia as refiners make their plants more complex by upgrading their plants to change the fuel into gasoline and diesel. However, analysts caution that new supply should begin flowing to the region from Europe and South America, eventually driving margins back towards their typical levels. The spread between the 180-centistoke fuel oil swap and Dubai crude for July was at a premium of 27 cents a barrel on Wednesday, the first time the residual fuel has been at a premium to Dubai since January 2012. The margin has averaged a discount of $3.09 in 2017 and averaged minus $5.37 last year. The higher margins are bolstering the values for regional crude oil grades that yield a large volume of fuel oil when refined, particularly at less complex plants, said three traders in that market.  The elevated fuel oil cracks could prompt some simple refiners to increase run rates over the near term but the extent of this could be limited in light of relatively lower gains in light and middle distillate cracks,  said Sri Paravaikkarasu, the Head of East of Suez Oil at energy consultancy FGE. While fuel oil margins will remain elevated, they should ease in the coming months. FGE's Paravaikkarasu pointed to rising exports from Latin America and the former Soviet Union in the fourth quarter as refiners there increase run rates and utilities switch away from burning fuel oil to natural gas. Fuel oil is primarily used to power large ships and for electric power generation. Utilities' consumption of the fuel tends to peak in the summer to meet increased cooling demand.  We could potentially see some correction in fuel oil crack values once peak summer demand eases,  said Nevyn Nah, oil products analyst at Energy Aspects. Fuel oil supplies this year have declined after the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries focused their crude cuts on grades that yield the most fuel oil. Investments into refinery upgrades in places like India and Russia also cut supply. Over the first week of June, onshore fuel oil stocks STKRS-SIN in Singapore, the world's biggest fuel oil trading hub, sank to their lowest in more than 2-1/2 years while inventories in northwest Europe STK-FO-ARA fell their lowest since October. Refinery outages in Venezuela, a key fuel oil producer have also helped constrain supplies. Demand for the fuel has also been supportive. Fuel oil sales to power ships in Singapore, the world's biggest ship fuel port, rose to an all-time high in January, while sales from February to March set monthly records.

The Indian Ocean country of 93,000 people largely depends on tourism for government revenues but has sought to promote itself as a low-tax, financial services hub.  For 2017 the growth prospects remain favourable...as tourist arrivals continue to rise at a sustained pace, while inflation should remain subdued, on account of the stability of fuel and other commodity prices,  Finance Minister Peter Larose said in a letter to the IMF released on Tuesday. Seychelles' inflation rose to 3.18 percent year-on-year in May from -0.78 percent a month earlier. IMF said in a separate statement that Seychelles' economy was still vulnerable to external factors that could affect its tourism sector.  The outlook for tourist arrivals remains highly susceptible to external developments, such as weak growth in advanced and emerging market economies, weakness in the Euro, and geopolitical tensions disrupting the Middle East, Africa, and Europe,  it said.

The IPO is planned for the first half of next year, with the timing to be detailed in August, he said.  The company is looking to raise  a few 100 million euros , probably less than half a billion euros, Sutter told Reuters on the sidelines of the Eurelectric utility conference. The listing, which was agreed in the new Estonian government's coalition agreement in November, could make Enefit Renewables the biggest listed company on the Tallinn exchange and will be the biggest IPO in the Baltics in years.  Shipping group Tallink is the biggest company on the Baltic stock index with a market value of about 620 million euros.   (Enefit Renewables) is a little bit too big for Tallinn, it might have made sense to list it somewhere else, but the government wanted to make the domestic stock exchange more active,  Sutter said. Eesti Energia is Estonia's main electricity retailer, with a market share of about 60 percent. It also has a 20 percent market share in Latvia and about 10 percent in Lithuania.  Sutter said the Estonian government had also considered listing the entire firm but decided to start with the renewables unit as that is where most of the company's capital spending will go.  Sutter said the lion's share of the IPO proceeds, some 180 million euros, would go towards the development of a new 140 megawatt (MW) wind park in Tootsi, southwest Estonia. A tender for the park's turbines, with probable capacity of 3 MW each, has been launched.  Eesti Energia also has other renewable energy projects, in wind and biomass. The tiny Baltic country has total wind capacity of 300 MW, which accounts for about 8 percent of total power consumption.  About 85 percent of the country's electricity is generated from oil shale, which Eesti Energia mines and burns in its own power stations.  Eesti Energia - which operates abroad under the Enefit brand name - has also just acquired a gas and power license in Poland, where it has set up an office and hired a team to launch power retailing.  Eesti Energia is one of the most digitalized utilities in Europe, with 95 percent of its 650,000 customers on paperless digital subscriptions. Forty percent of the company's customers are on so-called dynamic tariffs linked directly to wholesale power prices and many have apps on their phone that allow them to take advantage of low prices to charge electric vehicles or heat up water boilers.  Sutter said the company wanted to boost its digital retail offering in neighboring countries.

Its majority owner, private equity investment group Cerberus , has recruited Morgan Stanley to help with global coordination of the share sale, which could launch as early as autumn, the sources said. However, no official mandates are out yet and more banks will be added in coming weeks, the sources said, adding Goldman Sachs and Citi also stand a good chance of being part of the bank line-up. Rothschild is seen as having an edge over Lazard and Evercore to take the role of a so-called independent IPO adviser, which will help with the selection of bookrunners, they added. BAWAG and the investment banks declined to comment. Cerberus held talks with investment banks in New York in late April to hear their proposals for an exit, they said. Cerberus acquired BAWAG with other investors for 3.2 billion euros in 2007. It now owns 52 percent while GoldenTree Asset Management has a 40 percent stake. The investors could opt to sell a stake of 20-30 percent in a potential IPO, which could value the bank at 4 to 5 billion euros. Although no final decision on the location has been taken, the company is expected to have Vienna as its primary listing location with a secondary listing in either Frankfurt or London. At 4.5 billion euros, BAWAG would be valued at roughly 1.5 times its book value - in line with the valuation of Nordic banks but at a premium to most banks in continental Europe. BAWAG does not comment on its owners' potential plans. Cerberus and GoldenTree declined to comment. Shares in European banks on average trade just below book value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Among Austrian lenders, Erste Group trades at 1.03 times and Raiffeisen Bank International at 0.7 times book value. Unlike Austrian peers with large operations in central and eastern Europe, BAWAG focuses on western markets. BAWAG's 2017 targets include a return on equity (ROE) above 15 percent and making more than 500 million euros in profit before tax. In 2016 its ROE was 15.9 percent. European banks on average had an ROE of 3.3 percent in the last quarter of 2016, according to the European Banking Authority.  The sentiment in the market is very positive but (the decision) wasn't because of catching the market at the right time,  a person close to the matter said.  The bank has been preparing for a strategic action for some time. It had (an exit) process two years ago, but was probably too early in the game.  BAWAG has margins ranging in the top 5 percent among ECB-regulated banks, so investors have increasingly come to see its performance as credible, the person added.

U.S. index provider MSCI said on Wednesday Hong Kong time it would add a selection of China's so-called  A  shares to its Emerging Markets Index .MSCIEF after having rejected them for three years running. In the broader overhaul, MSCI surprised many investors by failing to upgrade Argentina from the frontier market category where it has languished in recent years, but said it would consult investors about adding Saudi Arabia to the benchmark. Inclusion in the index marks a key victory for the Chinese government, which has been working steadily over the past few years to open up its capital markets, investors said.  Given the size and importance of China as an economic superpower, I think this is a historic moment,  Kevin Anderson, senior managing director of State Street Global Advisors and head of investments in the Asia Pacific region told Reuters.  It's a long-awaited and much-debated decision in the past, and I think it's more than symbolic as it will create additional flow of capital and potentially a new segment of institutional investors in the China market.  Traders said MSCI's widely expected  Yes  decision had been largely priced in, with the announcement triggering some profit-taking in blue chips, which are no longer cheap after strong rallies this year. Shanghai shares .SSEC opened just 0.3 percent higher, dipped into negative territory, and then rallied to end the day up 0.5 percent. The blue-chip CSI300 Index .CSI300 shook off early profit taking to finish up 1.2 percent at its highest close in 1-1/2 years. MSCI has been in discussions with Chinese regulators and global investors for four years over whether to add yuan-denominated shares to the Emerging Markets Index – tracked by around $1.6 trillion in assets – but excluded them because of restricted access to China's equity markets. Related CoverageAnalyst View: MSCI adds domestic Chinese stocks to Emerging Markets IndexSouth Korea stocks may see outflow of up to 4.3 trillion won after MSCI includes China: officialMSCI to consider adding Saudi Arabia to key index during 2019On Wednesday, the company said China had made enough progress in opening up its markets for MSCI to add a selection of 222 large-cap stocks. The bulk of the shares will be financial and industrial companies, many state-owned. According to Credit Suisse, among the 222 stocks on the simulated list of constituents for the new proposal of China A-share inclusion, 50 are in the financial sector with a total weight of 36 percent, and 44 stocks are in the industrial sector with a total weight of 16 percent. The stocks, which would represent a weighting of just 0.73 percent in the benchmark, will be included via a two-phase process in May and August next year. The move will see around $17 billion to $18 billion of global assets move into Chinese stocks initially, MSCI executives told reporters, adding that over the long term the full inclusion of the China market could see more than $340 billion of foreign capital flow into the country.  FILE PHOTO: An investor looks at a screen showing stock information at a brokerage house in Shanghai, China November 9, 2016.Aly Song/File PhotoSebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI declined, however, to provide a likely timeline for the full inclusion of  A  shares, saying it would depend on  continued progress on China's reform agenda. MSCI, he noted, would like to see China further relax controls on repatriating capital out of the country, and act to curb frequent share suspensions.  It's really in the hands of the Chinese stakeholders, they are dictating the timing. It's very difficult for us to articulate any type of timeline with respect to further inclusion,  Lieblich told reporters.   The China Securities Regulatory Commission, which has overseen many key reforms in recent years, welcomed MSCI's decision.  The inclusion of 'A' shares in the MSCI index is in line with the inevitable needs of international investors and reflects the confidence of international investors in the good prospects for China's economic development and stability of the financial market,  the CSRC said in a statement. Slideshow (3 Images)Relaxed Criteria MSCI in March relaxed its criteria for inclusion by cutting the number of proposed stocks to 169 from 448 in a bid to address ongoing curbs on repatriating capital from China and investor concerns over the country's high number of suspended stocks. The 169 stocks can be easily accessed by foreigners through the  Stock Connect  link launched in 2014 and significantly expanded in December.  MSCI said it had increased the selection to include a further 53 domestic Chinese stocks that are also listed in the Hong Kong market, and which will be better known to foreign investors. Chinese companies listed overseas already account for 28 percent of the EM Index as of May but the addition of domestic, yuan-denominated China stocks could see the country account for as much as 40 percent of MSCI's Emerging Market Index in the future.  The A-share market, including shares from Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, is worth roughly $7.5 trillion, the world's largest after the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.  BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest asset manager, endorsed MSCI's decision.  We believe our clients will benefit from today's decision to bring Chinese equities into mainstream investment,  said Ryan Stork, BlackRock's chairman for the Asia-Pacific in Hong Kong and one of the company's most senior executives, in an emailed statement. Failing to upgrade Argentina means the country remains in MSCI's smaller frontier markets index, where it has been since 2009. Nigeria will also remain a frontier market, with the possibility of being downgraded to  standalone  status.

The government and local authority's response to the Grenfell Tower blaze has been widely criticized, with complaints from bereaved families and people who lost their homes that they were not given any information or support by official agencies.  The purpose of the Independent Public Advocate is to keep the bereaved and surviving victims of disasters informed of progress in any relevant investigation and make them fully aware how they can contribute to that investigation,  said the government in a document detailing its legislative program for the next two years.  The Public Advocate would ensure that, in the event of disasters involving multiple fatalities and where there are numerous persons affected, no individuals or families are sidelined in what will necessarily be large and complex proceedings,  the document said. Prime Minister Theresa May, already politically weakened since losing her parliamentary majority in a June 8 election, was heavily criticized for her personal handling of the tower fire, which was perceived to be insensitive. On a first visit to the scene of the disaster, she met only senior members of the emergency services and stayed away from people affected by the blaze and members of the local community. On a return visit during which she did meet people who had been caught up in the tragedy, she was booed and heckled by a crowd.

After snapping Cleveland's winning streak at six games, Manny Machado and the Orioles go for their fourth win in five games as the teams continue a four-game set at Baltimore's Camden Yards. Manager Buck Showalter resisted the urge to move Machado to shortstop after J.J. Hardy suffered a broken wrist on the weekend and his third baseman looked locked in by belting a pair of homers as part of a 4-for-4 night in Tuesday's 6-5 victory. Still, the Orioles have plenty of concerns over after giving up at least five runs for the 17th consecutive game -- three shy of the major league mark set by Philadelphia in 1924.

Carrasco has made four career appearances (three starts) versus the Orioles, going 1-2 with a 3.79 ERA. Gausman continues to give up hits in alarming numbers (107 in 75 innings) and his WHIP of 1.92 is easily the worst in the major leagues. The 26-year-old has allowed at least eight hits in seven consecutive starts, including last time out when he was tagged for five runs in 5 2/3 innings versus St. Louis.

The Cubs begin the day just one-half game behind division-leading Milwaukee as they aim for a fourth straight victory and a three-game sweep of the visiting San Diego Padres. Some of the blame for Chicago’s disappointing start falls on an inconsistent lineup, but moving slugging first baseman Anthony Rizzo to the leadoff spot has helped spark the offense. Rizzo has reached base to open the game in all seven contests since moving to the top of the order, the longest streak by a Cubs leadoff man since Richie Ashburn in 1960. He’s the first player in the last 60 years to reach in his first plate appearance in each of his first seven games batting leadoff, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

The Angels gave the Yankees the first two of their seven straight losses when the teams met in California last week and then opened this set with an 8-3 triumph, outhitting the hosts by a 14-4 margin. The slide is the longest for New York since an identical one in 2007 and the franchise has not lost eight in a row since 1995.

The BoE's eight policymakers split 5-3 when they voted to keep interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.25 percent last week, a closer outcome than expected by investors. In a speech published on Wednesday, Haldane, who voted to keep rates unchanged last week, said he was likely to change his vote in the coming months.  Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year,  he said. In August last year the BoE cut interest rates to 0.25 percent and took other measures to give the economy boost after signs of a sharp slowdown after the Brexit vote in June. Haldane said the risk of moving too late with a first rate hike in a decade had grown after British economic growth and, to a lesser extent, inflation had proved more resilient than expected. Haldane said he had decided not to vote for a rate hike last week because there were few signs of wage growth picking up and because there was  still some chance  of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the economy.  Both are reasons for monetary policy not to rush its fences. Nor does it need to do so, given the slow build of nominal pressures in the economy,  he said. Furthermore, the inconclusive outcome of Britain's national election earlier this month - which cost Prime Minister Theresa May her majority in parliament - had  thrown up a dust-cloud of uncertainty , he said.  It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers,  Haldane said.  I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust cloud has started to settle.  In a speech delivered on Tuesday, BoE Governor Carney said he first wanted to see how the economy coped with Brexit talks in coming months before he would consider a rate hike.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings. Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2sQaEQL These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021. Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them. Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment's $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury's nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday. Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent. Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings. Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line. Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity. “The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.  Being Mindful of Tax Planning  Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments. “It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.” Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.” Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities. Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock. “From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said. Coal Interest Dates to 2011 Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014. Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy. Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them. Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia. Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs. Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts. But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter. According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.

New Jersey-based J&J; has been battling a series of lawsuits over its talc-based products, including Johnson's Baby Powder, brought by around 5,950 women and their families. The company denies any link between talc and cancer. A fifth of the plaintiffs have cases pending in state court in St. Louis, where juries in four trials have hit J&J; and a talc supplier with $307 million in verdicts. Those four cases and most of the others on the St. Louis docket involve out-of-state plaintiffs suing an out-of-state company. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in a case involving Bristol-Myers Squibb Co that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state when the alleged injuries did not occur there. The ruling immediately led a St. Louis judge at J&J;'s urging to declare a mistrial in the latest talc case, in which two of the three women at issue were from out of state. It also could imperil prior verdicts and cases that have yet to go to trial.  We believe the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Bristol-Myers Squibb matter requires reversal of the talc cases that are currently under appeal in St. Louis,  J&J; said in a statement. The question of where such lawsuits can be filed has been the subject of fierce debate. The business community has argued plaintiffs should not be allowed to shop around for the most favorable court to bring lawsuits, while injured parties claim corporations are trying to deny them access to justice. Along with talc cases, large-scale litigation alleging injuries from Bayer AG's Essure birth control device in Missouri and California and GlaxoSmithKline's antidepressant Paxil in California and Illinois are examples of other cases where defendants could utilize the Supreme Court decision. Although he declared a mistrial on Monday, St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison left the door open for the plaintiffs to argue they still have jurisdiction. Plaintiffs lawyer Ted Meadows said he would argue the St. Louis court still had jurisdiction based on a Missouri-based bottler J&J; used to package its talc products, which he said would create a sufficient connection to the state.  It's very disappointing to mistry a case because the Supreme Court changed the rules on us,  said Meadows. The lawsuit decided by the high court on Monday involved claims against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp by 86 California residents and 575 non-Californians over the blood thinner Plavix. Beyond Monday's mistrial, the Supreme Court's ruling could bolster a pending appeal by J&J; of a $72 million verdict in favor of the family of Alabama resident Jacqueline Fox, who died in 2015. A Missouri appeals court had said in May it would wait until the Supreme Court issued its decision to decide the appeal. J&J; has won only one of the five trials so far in Missouri. It previously sought to move talc cases out of St. Louis, but the Missouri Supreme Court in January denied its bid. The company has also cast the St. Louis court as overly plaintiff-friendly and has allowed evidence linking talc to cancer that was rejected by a New Jersey state court judge overseeing over 200 talc cases. The plaintiffs are appealing. The talc verdicts against J&J; led the business-friendly American Tort Reform Association last year to declare the St. Louis state court the nation's top  Judicial Hellhole.  Now J&J; could try to use the Supreme Court ruling to dismiss many of the cases it faces in Missouri, according to legal experts. Corporations facing a large volume of cases in venues chosen by plaintiffs will likely cite the Supreme Court to try to dismiss those claims, said Rusty Perdew, a defense lawyer at the law firm Locke Lord.  You have a bunch of defendants who can go back and say, 'Judge, you got that wrong and you're going to have to dismiss claims by all those plaintiffs,'  he said.

Growth was set to rebound to 2.7 percent from 0.7 percent in 2016, the World Bank said in an update on the economy. But it warned that underlying problems would bring that rate below the 1 percent mark again in 2018/19.  While a good harvest is projected to boost GDP in 2017, sustaining robust long-term growth will require addressing underlying fiscal and financial sector imbalance,  the bank said. The central government’s fiscal cash deficit widened to 10 percent of GDP in 2016, up from 2.3 percent the previous year, the bank said.  The deficit was largely financed from domestic financial markets as external arrears prevented Zimbabwe from gaining access to international capital markets. Cash shortages followed, financing for imports dried up, and the current account deficit narrowed dramatically.  Zimbabwe has struggled to feed itself since 2001 - a plight largely blamed on frequent droughts and President Robert Mugabe's seizures of white-owned farms, which hit commercial agriculture production and dented economic growth. The World Bank said Zimbabwe was weighed down by high levels of public spending - amounting to roughly 50 percent of gross domestic product. Harare's total debt stock would continue to grow, the bank added, putting pressure on Mugabe's government to stick to commitments to bring down fiscal deficits ahead of national elections in 2018. The bank also said it saw 3.2 percent annual inflation rate for 2017 followed by a sharp acceleration to 9.6 percent at the end of 2018. Ninety-three year-old Mugabe's four decade rule has been dogged by soaring consumer price growth and deep funding shortages since international institutions stopped lending to it in 1999. Zimbabwe owes more than $7 billion in arrears to foreign lenders. Responding to the report, the country's Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa said Harare was on track to woo back lenders by proving government's commitment to cut spending and speed up repayments on loans.  We remain committed to the reengagement exercise (with foreign lenders) but the process has remained painfully slow. As government we remain committed to re-engage the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and African Development Bank,  said Chinamasa.

The U.S. index provider said on Tuesday it would add 222 China-listed stocks to its Emerging Markets Index, tracked by around $1.6 trillion, in what analysts and investors described as a gesture designed to end a four-year impasse with regulators over China's remaining market controls. But they said it could still take as long as a decade for MSCI to include Chinese shares at the country's full weighting, citing ongoing uncertainty over the pace of reform, the risk of regulatory shifts and weak corporate governance.  MSCI is at a crossroads. There has been a bit of a stand-off between MSCI and the Chinese regulators, with both parties keen for inclusion to happen - but there are still all these issues unresolved,  said Douglas Morton, Head of Research Asia at Northern Trust Capital Markets.  The government does step in to support the market. From an international investor's point of view, there are concerns that this is not a freely floated index,  said Morton, noting Western governments were not immune to similar interventions. Although China has made strides with its liberalization agenda, it has also proved willing to temporarily row-back on reforms at times of crisis. Beijing intervened heavily in the stock market during the 2015 crash, imposing a raft of capital controls only months before the International Monetary Fund made a decision to include the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies.     MSCI has been in discussions with Chinese regulators and global investors for four years over whether to add yuan-denominated shares to the benchmark, but long excluded them because of restricted access to China's equity markets. The company said it could add a selection of 222 large-cap stocks at a tiny weight of just 0.73 percent, because these shares can be easily traded through a Hong Kong-China  Connect  link. Increasing that weighting will require further market liberalization, from allowing capital to flow more freely in and out of equities to addressing the high number of stocks that are suspended for long periods. The MSCI logo is seen in this June 20, 2017 illustration photo.Thomas White/IllustrationLong March Sebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI, said he could not provide an indicative timeline for full inclusion, or an initial weighting increase.  It's really in the hands of the Chinese stakeholders, they are dictating the timing,  he told reporters. Global investors Schroders, Robeco and Manulife asset management estimated full inclusion could take as long as a decade - longer than already protracted processes for South Korea and Taiwan.  I think it could take five to 10 years for China to be represented at half its total weight in the global indices. In terms of the uplift in inclusion factor, I'd be surprised if they make a following adjustment next year,  said David MacKenzie, head of Asian Equity Management at Schroders.  And China still has hearts and minds to win elsewhere. Despite MSCI's move, Mark Makepeace, CEO of MSCI rival FTSE Russell, which compiles the other major emerging market benchmark, told Reuters that many investors continued to have reservations about the China market.   The obligations of China with respect to opening up to international investors in the event of inclusion need to be clear,  he said in an interview. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's securities watchdog, said in a statement that inclusion was  both an opportunity and a challenge for reform  and that China would continue to try to internationalize its market while promoting stability at home.  A  share inclusion and an influx of institutional investors should help promote Beijing's reform agenda over the long term, but investors worry the addition of the new shares, the bulk of which will be in China's troubled financial and industrial sectors, also poses near-term risk.  In our experience, many Chinese A-share managements have yet to fully grasp the duties imposed by a listing, not to mention inclusion in a global index,  said Gary Greenberg, head of emerging markets at Hermes Investment Management, in a note.  The ability to communicate with foreign investors, even in companies with worldwide operations, tends to be less than world class. For businesses with top line revenues that can top $15 billion, this should have been fixed by now.

The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2rUnVCT * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2sSBGH9 * Chart 3: tmsnrt.rs/2tsrYIE By John Kemp LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Crude prices are likely to remain under pressure until there are signs the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States is stabilising or reversing lower. U.S. exploration and production firms have hired 530 extra drilling rigs since the end of May 2016 - 431 to target oil and 99 to focus on gas - according to oilfield services firm Baker Hughes. As a result, U.S. crude and natural gas liquids production is forecast to increase by 780,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and by more than 1 million bpd in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). U.S. producers will seize more than half of the projected growth in global liquids consumption of 1.54 million bpd in 2017 and 1.62 million bpd in 2018 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, June 2017). Experience suggests the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its non-OPEC allies led by Russia will eventually respond by increasing their own output to protect market share against the threat from U.S. shale producers. The prospect of a renewed rise in OPEC output and global oil inventories during 2018 has thrown oil prices onto the defensive over the last four months. A continued rise in U.S. output during the rest of this year is unavoidable given the large number of extra rigs put to work in the first half. The lag between spudding a new well and first commercial production averages about six months, so extra rigs in the first half will ensure continued growth in output during the second half. But the fall in prices, if sustained, will eventually cause the rig count to stabilise, curbing growth in output next year. The breakeven price for drilling new wells varies considerably among shale plays and even between different parts of the same play. But a recent survey of producers in the major shale plays conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas showed most needed U.S. crude prices of $45-50 to break even (“Dallas Fed Energy Survey”, March 29). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices have already declined more than $11 per barrel, over 20 percent, since their recent peak and are now below $44 per barrel. Exploration and production firms have added an extra 145 oil-focused rigs in the last 16 weeks even as WTI prices have fallen. (tmsnrt.rs/2rUnVCT) But the oil rig count typically responds to changes in WTI prices with an average lag of 15-20 weeks so it should stabilise and turn lower within the next four weeks (tmsnrt.rs/2sSBGH9 and tmsnrt.rs/2tsrYIE). Until the rig count starts to stabilise, however, oil traders are likely to continue driving prices lower to try to uncover the pain threshold that forces shale firms to scale back drilling. Prices are likely to overshoot on the downside, as traders drive them lower than necessary owing to the lags in the system, which will create conditions for a subsequent rally. Once stabilisation occurs, it should provide some support for prices, and the relatively large number of hedge fund short positions should then help fuel a limited rally once fund managers start to cover them. Hedge fund managers added nearly 70 million barrels of extra short positions in WTI and Brent between the end of May and the middle of June, and are likely to have added even more since then. First, however, oil traders need a clear sign that the drilling fleet is stabilising.

After Prime Minister Theresa May failed to win a majority in an early election on June 8, there had been uncertainty about how much of her Conservative Party's pre-election policy goals would be put before parliament. The plans published on Wednesday showed the budget deficit reduction goals are little changed from those set out by finance minister Philip Hammond in March. He is due to present a budget update later this year.  We will reflect on the message voters sent at the general election - while always remembering that we have to balance the books,  the government said in a statement setting out the legislation it wanted to pass over the next two years.  These rules take a balanced approach, combining the flexibility to support the economy if necessary in the near term, and the commitment to return the public finances to a sustainable position in the long term,  the statement added, echoing earlier language from Hammond. March's budget pencilled in a somewhat faster pace of deficit reduction than needed to reach the government's longer-term goal to balance the budget, giving it a bit of room for manoeuvre to loosen spending controls if needed. After the election, Hammond said he was  not deaf  to signs of weariness among voters about Britain's near decade-long grip on public spending which has come under renewed criticism after a deadly fire in a London tower block. Plans to raise Britain's minimum wage for workers aged 25 and over to 60 percent of median earnings by 2020 also remained intact despite concern about its cost for employers from some business groups and labour market analysts.

No economically viable discoveries have been made on the Faroese shelf but the tiny nation hopes to entice energy firms to restart exploration as it shows them new geological data in London on Wednesday.  Oil firms have in many ways shown interest. We are having meetings, they buy data from us, visit us on the Faroe Islands ... So there is an interest and they are looking at the possibilities,  survey director Niels Christian Nolsoe said. He declined to identify any of the companies but said bigger firms could put up the necessary cash, adding that companies present in the UK Shetland region also might be interested. Companies including Norway's Statoil and DONG Energy have previously held licences in the Faroe Islands, where no firm currently holds any.  We left the Faroe Islands in 2015 and have no plans about entering again,  said a Statoil spokesman. The seabed is mostly covered by thick basalt layers, which make the Faroese offshore areas difficult to explore despite promising geological and seismic surveys. The seismic data now available and collected by companies such as Norway's PGS gives a much better understanding than when exploration started some 16 years ago, Nolsoe said. In the fourth licensing round, running until February 2018, the Faroe Islands is offering licences in an area covering 30,000 square metres on the eastern part of the shelf bordering the western Shetland region.  Only nine wells have been drilled in a huge area and big discoveries have been made in the Shetlands, so if you look at where there could be some big undiscovered findings, the possibility is greatest in our area,  he said. In March, Hurricane Energy announced an oil discovery in the Halifax well in the West Shetland region, which it said could be Britain's largest undeveloped oil find. BP started production at the Quad 204 project in the West Shetland region in May after a $5.7 billion redevelopment, one of the largest such projects there in recent years that will breathe new life into the ageing offshore basin. However, a persistent slump in oil prices and thus strict cash discipline among oil firms could curb interest in the undeveloped North Atlantic region.  The oil price is a challenge ... on the other hand, the oil industry has also reduced its costs,  he said.

While Luanda rose, all UK cities fell significantly in this year's rankings which were released on Wednesday, with 30th-ranked London dropping 13 places from 2016.  The survey, conducted by global consulting firm Mercer, suggested that the country's vote to leave the European Union had played a role in the drop by causing the value of sterling to fall.

Building on its success in conventional banking, Dubai announced in 2013 a drive to promote sharia-compliant business in the financial industry and other sectors. The city state wants to become a centre for sukuk issuance, challenging the global dominance of Malaysia, as well as a centre for other Islamic financial transactions and Islamic finance scholarship. These goals could become harder to achieve if the Dana Gas case is not resolved in a way that reassures a broad spectrum of investors that the United Arab Emirates' sukuk market is safe. The UAE company is arguing that since its sukuk were issued in 2013, they have become invalid under UAE law  due to the evolution and continual development of Islamic financial instruments and their interpretation . Some investors fear this approach could make sukuk in general more risky, by allowing issuers to avoid honouring their obligations simply by claiming religious standards had changed. Mohieddine Kronfol, chief investment officer for Middle East fixed income at Franklin Templeton Investments, said the global sukuk market could weather the storm as it has over $400 billion of outstanding paper from diverse issuers. But Dubai's market may not be so fortunate, he said.  This case, depending on the outcome from the competent courts of the UAE, may very well put into question Dubai's ambition,  said Kronfol, whose firm has over $744 billion in assets under management around the world. Hasnain Malik, head of global equities research at Exotix Partners in Dubai, said that if Dana ended up setting a precedent, it could affect future deals and deter foreign buyers of Islamic debt.  New sukuk sales might be delayed until this situation unfolds.  The Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre, a government body which promotes the emirate's initiatives in the sector, declined to comment. Last month, it announced plans to develop a national Islamic re-insurance company and a central advisory body that would streamline provision of sharia review services to Islamic financial institutions in the UAE. Court Dana says it wants a consensual agreement with creditors to exchange its existing sukuk for new, four-year Islamic instruments offering much lower profit rates. If creditors can ultimately agree on a deal, the controversy may die down. Otherwise, it is likely to be settled in the courts. According to the prospectus, Dana's sukuk are governed by English law. But the gas production assets behind the sukuk fall under UAE law, and Dana has involved the UAE court system by asking the Federal Court of First Instance in the emirate of Sharjah to rule the instruments are unlawful and unenforceable. Pending an initial hearing on the application scheduled for Dec. 25 - well after the sukuk are due to mature in October - Dana has obtained an injunction from the Sharjah court blocking claims for payments on the paper, the company said. This is alarming for international holders of the sukuk, which include major global fund managers. Instead of being treated as a default under English common law, the case revolves around the actual legality of the contracts under UAE law, which is based on civil law and is unfamiliar to many of them.  Trying to pursue this in UAE courts sets a very poor precedent for UAE sukuk - it's damaging to the prospect of other issuances coming out of UAE going forward,  said a fund manager directly involved with Dana as both shareholder and creditor. A London-based banker following the case said much would depend on whether the UAE court proceeded with the case or set aside the argument of sharia non-compliance, which could send the case back to English courts. That would mirror decisions from previous legal cases where English courts have disregarded sharia compliance, treating disputes purely according to the terms of the transaction, he said.  If the UAE courts do not recognise this, then it could be the end of UAE-based Islamic finance,  because investors would face an additional level of sharia-related risk every time they bought sukuk, he added.

U.S. index provider MSCI said China had made enough progress in opening up its markets, paving the way for adding a selection of 222 large-cap stocks, which would represent a 0.73 percent weighting on the benchmark.     The bulk of the shares will be of financial and industrial companies, and will be included via a two-phase process in May and August next year.       The inclusion of China shares on MSCI's Emerging Market Index would displace shares of other emerging markets,  said Jeffrey Lucero, equity research analyst with RCBC Securities.     Meanwhile, benchmark oil prices slid to seven-month lows, as investors discounted evidence of strong compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC producers with a deal to cut global output.     Singapore shares fell 0.9 percent to close at its lowest in three weeks, with financial and industrial sectors contributing most of the losses.     Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd fell 1.6 percent, while Singapore Telecommunications Ltd fell 1.1 percent.       Philippine shares closed 0.4 percent lower ahead of its central bank policy meeting on Thursday, where it is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate steady at 3.0 percent.     However some economists expect the central bank to adopt a more hawkish tone to lay the groundwork for a tighter policy in the second half of this year to head off inflation pressures.     Index heavyweight PLDT Inc ended 2.4 percent lower and Ayala Land lost 1.5 percent.      Malaysian shares edged down 0.3 percent, posting their third straight day of losses.      Government data showed consumer prices in May were 3.9 percent higher than a year earlier, slightly below the 4.0 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.     Indonesian shares rose 0.5 percent, driven by gains in the financial sector.      Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk PT gained 2.2 percent and Unilever Indonesia Tbk PT gained 1.6 percent.

The firm also forecasts April-June earnings to exceed that of three months prior on expectations of lending growth, Chuchat Petaumpai said in an interview.  This quarter is the planting season and the start of school and that is boosting demand for loans,  Chuchat said, referring to the need for farming machinery and motorcycles. The forecast comes after Thailand's military government introduced various measures to help farmers, such as buying crops at fixed prices, to boost local economies and help meet its economic growth forecast of 3.3 to 3.8 percent this year from 3.2 percent last year. The farming sector accounts for 40 percent of Muangthai's loan book, and demand should continue during the current period of bumper crops and due to government support, Chuchat said.  When there are problems, either droughts or flooding, the government will come to help farmers,  Chuchat said. In January-March, Muangthai booked 536 million baht ($15.75 million) in profit, a rise of 91 percent from the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 81 percent to 1.56 billion baht. Motorcycle sales grew 1.6 percent over the period to 464,783 units, a rate that reached 6.6 percent by May with 773,748 units, showed data from the Federation of Thailand Industries. Chuchat said, for the whole year, revenue and profit will likely grow 50 percent, though cost increases will pull down its net interest margin slightly to 19 to 20 percent, from 20.2 percent last year. Its accounts receivable stood at 26 billion baht as at March-end. Chuchat also said Muangthai plans to follow up a 4 billion baht bond sale last month with another sale in August or September, though the size of the sale is yet to be determined. Muangthai, with over 4,500 employees at 2,000 branches, aims to have 2,200 by the end of 2017 and expand into Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam after 2020, Chuchat said. To attract institutional investors, Muangthai is planning roadshows in July-September in Europe, Hong Kong and the United States.

The South African-based lender also said it would challenge in court a finding by the agency, published in a report this week, that Barclays had unduly benefited from an apartheid-era bailout. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of South Africa's constitutionally-sanctioned anti-graft watchdog, called on Monday for the central bank's mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to be changed to focus on economic growth.   Her recommended amendments pose a very serious risk to the financial system and they cannot be allowed to stand,  Barclays Africa said in a statement. The ruling African National Congress's secretary general Gwede Mantashe and the central bank itself have also criticized Mkhwebane's proposal, which has further stained South Africa's image as an investor-friendly emerging market, coming less than a week after Mines Minister Mosebenzi Zwane spooked mining investors with a revised plan to revamp the sector's black ownership rules. Mkhwebane made her recommendation in a report by the agency, published on Monday, which also said the apartheid government breached the constitution by supplying Bankorp, which was acquired by Absa, now Barclays Africa, in 1992, with a series of bailouts from 1985 to 1995.

Countries including Austria, the Netherlands, France and Italy have seen a sharp rise in popularity of parties with eurosceptic, often anti-immigration policies, but in recent months these have suffered decisive defeats in elections. Tusk, the president of the council of EU heads of states and governments, said the bloc was now again starting to be perceived as a solution, rather the problem, and that recent difficulties had served to strengthen it.  It is fair to say that we will meet in a different political context from that of a few months ago, when the anti-EU forces were on the rise,  Tusk wrote.  The current developments on the continent seem to indicate that we are slowly turning the corner. In many of our countries, the political parties that have built their strength on anti-EU sentiments are beginning to diminish,  he said. In Britain, the Conservative government of Prime Minister Theresa May lost its majority in parliament earlier this month, scuppering May's stated aim of bolstering her mandate for negotiating Britain's exit from the EU. In France, Emmanuel Macron decisively won presidential and parliamentary elections on a agenda of support for the EU and reforms, soundly beating Marine Le Pen's far right National Front, which for the first time in its history reached a second round in a presidential vote.  We are witnessing the return of the EU rather as a solution, not a problem. Paradoxically, the tough challenges of the recent months have made us more united than before,  Tusk said. Apart from Brexit, the EU is also facing a major immigration challenge which, though abated, is still fuelling anti-EU sentiment. Some blame the EU for not acting fast enough to stop the inflow of migrants arriving from the Middle East and Africa. A series of attacks by Islamist militants in Britain, France, Sweden, Germany and Belgium, in which hundreds were killed, have added to concerns. To further stem migration flows, Tusk said the EU should give more money to support Libyan Navy Coastguards to help stop people being smuggled into the EU by sea. There is also discontent over unfettered global trade, perceived as a threat to jobs in Europe.  Therefore, during the upcoming European Council, I want us to move further on our policy response in these three areas,  Tusk said in the letter to the leaders. He said that while the EU could not replace governments in fighting home-grown militants, it could put pressure on technology firms to act against  content that spreads terrorist material or incites to violence.  Europe should also set up joint defence capabilities to improve security, Tusk said, and he also called for better instruments to defend EU trade against unfair competition and  uncontrolled globalisation .

Trump has held high hopes for greater cooperation from China to exert influence over North Korea, leaning heavily on Chinese President Xi Jinping for his assistance. The two leaders had a high-profile summit in Florida in April and Trump has frequently praised Xi while resisting criticizing Chinese trade practices.  While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!  Trump wrote on Twitter. It was unclear whether his remark represented a significant shift in his thinking in the U.S. struggle to stop North Korea's nuclear program and its test launching of missiles or a change in U.S. policy toward China.  I think the president is signaling some frustration,  Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, told MSNBC.  He's signaling to others that he understands this isn't working, and he's trying to defend himself, or justify himself, by saying that at least they tried as opposed to others who didn't even try.  China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that China had made  unremitting efforts  to resolve tensions on the Korean peninsula, and that it had  always played and important and constructive role .  China's efforts to resolve the peninsula nuclear issue is not due to any external pressure, but because China is a member of the region and a responsible member of the international community, and because resolving the peninsula nuclear issue is in China's interests,  ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing.  On Tuesday, a U.S. official, who did not want to be identified, said U.S. spy satellites had detected movements recently at North Korea's nuclear test site near a tunnel entrance, but it was unclear if these were preparations for a new nuclear test - perhaps to coincide with high-level talks between the United States and China in Washington on Wednesday. “North Korea remains prepared to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time when there is an order from leadership but there are no new unusual indications that can be shared,” a South Korean Defense Ministry official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  Related CoverageChina says it is making unremitting efforts on North Korea nuclear issueSeoul was in close consultation with Washington over the matter, the official added.     North Korea last tested a nuclear bomb in September, but it has conducted repeated missile test since and vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, putting it at the forefront of Trump's security worries. u.s.-China Dialogue The Trump statement about China was likely to increase pressure on Beijing ahead of Wednesday's Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, which will pair U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis with China's top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, and General Fang Fenghui, chief of joint staff of the People's Liberation Army. The State Department says the dialogue will focus on ways to increase pressure on North Korea, but also cover such areas as counter-terrorism and territorial rivalries in the South China Sea. U.S. President Donald Trump (L) and China's President Xi Jinping walk along the front patio of the Mar-a-Lago estate after a bilateral meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 7, 2017.Carlos BarriaThe U.S. side is expected to press China to cooperate on a further toughening of international sanctions on North Korea. The United States and its allies would like to see an oil embargo and bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers among other moves, steps diplomats say have been resisted by China and Russia. In a sign that U.S.-Chinese relations remain stable, a White House aide said Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, were invited by the Chinese government to visit the country later this year. Trump has hardened his rhetoric against North Korea following the death of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who died on Monday in the United States after returning from captivity in North Korea in a coma.  A Disgrace  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects the defence detachment on Jangjae Islet and the Hero Defence Detachment on Mu Islet located in the southernmost part of the waters off the southwest front, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on May 5, 2017. KCNA/ via REUTERSIn a White House meeting with visiting Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko, Trump criticized the way Warmbier's case was handled in the year since his arrest, appearing to assail both North Korea and his predecessor, President Barack Obama.  What happened to Otto is a disgrace. And I spoke with his family. His family is incredible ... but he should have been brought home a long time ago,  Trump said. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States holds North Korea accountable for Warmbier's  unjust imprisonment  and urged Pyongyang to release three other Americans who are detained. Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times, published by the official People's Daily, said Chinese officials must be wary that Warmbier's death might push Washington to put greater pressure on Beijing.  China has made the utmost efforts to help break the stalemate in the North Korean nuclear issue. But by no means will China, nor will Chinese society permit it to, act as a 'U.S. ally' in pressuring North Korea,  the Global Times said in an editorial. If Washington imposes sanctions on Chinese enterprises, it would lead to  grave friction  between the two countries, said the paper, which does not represent Chinese government policy. Trump's tweet about China took some advisers by surprise. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had limited options to rein in North Korea without Chinese assistance. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said a meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is less likely following Warmbier's death.

Fowle, 59, is one of 16 Americans who have been imprisoned by the reclusive state over the last two decades, including three who remain detained. Like student Otto Warmbier, he visited North Korea with a tour group and was taken into custody at the airport when trying to leave. But Fowle was released in relatively good physical health after a six-month detention. Warmbier, 22, died at a Cincinnati hospital on Monday, just days after he was released from captivity in a coma. The family declined an autopsy.  Otto Warmbier’s death was a sudden tragedy for all of America,  Fowle said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.  It doesn’t take much to get in trouble in North Korea.  Both men committed infractions that would be considered minor in most parts of the world. Fowle left a Bible behind in a nightclub in the coastal city in Chongjin. Warmbier was convicted for trying to steal a banner linked to former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il from a Pyongyang hotel used by foreign tourists. However, in the eyes of North Korea, where Kim Jong Il is revered as a demigod and proselytizing is seen as an assault on the state, the two had committed heinous crimes. Fowle spent nearly a month of his detention in a hotel for foreigners and then was moved to a guest house in another part of Pyongyang. Like others held under varying terms of detention, from cramped, windowless shacks offering little protection from the country's bitter cold to hotel rooms, Fowle recalled the sense of isolation he felt. Kenneth Bae speaks upon returning from North Korea during a news conference at U.S. Air Force Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Fort Lewis, Washington, United States on November 8, 2014.David Ryder/File Photo The emotional strain was high, especially during the early part of my detention when I was coached on how to formulate my admission of guilt,  Fowle said, adding,  I was never physically abused.  The longest-serving of the American prisoners, Christian missionary Kenneth Bae, has said he had to shovel coal, haul rocks and had about 30 guards keeping watch over him as their sole prisoner during his two years in captivity beginning in 2012.  Although we don’t know everything about life in North Korea, this much is sure: innocent people like Otto are suffering,  Bae said in a statement after Warmbier's death. The news of Warmbier’s death reminded George Hunziker, 59, of his younger brother Evan’s imprisonment in North Korea after being charged with spying in 1996. Evan Hunziker, then 26, was held for three months and committed suicide about a month after his return to the United States. George Hunziker said his brother was young like Warmbier and did not realize the seriousness of his actions. He swam from China across the border with North Korea and was arrested. He was later charged with spying.  “You're in America and you think you can do stuff and there's no consequences, but in North Korea you don't have those same privileges,” he said. “I wish somebody could do something about those crazy people over there.”      For a graphic on Americans detained by North Korea click tmsnrt.rs/2pmE3ks Reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas and Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Lisa Shumaker","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-northkorea-detainee-prisoners-idUSKBN19B387"},

The Financial Conduct Authority said it was intervening after seeing cases of poor advice. The British government introduced  pension freedoms  in 2015, allowing people to cash in pension pots built up from investments made via defined contribution schemes. Previously, they had to use the pots to buy an annuity, which pays a fixed income for life. These rules also allow people to transfer money from defined benefit, or final salary schemes, which also pay a fixed income for life, into alternative investments such as defined contribution pensions. The transfer values of defined benefit pensions - considered as  gold plated  pensions - have risen to historically high levels, making it potentially attractive to take the money and invest it in a different scheme. The FCA said on Wednesday the proposed changes included a clarification that the onus is on the adviser to prove that a transfer is in the client's best interests. They also replace the current transfer value analysis with a comparison that would show the value of the benefits being given up.  This does not represent a softening of our approach, but makes it clear that is essential for an adviser to demonstrate that an individual will benefit from giving up a valuable pension.  Most consumers will be best advised to keep their defined benefit pension, the FCA said.  Our new approach should better equip advisers to give the right advice so that consumers make well-informed decisions,  FCA executive director of strategy and competition, Christopher Woolard, said in a statement. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association said almost 11 million people belong to a private sector defined benefit scheme, and nearly all those schemes have received a transfer request in the last six months. The FCA said it also wanted to hear views on whether there should be specific qualification and experience requirements for a pension transfer specialist. People must take financial advice if they want to transfer benefits worth more than 30,000 pounds, a step taken after a string of pension mis-selling scandals in the 1980s and 1990s. The watchdog will publish its new rules by early 2018. Reporting by Huw Jones and Carolyn Cohn.

Almost 10 percent of China's refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world's top crude importer is stuttering further.  West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China's reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.  Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina's Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.  Petrochina's Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.  Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.  Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.   Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,  said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.  Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.  Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China's 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.  To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.   China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,  said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.  FILE PHOTO: Employees close a valve of a pipe at a PetroChina refinery in Lanzhou, Gansu province January 7, 2011.Stringer/File PhotoThe lower refinery throughput should reduce China's demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.  From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.     But Don't Write China Off  The imminent cuts in China's refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.  However, traders say that China's voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.  Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.   I'd expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,  said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.  Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.  As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.  Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.  Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.   China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China's buying,  said Berentsen.

South Africa is planning to build 9,600 megawatts (MW) of nuclear capacity, a project that could be one of the world's biggest nuclear contracts in decades. Kubayi, who was in Moscow leading a South African delegation at to nuclear conference, said she was a member of a cabinet committee chaired by President Jacob Zuma which was drawing up responses to recession and that the committee would study the nuclear plans. The country has technically entered recession after two quarters of economic contraction, and the procurement process for the nuclear project has been disrupted by a court ruling which declared a nuclear pact between South Africa and Russia unlawful.  We will do the nuclear project at a scale and pace that we can afford. So we will look at that completely, if we need to review the scale we have obviously to go back,  Kubayi told a news conference. In response to a question on the firm that South Africa could choose to build new nuclear reactors, Kubayi said it was important to go for  the most experienced people who have a track record . Russian state firm Rosatom is a contender to build the nuclear reactors and has been talking up its chances of winning the contract, given delays and cost overruns at French competitor Areva and Japanese-owned Westinghouse. Kubayi met Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Rosatom head Alexei Likhachev on her visit to Russia, agreeing with Likhachev that South African and Russian technical teams would initiate discussions on cooperation. She said it was too early to give an exact date on when the procurement process for the nuclear project could restart and that South Africa was reviewing intergovernmental agreements with many countries following the High Court ruling against the Russian nuclear pact.

Lewis is in the best place I have seen him during any of the last five years since he joined the team,  the Austrian said this week.  Not only because he had a great weekend in Montreal, but because he is coping so well with the difficult days. This is what the very best are made of.  Hamilton will also be keen to banish the memory of a disappointing first visit to the anti-clockwise track running along the shores of the Caspian Sea and around the walls of the medieval old town.

He then struggled with engine modes before eventually finishing fifth. His then team mate and eventual champion Nico Rosberg, who retired at the end of last season, took pole, fastest lap and victory in a race that was designated the European Grand Prix but has since changed name. That means that nobody on the current starting grid is a previous winner in Baku and only Vettel, who was a distant second that day, and Force India's Mexican Sergio Perez have stood on the podium there.

Hamilton will apply the lessons from both to the searing heat of Baku.  You take each experience and you pile them up. What we learned in Monaco will definitely impact Baku. It's a much longer circuit; I think it's very smooth, a lot more flat,  he told reporters.  Downforce efficiency is going to be important there.  Hamilton and Vettel both have three wins from seven races, with champions Mercedes -- despite trying to portray themselves as underdogs -- ahead 4-3 thanks to Valtteri Bottas's win in Russia. Bottas clocked the highest ever recorded speed in a Formula One session during qualifying in Baku last year with Williams, hitting 373 kph on the longest straight of any race on the calendar. Vettel showed all his mettle in Canada, however, when he started on the front row, dropped to last and came back through the field to fourth with a fighting display that earned him the Driver of the Day award.  I wanted to get a trophy. I didn't get one,  he said after his first non-podium finish of the year. He should resolve that on Sunday.

Milestone Williams rookie Lance Stroll scored his first Formula One points in his home race in Montreal. He is now the only Canadian driver without the surname Villeneuve to score. The points also made the 18-year-old the second youngest scorer of all time.

Atlas Mara, which has been buying up banking assets with the aim of becoming the leading bank in Africa, plans to sell US$100m of new shares to Fairfax Africa and existing investors, and sell US$100m of mandatory convertible bonds to Fairfax. Fairfax Africa will invest at least US$130m and up to the full US$200m, which will give it a stake of between 35% and just below 50% in Atlas Mara.  With Fairfax, we are now better positioned to achieve our full potential and to benefit from the long-term trends we see in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa,  said Diamond, the former Barclays CEO who is executive chairman of Atlas Mara. Proceeds will be used to raise Atlas Mara's stake in Union Bank of Nigeria to 44.5% from 31.1%, and to invest and scale up the markets and treasury and fintech business, the company said. The new shares will be offered at US$2.25 per share, a 10% discount to Tuesday's closing price. Fairfax will take 30% of the shares and any more not bought in the offer. The US$100m mandatory convertible bonds will convert into shares at US$2.25 when the share offer completes. Citigroup is advising on the deal. Fairfax Africa is part of Canadian investment firm Fairfax Financial, led by Prem Watsa, to invest in African assets. It will nominate four out of Atlas Mara's nine board directors. Atlas Mara will spend US$55m on buying the extra 13.4% in UBN from the Clermont Group. It will spend more to maintain its stake in UBN in a planned rights issue, and is expected to increase the holding to a majority in the future. Diamond built up Barclays' investment bank over more than a decade and was CEO for 18 months until he was ousted in July 2012 following the British bank's fine for rigging Libor interest rates. He subsequently teamed up with Africa-based entrepreneur Ashish Thakkar to set up Atlas Mara at the end of 2013, and is now running the business after the departure of John Vitalo as CEO in February. Atlas Mara's London-listed shares have fallen to US$2.50, a quarter of the US$10 they listed at in the IPO. The company raised US$325m in its IPO and has raised another US$313m in two follow-ons and US$69m from two convertible bond sales, and raised debt. It has bought businesses to build a platform in Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Rwanda, but it has struggled to cut costs and increase revenues.

Angola, a regional political and military heavyweight, has on several occasions provided vital support for Kabila, who took over as president of Democratic Republic of Congo in 2001 following the assassination of his father.  But Luanda is frustrated by Kabila's handling of several crises, including his failure to step aside when his mandate ended last December and a conflict in which refugees have poured across his country's long border into Angola. In December Angola withdrew military trainers it had sent to Congo, where wars at the turn of the century killed millions and sucked in neighboring countries. That decision raised doubts that Luanda would be ready to bail Kabila out again, and those doubts have been heightened by the change of tone in ties, signaling a big shift in regional power politics. Foreign Minister Georges Chikoti made clear that patience was running out in May, when he questioned a statement in which Congo said a conflict in the Kasai region bordering Angola had been resolved after several months.  On one side, we are told that the question of the succession of the kingdom of Kasai has been resolved, on the other, we (still) see people who arrive (in Angola) having been treated badly,  he told French broadcaster RFI. Chikoti also backed calls for an international inquiry into the killing of two U.N. investigators in the region, a move which Kinshasa has rejected.  Playing With Matches on a Barrel of Explosives  A more direct challenge has come from Sindika Dokolo, a Congolese businessman and art collector who is married to the  billionaire daughter of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Having previously steered clear of national politics, Dokolo has in recent weeks hit out at Kabila on Twitter and in interviews, drawing comparisons with the end of Congolese late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's rule.  We underestimate Congo's capacity to destabilize the region,  he told Reuters.  We are playing with matches on a barrel of explosives and that worries me a lot.  Dokolo has urged students and church leaders to mobilize against Kabila and praised Moise Katumbi, an opposition leader in exile.  He says he is commenting as a private Congolese citizen. But the outspoken remarks carry weight because they come from the heart of the family around dos Santos.  Clearly as husband to Isabel dos Santos, this signals frustration in Luanda,  said Alex Vines, head of the Africa Program at London-based policy institute Chatham House. Preserving the Status Quo  FILE PHOTO: A vendor sits at a bus stand in front of a picture of Democratic Republic of Congo's President Joseph Kabila in Kinshasa, December 31, 2016.Stringer/File PhotoCongo, a country of more than 80 million people which is the world's biggest cobalt producer, a copper and diamonds miner and an oil producer, has been plagued by war and instability since the fall of kleptocrat Mobutu in 1997. Angola has had differences in the past with Congo, including over their maritime border, competing claims to offshore oil and the expulsion by Luanda of tens of thousands of Congolese diamond miners more than a decade ago.  But Angola, whose population of about 26 million is much smaller than its neighbor's, believes its interests are best served if Congo is stable, though weak, and has stepped in militarily or diplomatically in the past to keep the status quo.  In 1998, early in a war that lasted until 2003, Angolan warplanes strafed Rwandan soldiers marching on Kinshasa. When gun battles erupted in the capital in 2006, Angolan troops flew in to help Kabila's bodyguards defeat fighters loyal to Jean-Pierre Bemba, an ex-rebel he had just defeated in an election.  Luanda has also echoed Kinshasa by criticizing sanctions imposed on Congo by the United States and the European Union over the election delays and alleged human rights abuses. FILE PHOTO: Angola's Foreign Minister Georges Chikoti attends a meeting with his Brazilian counterpart Antonio Patriota (not pictured) at the Itamaraty Palace in Brasilia November 13, 2012.Ueslei Marcelino/File PhotoBut in a sign of Angola's growing frustration with the situation in Congo, Luanda has -- as a member of the U.N. Security Council in 2015 and 2016 -- voted for tough resolutions against Congo at the United Nations.  Luanda also showed its concern by putting pressure on Kabila to accept a second attempt at dialogue late last year after talks on a political transition, brokered by the African Union, failed to include the main opposition leaders.  The Angolans don't respect or appreciate the way Congo is handling the crisis. They feel they are making it worse,  a diplomat in direct contact with top Angolan officials told Reuters.  It is very clear to the Angolans that Kabila doesn’t have control of his country.  Diplomatic Offensive Barnabe Kikaya bin Karubi, Kabila's top diplomatic adviser, said the Congolese government understood Angola's frustration about violence near its border but that Angola had not pressured it over internal politics. Angola's concerns, and those of other African leaders and Western states, are heightened by the fact that unrest in Congo often takes on regional dimensions.  A repeat of the overt interventions by several neighbors in the 1998-2003 war is unlikely, but Kabila is seeking regional support as the political impasse continues in Congo and has launched a diplomatic offensive to woo African countries. He began in April by visiting Egypt and Gabon, where joint statements were issued criticizing foreign meddling. Since then, his foreign minister has visited the nine countries neighboring Congo and other African states to deliver letters from Kabila.  Sitting African leaders are reluctant to criticize Kabila publicly, but the Ghanaian former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and nine former African presidents have said Congo is in  grave danger  because of the failure to organize elections. Some Congolese fear Angola could intervene militarily as it has troops and weaponry on the border.  But Angola's economy has been severely weakened by low oil prices -- year-on-year inflation is more than 32 percent -- and Luanda is trying to manage a transition of its own, with dos Santos due to quit in August after 38 years in power. An election is due in Angola on Aug. 23. Additional reporting by Elias Biryabarema in Kampala, Editing by Timothy Heritage","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-angola-idUSKBN19C0E7"},

The finance ministry offered a two-tranche Eurobond worth $3 billion, it said in a statement. Order books had topped $6.6 billion, a market source familiar with deal details told Reuters  The deal - and investors' enthusiasm - comes just days after the U.S. Senate voted to impose new sanctions on Russia, extending curbs put in place in 2014 to punish Moscow for its role in the Ukraine crisis. But Russia is celebrating its victory over restrictive geopolitics by selling Eurobonds for the second year in a row. Foreign money managers, including U.S. investors, showed  big interest , Andrey Kostin, the head of Russian state-run bank VTB told reporters in London.  He described the bond as a  normal market deal  Itself under U.S. and European sanctions, VTB is acting as the sole book runner for the Eurobond issue.  So far the investment world has decided that (sanctions are) not a significant factor especially since it's fixed income and there should be significant returns,  Kostin said. There is huge investor demand for high-yielding securities.  Russia's bond comes a day after Argentina - with a credit rating well below Russia's - debuted on the so-called  century bond  market with $2.75 billion of 100-year debt, just over a year after emerging from its latest default.. Andrei Solovyov, head of debt capital markets at VTB Capital, lauded the issue a  success .  Those are the lowest coupon rates in the whole history of Russian sovereign eurobond issues,  he said, adding that the demand toppled $6 billion. He said the biggest part of the issue was bought by foreigners, with U.S. investors accounting for the bulk of it. Debt Levels  Raising $1 billion in a 10-year sovereign Eurobond issue, Russia set final yield guidance at 4.25 percent, nearly twice as high as 2.17 percent offered by 10-year U.S. Treasuries. Yield guidance on its 30-year bond was 5.25 percent Some investors reckon the sanctions may even have boosted the market for Russian Eurobonds, especially as economic sanctions kept Moscow out of international bond markets in 2014 and 2015 and reduced the supply of Russian hard currency debt. Russia's rock-bottom public debt levels are also attractive to investors.  We think the pricing is fair on both tranches, it's good timing for Russia to issue as despite low oil prices there is access to cheap financing. The market thinks their fiscal stance is sustainable,  said JC Sambor, deputy head of EM fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London. Vladimir Miklashevsky, an economist at Danske Bank said however:  Yields are interesting but not as attractive as they used to be two weeks ago amid fears of new sanctions.  With the sanction pattern generally unchanged from 2016, a Russian deal remains off-bounds for several Western banks and asset managers. In early 2016, some U.S. banks were advised not to help Russia launch the issue. A couple of U.S. banks did not reply to Reuters requests for comment, while a chief economist at one of the U.S. banks said he was not allowed to speak on the matter, even off-record. An investor at a German asset manager said by email his fund would not participate in the primary market.  The reason is more compliance related, since VTB as a sole book runner is a sanctioned entity in the EU, this will make an investment in the primary market a very complicated task,  the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  He said, however, that the fund may consider buying the Eurobonds on the secondary market once trading started.

More than $2 trillion of planned investment in oil and gas projects by 2025 could be redundant if governments stick to targets to lower carbon emissions to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, according to a report by the Carbon Tracker thinktank and institutional investors. It compared the carbon intensity of oil and gas projects planned by 69 companies with requirements needed to meet the warming target set by the 2015 Paris agreement, which will require curbing fossil fuel consumption. It found Exxon, the world's top publicly-traded oil and gas company, risks wasting up to half its budget on new fields that will not be needed.  Shell and France's Total (TOTF.PA) would see up to 40 percent of their budgets misspent. Fossil fuel producers have come under growing pressure from investors to reduce carbon emissions and increase transparency over future investment.  Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, one of the authors of the report, said last week it had wound down investments in six companies, including Exxon, which it said had violated the Paris agreement. Top energy companies have voiced support for the Paris agreement reached by nearly 200 countries. Many of them have urged governments to impose a tax on carbon emissions to support cleaner sources of energy such as gas. U.S. President Donald Trump said this month he would withdraw the United States from the Paris accord which he said would undermine the U.S. economy. The report found five of the most expensive projects, including the extension of Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan field and Bonga Southwest and Bonga North in Nigeria, will not be needed if the global warming target is to be met. Around two thirds of the potential oil and gas production which would be surplus to requirement is controlled by the private sector,  demonstrating how the risk is skewed toward listed companies rather than national oil companies , the report said. Saudi Arabia's state-run Aramco, widely considered the lowest cost oil producer, would see up to 10 percent of its production rendered uneconomical, the report said. The report's authors said their discussions with oil companies had shown the companies wanted to remain flexible to respond to future developments and possible changes in the oil price. Companies including Shell and BP have rejected the idea that assets could end up redundant, saying the reserves they hold are too small to be affected by any long-term decline in demand.  We believe our business strategy is resilient to the energy transition. We are convinced there is a role for gas to help with the transition to a lower carbon world,  Shell said in response to the report.

Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, one of the authors of the report, said last week it had wound down investments in six companies, including Exxon, which it said had violated the Paris agreement. Top energy companies have voiced support for the Paris agreement reached by nearly 200 countries. Many of them have urged governments to impose a tax on carbon emissions to support cleaner sources of energy such as gas. U.S. President Donald Trump said this month he would withdraw the United States from the Paris accord which he said would undermine the U.S. economy. The report found five of the most expensive projects, including the extension of Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan field and Bonga Southwest and Bonga North in Nigeria, will not be needed if the global warming target is to be met. Around two thirds of the potential oil and gas production which would be surplus to requirement is controlled by the private sector,  demonstrating how the risk is skewed toward listed companies rather than national oil companies , the report said. Saudi Arabia's state-run Aramco, widely considered the lowest cost oil producer, would see up to 10 percent of its production rendered uneconomical, the report said. The report's authors said their discussions with oil companies had shown the companies wanted to remain flexible to respond to future developments and possible changes in the oil price. Companies including Shell and BP have rejected the idea that assets could end up redundant, saying the reserves they hold are too small to be affected by any long-term decline in demand.  We believe our business strategy is resilient to the energy transition. We are convinced there is a role for gas to help with the transition to a lower carbon world,  Shell said in response to the report.

The oil ministry proposed 102 blocks, comprising 93 in the Barents Sea and nine in the Norwegian Sea, despite calls from the Norway's Environment Agency to remove about 20 blocks near Bear Island, an important nesting site for Arctic birds. The application deadline for Norway's 24th Arctic licensing round is Nov. 30 and the aim is to announce awards during the first half of 2018, the ministry said. The 93 blocks proposed in the Barents Sea beat the previous record of 72 blocks offered in Norway's 22nd round  The country's Petroleum Directorate (NPD), which regulates the industry, said drilling in the Barents Sea was Norway's best chance of making new oil and gas discoveries.  Therefore it's important to facilitate acreage for exploration in this area,  the NPD said in a statement.  There's great interest, which also reflects the fact that 2017 is set to become a record year for exploration in the Barents Sea.  The latest offer drew sharp criticism from environmentalists, who said Western Europe's top oil and gas producer was ignoring the 2015 Paris climate agreement.  This is an attack on the environment,  Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, told Reuters.  It's a confirmation that the Norwegian government doesn't take their own climate commitments from Paris seriously.  The Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 (2.7F), above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures have already risen about 1 degree (1.8F). Norway's petroleum sector contributes about 28 of the country's total emissions, which have to be limited according to the Paris Agreement. Greenpeace is already taking the government to court over its previous licensing round, saying the expansion of exploration would raise emissions, violating the country's climate commitments. The Norwegian Environment Agency had proposed expanding a non-drilling zone around Bear Island to 100 km from 65 km but about 20 blocks offered in the latest round fall within the new suggested exclusion zone. The agency was not immediately available to comment. editing by David Clarke","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-oil-idUSKBN19C17Y"},

Kern's Social Democratic Party (SPO) last week dropped a 30-year ban on allying with the anti-immigration FPO, but set broad conditions for any potential coalition partner to fulfill. Adding a new condition, Kern told Wednesday's edition of newspaper Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten:  As long as ... the FPO shares a faction with (French far-right leader) Marine Le Pen... the preconditions for deeper cooperation have not been met.  For most center-left parties in Europe, a coalition government with the far right would be unthinkable. But polls suggest the FPO might well become kingmaker after a snap parliamentary election set for October following frequent spats within the current coalition between the SPO and the center-right OVP. The FPO joined forces in the European Parliament in 2015 with Le Pen's National Front, the Netherlands' Geert Wilders and far-right leaders from Italy and Belgium to form the Europe of Nations and Freedom bloc. Le Pen campaigned on a staunchly anti-EU platform in France's presidential election this spring but was well beaten in last month's run-off, prompting the FPO to tone down its euroscepticism. The FPO has said it has no preference between allying with the SPO and the center-right OVP, but party secretary general Herbert Kickl said on Wednesday an alliance with the Social Democrats was not currently on its agenda.  As things stand at present we are not available for coalition talks with the SPO,  he told newspaper Der Standard. Kickl said he wanted the SPO's party base to vote on the possibility of an alliance with the FPO before the Oct. 15 election. Kern wants such a vote to take place only after any coalition talks have been completed. Last week's decision to replace the SPO's ban with a  values compass  and flexible criteria for any potential partner was taken by the party's 70-person steering committee.

South Africa is planning to build 9,600 megawatts (MW) of nuclear capacity, a project that could be one of the world's biggest nuclear contracts in decades. Kubayi, who was in Moscow leading a South African delegation at to nuclear conference, said she was a member of a cabinet committee chaired by President Jacob Zuma which was drawing up responses to recession and that the committee would study the nuclear plans. The country has technically entered recession after two quarters of economic contraction, and the procurement process for the nuclear project has been disrupted by a court ruling which declared a nuclear pact between South Africa and Russia unlawful.  We will do the nuclear project at a scale and pace that we can afford. So we will look at that completely, if we need to review the scale we have obviously to go back,  Kubayi told a news conference. In response to a question on the firm that South Africa could choose to build new nuclear reactors, Kubayi said it was important to go for  the most experienced people who have a track record . Russian state firm Rosatom is a contender to build the nuclear reactors and has been talking up its chances of winning the contract, given delays and cost overruns at French competitor Areva and Japanese-owned Westinghouse. Kubayi met Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Rosatom head Alexei Likhachev on her visit to Russia, agreeing with Likhachev that South African and Russian technical teams would initiate discussions on cooperation. She said it was too early to give an exact date on when the procurement process for the nuclear project could restart and that South Africa was reviewing intergovernmental agreements with many countries following the High Court ruling against the Russian nuclear pact. She said:  In a few weeks we should be able to give an indication (of the procurement restart date), once the internal cabinet processes have been concluded.

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - It is the conversation dominating and worrying world markets in equal measure: is there anything on the immediate horizon that will snap the  Goldilocks  cycle that has sent volatility to historic lows and stock prices to record highs? It appears not. This month the Fed raised U.S. interest rates again and said it will soon begin reducing bond holdings, the Bank of England moved closer to raising rates than at any time in a decade, and world economic data disappointed. Tighter monetary policy or a significant deterioration in the outlook for growth - at least relative to expectations - would normally be red flags to investors, and potential triggers for a pick up in volatility and a pullback in stocks. Yet implied volatility on Wall Street is at a record low, and U.S., UK, German and world stocks are at record highs. World stocks look set for the eighth monthly rise in a row, the best run for more than 13 years. Every market dip is met with a wave of buying, suggesting that faith in the central bank  put  is as strong as ever. Ultimately, investors are betting the Fed and its central bank peers have their back, despite the relatively hawkish noises coming out of the Fed. This refers to the perception that central banks will do whatever it takes to avoid the financial and economic damage a crash would unleash. Essentially that means maintaining a loose monetary policy and the flow of liquidity into financial assets. It is a view borne out in the U.S. bond market, where the gap between short-dated and long-dated yields is the smallest since 2007. The flatness of the yield curve shows that investors do not believe the Fed will tighten much at all. Surprise, Surprise The central bank prop of trillions of dollars, euros, sterling and yen of stimulus has powered the global economic and market rebound from the 2007-2009 crisis. The danger now is complacency. With yields so low - a consequence of central banks' massive bond-buying programmes - investors are taking extra risks by seeking returns in markets or regions they would not normally venture in. Valuations get pushed higher and bubbles form. Investors have had no shortage of potential minefields to navigate over the past year, including the political shocks of Brexit and Trump's election, rising tensions between the West and North Korea, and a heavy European election calendar. Some of those risks have been more benign than feared and some have yet to play out at all. But nothing on the political front has derailed markets, mainly because the global economy and company earnings growth have been humming along nicely. World growth is ticking along steadily, and according to Fitch, will rise to 3.1 percent next year, the fastest rate since 2010. According to JP Morgan, global economic volatility has not been this low for 40 years. Global earnings growth is forecast at about 12 percent for the next 12 months, the fastest rate since 2011. But the growth picture has darkened this month, at least relative to lofty expectations, if Citi's range of economic surprises indexes are anything to go by. The U.S. and G10 developed economy surprise indexes are on course for their biggest monthly fall for six years, and the UK index its biggest fall since 2009. Both the U.S. and UK declines will be the third largest on record. Yet world stocks have barely blinked and volatility is historically low.  The longer volatility remains low the more fragile the system gets, the more leverage is applied, the more people sail closer to the wind,  said UBS Wealth Management chief investment officer Mark Haefele, with about $2 trillion under management.  The real shock is if people start to believe that the central bank put is no longer in place. And we're nowhere near that point yet.

No economically viable discoveries have been made on the Faroese shelf but the tiny nation hopes to entice energy firms to restart exploration as it shows them new geological data in London on Wednesday.  Oil firms have in many ways shown interest. We are having meetings, they buy data from us, visit us on the Faroe Islands ... So there is an interest and they are looking at the possibilities,  survey director Niels Christian Nolsoe said. He declined to identify any of the companies but said bigger firms could put up the necessary cash, adding that companies present in the UK Shetland region also might be interested. The seabed is mostly covered by thick basalt layers, which make the Faroese offshore areas difficult to explore despite promising geological and seismic surveys. The seismic data now available and collected by companies such as Norway's PGS gives a much better understanding than when exploration started some 16 years ago, Nolsoe said. In the fourth licencing round, running until February 2018, the Faroe Islands is offering licences in an area covering 30,000 square metres on the eastern part of the shelf bordering the western Shetland region.  Only nine wells have been drilled in a huge area and big discoveries have been made in the Shetlands, so if you look at where there could be some big undiscovered findings, the possibility is greatest in our area,  he said. In March, Hurricane Energy announced an oil discovery in the Halifax well in the West Shetland region, which it said could be Britain's largest undeveloped oil find. BP started production at the Quad 204 project in the West Shetland region in May after a $5.7 billion redevelopment, one of the largest such projects there in recent years that will breathe new life into the ageing offshore basin. However, a persistent slump in oil prices and thus strict cash discipline among oil firms could curb interest in the undeveloped North Atlantic region.  The oil price is a challenge ... on the other hand, the oil industry has also reduced its costs,  he said. Companies including Norway's Statoil and DONG Energy have previously held licences in the Faroe Islands, where no firm currently holds any.

Before the Queen's Speech, which will lay out the government's legislative programme, at 1030 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 0.3 percent. Euro zone shares fell as much as 0.93 percent. However, Provident Financial plummeted up to 20 percent after it warned that disruption from the reorganisation of its consumer credit division would weigh its results for the rest of the financial year. Analysts at Liberum said they had been concerned about rising impairments and customer attrition in the division as the new model was implemented, but the transition was  more painful than expected.   The sheer speed of the deterioration has taken us by surprise, particularly after a reassuring Q1 interim management statement on May 12,  they added. Its losses also weighed on Hargreaves Lansdown, the second-worst blue-chip performer. Gains by Whitbread and Centrica helped the FTSE 100 outperform despite Provident's fall. Costa Coffee and Premier Inn owner Whitbread was top performer among UK and European shares, up 4.5 percent after reporting sales rose 7.6 percent in the first quarter.  If the consumer gets squeezed by inflation, then they will have to cut back, but probably more on the bigger-ticket items in the short term,  said Greg Johnson, analyst at Shore Capital.  Affordable treats, lower-ticket leisure expenditure will probably outperform bigger-ticket items such as houses.  With most of its hotels in the UK, Whitbread was also well positioned to benefit from a potential rise in 'staycations', Johnson said. Energy firm Centrica rose as investors cheered the sale of its two biggest gas plants to a subsidiary of Czech energy company EPH. Mining company Fresnillo rose as gold prices ticked higher. London-focussed housebuilder Berkeley Group was a top gainer among lacklustre mid-caps, up 2.2 percent after its full-year results beat expectations with a 53 percent increase in profits before tax. However, it warned uncertainty related to Brexit could cut into demand for houses.  Full-year 2016/2017 is likely to represent peak profits for Berkeley Group. As had been flagged for some time, the company will see margins (currently in the mid-to-high 20s) revert to more 'normal' levels (below 20%),  said Colin Sheridan, analyst at Davy Research.  The results are strong, however, and the market is likely to be encouraged by comments that selling trends in London have improved into the end of the financial year,  he added.

Speaking to Reuters on day three of the June 19-25 show, Leahy said:  We will have some orders today, but today's isn't going to be one of our record air shows.  Regarding orders that Airbus could get over the rest of the show, Leahy added that such deals would be  nothing big, but real stuff  - an indirect reference to conversions from existing models that account for more than half of the orders announced so far for Boeing's newly launched 737 MAX 10. Boeing leads the race for net new orders at the air show.  Industry watchers said the veteran Airbus sales chief could pull off a signature last-minute deal to avoid an unusual defeat at the European company's home event. Leahy took issue with claims by Boeing (BA.N) that the Boeing 737 MAX 10 is 5 percent more efficient to operate than the Airbus A321neo, which has outsold the smaller 737 MAX 9 by about four to one.  I am getting to the point where I may run my Pinocchio ad again with the stuff they are saying,  Leahy said, referring to an advertising war between Airbus and Boeing in 2012 over conflicting claims on jet performance. Resale Values Boeing says the 737 MAX 10 is a lighter plane with a longer wing, making it more efficient. Airbus says the A321neo has a larger and more efficient engine, giving it an advantage. An aerial view of an Airbus A380 and an Airbus A321neo during the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris, France, June 21, 2017.Pascal RossignolBoeing's development chief said on Tuesday Airbus marketing risked ignoring the  physics of the universe . Leahy also said Boeing was putting some of its own sales at risk, rather than denting interest in the A321neo.  I don’t think we have a real competitor to worry about there. I think the rest of their product line is going to be cannibalized by that aircraft,  Leahy said of the 737 MAX 10. Slideshow (7 Images) Either the MAX 9 or the MAX 10 is going to survive, but one of them has to go,  Leahy said in an interview at what is likely to be his last major air show as he prepares to retire. He also questioned whether the introduction of a fifth member of the MAX family would allow airlines to preserve the value of their assets for possible resale - a key barometer of aviation finance that influences both old and new prices.  If you bought a MAX 9 in the past I think you have got to worry about your residual values,  Leahy said. Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister  this week denied the 737 MAX 10 would have any financing issues. Leahy said he was not worried about an order for 100 Boeing 737 MAX 10s from United Airlines, converted from other models.  I understand that United have an agreement that they can convert to any member of the MAX family that they want to, and can convert back if they want to, so we don't see that as a competitor to having the A321 one day be introduced to United.  Asked to comment on Leahy's remark, a Boeing spokesman said:  They (United) selected the 10.

The oil ministry proposed 102 blocks, comprising 93 in the Barents Sea and nine in the Norwegian Sea, despite calls from the Norway's Environment Agency to remove about 20 blocks near Bear Island, an important nesting site for Arctic birds. The application deadline for Norway's 24th Arctic licensing round is Nov. 30 and the aim is to announce awards during the first half of 2018, the ministry said. The 93 blocks proposed in the Barents Sea beat the previous record of 72 blocks offered in Norway's 22nd round  The country's Petroleum Directorate (NPD), which regulates the industry, said drilling in the Barents Sea was Norway's best chance of making new oil and gas discoveries.  Therefore it's important to facilitate acreage for exploration in this area,  the NPD said in a statement.  There's great interest, which also reflects the fact that 2017 is set to become a record year for exploration in the Barents Sea.  The latest offer drew sharp criticism from environmentalists, who said Western Europe's top oil and gas producer was ignoring the 2015 Paris climate agreement.  This is an attack on the environment,  Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, told Reuters.  It's a confirmation that the Norwegian government doesn't take their own climate commitments from Paris seriously.  The Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 (2.7F), above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures have already risen about 1 degree (1.8F). Norway's petroleum sector contributes about 28 of the country's total emissions, which have to be limited according to the Paris Agreement. Greenpeace is already taking the government to court over its previous licensing round, saying the expansion of exploration would raise emissions, violating the country's climate commitments. The Norwegian Environment Agency had proposed expanding a non-drilling zone around Bear Island to 100 km from 65 km but about 20 blocks offered in the latest round fall within the new suggested exclusion zone. The agency was not immediately available to comment. editing by David Clarke","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/norway-oil-idUSL8N1JI1MR"},

His departure as chief executive amid pressure from other shareholders in the company ends the first leg of Uber's journey from startup to $70 billion enterprise to, eventually, public company. That the private firm was able to jettison its controlling shareholder suggests a small, but welcome, modicum of market discipline in startup world. Uber’s woes are not all Kalanick’s doing. Its original conceit was to offer an asset-light solution to hailing taxis: Uber provides a handy GPS and payments application, drivers bear all the costs and liabilities of transportation, and Uber takes a fee. To beat back pesky livery and taxi regulations, Uber helpfully picked up the tab for drivers' infractions. Now that municipalities have either loosened the rules, leveling the playing field for Uber and its competitors, or simply clamped down, the arbitrage trick is up. A nasty fight in which Kalanick berated a driver bemoaning the cost he had incurred in acquiring his vehicle showed that Uber's practice of heaping liabilities on its freelancing workers was also reaching its limits. On top of these headwinds, however, Kalanick generated a few of his own. A frat-like culture led to a probe into charges of sexual harassment and unprofessional behavior. Senior executives departed. So did TPG boss and Uber board member David Bonderman last week, after an ill-judged joke that more women on the board means “more talking”. Kalanick had planned a leave of absence, but it appears that wasn’t enough for top shareholders including Benchmark Capital. Kalanick’s willingness to step back disrupts the tech-sector model of founders wielding executive power, aided by super-voting shares and cadres of boardroom allies. It also sets a positive example that might one day help a Snap or Facebook through bad times. The question is what he does next. If its controlling shareholder simply drives from the back seat, the company will look even less suited to public life. From the outside, though, Uber is now on a better course.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

At the annual Herzliya security conference near Tel Aviv, Major-General Amir Eshel said qualitative and quantitative improvements in the air force since the 2006 Lebanon war meant it could carry out in just two or three days the same number of bombings it mounted in those 34 days of fighting.  If war breaks out in the north, we have to open with all our strength from the start,  he said, pointing to the likelihood of international pressure for a quick ceasefire before Israel can achieve all its strategic goals. Israeli politicians and generals have spoken often of an intention to hit hard in Lebanon if war breaks out, in an apparent bid to deter Hezbollah. Eshel said in 2014 that another conflict could see Israeli attacks 15 times more devastating for Lebanon than in 2006. But at the conference, Eshel noted that  many elements busy achieving their goals  in Syria's civil war were interested in preventing any fresh hostilities in Lebanon, where Israel says Hezbollah has built up an arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets. Since early in the six-year-old Syria war, Hezbollah's energies have been focused on propping up President Bashar al-Assad in alliance with Iran and Russia, throwing thousands of its fighters into battle against Syrian rebels. FILE PHOTO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sits inside an Apache Helicopter next to Chief of the Israeli Air Force Major-General Amir Eshel (L) during his visit to the Tel Nof airforce base in southern Israel August 17, 2016.Amir Cohen/File PhotoBut the Shi'ite group has not altered its view of Israel as its foremost enemy, and Israel's military has said it regards Hezbollah in the same way. Crowded Skies Although Israel has kept to the sidelines of the war in Syria, Israeli aircraft have targeted suspected Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, operations complicated by Russian and U.S. air activity in the region.  The skies of the Middle East are a lot more crowded than before, with lots of players,  Eshel said, pointing to the need for the air force to operate  surgically  to avoid  mistakes . On the other hand, such strikes, he said, also act as a deterrent to Hezbollah, whose missile capabilities could mean that the air force and the rest of the Israeli military will fight any future Lebanon war with their own bases under attack. Eshel cautioned residents in southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold, to leave their homes if a new conflict erupts, saying the Iranian-backed group uses civilian homes as  launching bases for missiles and rockets  About 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops fighting Hezbollah, were killed in the 2006 war, which displaced a million people in Lebanon and up to 500,000 in Israel.

The company, which provides credit to people who do not meet the lending criteria of mainstream banks, is ending its practice of using self-employed collection agents and employing them instead. However the rate of applications by its current agents has fallen short of expectations.  We didn't get it right. The incentives we had in place and the other management actions and communications that were there, were not sufficient to retain the number of agents that we anticipated,  CEO Peter Crook told analysts on Wednesday. Shares in the lender plunged 20 percent on Wednesday morning, making the stock the biggest loser on London's blue-chip index. The unfilled jobs were in the lender's UK business, Finance Director Andrew Fisher said on the analyst call, adding there were about 450 vacancies. It is aiming to employ a total of 2,500 in total.  When you are going through a period of 4-5 months when essentially most of the work force is on notice and you're having to re-recruit much of your workforce into new positions within a new structure, it creates an air of uncertainty across the organisation,  Fisher said. Operational disruption had led to more uncollected home credit and hit sales penetration and customer retention, Provident Financial said. The lender said the shortfall in the unit's contribution to profit was estimated to be about 40 million pounds ($50 million) in the first half of the year, up from the 15 million pound hit the company forecast in April. Provident Financial said recent collections performance had  deteriorated , particularly in May. June collections were  stabilising , with performance expected to normalise next month. This operational disruption on collections and sales is forecast to reduce 2017 pre-exceptional profits from the consumer credit division to around 60 million pounds, from 115 million pounds a year earlier. Crooke said the company expects things to be back to  normal  by the fourth quarter.  We don't have a credit quality issue, we have an issue whereby we haven't collected on customers in the normal disciplined, diligent,  he said.

This departure from traditional pork-rich dumplings is a hit with busy, young urbanites, trying to reduce the fat in diets often heavy on fast food.  They like to try to eat more healthy products once a week or fortnight. It's a big trend for mainland China consumers, especially those aged 20 to 35,  said Ellis Wang, Shanghai-based marketing manager at U.S. food giant General Mills (GIS.N), which owns top dumpling brand Wanchai Ferry. For pig farmers in China and abroad, it is a difficult trend to stomach. The producers and other market experts had expected the growth to continue until at least 2026. Chinese hog farmers are on a building spree, constructing huge modern farms to capture a bigger share of the world's biggest pork market, while leading producers overseas have been changing the way they raise their pigs to meet Chinese standards for imports. Some have, for example, stopped using growth hormones banned in China. China still consumes a lot more meat than any other country. People here will eat about 74 million tonnes of pork, beef and poultry this year, around twice as much as the United States, according to U.S. agriculture department estimates. More than half of that is pork and for foreign producers it has been a big growth market, especially for Western-style packaged meats. But pork demand has hit a ceiling, well ahead of most official forecasts. Sales of pork have now fallen for the past three years, according to data from research firm Euromonitor. Last year they hit three-year lows of 40.85 million tonnes from 42.49 million tonnes in 2014, and Euromonitor predicts they will also fall slightly in 2017. Chinese hog prices are down around 25 percent since January, even though official numbers suggest supply is lower compared with last year. China's meat and seafood sales IMG: tmsnrt.rs/2s83aam Rare Luxury Since China began opening up to the world in the late 1970s, pork demand expanded by an average 5.7 percent every year, until 2014 as the booming economy allowed hundreds of millions of people to afford to eat meat more often. During Mao Zedong's reign as Chinese leader from 1949-76 meat had, for many, been a rare luxury. Now, growing concerns about obesity and heart health shape shopping habits too, fuelling sales of everything from avocados to fruit juices and sportswear. [reut.rs/2rpFDhp] [reut.rs/2tis0Tg]  Market demand remains very weak. I think one factor behind this is people believe less meat is healthier. This is a new trend,  said Pan Chenjun, executive director of food and agriculture research at Rabobank in Hong Kong. Sales of vegetable-only dumplings grew 30 percent last year, compared with around 7 percent for all frozen dumplings, Nielsen research also shows.  Demand for vegetable products keeps rising, giving us large room for growth,  said Zhou Wei, product manager at number two dumpling producer Synear Food. FILE PHOTO: A customer chooses meat at a meat market in Beijing May 31, 2013.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoGuangzhou-based Harmony Catering says health is the key to reduced servings of meat to the roughly 1 million workers eating at its 300 canteens each day. Staff at the technology companies, banks and oil majors that are Harmony's clients will consume about 10 percent less meat today than they did five years ago, but around 10 percent more green vegetables, according to Harmony vice president Li Huang.   It's mainly because of media, the concept of health has entered popular consciousness,  he said. For now, it's mostly urban and white-collar workers paying closer attention to their diets. There's been, for example, a sharp rise in vegetarian food stations at university campuses.    But the government wants a nationwide shift in eating habits. Childhood obesity in China is rocketing, and the country also faces an epidemic of heart disease, Harvard researchers warned last year. Among the problems, they blamed growing consumption of red meat and high salt intake. In April, the health ministry kicked off its second 10-year healthy lifestyle campaign, urging citizens to consume less fat, salt and sugar, and aim for a 'healthy diet, healthy weight and healthy bones'. Slideshow (2 Images)By 2030, Beijing wants to see a marked increase in nutritional awareness, a 20 percent cut in the per capita consumption of salt, and slower growth in the rate of obesity, it said in its recently published 'Healthy China 2030' pamphlet. Meat consumption by type and country: reut.rs/2s3F00J Some companies have been urgently changing the mix of products they sell, going for higher-margin pork meats rather than volume. Sales of traditionally less popular lamb and beef have also been increasing. Li of Harmony Catering says although servings of pork are down, the firm is including more beef and lamb in meals.  People usually eat lean beef or lamb, like beef brisket, while with pork it's both fatty and lean parts, like in 'hong shao rou',  said Beijing-based nutritionist Chen Zhikun, referring to the widely consumed braised pork dish. China's top pork producer WH Group has been going up market, selling Western-style products in China, such as sausages and ham. A lot of this is imported from Smithfield, the largest U.S. pork producer, which was acquired by WH in 2013. Some producers say that the recent drop in pork consumption can be partly explained by sharply lower output. A prolonged period of losses during 2013 to 2015 forced farmers to cull millions of hogs, hitting supply and sending pork prices to record levels in 2016. But for a growing portion of Chinese consumers, price tags on food items are less and less important. A spate of safety scandals in recent years, many related to meat, have made urban Chinese highly sensitive to food quality. More than 80 percent of people in China surveyed by Nielsen last year said they were willing to pay more for foods without undesirable ingredients, much higher than the global average of 68 percent.  China is in a new stage where consumption of pork and other foods is no longer a simple matter of 'more is better',  said Fred Gale, senior economist at the United States agriculture department.

Saudi, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt broke relations and transport ties with Qatar on June 5, alleging it finances terrorism, something Doha vehemently denies. The move has thrown the region -- which has been relatively stable, if troubled by Sunni and Shi'ite Muslim rivalry -- into diplomatic turmoil that is now putting off investors.      We were used to a relatively peaceful region and now the landscape has changed,  said Brigitte Le Bris, head of emerging debt and currencies at Paris-based Natixis Asset Management, which manages about 350 billion euros ($392 billion) in assets.  We are not yet ready to increase our exposure to the region. We need to know whether this crisis is isolated to Qatar or it can spread and affect other countries or the crisis can worsen.  One obvious area is sovereign debt, where the crisis has the potential of raising borrowing costs. Following the sanctions, rating agency Standard & Poor's  downgraded Qatar while Fitch put it on its watchlist for a potential downgrade. To date, foreign investors still appear to be comfortable holding Qatar paper due to the size of the country's reserves and assets held by its sovereign wealth fund, Qatar Investment Authority. Yields on Qatar’s sovereign dollar bonds maturing in 2026 spiked over 40 basis points after the sanctions were announced on June 5 but have now recovered nearly 20 bps. Other Gulf Cooperation Council countries' sovereign bonds saw some weakness in the immediate aftermath of the diplomatic crisis, but again have largely gone back to their pre-crisis levels.

If the situation continues like this and they planned their IPO, they would be bombarded with questions on this (political upheaval),  he told Reuters, asking not to be named. Even though the Aramco IPO is not expected until 2018, Saudi Arabia was preparing the sale of government stakes in airports, healthcare and educational firms, aiming to raise $200 billion. The privatization is part of the reforms to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil, after its price plunge hurt the kingdom's economy and stretched its finances. Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a recent note said geopolitics may delay the reforms, although not derail them. Saudi's reform process could get some impetus, however, from the announcement on Wednesday that Mohammed bin Salman will become the crown prince, replacing his cousin in a sudden announcement that confirms Saudi Arabia King Salman's 31-year-old son as next ruler of the kingdom.

The tightening of anti-terrorism laws in the world's largest Muslim-majority country comes as concern grows about the spread of influence of Islamic State, and fears it wants a foothold in Southeast Asia as it loses territory in the Middle East.  The new criminal code adopts the principle of universality, which means that wherever an Indonesian citizen commits a crime, they can be legally processed in Indonesia,  said lawmaker Arsul Sani, referring to terrorism.  They can face up to 15 years in prison,  he said. The legislation was likely to be approved in September, legislators said. Law enforcement agencies have long complained of their inability to deal with people who have traveled abroad to join Islamic State and then returned home. Authorities believe Islamic State has thousands of sympathizers in Indonesia. Hundreds of Indonesian men, women, and children are thought to have traveled to Syria in recent years, and authorities believe about 400 Indonesians have joined Islamic State. Dozens are believed to have returned to Southeast Asia. The region, with a population of about 600 million, has suffered occasional militant attacks over the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. In particular, the Philippines and Indonesia have seen attacks by militants claiming allegiance to al Qaeda, and more recently to Islamic State. Government forces in the predominantly Christian Philippines have been battling militants linked to Islamic State in a town in its Muslim-majority south for the past month. In Indonesia, a suicide bomb attack by Islamic State-inspired militants at a bus station last month killed three police officers. Indonesia's tightening of its security laws is part of a revision that President Joko Widodo has urged to meet the new danger. Changes will broaden the definition of terrorism and give police powers to detain suspects without trial for longer.  Police will also be empowered to arrest people for hate speech or for spreading radical content, as well as those taking part in paramilitary training or joining proscribed groups. National police chief Tito Karnavian said on Wednesday security has been tightened ahead of this weekend's Eid al-Fitr festival that marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. He said 38 suspected militants had been detained in recent weeks. Neighboring Malaysia and Singapore already have tough internal security laws that allow for lengthy detention without trial. Alarmed by the surge of violence in the southern Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines this week launched joint air and sea patrols to prevent militants from crossing their common borders.

The UNHCR issued a similar warning last month when about 12,000 refugees returned to the border town of Banki in Borno state, which was already housing 45,000 displaced Nigerians. Another 889 refugees, mostly children, arrived in Banki on June 17 from Minawao camp in Cameroon, Grandi said.   The new arrivals - and we hear reports of more refugees seeking to return - put a strain on the few existing services, he said in a statement.  A new emergency, just as the rainy season is starting, has to be avoided at all costs.   It is my firm view that returns are not sustainable at this time.   Banki, once a thriving town, was razed to the ground by the time the Nigerian army retook it from Boko Haram insurgents in September 2015. Grandi said the severely overcrowded town could not provide adequate shelter or aid and its water supply and sanitation were  wholly inadequate , creating the risk of disease. Although Boko Haram attacks have been fewer in recent months, more people are on the move and there are 1.9 million Nigerians displaced across the northeast, the World Food Program (WFP) said in a report last week.   Insecurity persists in parts of Northeast Nigeria, disrupting food supplies, seriously hindering access to basic services, and limiting agricultural activities, worsening an already dire food security situation,  it said.  More than 5 million people in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states in northeastern Nigeria have no secure food supply, WFP said.

In Simon Jones, Australia have an insider and an architect of British cycling success, the Somerset man having guided Team GB riders to medals at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, and helped Team Sky dominate professional cycling in a three-year stint as head of performance and innovation. Australia will hope Jones can quickly bridge the gap with Britain at the Olympics, while avoiding the scandals and collateral damage that have accompanied their rivals' relentless pursuit of success. Only two months into the role, Jones has already made his presence felt, firing veteran women's endurance coach Gary Sutton and announcing a replacement for track sprint coach Gary West. New endurance coach Jason Bartram and sprint coach Nick Flyger are both qualified sports scientists, a pointer to Jones's more numbers-oriented approach. More tough decisions loom for a program that yielded only one track silver and a bronze from all cycling events at the Rio Games, after winning six medals at the 2012 London Games.  I want to be successful, measured by gold medal outcomes at the Olympic Games,  Jones told Reuters in an interview.  We have to make challenging decisions along the way.  Tradition is one thing but the future is more about a more systematic and planned performance-based approach. And that's all part of the decision-making approach in where you intend to invest. Otherwise, it's all quite a gamble.  Australian cycling has long enjoyed generous government funding as a sport seen to have medal-winning potential but since their cyclists dominated the 2004 Athens Games, the Olympic returns on investment have steadily diminished. Britain, meanwhile, has enjoyed roaring success, its cycling teams lavished with funding from the national sports lottery and contributing to the nation's burgeoning medal hauls at Beijing, London and Rio. Jones, a former coach to Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins and champion sprinter Mark Cavendish, said Australia could not hope to  cut and paste  the British experience as a roadmap to success. But the country could learn from Britain's more targeted approach to identifying and investing in talent.  If you look at the UK system, they support less sports and they have less athletes identified in their athlete pathways with three times the population,  he said.  So we've got around 1,000 athletes identified with a smaller population. When I look at our cycling program, we seem to not have an unequal distribution of athletes but are trying to do the same things in the same programs.  Going forward, we need to have a very athlete-focused approach. Who can win, do we have the quality of athlete, do they have the potential to progress?  Are they in an environment in which they can optimize their performance? Do we have shared goals? That's absolutely vital.  You have to have a blueprint for each athlete and a systematic process to assess whether an athlete is on a trajectory to get that outcome.  The Australian Olympic Committee and a number of sports have bemoaned dwindling government funding for elite athletes and the federal sports minister is championing a new UK-style sports lottery to bridge the gap. Jones, however, said his program had enough resources to produce Olympic champions. The problem was more where the money was being spent. Jones noted that Australia sent a strong team to the track world championships in Hong Kong in April where they topped the table with 11 medals and three golds. But the result was something of a mirage, given other nations elected to rest their top riders in a post-Olympic year.  The ones I'm counting are the Olympic ones, that's one gold, three silvers and a bronze,  Jones said of the Hong Kong haul.  Do we need to be the leading nation in a post-Olympics year?  I think our funding system needs to have a bit of re-think. It's very year-to-year. We need to have a strategic approach to how we incentivize.  Again, we’ve got to pace ourselves over the (Olympic) cycle.  Editing by Amlan Chakraborty","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-australia-jones-idUSKBN19C102"},

Insecurity persists in parts of Northeast Nigeria, disrupting food supplies, seriously hindering access to basic services, and limiting agricultural activities, worsening an already dire food security situation,  it said.  More than 5 million people in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states in northeastern Nigeria have no secure food supply, WFP said.

In Simon Jones, Australia have an insider and an architect of British cycling success, the Somerset man having guided Team GB riders to medals at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, and helped Team Sky dominate professional cycling in a three-year stint as head of performance and innovation. Australia will hope Jones can quickly bridge the gap with Britain at the Olympics, while avoiding the scandals and collateral damage that have accompanied their rivals' relentless pursuit of success. Only two months into the role, Jones has already made his presence felt, firing veteran women's endurance coach Gary Sutton and announcing a replacement for track sprint coach Gary West. New endurance coach Jason Bartram and sprint coach Nick Flyger are both qualified sports scientists, a pointer to Jones's more numbers-oriented approach. More tough decisions loom for a program that yielded only one track silver and a bronze from all cycling events at the Rio Games, after winning six medals at the 2012 London Games.  I want to be successful, measured by gold medal outcomes at the Olympic Games,  Jones told Reuters in an interview.  We have to make challenging decisions along the way.  Tradition is one thing but the future is more about a more systematic and planned performance-based approach. And that's all part of the decision-making approach in where you intend to invest. Otherwise, it's all quite a gamble.  Australian cycling has long enjoyed generous government funding as a sport seen to have medal-winning potential but since their cyclists dominated the 2004 Athens Games, the Olympic returns on investment have steadily diminished. Britain, meanwhile, has enjoyed roaring success, its cycling teams lavished with funding from the national sports lottery and contributing to the nation's burgeoning medal hauls at Beijing, London and Rio. Jones, a former coach to Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins and champion sprinter Mark Cavendish, said Australia could not hope to  cut and paste  the British experience as a roadmap to success. But the country could learn from Britain's more targeted approach to identifying and investing in talent.  If you look at the UK system, they support less sports and they have less athletes identified in their athlete pathways with three times the population,  he said.  So we've got around 1,000 athletes identified with a smaller population. When I look at our cycling program, we seem to not have an unequal distribution of athletes but are trying to do the same things in the same programs.  Going forward, we need to have a very athlete-focused approach. Who can win, do we have the quality of athlete, do they have the potential to progress?  Are they in an environment in which they can optimize their performance? Do we have shared goals? That's absolutely vital.  You have to have a blueprint for each athlete and a systematic process to assess whether an athlete is on a trajectory to get that outcome.  The Australian Olympic Committee and a number of sports have bemoaned dwindling government funding for elite athletes and the federal sports minister is championing a new UK-style sports lottery to bridge the gap. Jones, however, said his program had enough resources to produce Olympic champions. The problem was more where the money was being spent. Jones noted that Australia sent a strong team to the track world championships in Hong Kong in April where they topped the table with 11 medals and three golds. But the result was something of a mirage, given other nations elected to rest their top riders in a post-Olympic year.  The ones I'm counting are the Olympic ones, that's one gold, three silvers and a bronze,  Jones said of the Hong Kong haul.  Do we need to be the leading nation in a post-Olympics year?  I think our funding system needs to have a bit of re-think. It's very year-to-year. We need to have a strategic approach to how we incentivize.  Again, we’ve got to pace ourselves over the (Olympic) cycle.  Editing by Amlan Chakraborty","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/cycling-australia-jones-idUSL3N1JI2BQ"},

At the annual Herzliya security conference near Tel Aviv, Major-General Amir Eshel said qualitative and quantitative improvements in the air force since the 2006 Lebanon war meant it could carry out in just two or three days the same number of bombings it mounted in those 34 days of fighting.  If war breaks out in the north, we have to open with all our strength from the start,  he said, pointing to the likelihood of international pressure for a quick ceasefire before Israel can achieve all its strategic goals. Israeli politicians and generals have spoken often of an intention to hit hard in Lebanon if war breaks out, in an apparent bid to deter Hezbollah. Eshel said in 2014 that another conflict could see Israeli attacks 15 times more devastating for Lebanon than in 2006. But at the conference, Eshel noted that  many elements busy achieving their goals  in Syria's civil war were interested in preventing any fresh hostilities in Lebanon, where Israel says Hezbollah has built up an arsenal of more than 100,000 rockets. Since early in the six-year-old Syria war, Hezbollah's energies have been focused on propping up President Bashar al-Assad in alliance with Iran and Russia, throwing thousands of its fighters into battle against Syrian rebels.

Crowded Skies Although Israel has kept to the sidelines of the war in Syria, Israeli aircraft have targeted suspected Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah, operations complicated by Russian and U.S. air activity in the region.  The skies of the Middle East are a lot more crowded than before, with lots of players,  Eshel said, pointing to the need for the air force to operate  surgically  to avoid  mistakes . On the other hand, such strikes, he said, also act as a deterrent to Hezbollah, whose missile capabilities could mean that the air force and the rest of the Israeli military will fight any future Lebanon war with their own bases under attack. Eshel cautioned residents in southern Lebanon, a Hezbollah stronghold, to leave their homes if a new conflict erupts, saying the Iranian-backed group uses civilian homes as  launching bases for missiles and rockets  About 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops fighting Hezbollah, were killed in the 2006 war, which displaced a million people in Lebanon and up to 500,000 in Israel.

U.S. index provider MSCI said on Wednesday Hong Kong time it would add a selection of China's so-called  A  shares to its Emerging Markets Index .MSCIEF after having rejected them for three years running. In the broader overhaul, MSCI surprised many investors by failing to upgrade Argentina from the frontier market category where it has languished in recent years, but said it would consult investors about adding Saudi Arabia to the benchmark. Inclusion in the index marks a key victory for the Chinese government, which has been working steadily over the past few years to open up its capital markets, investors said.  Given the size and importance of China as an economic superpower, I think this is a historic moment,  Kevin Anderson, senior managing director of State Street Global Advisors and head of investments in the Asia Pacific region told Reuters.  It's a long-awaited and much-debated decision in the past, and I think it's more than symbolic as it will create additional flow of capital and potentially a new segment of institutional investors in the China market.  Traders said MSCI's widely expected  Yes  decision had been largely priced in, with the announcement triggering some profit-taking in blue chips, which are no longer cheap after strong rallies this year. Shanghai shares .SSEC opened just 0.3 percent higher, dipped into negative territory, and then rallied to end the day up 0.5 percent. The blue-chip CSI300 Index .CSI300 shook off early profit taking to finish up 1.2 percent at its highest close in 1-1/2 years. MSCI has been in discussions with Chinese regulators and global investors for four years over whether to add yuan-denominated shares to the Emerging Markets Index – tracked by around $1.6 trillion in assets – but excluded them because of restricted access to China's equity markets. Related CoverageAnalyst View: MSCI adds domestic Chinese stocks to Emerging Markets IndexSouth Korea stocks may see outflow of up to 4.3 trillion won after MSCI includes China: officialMSCI to consider adding Saudi Arabia to key index during 2019On Wednesday, the company said China had made enough progress in opening up its markets for MSCI to add a selection of 222 large-cap stocks. The bulk of the shares will be financial and industrial companies, many state-owned. According to Credit Suisse, among the 222 stocks on the simulated list of constituents for the new proposal of China A-share inclusion, 50 are in the financial sector with a total weight of 36 percent, and 44 stocks are in the industrial sector with a total weight of 16 percent. The stocks, which would represent a weighting of just 0.73 percent in the benchmark, will be included via a two-phase process in May and August next year. The move will see around $17 billion to $18 billion of global assets move into Chinese stocks initially, MSCI executives told reporters, adding that over the long term the full inclusion of the China market could see more than $340 billion of foreign capital flow into the country.  FILE PHOTO: An investor looks at a screen showing stock information at a brokerage house in Shanghai, China November 9, 2016.Aly Song/File PhotoSebastien Lieblich, global head of index management research at MSCI declined, however, to provide a likely timeline for the full inclusion of  A  shares, saying it would depend on  continued progress on China's reform agenda. MSCI, he noted, would like to see China further relax controls on repatriating capital out of the country, and act to curb frequent share suspensions.  It's really in the hands of the Chinese stakeholders, they are dictating the timing. It's very difficult for us to articulate any type of timeline with respect to further inclusion,  Lieblich told reporters.   The China Securities Regulatory Commission, which has overseen many key reforms in recent years, welcomed MSCI's decision.  The inclusion of 'A' shares in the MSCI index is in line with the inevitable needs of international investors and reflects the confidence of international investors in the good prospects for China's economic development and stability of the financial market,  the CSRC said in a statement. Slideshow (3 Images)Relaxed Criteria MSCI in March relaxed its criteria for inclusion by cutting the number of proposed stocks to 169 from 448 in a bid to address ongoing curbs on repatriating capital from China and investor concerns over the country's high number of suspended stocks. The 169 stocks can be easily accessed by foreigners through the  Stock Connect  link launched in 2014 and significantly expanded in December.  MSCI said it had increased the selection to include a further 53 domestic Chinese stocks that are also listed in the Hong Kong market, and which will be better known to foreign investors. Chinese companies listed overseas already account for 28 percent of the EM Index as of May but the addition of domestic, yuan-denominated China stocks could see the country account for as much as 40 percent of MSCI's Emerging Market Index in the future.  The A-share market, including shares from Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, is worth roughly $7.5 trillion, the world's largest after the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.  BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), the world's largest asset manager, endorsed MSCI's decision.  We believe our clients will benefit from today's decision to bring Chinese equities into mainstream investment,  said Ryan Stork, BlackRock's chairman for the Asia-Pacific in Hong Kong and one of the company's most senior executives, in an emailed statement. Failing to upgrade Argentina means the country remains in MSCI's smaller frontier markets index, where it has been since 2009. Nigeria will also remain a frontier market, with the possibility of being downgraded to  standalone  status.

Europe's STOXX 600 fell 0.8 percent, extending the previous session's losses, while euro zone stocks fell more sharply, down 1 percent along with the bloc's blue chips . Financial services, insurance and banking stocks were among the worst-performing sectors, punished by heavy losses from British subprime lender Provident Financial. Provident plummeted as much as 20 percent after warning on profit, saying operational disruption from the reorganisation of its consumer credit division would weigh for the rest of the financial year.  We had been concerned about rising impairments and customer attrition in the consumer credit division as the new model was implemented. The transition appears to have been more painful than expected,  said Liberum analysts. The lender's plunge weighed on sentiment for banks, which were among the top fallers on France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX. Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Natixis fell 1.9 to 2.4 percent, helping make the French blue-chip index the worst European performer. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank fell up to 1.7 percent. Belgium's KBC was the worst-performing on the banking index, down 3.3 percent as its investor day got off to a disappointing start. KBC released a new core equity tier 1 target, a key metric of banks' solvency, of 16.6 percent, and analysts at KBW said the new figure did not leave room for excess capital distribution.  We expect the share price may be on the weak side before further details are disclosed during the day,  they said. A supply glut weighing on crude prices compounded losses, sending the oil and gas index to a near 7-month low. Retail stocks were also weighed by Belgian food retailer Colruyt falling 4.8 percent after its full-year results missed consensus.  This disappointing performance is mainly due to higher operating costs as Colruyt continued to invest in staff and stores, as well as a more competitive environment in Belgium in the second hald,  said Barclays analysts. Scout24 fell after Deutsche Telekom sold a 9.3 percent stake in the online classified-ads firm. Meanwhile, Costa Coffee owner Whitbread was the best European performer, up 5.1 percent after reporting first-quarter sales rose 7.6 percent. It spurred the European travel and leisure sector up 0.2 percent, the only sector not in the red. Despite some glum company updates on the day, the latest first-quarter results figures highlight the reasons for investors’ belief in underlying strength among European corporates. STOXX 600 companies have on average reported earnings 10.2 percent above estimates, beating the 4 percent average surprise factor (since 2011) and the 6 percent surprise factor over the past four quarters, Thomson Reuters data showed. Of the 300 companies reporting first quarter revenues to date, 74.3 percent exceeded analyst estimates, against 53.6 percent in a typical quarter.

MSCI said its emerging equity benchmark would include 222 China so-called  A  shares from next year, a move that could bring up to $18 billion into the country initially. The announcement pushed Shanghai and Shenzen markets 0.5 and 1.2 percent higher , while Saudi Arabian stocks, put on the watchlist for eventual inclusion into the index, enjoyed a 2-percent rally The Saudi market was also boosted by news that Prince Mohammed bin Salman, architect of the kingdom's economic reforms, had been promoted to become crown prince. Investors saw this as reassurance that reforms – including selling a stake in oil firm Saudi Aramco - will continue. However, MSCI's emerging equity index slipped 0.6 percent as Asian bourses in Hong Kong and Korea lost ground on anticipated selling by investors to make room for China. The other drag was the oil price fall, with Brent crude down almost 10 percent this month, hitting inflation expectations and potentially forcing the U.S. Federal Reserve to put rate-hike plans on hold. The U.S. bond curve has reacted, pushing spreads between five- and 10-year yields to the narrowest since 2007. Morgan Stanley analysts said the backdrop was a mixed one for emerging markets which have taken in new money for seven months in a row.  The recent decline of oil prices suggests that global funding costs may stay low for longer, keeping yield searching investors pushing funds into EM assets,  Morgan Stanley wrote.  There is one caveat to consider in the short term. Over recent weeks U.S. inflation expectations have fallen faster than nominal yield, pushing U.S. real yields to their highest levels since March. Elevated real yield could provide a risk hiccup, explaining why the equity market traded lower overnight.  Commodity exporters' currencies extended losses, with the rouble down 0.7 percent to 4-1/2 month low against the dollar and the rand falling 0.5 percent. The Chinese yuan was flat, shrugging off potential MSCI-related inflow, with many feeling that capital outflows from China would eclipse foreign buying. HSBC analysts said the $18 billion that the market could initially receive was  not large  in the context of China's balance of payments.  The inflows may also not be enough to offset residents' structural asset diversification outflows, which support our forecasts for a modest yuan depreciation to 6.9 by end-2017 and 7.0 by end-2018,  HSBC added. On the bonds front, Russia successfully placed 10- and 30-year dollar bonds despite extended U.S. sanctions and both issues, sold at par, were holding up well, with the 30-year issue marked higher at 100.85/101. Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Union Investments said the 30-year tranche was attractive, offering a 30-40 basis point premium over the Russian secondary market.  So far generally there is good appetite for long-end bonds, look at Argentina's 100-year deal,  he said, referring to the  century  bond issue on Monday.

In light of the further increase in price inflation for retail goods ... annual sales growth in volume terms had continued to slow.

Carrie Lam, 60, Hong Kong's first female chief executive, faces various challenges including healing social rifts as public resentment grows over what many see as Beijing's interference in city affairs and its denial of full democracy.  We pledge to serve the people with pragmatism and build a better Hong Kong for the next generation,  said Lam, who stood before a large sign with the words  We Care, We Listen, We Act  in announcing her new cabinet. Lam and her leadership team will be sworn in on July 1 when the former British colony of 7.3 million people marks the 20th anniversary of its return to China. Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule under promises enshrined in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, that it would be granted a high degree of autonomy, with full democracy an  ultimate aim . But two decades later, the city's chief executive is still chosen by an electoral college stacked with Beijing loyalists. China declined to make any concessions to student protesters demanding universal suffrage in  Occupy  street demonstrations in 2014. Hong Kong Chief Executive-elect Carrie Lam (in white) poses with top officials of her administration in Hong Kong, China June 21, 2017.Bobby YipLam has promised a  new leadership style  after a sometimes divisive five years under a predecessor who many Hong Kong citizens saw as too keen to please Beijing. Despite the promise of change, her team is made up mostly of familiar faces including Financial Secretary Paul Chan, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung and Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen.  The only newcomer is Law Chi-kwong, a moderate former member of the Democratic Party, who will become the next labor and welfare secretary, an apparent nod to the opposition. Slideshow (3 Images)Lam said she would try  advancing democracy  but gave no specifics. In an interview with China's official Xinhua news agency this week, Lam warned Hong Kong activists not to promote independence from China.  In the future the (Hong Kong) government will act strictly according to the law. Any action taken on 'Hong Kong independence' is against local laws. We must strictly implement the law,  Lam told Xinhua. At a time when Hong Kong's competitiveness, including in financial services, has been eroded by the likes of Singapore, Shanghai and London, Lam said a financial leaders forum would be formed to  push Hong Kong's financial sector to a new level . Hong Kong should  have the guts  to change tax regulations to enhance competitiveness, she said.

The euro zone's northernmost member is returning to growth after a decade of stagnation sparked among other things by the decline of Nokia's former phone business, rigid labour markets and a recession in neighbouring Russia. The ministry expects gross domestic product to grow 2.4 percent this year, 1.6 percent in 2018 and 1.5 percent in 2019 against forecasts in April for growth of just 1.2 percent in 2017, 1.0 percent in 2018 and 1.2 percent in 2019.  Conditions are improving for growth in exports as global export demand is rising and businesses are becoming more cost-competitive. After years of negative contribution, foreign trade will begin boosting GDP growth,  a ministry statement said. However, the ageing population will mean an increase public spending and government debt after 2020, sending the debt-to-GDP ratio up from existing levels of about 64 percent, it said.  The upswing will not resolve structural problems in the economy. Long-term growth prospects are muted, with insufficient revenue to cover public spending over the long term,  it said. The centre-right government, which this week survived a coalition crisis, is looking to implement a complicated health care and local government reform to cut future spending. However, it is set to fall short of its target to lift the employment rate to 72 percent from 69 percent by 2019, the ministry said, calling for more reforms to boost employment.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) green light for Mydayis follows good results for Shire's new hereditary angioedema drug and helps offset the setback of early generic competition to a Shire drug for ulcerative colitis. Shares in Dublin-based Shire rose 1.5 percent by 0800 GMT in London on Wednesday following the overnight FDA news. The new drug Mydayis, previously known as SHP465, contains the same active ingredient as Shire's widely used attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment Adderall XR but is formulated to last up to 16 hours. Adderall XR, which is also available in generic forms, manages symptoms for up to 12 hours.  It's obviously not a new molecule but it does extend delivery,  said Gregory Mattingly, who has been a study investigator in multiple Shire ADHD drug trials. Shire, whose ADHD drugs Adderall XR and Vyvanse generated close to $2.4 billion in sales last year, plans to launch Mydayis in the third quarter of 2017. The company has said Mydayis could have annual sales of $500 million by 2020, well above the $294 million consensus figure, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. Jefferies analysts noted that every ADHD drug launched by Shire has significantly exceeded initial market projections. While Shire was once best-known for its ADHD medicines, analysts now view the business as essentially a cash-generating machine to help the company repay debt and fund investment in its large portfolio of drugs for rare diseases. Mydayis is designed to help those patients, many of them college students or adults, who now take two doses of various ADHD treatments to control their symptoms throughout the day. The drug cannot be used by children aged 12 years or younger. Shire first filed an application to market Mydayis in 2006 but faced multiple setbacks, including a requirement for additional studies to satisfy the FDA. ADHD is characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that affects development. Estimates vary but recent data show up to 11 percent of American children are afflicted and more than half continue to suffer as adults. Both Mydayis and Adderall XR contain amphetamine, a stimulant that elevates levels of dopamine - a neurotransmitter associated with motivation, attention and movement.  As a stimulant, such drugs carry a risk of abuse, can be poorly tolerated, and even be fatal in rare cases. Non-stimulant ADHD treatments have fewer side-effects but are typically less effective. Other ADHD drug developers include Neos Theraputics Inc, Alcobra Ltd, Aevi Genomic Medicine and privately held NLS Pharma.

China's overture appeared aimed at deepening engagement with the influential young couple, who played a role in the first summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in April, which set an improved tone for relations between the world's two biggest economies. Kushner, a senior adviser who entered the White House with no government experience, has been assigned the job of conducting Middle East peace diplomacy and will visit the region this week for talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Helping to manage relations with China is another part of his foreign policy portfolio. At the same time, Kushner has come under heavy scrutiny, with high-profile investigations into alleged contacts between current and former Trump aides and Russian officials. No further details were available on the Chinese invitation, which was first reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed by a White House official on condition of anonymity. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had seen reports of the visit but that he was not aware of any details.  Trump railed against China, especially its trade practices, during the presidential campaign. A fence-mending phone call in February was arranged by Kushner and China's U.S. ambassador, Cui Tiankai, U.S. officials said, after Cui invited Ivanka Trump to the Chinese embassy's Lunar New Year reception, where her daughter sang in Mandarin. Kushner helped plan and attended the U.S.-China summit at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in April. Trump has since had warm words for Xi, praising him for cooperation with efforts to rein in Beijing's nuclear-armed neighbor North Korea. But analysts question how long rapprochement can last if North Korea continues its nuclear and missile development in defiance of international pressure.

Shares in Dublin-based Shire rose 1.5 percent by 0800 GMT in London on Wednesday following the overnight FDA news. The new drug Mydayis, previously known as SHP465, contains the same active ingredient as Shire's widely used attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment Adderall XR but is formulated to last up to 16 hours.

We'd thought we'd get a drop off because it's Wednesday and it's cold, it's very cold this morning...but we were thrilled with the response.  Swimmers ran into the Derwent River as members of the Holy Tantra Esoteric Buddhist community played drums and cymbals as the sun rose after the year's longest night, and warmed themselves by fires lit in bins afterwards.   This is the best way to start the year , said one participant.  This is the fifth year the swim has been organized. It takes place on the winter solstice, which marks the shortest day of the year in the southern hemisphere.

Signs of a growing glut of supply sent Brent crude futures skidding back to $45.50 a barrel as European trading gathered momentum. Poorly performing banking stocks also made for a weak start for London, Paris and Frankfurt's stock markets. The slide in energy costs boosted bond prices and flattened yield curves as investors priced in lower inflation for longer, while safe-haven flows underpinned the Japanese yen. The spread between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds shrank to the smallest since 2007 as investors wagered the Federal Reserve might have to delay further rate hikes. Thirty-year German debt yields bonds also tumbled back towards two-month lows, adding to a more than 20-basis-point drop over the past month and ahead of what will now be a closely watched sale of 30-year debt in Berlin later.  The plunge in oil prices ignited a bull flattening on the German and U.S. curve,  analysts at UniCredit said in a note adding that it suggested  reflation trades are finally deflated.  The recent setback for crude and commodity prices as well some equity markets is partly down to doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump's promised multi-trillion dollar stimulus programme, which had raised hopes of boosted inflation and growth.  Brent now the lowest since mid-November: remember that whole reflation thing? No, neither does the market,  Rabobank analysts told clients in a reference to Brent crude futures, which have slid almost 10 percent this month. Oil had shed 2 percent on Tuesday, taking U.S. crude futures 20 percent off recent highs and thus into official bear territory, a red flag to investors who follow technical trends. In Asia there had been muted reaction to global index provider MSCI's decision to add the first batch of mainland Chinese stocks to its popular emerging equity benchmark. Indexes in Shanghai and Shenzen moved around 0.5 percent higher after the decision, which could ultimately bring $340 billion of foreign capital to the so-called A-share market. The commodity and bond market turbulence and falls in Europe pushed MSCI's all-country share index down 0.3 percent after its 0.7-percent slide on Tuesday compounded by a weak close on Wall Street . Joining the Club The acceptance of some Chinese  A  shares into MSCI's Emerging Markets Index was seen as a symbolic win for Beijing after three failed attempts. Yet the step is still a small one. Only 222 stocks are being included and, with a weighting of just 5 percent, they will account for only 0.73 percent of the Emerging Markets Index. MSCI estimated the change, due around the middle of next year, would drive inflows of between $17 billion and $18 billion. China's market cap is roughly $7 trillion. The index provider set out a laundry list of liberalisation requirements before it would consider further expansion.  We suspect that it will be a long time before this happens,  wrote analysts at Capital Economics in a note.  While China's weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index may ultimately rise to 40 percent or so, this rise is likely to be slow,  they added.  The upshot is that any initial boost to equities is likely to be small.  The initial reaction was indeed restrained, with China's CSI300 index up 0.5 percent. MSCI also said it would consult on adding Saudi Arabia to the emerging markets benchmark and that Nigeria will remain a frontier market, but it shocked many emerging market investors by declining to upgrade Argentina from the frontier market category. In currency markets, the flight from oil and into long-dated government bond benefited the safe-have yen which climbed to 111.120 per dollar. The U.S. currency was holding its own elsewhere though - oil and the greenback often move inversely. Against a basket of currencies, it was steady at 97.736 having touched a five-week peak overnight. The euro stood at $1.1131 after hitting a three-week low, while the dollar eased a touch on the yen to 111.27. Sterling was still in the firing line sliding back under $1.26 and towards 90 percent per euro. It took a spill after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney hosed down speculation that he might soon back higher interest rates, saying he first wanted to see how the economy coped with Brexit talks.

Hong Kong trading volumes have already been under pressure in recent years from a growing number of China exchange traded funds (ETFs) based in other countries. Alex Wong, a director at Ample Finance Group, said that the Hong Kong market was under pressure  on anticipation of capital outflows in the very long run due to the inclusion.  Ronald Chan, Chief Investment Officer at  Manulife Asset Management, Asia, said:  The universe to choose from is much larger in the domestic Chinese market compared to that of Hong Kong.

Rusnok's comments were in line with recent remarks of other central bankers, including bank board member Marek Mora or Vice Governor Vladimir Tomsik. The seven-strong board will meet on June 29 to assess risks to its staff outlook released in May.  Yes, it (rate hike) can come in the third quarter, however that is rather a model calculation, but from the monetary-policy view it does not look like it,  Rusnok said in an interview with Czech news agency CTK.  If there is a raising of rates, it would be in small steps. Should the crown continue with its strengthening, that can be a reason for a slower rise of rates,  he said. The central bank ended a cap on the crown in April, abandoning this tool after more than three years during which it prevented the crown from firming beyond 27 to the euro in order to spur inflation. That opened the door to a rise in interest rates, which would be the first rate hike in almost a decade. After the central bank freed the crown, it had settled around 26.50 versus the euro in May but then jumped to 26.115 last week, 3.4 percent stronger than the former cap. It traded around 26.32 on Wednesday morning. Czech gross domestic product has been growing among the fastest in the European Union, pushing unemployment in the country to the lowest level in the 28-member bloc.

Its budget pressured by low oil prices, Riyadh slashed the allowances last September to save money, but announced in April that it was restoring them to stimulate economic growth and because its first-quarter deficit was smaller than expected. A royal order published by state news agency SPA on Wednesday, and which accompanied the announcement of Prince Mohammed bin Salman's promotion to the post of crown prince, took the further step of restoring the allowances retroactively back to September.

This should not impact the overall budget or the budgeted deficit but we expect that it will contribute toward increased consumer spending and confidence, serving as a boost to economic growth and ensuring stability in consumer demand trends going forward,  Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in the statement.

While, at the start of the year, the country reported the highest growth rates among Eastern European countries amid very low inflation rates, this momentum is essentially based on thrifty fiscal policy,  analysts at Commerzbank said in a note.      The elevated political uncertainty is weighing on the RON. The managed currency recently traded at just under 4.60 EUR-RON and has thus not been so weak since 2012. The political situation should keep the RON under pressure initially.      The forint was a touch stronger in early trade, pulling back from a one-month-low caused by Tuesday's decision by the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to push more funds than expected from its three-month deposits into the economy to help cut borrowing costs.     The NBH, seen as the most dovish central bank in central Europe, also lowered its inflation forecasts for the next two years and affirmed its readiness to ease monetary conditions further if below-target inflation persists.      This supports our call of limited HUF appreciation potential going forward as the (NBH) will remain reluctant to end its expansionary monetary policy,  analysts at Raiffeisen Bank said in a note.      We would expect to see HUF underperforming its peers PLN (Polish zloty) and CZK (Czech crown) over the coming months as their central banks are expected to tighten monetary policy earlier.      Before Tuesday's policy meeting, analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the Hungarian base rate staying unchanged at least until the second quarter of 2019.     Czech central bank Governor Jiri Rusnok was quoted as saying on Wednesday that the strength of the crown, trading on the strong side of its former cap on its value at 27 to the euro, could be a reason for a slower rise in interest rates.      A currency dealer said the crown was likely to stay in a range between 26.150-26.450 in the coming days.

Formed by over 30 organizations,  Instinct for Life  says the worst-hit countries - Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala – need to cut homicides by 7 percent a year to halve murder rates and save up to 365,000 lives over 10 years. “Governments are spending a disproportionate amount on servicing their police, their prosecutors, their defenders, their penal systems - and growing them, at the expense of what are ultimately much more urgent requirements for human development,” said Robert Muggah, research director of Brazil’s Igarapé Institute, one of the campaign’s coordinators. The seven most dangerous countries account for around a third of the world’s homicides, with violence in some cities on a par with war zones, according to a report by  Instinct for Life , which includes the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the Organization of American States, alongside local non-profit and civil society groups. In the highly urbanized region, where stark social inequality, youth unemployment and weak legal systems fuel crime, homicide rates in 120 cities were above 25 per 100,000 inhabitants, it said.  With 144,000 homicides a year, the region spends as much on security as it does on infrastructure, according to the report, which cited IADB figures showing violence and crime cost around 3.6 percent of the region’s gross domestic product. Meanwhile, systemic impunity in Latin America means “the opportunity cost of committing crime is very low”, said Muggah. Around 80 percent of homicides in Mexico are not prosecuted, rising to 92 percent in Honduras and Brazil, said the report. Only around a third of people trust the judicial system in the region which has experienced a “normalization of violence”, it added. Poor, young non-white men are most likely to be victims, but around 12 women are killed every day, with the highest rates in Honduras, El Salvador and Dominican Republic, said the report, citing U.N. figures.  Ground Up  Using data to target specific people and streets that are crime hotspots has had a positive impact in some places, along with rehabilitation programs for those coming out of jail, said the report, urging governments to set clear targets.  Psychological techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for potential perpetrators, have also proved successful, as have early childhood intervention and programs to protect women, including health services and strict gun controls for abusive partners. Muggah said those approaches deliver the best longer-term results but “aren’t so popular politically as they don’t give you the quick return”. Heavy-handed tactics - often linked to rising prison populations and human rights abuses including torture and disappearances – have not worked and have even increased violence in some countries, the report said.  There is growing awareness among mayors, legislators and businesses that building security from the ground up is more effective, the report said.  Ways to reduce urban crime include improving transport and infrastructure such as hospitals in poor areas, as well as smaller measures like installing cameras and street lighting, and eliminating dead-ends, it added. But cities dominated by extreme violence can require tactics more akin to counter-insurgency, said Muggah.  Better security has often depended on the outcome of turf wars and truces between rival gangs, or deals hammered out with governments, said Muggah, referring to Medellin in Colombia, Mexico's Ciudad Juarez and Sao Paulo in Brazil.  “It’s not in the interest of governments to often be vocal about that because these are deeply unpopular measures - most people in Latin America would like to see the bandits arrested, if not a lot worse,” he said.

Oil prices held near multi-month lows on Wednesday as investors discounted evidence of strong compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers with a deal to cut global output. That pulled the commodity-linked complex of currencies lower with the Norwegian crown languishing close to 5-month lows against the dollar after falling half a percent on Tuesday. It last traded at 8.5564 crowns per dollar, down 0.2 percent on the day. The Canadian dollar, which fell about 0.4 percent on Tuesday, traded at C$1.3296 per dollar, down 0.2 percent on the day. It moved further away from a 3-1/2-month high of C$1.3165 reached a week ago after Bank of Canada's governor expressed support for an interest rate hike. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.7550 and the New Zealand dollar was 0.2 percent lower at $0.7228 .  The culprit behind their (commodity currencies) lacklustre performance is the oil price in recent days,  said Valentin Marinov, head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole in London.  The key question for the FX markets on the day is the extent to which the oil price weakness will ultimately grow into a broad-based risk-off move.  The safe-haven yen, which tends to gain when  risk-on  commodity currencies decline, rose 0.3 percent to 111.120 yen per dollar. The dollar itself stayed tightly range-bound, almost flat against a basket of peers at 97.764. The euro was also flat at $1.1132, off a seven-month peak of $1.1296. Sterling hit fresh two-month lows, extending its declines after Bank of England governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that now was not the time to raise British interest rates. It was last 0.3 percent lower at $1.2590. Last week three out of eight BoE policymakers voted in favour of a rate hike and raised hopes for a near-term tightening. Prime Minister Theresa May is still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists' Party, nearly two weeks after Britain's election produced no clear majority for any party.  Sterling is weak as this political risk premium embedded in the pound looks like it is set to extend into next week with the DUP and the Conservative Party still not finalizing talks,  said Stephen Gallo, currency strategist with BMO Capital Markets in London.

A renewed slump in oil markets to seven-month lows put Asian investors on edge, and pushed down U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar index against a basket of currencies.                        It's mostly the dollar (supporting gold). It is a little bit weaker than yesterday's closing,  said Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo branch manager at ICBC Standard Bank.       Spot gold        was up 0.2 percent at $1,245.82 per ounce, as of 0801 GMT.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery climbed 0.3 percent to $1,246.7 per ounce     Gold is also being supported by a bout of short-covering following its recent weakness, said OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan.     However, the possibility of another interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year is underpinning the bearish outlook for the yellow metal, he added.       Meanwhile, the outlook for inflation and the future of financial stability are emerging as dueling concerns at the heart of a debate at the U.S. central bank over how fast to proceed on future interest-rate hikes.                  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan on Tuesday expressed doubt that short-term interest rates are very accommodative and said he wants to wait for more data to understand whether recent weak inflation readings are transitory as he suspects.                  Higher interest rates tend to boost the dollar and push bond yields up, pressuring gold prices by increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.         Spot gold may break resistance at $1,248 per ounce and rise towards the next resistance level at $1,251, as it has managed to stabilize around support at $1,243, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.      A lack of solid data this week globally won't be helping gold's direction in either way,  said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.     Russia's central bank posted an increase in gold reserves in May, the fifth consecutive month of gains.                  Among other precious metals, silver        gained 0.1 percent to $16.47 per ounce, hovering near a six-week low hit in the previous session.     Platinum        slid 0.1 percent to $917.25 per ounce, while palladium        was flat at $867.99 per ounce.

Founded in Berlin in 2008, Zalando has expanded rapidly and now delivers 1,500 brands in 15 countries, but is looking for ways to diversify as the pace of growth has slowed. Up until recently, Zalando has focused on the wholesale business, buying shoes, clothes and accessories from brands and shipping them to customers from huge out-of-town warehouses. Now it has built up technology and logistics expertise, as well as a loyal customer base, it is offering these services to brands, potentially a more profitable business than just selling fashion itself.  The target is to double the company again by 2020,  co-chief executive Rubin Ritter told a media event. A spokeswoman said Zalando aimed to double from the 3.6 billion euros ($4 billion) in sales reached in 2016. Analysts currently expect Zalando to reach sales of 7.6 billion euros by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, it is the first time that the company itself had set out mid-term sales goals. Zalando will have capacity to handle 8 billion euros of sales once new warehouses planned in Sweden and Poland are ready, said Birgit Opp, new senior vice president finance, adding that the company ultimately targets 20 billion in sales. Zalando says that the wholesale model that accounts for about 90 percent of revenues can yield an earnings before interest and taxation margin of 10 percent, with Opp saying the margin should be higher for the new services it offers brands. New Partners Zalando announced on Friday that Nike is joining its partner programme, which involves Zalando selling a wide range of inventory on its website for a commission, rather than buying stock wholesale. David Schroeder, operations chief at Zalando, said the scheme was particularly attractive for brands that want to retain control over their stock and its presentation.  It turns Zalando into a shopping mall,  he said, adding that also helped to differentiate Zalando from Amazon, seen as a threat to Zalando as it expands its fashion ranges. Zalando is also adding H&M;'s Weekday brand in a wholesale deal. Zalando said that Danish fashion group Bestseller, which owns brands such as Jack & Jones and Vero Moda, is becoming its first major customer for logistics services, paying Zalando to store its stock in its warehouses and ship orders. In addition, Zalando said it has struck deals with German shoe retailer Schuh.de to put the inventory of its physical stores on its site as well as with four stores of U.S. brand Tommy Hilfiger in Berlin.

The figures are among the most detailed on the scheme and come after several members of the European Parliament criticised the ECB for the lack of transparency on the roughly 100 billion euros worth of buys. The ECB purchases the bonds as part of its 2.3 trillion asset buying programme, known as quantitative easing, aimed at curbing borrowing costs to induce growth and ultimately inflation. The ECB said the structure of the buys, including the geographic or sector distribution, broadly reflect the eligible universe as the market is heavily skewed towards large firms in western and northern Europe. The ECB also noted that bond issuance has increased since the scheme started, with the growth rate doubling to around 10 percent, even as bank lending is rising. This would suggest that the scheme is indeed inducing the issuance of new debt, a welcome trend for the ECB, as it tries to induce more borrowing that could fund investments and thus growth. The ECB has so far bought around 950 different corporate bonds from around 200 firms, with 30 percent coming from Germany and 25 percent from France. Spain and Italy each represent around a 10th of purchases. Just over half of bonds were rated BBB, the lowest rated bonds the bank can buy and only 11 percent were AA rated, the ECB said.

As the evening sun lingers, the growing crowd spills onto the quiet leafy street, where asylum seekers eagerly don high visibility vests and helmets to test ride their new gifts.  I will use this bike to go to college where I can learn English so I can move forward with my life,  said Syrian refugee Khalib, 44, at The Bike Project, a charity that donates bicycles to refugees, along with helmets, vests, lights and basic cycling training.  I noticed that English people use bikes a lot so it's a good way for us to get around, especially given how expensive transport is in London,  Khalib said in Arabic through a translator. He didn't reveal his full name for privacy reasons having fled the Syrian capital Damascus in 2013. Travel can be difficult for refugees and asylum seekers in London, since many cannot afford public transport and often walk for hours to access services or to meet friends and families. London-based charity Housing Justice said people waiting for asylum, or those appealing their rejected claims were most at risk of destitution since they are not entitled to regular welfare benefits nor are they allowed to work. The British Red Cross said it helped over 14,000 homeless and destitute asylum seekers in 2016 who relied on an asylum allowance of about 36 pounds ($46) a week.  The Bike Project estimates that a bicycle can help a refugee save about 20 pounds ($25) a week on bus fares, which is more than 1,000 pounds ($1,300) a year.   By having a bike, it saves them spending money on really expensive transport fares so they can access support and services that they need, or meet people,  said Anna Chapman, a spokeswoman at The Bike Project.  It's such a big, tough city to come to. You've got language barriers - all sorts of barriers. And it's just one practical tool that can help make that settling process just a little bit easier,  she said. Since it started in 2013, the charity has given more than 2,500 refurbished bicycles to newly settled asylum seekers and refugees in London. The group also sells bicycles online to help fund the project.     The sense of community also sees many refugees and locals, like Vicky Carnegy, signing up to volunteer. Carnegy said she was struck by the simplicity of the project when she decided to help out more than a year ago.  It's a bit of no brainer to give bikes to people who've come here with nothing ... and to give them something that's going to make their mobility and health much better,  said Carnegy, who teaches women refugees how to cycle each week.  And who doesn't like being given something? It's no strings attached,  she said.

Development of the Corunna Downs mine by Australia's fifth biggest producer, costing between A$47-A$53 million ($35-$40 million), was announced in February when iron ore was trading at around $95 a tonne. Prices have since retreated to under $60 a tonne on concerns about oversupply and weak demand from steelmakers in China, the world's top buyer.  Corunna Downs remains an important project for the company to sustain its production base and we will proceed with its development when market conditions improve,  Atlas Managing Director Cliff Lawrenson said in a statement. The mine was a key plank in efforts to rebuild the company's yearly production rate to 12 million tonnes, after the firm almost collapsed during a previous down cycle before being rescued by creditors. Atlas was forced to suspend mining in April 2015 when it was losing $15 for each tonne mined. It faces higher costs than some other Australian producers because it uses road, not rail, to ship ore up to 230 kilometers (140 miles) to port. Within a year, the mines were back running, after 70 percent of Atlas was transferred to creditors in exchange for a 48-percent reduction in debt. Inventories of imported iron ore at Chinese ports last stood at 138.95 million tonnes, according to the latest data tracked by SteelHome. The week before stockpiles hit a record 140.05 million tonnes SH-TOT-IRONINV. Forecasters for Citi expect an iron ore surplus of over 100 million tonnes this year. The bank has slashed its 2017 average forecast to $61 a tonne from $70, and to $50 from $53 for next year. In lieu of developing Corunna Downs, Atlas said it would add an additional 2 million tonnes of production capacity from its existing mines for an overall annual rate of 9-10 million tonnes. $1 = 1.3243 Australian dollars Reporting by James Regan; Editing by Joseph Radford","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/australia-atlas-iron-idUSL3N1JI2IB"},

A PAC-3 Patriot battery drove on to the Asaka Self Defence Forces base near Tokyo, deployed its radar antenna and raised its missile launcher to firing position. The drill is one of four being held across Japan.  Making this public is a way to reassure people about their safety and bring peace of mind,  Akinori Hanada, an Air Self Defence Force major, told reporters. North Korea has pushed ahead with its missile and nuclear weapons programmes in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and regularly threatens to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this month North Korea's advancing weapons programmes were the  most urgent  threat to national security and that its means to deliver them had increased in speed and scope. South Korea has deployed the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system to protect against the North Korean threat, angering China, North Korea's lone major ally. Japan's PAC-3 batteries are the last line of defence against any incoming warheads. With a range of around 15 km (9 miles), they are only able to protect larger cities and key government installations. Advances in North Korea's ballistic missile programme have raised concern in Tokyo that its PAC-3 batteries and Aegis destroyers in the Sea of Japan could be overwhelmed. Japan has begun a $1 billion program to upgrade the PAC-3s to extend their range and accuracy, but the first of those will not be ready until 2020. In addition to public PAC-3 exercises, some Japanese prefectures have also conducted missile attack evacuation drills in recent weeks. Japan will follow these up with a series of 30-second public information broadcasts and newspaper ads beginning Friday advising people what to do in the event of a North Korean missile attack, the Yomiuri newspaper said. A Japanese government spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about the report. Editing by Nick Macfie","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-missiles-japan-idUSL3N1JI2U9"},

FIFA said on Tuesday it had warned the FMF about the misconduct of a  small group of Mexican fans in relation to insulting and discriminatory chants  during Sunday's 2-2 draw against Portugal. Mexico fans have long shouted an insult at keepers taking goal kicks which gay rights groups argue is homophobic. Mexican media said the chant was heard again on Sunday when Portugal goalkeeper Rui Patricio took goal kicks, though on a smaller scale than in the past.  As you know, FIFA is very serious about the chanting that we do when the goalkeeper takes a kick, and the possible sanctions are serious,  FMF said in a statement directed at the team's supporters.  Our efforts on the pitch will come to nothing if, because of this (behaviour), we lose the match, the game is suspended or you are expelled from the stadium.  We lose, you lose, everyone loses.  Mexico have already been fined eight times during the course of the World Cup qualifying competition because of homophobic chanting. The matches in question were at home and away to El Salvador, home and away to Canada, at home to Honduras, away to the United States, and at home to Panama and Costa Rica in a period starting in November 2015 until this March. Mexican media said the chant was also heard at matches at home to Honduras and the U.S. earlier this month, although FIFA could not immediately reached for comment on whether disciplinary proceedings had been opened in those cases.

Deutsche Bank, in a client note, called the update  reassuring  with positive numbers in all businesses. First-quarter sales at the Costa Coffee chain rose by 8.7 percent while Premier Inn's total sales were up 9.2 percent, with revenue per available room at its London properties rising by 2.8 percent.  Costa has started the year well and Premier Inn continues to win share, albeit in a weaker than expected hotel market. , Whitbread said. Sales at Costa Coffee stores running for over a year rose 1.1 percent for the 13 weeks to June 1, reversing a 0.8 percent contraction seen in the preceding 13 weeks, which was the final quarter of the previous financial year. Sales in Costa were also helped by a steady performance at its drive-through travel format stores and the introduction of a new breakfast range towards the end of first quarter, Whitbread said. Whitbread said it remained on track to open about 4,200 hotel rooms and 230-250 Costa coffee shops this year.

Four men are charged with the killings of the 71 men, women and children at the height of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015. They and seven others are also charged with the smuggling of hundreds of people across Europe. The one Afghan and three Bulgarians facing murder charges were led into the Hungarian courtroom in handcuffs by armed police wearing face masks on the opening day of their trial. The bearded Afghan man, named as Lahoo Samsooryamal and described as leader of the smuggling gang, smiled at the media as he entered. He carried a folder in his hands bearing the words  Allahu Akbar  (God is Great). The bodies of the 59 men, eight women and four children, from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, were found inside the abandoned truck on August 26, 2015.  The 71 victims, due to the small space, inability to move, a lack of air and overheating ... died shortly after they set off on the journey,  the Kecskemet court said in a statement posted on its website before the hearing.      Before their deaths they continuously banged on the sides of the lorry and shouted.   The deaths shocked Europe as it struggled to cope with the massive influx of migrants. It was the worst incident of its kind on the route across the Balkans taken by hundreds of thousands fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Prosecutor Gabor Schmidt spoke for five hours in court on Wednesday, listing 26 counts of people-smuggling, with the journey in which the 71 died as one of the last cases.  He said that as the migrant crisis peaked in 2015, the defendants stepped up their operation to maximize profits, taking up to 100 people a day from Hungary to Austria or Germany, mostly along the M1 motorway connecting Budapest with Vienna. Before the August incident, the defendants had carried many migrants in similar conditions, causing  significant physical and mental suffering , the prosecutor said. Cries Ceased Schmidt said the Afghan defendant had promised to pay 3,500 euros to one of the Bulgarian defendants to drive the Volvo freezer truck from the Serbian-Hungarian border to Germany.

The three others in the smuggling gang followed the truck in cars, and were in phone contact during the journey. The migrants started banging on the sides of the vehicle and shouting 30-40 minutes after departure.  Schmidt said the driver of the truck repeatedly told his Afghan boss about the cries for help, but was told not to stop to open the doors. He obeyed.  The defendants were aware that the people inside the Volvo were shouting and banging ... because they could not breathe,  the prosecutor told the court.

The prosecutor said the Afghan had told one of the other defendants by phone that  he wanted the victims to die  and that if they did, the bodies should be dumped later.  The gang stopped twice to check the engine's coolant water and refuel, but did not open the doors. At one stop, no more shouting could be heard. The convoy drove across to Austria and abandoned the vehicle near Parndorf.  They were aware that the victims locked up inside the lorry would suffocate unless let out,  the prosecutor said.  All victims ... died within three hours, at the latest, after the start of the journey.  The four defendants are also charged with smuggling other migrants over several months. Seven other men are charged only with smuggling. Only six of the seven, who are all Bulgarians, appeared in court in the Hungarian city of Kecskemet. Authorities said one was still on the run.

Kuroda, in a speech on Wednesday, reiterated the BOJ's growing optimism on the economic outlook due to rising exports, higher factory output, and a tightening labor market. Kuroda's remarks came after minutes of the central bank's April 26-27 meeting showed policymakers see no problem if government debt purchases fall below its guidance for market operations.  Our economy is on firmer footing, but we are still distant from our 2 percent inflation target,  Kuroda said.  It is appropriate to keep monetary conditions easy with our current market operations framework.  The BOJ kept monetary policy on hold at the meeting in April and offered its most optimistic assessment of the economy in nine years. The BOJ also retained a loose pledge to buy government bonds so its holdings increase at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($719 billion), contrary to market speculation the guidance could be removed because the BOJ is trying to taper policy. Since then, Kuroda has repeatedly signaled that he is not contemplating an early exit, and that the pace of government debt purchases could rise again as easily as it has fallen recently. The BOJ has reduced the pace of government bond purchases in recent months, which if maintained would lead to an annual increase of only 60 trillion yen. However, Kuroda's reassurances have tamed speculation that the BOJ is about to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in exiting quantitative easing. Kuroda, on Wednesday, offered an optimistic assessment of capital expenditure and corporate profits, highlighting the BOJ's growing confidence in the economy. Japan's output gap is moving into positive territory, but this has been slow to translate into higher consumer prices, Kuroda said. At its most recent meeting on June 15-16 the BOJ upgraded its assessment of consumption but kept policy on hold.

Europe's benchmark borrower is set to sell 30-year debt on Wednesday following a more than 20 basis point decline in yields over the past month. Yields tend to rise ahead of debt sales as investors make room in portfolios for the new supply, but there was little sign of that in early European trading with oil prices wallowing at multi-month lows and dimming the outlook for inflation. Weak inflation influenced the cautious tone expressed by the bloc's central bankers at a meeting earlier this month, and has made investors question whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will be able to raise interest rates again this year after a hike last week. A U.S. policymaker said on Tuesday that low yields meant the central bank would have to be careful about raising rates further. The Bank of Japan said it will lag well behind the Fed in dialling back its massive stimulus programme, with inflation far from its 2 percent target.  In a relatively quiet market we would normally expect some weakness ahead of the auction,  Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet said.  But we think the bond will attract buyers given the monetary policy backdrop... As yields have fallen in the 10-year sector also, there will be more demand from investors that need to add yield to their portfolios.  German 30-year bond yields fell 2 basis points to 1.05 percent on Wednesday, within a whisker of two-month lows of 1.04 percent hit last week. Ten-year equivalents were also down 2 bps at 0.25 percent, close to two-month lows . At 169 bps, the gap between Germany's two-year and 30-year yields was the lowest it has been this year. This flattening of the yield curve tends to occur when investors start to question the long-term path for monetary policy and interest rates. It has been particularly noticeable in the United States where the curve is the flattest it has been in a decade .

The blue-chip CSI300 index shook off a bout of early profit taking to end up 1.2 percent at 3,587.96 points, its highest close since Dec. 31, 2015. The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.5 percent to 3,156.21. Reaction to MSCI's announcement was largely muted in the morning as traders say a  Yes  decision had already been priced in, but a chorus of positive responses from brokerages and fund managers appeared to lure more funds into blue-chips in the afternoon.  We believe the inclusion of A-Shares in the MSCI will give a significant boost to China's stock market in the long run,  said Kathryn Shih, president, Asia Pacific at UBS. Rakesh Patel, head of Asia Pacific equities at HSBC, said the initial impact from the inclusion could be limited, expecting about $12-14 billion of flows from active and passive investors in the first year after inclusion.  But on a five-10 year view, there's potential for $500 billion worth of inflows, which is huge. This is based on full-weight, full inclusion for both MSCI and FTSE.  Consumer and financials - the two main sectors to be included in the MSCI EMI - posted solid gains, rising 2.7 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. The U.S. index publisher will add 222 yuan-denominated A shares to its MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with an initial weight of 0.73 percent. The change will take effect beginning in June 2018.

The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed its US dollar senior unsecured notes issued by Caiyun International Investment Limited (CII) at 'BBB+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Links to China's Yunnan Province: YMCI's ratings are credit-linked but not equalised with Fitch's internal assessment of China's Yunnan Province. This is reflected the entity's 100% state ownership, strong government oversight of its financials, and strategic importance of the entity's operation to the government. These factors result in a high likelihood YMCI would get extraordinary support from the government, if needed. Yunnan's Creditworthiness: Yunnan serves as an important outpost in China's national  One Belt, One Road  initiative and is likely to play a strategic role in helping China maintain a constructive relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations under the initiative. Yunnan has a healthy budget, which is underpinned by strong central government support through China's robust fiscal equalisation system and the province's economy is growing at a much faster pace than the national average. Legal Status Attribute at Mid-Range: YMCI is registered as a state-owned limited liability company under Chinese company law. It is allowed to file for bankruptcy and not all of its employees are civil servants. Strategic Importance Attribute at Mid-Range: YMCI is Yunnan government's largest platform for urban and tourism infrastructure financing and development. It is the backbone of the province's effort to monetise its abundant tourism resources and develop urban infrastructure. In addition, YMCI is the only provincial-level platform for managing the land reserve, reflecting YMCI's industrial know-how. Control and Supervision at Attribute Stronger: YMCI is wholly owned by the Yunnan provincial government. The company's directors and senior management are mainly appointed by the government, and its major decisions need the government's approval. The company's borrowings need approval from the Yunnan State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which also closely monitors YMCI's liabilities. Integration Attribute at Mid-Range: The Yunnan provincial government injected over CNY10 billion into YMCI through subsidies, capital injections and asset transfers between 2008 and 2015. In 2016, the government injected CNY3.5 billion of assets and subsidies into YMCI. Fitch expects government to continue to provide support in various forms. Weak Financial Profile: YMCI has two approaches in its business operation - it seeks to maximise profit in its commercial segment, but offers the best financing and execution for government-mandated projects. The company's standalone credit profile is constrained by its leverage, with debt to EBITDA at around 15x at end-2016. Around 30% of YMCI's total debt will mature in 2017, but the company's refinancing risk is low as it may be able to repay or refinance the debt via cash on hand or its significant unused bank facilities. The weak standalone credit profile is mitigated by its strategic links with the Yunnan provincial government, which may provide monetary and non-monetary support to the company. Senior Notes Guaranteed by YMCI: The rated senior unsecured notes were issued by YMCI's wholly owned subsidiary, Caiyun International Investment Limited (CII). YMCI has provided an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the notes. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of YMCI and rank pari passu with all other obligations of YMCI. RATING SENSITIVITIES A stronger support commitment from the Yunnan provincial government may lead to positive rating action on YMCI. An upgrade of Fitch's internal assessment of the creditworthiness of Yunnan province would result in an upgrade of YMCI. Significant weakening of YMCI's strategic importance to Yunnan, a dilution of the government's shareholding, or reduced explicit and implicit government support may lead to a downgrade. A downgrade could also stem from weaker fiscal performance or increased indebtedness of the government that causes our internal assessment of its creditworthiness to deteriorate.

Ramachandran has told Reuters. Ramachandran said the IOA also wanted India to host the Asian Beach Games in 2020, the Olympic Council of Asia's general assembly that year, and the International Olympic Committee session in 2021. The aim, Ramachandran said, was to use the engagement as a catalyst for the growth of Olympic sports in India and to help improve the country's miserable standing in pretty much every sport apart from cricket.  As the world's second-most populous nation after China, Ramachandran said it was time for India to follow its powerful neighbor in showcasing its burgeoning economic muscle through sport. Dismissing concerns about whether India can afford to stage such huge sporting spectacles, Ramachandran said the country was one of the few in the region that did have the means. It was up to the government to set the wheels in motion, he told Reuters in an interview.  From my part, I am telling them if you bid, I will make sure you get it,  he added. Ramachandran said he had spoken about India's prospects of hosting an Olympics with IOC President Thomas Bach, an indication of the early groundwork required for a serious bid.  You cannot take a decision today and say, 'I want to host an Olympic Games tomorrow.' It is an eight-year process. So you have to start now,  Ramachandran said.   If you are looking at anything it's 2032. That will give you 10 years to improve the infrastructure and you will have a decision (to make) in the next four to six years.  The Indian government had agreed to discuss the proposals in cabinet and revert back to the IOA, Ramachandran added. Economic Power Winning the hosting rights for an Olympic Games is not the hot ticket it once was. Los Angeles and Paris are the only candidates left in the race for the 2024 Olympics after four other cities pulled out over cost concerns. The IOC will award both the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games at the same time and the expectation is that the two cities will host one each.  For the 2022 Winter Games, four of six bidders pulled out citing high costs or lack of support, leaving Beijing to beat Almaty in the final vote.   Ramachandran was confident India, which has Asia's third-largest economy, would be capable of meeting the costs.  India is one of the emerging economies,  he said.  Even assuming you spend $12 billion on an Olympic event, $6 billion will be given to you by the IOC.   What is $6 billion over a period of eight years for a country which has the size of the economy which India has today?  Not many countries today wish to host the Olympics. China has already had everything possible that can be hosted.  In terms of hosting experience, India has successfully staged several global cricket tournaments, and FIFA say they are satisfied with preparations for the Under-17 World Cup in October. But a question mark over the country's ability to host an international multi-sports event has hung over India since the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a $6 billion event billed as Delhi's answer to the Beijing Olympics. Learned from Mistakes A series of embarrassments over leaking stadiums and filthy accommodation culminated in Games chief Suresh Kalmadi spending nine months in prison for inflating tenders worth millions of dollars. Ramachandran said there would be no repeat of those blunders.  We have learnt from our mistakes. You see the South Asian Games (in 2016) that was hosted in Guwahati. Nobody said anything,  he added.   We should stick to what we know best - technical conduct of the Games. Even when we hosted the Commonwealth Games in India, (the IOC) praised the technical conduct of the event. And we also did very well in the medals tally.  While the hosts finished second to Australia at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, to say that India has underperformed at the Olympics is an understatement.  India has won just 28 medals since 1900, with Abhinav Bindra claiming the country's only individual gold medal in the men's 10 meter air rifle in Beijing.  We have very clearly advised the government that if you are just going to send your athletes to participate in international tournaments, that alone will not be sufficient for sports to grow in India,  Ramachandran said.   You also need to conduct multi-sports events in India. Because then you will have more referees, more officials, your administrators can get into international sports federations.   If you are on an international body then you can help your athletes more.  Editing by Nick Mulvenney and Peter Rutherford","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-india-idUSKBN19C0QJ"},

We will investigate if, in the days before the intervention in Banco Popular, there was privileged use of information and manipulations in the stock market,  Albella said in an interview published on Wednesday. Popular was taken over by Spain's largest bank Santander in early June, for the symbolic price of one euro, after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. Popular shares dropped almost 60 percent in its last month of trading in the lead up to Santander's acquisition on June 7. Albella said the investigation would concentrate on moves on the stock market in the run up to the rescue. Deposit flight from Popular in the weeks before its rescue has also led to calls for an investigation, though Albella noted that it wasn't within the CNMV's responsibility to investigate the withdrawals. European Central Bank supervisor Daniele Nouy was questioned in the European Parliament's economic affairs committee on Monday over a withdrawal of deposits from Popular by local and regional authorities. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday that some institutional depositors withdrew their money from the bank after a credit rating downgrade. A spokeswoman for CNMV confirmed Albella's remarks to Expansion. (Reporting by Paul Day; Editing by Susan Fenton)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/spain-popular-idUSL8N1JI0WV"},

Springer led the way, launching a leadoff home run in the first inning off Gray into the left-center field seats at the Oakland Coliseum. The Astros scored five runs in the first inning and went on to an 8-4 victory Tuesday night.  He's tough,  Springer said of Gray.  You got to hit him early. You can't let him settle in. We were able to scratch across some hits in the first inning, which was big.  Springer hit Gray's 3-1 pitch for his 21st homer of the season. He hit his eighth career leadoff home run, tying the franchise record he already shared with Craig Biggio. He also homered for his third consecutive game.  We're wowed by him, because he's setting such a great tone at the top of the order, and doing it with great power now, obviously,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  The first at-bat of the game, you've got to be ready. He's kind of must-see TV at the top of the order.  The Astros won for the eighth straight time at the Coliseum and beat Oakland for the 13th time in the past 14 games. They've won the first two contests of the four-game series and own the best record in the major leagues at 48-24. Astros rookie right-hander Francis Martes (2-0) allowed three runs over 5 2/3 innings. He gave up six hits, struck out four and walked three in his second career major league start and third appearance. When he took the mound, Martes had a five-run lead. Related CoveragePreview: Astros at AthleticsHouston Astros - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch It's the most confident situation for any pitcher if you're pitching ahead with the lead,  Martes said.  You're not going to throw strikes right down the middle, but you can challenge hitters.  Carlos Beltran went 2-for-4 with a solo home run, his 10th blast of the season, for the Astros. Josh Reddick came off the seven-day concussion disabled list and went 2-for-4 with a double, a run and a walk. Alex Bregman went 2-for-3 with two RBIs and a walk. Gray (2-3) gave up five runs on seven hits over five innings. He struck out five, walked four and threw 108 pitches, 60 for strikes. Gray is 0-2 over his past five starts and hasn't won a game since May 24 against Miami.  In the first, I kind of got away from the game plan a little bit and started to leave some balls kind of over the middle more,  Gray said.  After that, I was able to battle through a couple innings and get through five, but I really dug us a big hole there in the first. Against a team like that and an offense like that, giving them a five-spot in the first, it's tough on the rest of the guys.  Khris Davis went 3-for-4 with two doubles, one RBI and one run for the A's. Chad Pinder hit a solo home run in the third. Houston sent 10 batters to the plate in the first inning and forced Gray to throw 38 pitches. Springer led off the game with a no-doubt home run. Then Reddick walked and went to second on Jose Altuve's bunt single. Gray got Carlos Correa to ground into a double play. But Brian McCann doubled Reddick home, Beltran walked, and Yuli Gurriel sent an RBI double to left-center, making it 3-0. Bregman singled sharply to center, driving in Beltran and Gurriel, increasing Houston's lead to 5-0.  We've talked about how starters are a little more vulnerable in the first inning than other innings,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  Just couldn't stop the bleeding there.  Oakland cut Houston's lead to 5-1 in the bottom of the first when Jed Lowrie lined a two-out single and scored on Khris Davis' double off the right-center wall. The A's made it 5-2 in the third on Pinder's 448-foot blast into the left-center field seats, his ninth homer of the season. Oakland scored another run in the fourth inning as Khris Davis lined a leadoff single, went to third on Yonder Alonso's double and scored on Ryon Healy's sacrifice fly. The A's cut Houston's lead to 5-4 in the seventh. Rajai Davis lined a double to right off reliever Michael Feliz and scored on Jaycob Brugman's one-out single. The Astros answered with two runs in the eighth to make it 7-4. After Bregman hit a leadoff double, Liam Hendriks walked Jake Marisnick and then walked Altuve with two outs, loading the bases. Correa lined his next pitch to center for a two-run single. In the ninth, Beltran homered to right against A's rookie Michael Brady, who made his major league debut. NOTES: Astros RHP Lance McCullers Jr. (lower back discomfort) will come off the disabled list Saturday and start against the Seattle Mariners, manager A.J. Hinch said Tuesday. McCullers, who has been on the disabled list since June 12, is 6-1 with a 2.58 ERA in 13 starts this season. ...

Oakland 3B Matt Chapman (left knee infection) missed his second straight game and continued being treated with antibiotics.  It's getting better,  the rookie said.  It's better than yesterday.  A's manager Bob Melvin said Chapman is still day-to-day. ... The A's signed OF Austin Beck, the No. 6 overall pick in baseball's 2017 draft. Beck took pre-game batting practice with the A's.

Berkeley, which reported pretax profit of 812 million pounds ($1 billion) in the 12 months to April 30, warned that Britain's exit from the European Union could lead to a prolonged period of uncertainty in the sector.  Brexit and wider global macro instability impact both confidence and sentiment and will result in constrained investment levels,  the company said.  This leads to greater uncertainty around the timing of delivery of homes from our land bank.  Increases to stamp duty, which is levied in bands according to the market value of a property, began to hit the London market from early 2015, leading to big drops in demand and prices in the city centre, where Berkeley has several developments. A further increase for those buying second homes and buy-to-let properties delivered another blow to demand in a market where many sales are driven by foreign investors. Chief Executive Rob Perrins also warned that Britain must continue after Brexit to secure the supply of European labour, which accounts for half of workers on London's building sites, to address a decades-long housing shortage. Without transitional rules for European labour the company cannot say with certainty that it will be able to build homes in two years' time, Perrins said.  By nature, you will invest less in that environment.

The Saudi stock index was 2.2 percent higher after seven minutes of trade. National Commercial Bank, the biggest listed lender, surged 4.8 percent. Prince Mohammed's promotion gives further assurance that key reforms – including a plan to sell a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, and austerity measures to close a budget deficit caused by shrunken oil revenues - will continue. “We do not expect to see any major changes to key areas of policy, including economic – Prince Mohammed bin Salman has already been driving the economic agenda and the push to transform and liberalise the economy,” said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.  This isn't unexpected though it came earlier than expected,  said a Jeddah-based fund manager.  There won't be a risk of the reforms being scrapped.  Also, index compiler MSCI announced overnight that it would start considering whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging market status; the upgrade would occur in two phases, in May 2019 and August 2019. That news has mostly been priced in, however, fund managers said. Other Gulf stock markets were weak, with Dubai down 0.6 percent and Qatar 0.8 percent lower, because of weak oil prices. Brent oil sank to around $46 a barrel overnight, its lowest level since November, before global oil producers agreed on output cuts in an effort to prop up prices. Oil's slide could mean Gulf governments will not boost spending this year as much as investors have been hoping.

But the Seattle third baseman can claim the game-winner in extra innings. Seager doubled in the deciding run in the bottom of the 10th to give the Mariners a 5-4 victory against the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday night at Safeco Field. Earlier, Corey Seager hit three home runs as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the visiting New York Mets 12-0.  There was a kid near the dugout giving me updates (from Los Angeles) during the game,  Seager said.  That's a tough day to match. I think I'll give him the edge.  Seattle's Nelson Cruz walked against Justin Wilson (3-3) to open the bottom of the 10th. Pinch-runner Tyler Smith stole second base before Seager lined a double down the right-field line to score the winner and give the Mariners (36-37) their third consecutive victory.  Doubles are good,  said Seager, who had three run-scoring doubles in a 7-3 victory Sunday at Texas.  We battled all night. It was a good game from both sides. We're just fortunate that we came out on top.  Detroit (32-38) suffered its fourth straight loss. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at MarinersDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch The positives are Zimm (Jordan Zimmerman) pitched well and the offense did a nice job coming back from a two-run deficit late in the game,  Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.  But, obviously, it wasn't enough.  Seattle's Steve Cishek (1-1) pitched one scoreless inning of relief to get the victory. The Tigers tied the score at 4-4 with two runs in the eighth off Mariners reliever Dan Altavilla. Ian Kinsler led off the inning with a walk and stole second. After Altavilla caught Nicholas Castellanos and Miguel Cabrera looking at called third strikes, Kinsler took off for third on the first pitch to J.D. Martinez. Altavilla's pitch was in the dirt and skipped toward the Detroit dugout down the third-base line, allowing Kinsler to score all the way from second. Kinsler was credited with a steal of third and came home on the wild pitch. That seemed to unnerve Altavilla as Martinez hit the next pitch deep into the seats in right field to even the score. It was Martinez's 12th home run of the season.  There was some energy when (Kinsler) came back to the dugout, and now instead of down two you're down one,  Ausmus said.  And then J.D. immediately follows with a home run, so I felt like the momentum might have shifted to our favor at that point.  The Tigers got a leadoff single from John Hicks in the ninth off Seattle closer Edwin Diaz, but Mikie Mahtook fouled out to first baseman Danny Valencia while trying to bunt pinch-runner Andrew Romine to second. Romine was caught stealing for the second out and Diaz struck out pinch-hitter Alex Avila to end the inning. Seattle's Ariel Miranda overcame a shaky start to pitch seven strong innings. Miranda allowed leadoff home runs in each of the first two innings but settled down. He allowed four hits, walked two and struck out three. The Cuban left-hander retired 13 of the last 14 batters he faced, the only baserunner during that time reaching on an error by third baseman Seager.  Miranda had the home runs the first couple of innings but then he really settled in,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  Getting seven innings out of him tonight was awesome.  Ben Gamel gave the Mariners a 4-2 lead with a solo home run to center field in the seventh off Tigers left-hander Daniel Stumpf, who faced just one batter in relief of Zimmerman. It was Gamel's third homer of the season. Zimmerman went 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs on six hits. He walked three and struck out seven. The way things started, it looked like the game would turn into a slugfest. Kinsler hit Miranda's third pitch of the night into the first row of the second deck down the left-field line. The home run was Kinsler's sixth of the season. The Mariners answered in the bottom of the inning, as Cruz lined a two-run double into the gap in left-center field. The Tigers tied it in the second as Justin Upton led off the inning with a 411-foot homer to center field, his 14th of the season. Seattle regained the lead in the bottom of the inning as Taylor Motter lined a two-out pitch just over the wall in the left-field corner, making it 3-2. It was Motter's seventh home run of the season. NOTES: Detroit 2B Ian Kinsler has four leadoff homers in the first inning this season and 44 in his career, tying Brady Anderson for fifth place in major league history. Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson holds the record with 81. ... Seattle OF Ben Gamel went 3-for-5 with a double and home run, extending his hitting streak to 12 games. ... Tigers DH John Hicks, who started his career with the Mariners, lined a single to left field in the second inning for his first hit at Safeco Field. Hicks was 0-for-15 with eight strikeouts in this ballpark before that at-bat. ... Tigers RHP Justin Verlander (4-4, 4.50 ERA) is scheduled to face Mariners LHP James Paxton (5-2, 3.23) on Wednesday night in the third contest of the four-game series.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-mariners-writethru-idUSMTZED6LVWHZ5J"},

Ramachandran has told Reuters. Ramachandran said the IOA also wanted India to host the Asian Beach Games in 2020, the Olympic Council of Asia's general assembly that year, and the International Olympic Committee session in 2021. The aim, Ramachandran said, was to use the engagement as a catalyst for the growth of Olympic sports in India and to help improve the country's miserable standing in pretty much every sport apart from cricket.  As the world's second-most populous nation after China, Ramachandran said it was time for India to follow its powerful neighbor in showcasing its burgeoning economic muscle through sport. Dismissing concerns about whether India can afford to stage such huge sporting spectacles, Ramachandran said the country was one of the few in the region that did have the means. It was up to the government to set the wheels in motion, he told Reuters in an interview.  From my part, I am telling them if you bid, I will make sure you get it,  he added. Ramachandran said he had spoken about India's prospects of hosting an Olympics with IOC President Thomas Bach, an indication of the early groundwork required for a serious bid.  You cannot take a decision today and say, 'I want to host an Olympic Games tomorrow.' It is an eight-year process. So you have to start now,  Ramachandran said.   If you are looking at anything it's 2032. That will give you 10 years to improve the infrastructure and you will have a decision (to make) in the next four to six years.  The Indian government had agreed to discuss the proposals in cabinet and revert back to the IOA, Ramachandran added. Economic Power Winning the hosting rights for an Olympic Games is not the hot ticket it once was. Los Angeles and Paris are the only candidates left in the race for the 2024 Olympics after four other cities pulled out over cost concerns. The IOC will award both the 2024 and 2028 Summer Games at the same time and the expectation is that the two cities will host one each.  For the 2022 Winter Games, four of six bidders pulled out citing high costs or lack of support, leaving Beijing to beat Almaty in the final vote.   Ramachandran was confident India, which has Asia's third-largest economy, would be capable of meeting the costs.  India is one of the emerging economies,  he said.  Even assuming you spend $12 billion on an Olympic event, $6 billion will be given to you by the IOC.   What is $6 billion over a period of eight years for a country which has the size of the economy which India has today?  Not many countries today wish to host the Olympics. China has already had everything possible that can be hosted.  In terms of hosting experience, India has successfully staged several global cricket tournaments, and FIFA say they are satisfied with preparations for the Under-17 World Cup in October. But a question mark over the country's ability to host an international multi-sports event has hung over India since the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a $6 billion event billed as Delhi's answer to the Beijing Olympics. Learned from Mistakes A series of embarrassments over leaking stadiums and filthy accommodation culminated in Games chief Suresh Kalmadi spending nine months in prison for inflating tenders worth millions of dollars. Ramachandran said there would be no repeat of those blunders.  We have learnt from our mistakes. You see the South Asian Games (in 2016) that was hosted in Guwahati. Nobody said anything,  he added.   We should stick to what we know best - technical conduct of the Games. Even when we hosted the Commonwealth Games in India, (the IOC) praised the technical conduct of the event. And we also did very well in the medals tally.  While the hosts finished second to Australia at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, to say that India has underperformed at the Olympics is an understatement.  India has won just 28 medals since 1900, with Abhinav Bindra claiming the country's only individual gold medal in the men's 10 meter air rifle in Beijing.  We have very clearly advised the government that if you are just going to send your athletes to participate in international tournaments, that alone will not be sufficient for sports to grow in India,  Ramachandran said.

Arenado, who hit a three-run, walk-off homer Sunday to complete a cycle and give the Rockies a 7-5 victory, tripled home two runs in the eighth Tuesday off Arizona ace Zack Greinke after the Diamondbacks stunned the Rockies with home runs on back-to-back pitches in the top of the inning.  Our third baseman is doing Kobe Bryant things,  said Rockies right fielder Carlos Gonzalez, who homered in the fourth and saved a run with a diving catch to end the fifth.  He's just on a different level right now. It's fun to watch. He's carrrying this team on his shoulders.  The Diamondbacks tied the game 2-2 when David Peralta hit his seventh homer, a leadoff blast on reliever Chris Rusin's 2-1 changeup that traveled an estimated 455 feet and well into the second deck in right field. Adam Ottavino (1-1) relieved Rusin and Paul Goldschmidt drove his first-pitch fastball into the right-field stands for his 17th home run. The homers gave Diamondbacks starter Zack Greinke (8-4) his first lead of the game, but he couldn't hold it. Greinke gave up consecutive one-out singles in the eighth to Charlie Blackmon and DJ LeMahieu and Arenado followed with a triple off the wall in right on Greinke's 1-0 slider. Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at RockiesColorado Rockies - PlayerWatch It was middle away,  Arenado said.  I didn't want to roll over a slider. I wanted to stay through it and lucky enough I was able to barrel it.  Arenado's liner off the wall hit right fielder Peralta and rolled away, enabling Arenado to hit his fourth triple of the season, two shy of his career-high set last year. Arenado has tripled in back-to-back games for the second time in his career. He also did it June 8-9, 2013, against San Diego.  If I'm hitting triples, that just means the ball's getting away from the outfielder. I'm a doubles guy,  said Arenado, who leads the majors with 26 doubles.  I was pitching good until that inning,  said Greinke, who worked 7 1/3 innings, leaving after Arenado's triple.  And even then, I made the right pitches. They took better swings at it. I felt really good, and I thought I made pretty good pitches. Blackmon just kind of slapped a ball in a good spot. And LeMahieu and Arenado did a good job with what I gave them.  The loss dropped the Diamondbacks two games behind the Rockies, who maintained their half-game lead in the National League West over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Greg Holland worked the ninth and earned his 25th save in 26 chances. After issuing a one-out walk, he struck out Jeremy Hazelbaker. While facing Gregor Blanco, Holland put the tying run in scoring position with a wild pitch, but Holland came off the mound to field Blanco's nubber and threw him out to end the game. The win was the sixth straight for the Rockies -- one shy of their season high -- and their 13th in the past 16 games. The Diamondbacks' season-high seven-game winning streak ended as they lost for only second time in 12 games. Arizona's five-game winning streak on the road also ended. The Rockies improved to 11-2 in one-run games while the Diamondbacks fell to 15-7 in such contests. Chris Owings' sacrifice fly cut Colorado's lead to 2-1 in the sixth, but that could have been a bigger inning for Arizona. Rockies starter German Marquez hit Goldschmidt with a pitch to open the inning, and Jake Lamb sent him to third with a single. Catcher Tony Wolters nailed Lamb trying to steal just ahead of Owings' sacrifice fly to deep right-center. That was the only run allowed by Marquez, who gave up four hits in six innings with two walks and three strikeouts. It was the first time in five starts that Marquez has pitched six innings. Gonzalez, steadily pulling out of the 0-for-27 slump he ended Friday, drove a homer an estimated 449 feet, over the fence in center with one out in the fifth, putting the Rockies ahead 2-0. It was his sixth homer of the season and his first homer, RBI or extra-base hit since June 6. The homer came on a 2-1 slider from Greinke, whom Gonzalez has hit well. He entered the game 13-for-36 with four homers and six RBIs against Greinke. The Diamondbacks gift-wrapped a run for Colorado in the second. With one out, Ian Desmond was safe on a slow roller that third baseman Lamb barehanded but threw the ball past first base. Catcher Jeff Mathis retrieved Greinke's wild pitch, tried to get Desmond at third but made an errant throw that allowed Desmond to score the first run.

The drop in Chinese steel futures on Tuesday after a four-day rise weighed on iron ore which dragged metals and mining stocks to their lowest in more than a month and a half.

Financial stocks posted a second session of losses with the country's  Big Four  lenders losing between 1.7 and 2.7 percent. Energy stocks tumbled 2.6 percent following a decline in oil prices. Additionally, the stocks were also hurt by the Australian government's decision to delay proposed curb on exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from eastern Australia. Woodside Petroleum Ltd dropped 2.1 percent while Santos the operator of the Gladstone LNG plant in Queensland, the only LNG producer that has been taking gas out of the domestic market to meet its export contracts, hit a more than year low.  The energy stocks are not being helped by the decision of the Australian government to put a limit on gas exports next year, which increases political risk in the sector,  said Ric Spooner, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.

A normal day.  Then, over the music, something more sinister:  All of a sudden I heard a bang, looked over and saw this thing burning.  And at first I thought, maybe it's just a regular explosion, an electronic device or whatever,  he said.  But when I heard the second explosion I started to get in instinct mode.  The 23-year-old lawyer had the presence of mind to snap a photograph of the flames from the first blast and later posted it on Twitter. That image traveled around the world showing what Belgian police are calling yet another  terrorist  attack in Europe. The suspected bomber was shot dead by soldiers but no one else was hurt.  I think we had some luck tonight,  Bonnaffe told Reuters by telephone after he finally made it home.  I'm happy that no one was injured and that this was basically a failed attempt.

Startled by the first blast, which he photographed, he then heard but could not see a second, similar explosion. Then came what were probably shots fired at the suspect by one of the army patrols that have been an accepted fixture of Brussels' public spaces since Islamist gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in and around Paris in November 2015.  I heard rapid bangs that to me were very clearly gunshots but I didn't see anything,  Bonnaffe said.  This reaffirms my sense of urgency and I left as quickly as I could. Upstairs.  With all the events, I just wanted to get away as quickly as possible from the mass and get to a place inside.

The South African-based lender also said it would challenge in court a finding by the agency, published in a report this week, that Barclays had unduly benefited from an apartheid-era bailout. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, head of South Africa's constitutionally-sanctioned anti-graft watchdog, called on Monday for the central bank's mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to be changed to focus on economic growth.   Her recommended amendments pose a very serious risk to the financial system and they cannot be allowed to stand,  Barclays Africa said in a statement. The ruling African National Congress's secretary general Gwede Mantashe and the central bank itself have also criticized Mkhwebane's proposal, which has further stained South Africa's image as an investor-friendly emerging market, coming less than a week after Mines Minister Mosebenzi Zwane spooked mining investors with a revised plan to revamp the sector's black ownership rules. Mkhwebane made her recommendation in a report by the agency, published on Monday, which also said the apartheid government breached the constitution by supplying Bankorp, which was acquired by Absa, now Barclays Africa, in 1992, with a series of bailouts from 1985 to 1995. She said Barclays Africa must pay 1.1 billion rand ($84 million).  Barclays Africa denied any wrongdoing.   This is due to numerous misrepresentations and factual inaccuracies which form the basis of the Public Protector's findings, and what we submit are the irrational and unreasonable legal conclusions in the report,  the bank said in its statement on Wednesday.

It was a crushing blow for the Southern California native, who was facing the Dodgers for the first time.  I've just been getting my butt kicked out there,  Gsellman said.  I haven't executed pitches and batters are too comfortable out there.  The Mets (31-39) have dropped five of their past six contests.  You got to be able to realize that you still have to pull together and you still have to make sure everybody is one the same page and these kind of things happen,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  We'll rally and get some rest, come back tomorrow, get together and get ready to play.  Logan Forsythe reached on a leadoff single in the first inning before Seager smoked a 2-1 Gsellman pitch over the wall in center for a 2-0 Los Angeles lead with no outs. Bellinger clubbed his team-leading 22nd home run, a two-run shot to left, for a 4-0 advantage. It was the third homer in the past two games and the 10th in the last 10 contests for Bellinger, who is only the second Dodger to accomplish the latter feat. Shawn Green was the other Dodger to do it in May 2002. Troy Tulowitzki was the last player to have a similar stretch of homers, going deep 11 times in 10 games in September 2010 when he was a member of the Colorado Rockies. Seager hit his second home run in the fourth on a full count for a 5-0 Dodgers edge. Grandal added a solo shot in the fifth for a 6-0 lead. Joc Pederson's ground-rule double scored Yasiel Puig in the inning to make it 7-0. Three batters later, Seager struck again with a three-run blast to give the Dodgers a 10-0 lead. It was the fifth multi-homer game for Seager. All of them have occurred at Dodger Stadium. Seager batted for the final time in the sixth with the bases loaded but lined out to left-center. He was on deck in the eighth when Forsythe struck out looking to end the inning.  I was hoping he got up again,  Bellinger said.  That was awesome to watch. He just missed that last one. That was crazy.  The Dodgers have won the last six contests at home, improving to 27-10 overall at Dodger Stadium. NOTES: The Dodgers signed 21 of their 40 picks in the 2017 draft, according to MLB.com. However, none of the 21 included their top three picks: Vanderbilt OF Jeren Kendall, RHP Morgan Cooper of the University of Texas and C Connor Wong from the University of Houston. ... Mets RHP Tyler Pill (0-2, 3.75 ERA) will oppose Dodgers LHP Rich Hill (3-3, 5.14) in the third contest of the four-game series Wednesday.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mets-dodgers-writethru-idUSMTZED6LVUBJ46"},

They have decided that – at least in the short term - they may well be on a loser if they try to fight the People’s Bank of China, the nation’s central bank, which has been taking a series of measures that appear aimed at keeping the currency stable. This is particularly the case ahead of an autumn congress of the ruling Communist Party of China, that is expected to allow Chinese leader Xi Jinping to consolidate his power. Also, the Chinese economy has been more robust than expected, the nation’s authorities have taken stiff measures to reduce capital outflows, and the U.S. dollar has been retreating from gains it made last year. Major global fund managers – such as Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Old Mutual Global Investors, Standard Life Investments and Aviva Investors -- have taken off short yuan positions even as many of them see some weakness further down the road. The PBOC has made some moves to defend the yuan, which is also known as the renminbi. It has pushed up the cost of short-selling the currency and even changing the way it sets a daily mid-point used as a benchmark.  They are not happy with a really weaker renminbi,  said Mark Nash, the London-based head of global bonds at Old Mutual Global Investors.  People obviously don’t want to fight the central bank.”      Nash, whose firm manages $44.7 billion globally, said he had been short the yuan at the turn of 2017 but took that position off early in the year. But he said he believes the strength in the yuan is reflective more of  an exercise in financial regulation  rather than an improvement in China's economic outlook and hopes to go short again soon. Standard Life Investments' Hong Kong-based emerging markets fixed income fund manager, Mark Baker, said he gave up his short yuan position in the first quarter of 2017, after seeing the success China was having with capital controls and some improvement in economic data.    There is a desire to rein in expectations that the currency is merely a one-way bet,” he said. The PBOC did not respond to a Reuters request for comments for this article. The yuan has risen 2 percent against the dollar so far this year. In the latest policy tweak, the PBOC has included a  counter-cyclical factor  in its method for fixing the daily mid-point around which the currency is allowed to trade.        The adjustment to the fixing method in May was the second this year and came after a string of capital control moves, all aimed at stopping domestic Chinese investors from moving cash abroad. That has put a floor under a currency which fell 6.5 percent in 2016 and 4.5 percent in 2015. Concern about the decline led the central bank to spend a trillion dollars over 2-1/2-years to defend the yuan.     Short yuan positions are expensive. It costs about 5 percent annually to own and short the yuan directly based on short-term borrowing costs, though there are a myriad ways in which an investor or trader can structure a short bet. Some investors interviewed for this article said they mainly use offshore forward currency contracts - settled for cash at a particular date - which makes the trade somewhat cheaper.          Intentions Unclear       Beijing is also keen on keeping the yuan strong so that U.S. President Donald Trump isn’t given any reason to take tough trade measures against China. During the election campaign, Trump had accused Beijing of manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive, hurting U.S. companies.     The stronger yuan also helps to dissuade Chinese companies and citizens from moving money offshore.     Jonathan Xiong, head of the fixed income alternatives group at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said he closed out his short yuan positions at the beginning of the year as China’s growth prospects improved.      Stuart Ritson, head of Asian rates and FX at Aviva Investors, with about $453 billion under management, removed his short position around the end of the first quarter, and is now positive on the yuan owing to the PBOC's preference for a stronger currency, reduced capital outflows and because the yuan offers one of the best yields relative to volatility among emerging market currencies. Ritson hasn’t taken a bullish bet as yet.     Not everyone has left the trade. Kyle Bass, the founder of Dallas-based hedge fund Hayman Capital Management, has kept his short position because he says he believes the nation’s credit bubble problems are “metastasizing.”  Bass, has long argued that the Chinese yuan is set to fall 30 percent against the U.S. dollar. “The numbers are telling me that we are right. The numbers are getting so bad so quickly,” he said.     But even those who see the currency weakening have pulled back their forecasts. Deutsche Bank's chief China economist, Zhiwei Zhang, sees the yuan ending the year at 7.1 per dollar, rather than the 7.4 he was forecasting at the beginning of the year.  There should be some weakness, he says, because economic growth is likely to slow, capital controls could become less effective over time and the dollar may not continue depreciating.      At the other end of the spectrum are fund managers such as Jan Dehn, London-based head of research at asset manager Ashmore Group, who says he believes the market shouldn't be blind-sided by conspiracy theories.   The recent stabilisation of the yuan has perfectly sound foundations and can be explained without having to resort to some suspect or obscure schemes on the part of Chinese policy makers,  said Dehn.

The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index .TRIABS RACSI, representing the six-month outlook of 101 firms, climbed to 74 in April-June from 70 three months earlier. A reading over 50 indicates a positive view.  The world economy is starting to look more solid,  said Singapore-based economics professor Antonio Fatas at global business school INSEAD. For PDF of survey click: tmsnrt.rs/2skXVUI For graphic on business sentiment index click: tmsnrt.rs/2tjdpqW For graphic on biggest perceived risks click: tmsnrt.rs/2hkNhpx  The U.S. is reaching good levels of GDP and employment, with Europe finally recovering and Asia seeing less risks ahead. China looks like it's in a more stable situation after having ups and downs because of capital outflows over the last couple of years and also the risks of a debt crisis.  China is widely expected to meet its 6.5 percent economic growth target this year without too many bumps, helped by a pick-up in exports and stable growth in factory output and retail sales. The government has also sought to reduce debt. Reflecting the upbeat picture, the country upon which much of Asia depends for trade scored a business sentiment subindex of 75, up from 72 three months prior. In nearby Japan, sentiment hit its highest-ever with a subindex of 83 compared with 61 in the previous quarter and an average of 58 in the survey's eight-year life. The country's central bank in April offered its most optimistic assessment of the economy in nine years, saying it was turning toward expansion. Buoyant consumer confidence and export growth that exceeded initial estimates helped Indonesia's sentiment subindex rise 8 points to 83, its highest in over a year. Sentiment rebounded the most in South Korea with a 50-point jump in its subindex to 75. The result came after the country's new president vowed to review a decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system which had angered China and prompted a boycott of Korean goods.  The cloud of political risk has disappeared,  Fatas said.  Last quarter the data for South Korea was looking weaker. There was potential for crisis with some trading partners, in particular China.  Sentiment also edged up in India and Thailand, but weakened in Australia, Taiwan and the Philippines. Singapore posted the lowest subindex of 62 - but even that was the strongest lowest subindex the survey has seen since it began in 2009. FILE PHOTO: An exotic used car dealership designed to resemble a vending machine in Singapore May 15, 2017.Thomas White/File PhotoConstruction Bullish Thomson Reuters and INSEAD polled companies from June 2 to 16. Of the 101 respondents, 56 percent rated their six-month outlook as positive, the highest proportion in over six years. 37 percent were neutral and 7 percent were negative. Respondents included Australia's APA Group (APA.AX), Japan's Hitachi Ltd (6501.T), South Korea's Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS), India's Vedanta Ltd (VDAN.NS) and China Eastern Airlines Co Ltd (600115.SS). The most bullish respondents were from the construction and engineering as well as transport and logistics industries, with half of such firms saying business volume had grown over the past three months.  Slideshow (3 Images)The two sectors are set to benefit from China's pledge in May to lend about $56 billion for infrastructure projects across Asia, Europe and Africa as part of its Belt and Road initiative. The metals and chemicals industry registered the biggest jump in sentiment, by 41 points to 81, while confidence was also buoyant among firms in the healthcare, financial and retail sectors.  E-commerce in Southeast Asia has significant potential for growth for years to come,  said Magnus Ekbom, group chief strategy officer at survey respondent Lazada Group SA, an online retailer backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).  We are on track to achieving our goal of making 100 million products available across all of our 6 markets.  The real estate sector and the household, food and beverage sector tied for the lowest subindex, while sentiment in the technology and telecommunications industry fell 7 points to 67. Survey respondent Intouch Holdings PCL (INTUCH.BK), a Thai telecoms firm, said it was anticipating positive impact in the second-half of the year from the mobile and fixed broadband business.  Overall, mobile competition still remains due to continued handset campaign offerings,  the firm said in an email to Reuters.  However, we see an opportunity from an uplift in data consumption from customer's behavioral changes.   Firms ranked disruptive technologies as the chief risk to their six-month outlooks. Disruptive technologies include the sharing platforms of Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Airbnb Inc which are increasingly taking market share from traditional industry leaders. Other risks cited include an inconsistent U.S. administration and protectionism. The U.S. president has pledged to pursue policies widely described as protectionist, including withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact.

The issuance consists of notes backed by Australian residential mortgages originated by Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA, AA-/Stable/F1+). The ratings are as follows: AUD749.8 million Class A notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD48.9 million Class B notes: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable AUD16.3 million Class C notes: 'NRsf' The notes were issued by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited in its capacity as trustee of Medallion Trust Series 2017-1P. The total collateral pool consisted of 2,894 obligors, totalling AUD815 million, at the 16 March 2017 cut-off date. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sufficient Credit Support: The class A notes have sufficient credit enhancement of 8.0% provided by lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI). The class B notes have sufficient credit enhancement of 2.0% provided by the class C notes and LMI. Pool Characteristics: The portfolio's weighted-average (WA) seasoning is 28 months, with a WA unindexed loan/value ratio (LVR) of 59.8% and WA indexed LVR of 58.1%. The average obligor current loan size is AUD281,615; investment loans represent 25.6% of the pool by balance and interest-only loans represent 19.8%. LMI is present on 11.7% of the pool. Sequential/Pro Rata Paydown: Interest is paid sequentially after expenses towards the class A notes, class B notes and then the class C notes. Reimbursement of losses is paid after the distribution of interest to the class B notes. Interest on the class B notes is subordinated if the stated amount of the note is, or ever has been, reduced to zero. Principal is allocated pro rata towards the class A and B notes, with the class B notes receiving the class C pro rata share if certain conditions are met. Sufficient Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided via excess spread, principal draws and a liquidity facility initially sized at 0.75% of the aggregate note balance at closing, with a facility floor of 0.075%. The liquidity facility will amortise annually in line with the reduction of the outstanding pool balance, subject to the floor. Strong Record: CBA has experience in mortgage lending and servicing. It originates loans through its nationwide branch network, mobile sales force, online and telephone sales operations and third-party mortgage brokers. Arrears of securitised Medallion transactions have generally tracked in-line or below Fitch's Dinkum Index for prime RMBS. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and are likely to result in a decline in credit enhancement and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased credit enhancement may make certain note ratings susceptible to negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis of the ratings by stressing the transaction's initial base-case assumptions. Analysis of the foreclosure scenarios found that the ratings on the class A and B notes were not affected under Fitch's moderate or severe foreclosure stress (15% and 30% increase) scenarios. The analysis of the recovery scenarios found that the ratings on the class A and B notes were not affected under Fitch's moderate or severe recovery stress (15% and 30% decrease) scenarios. The analysis of Fitch's moderate combination stress of 15% increase in foreclosures and 15% decrease in recoveries found that the ratings on the class A and B notes were not affected. Under Fitch's severe combination stress of 30% increase in foreclosures and 30% decrease in recoveries, the ratings on the class A notes decreased to 'AA+sf' while the ratings on the class B notes decreased to 'BBB+sf''. LMI is not required to support the ratings on the class A and B notes due to the level of credit support provided by the lower-ranking notes. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es;) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under  Related Research  below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es; to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled  Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,  dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, which indicated no adverse findings material to the rating analysis. As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of CBA's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

The president held talks with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Washington on Tuesday. The Ukraine leader emerged from the meeting saying Kiev had “received strong support from the U.S. side” over sovereignty, territorial integrity and the “independence of our state.” For Ukraine, the meeting was a win because Poroshenko got to visit the White House ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Trump, it seems to have been a missed opportunity to win political capital at home.  Trump should have spoken out against what many see as Ukraine’s troubling glorification of Nazi collaborators. Poroshenko presumably focused on Russia's occupation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine’s Donbass region. Trump should have broadened the agenda to call out Kiev for its official state policy of honoring controversial figures from World War Two.  The latest example: local authorities in the capital recentlyvoted to rename a major street after a former Nazi collaborator and anti-Semite named Roman Shukhevych.  Shukhevych led the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), an organization responsible for the mass slaughter of Poles and Jews during the war. Even inside Ukraine the renaming is a disputed move, with hundreds of people taking to the streets last Friday to protest the decision – only to be attacked by an ultra-nationalist neo-Nazi group called C14.  MORE COMMENTARY FROM REUTERS Anthony Lester: Ireland - Theresa May's latest Brexit blunder John Lloyd: The problem with Oliver Stone and other Putin friends The renaming plan isn’t an isolated event. In 2015, Ukraine passed a law honoring the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and its military wing, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, (OUN-UPA). Since then, other streets have been named after the group and its leaders, and the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory (UINM) is drafting a law to posthumously exonerate OUN-UPA members convicted of murdering Polish and Jewish civilians during and after the war.    OUN militias played a major role in pogroms in Western Ukraine that killed tens of thousands of Jews after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Many OUN members also joined the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, where they collaborated with the Nazis to kill Jews in Western Ukraine in 1941-1942. After the OUN violently seized control of the UPA in 1943, the UPA also slaughtered between 70,000 and 100,000 Poles in western Ukraine from 1943-1944 and hunted down Jewish survivors of the Holocaust.     U.S. organizations like the United States Holocaust Museum and the Simon Wiesenthal Center have joined Ukrainian Jewish groups in criticizing Ukraine’s decision to lionize the OUN-UPA. Wiesenthal Center head Efraim Zuroff said that honoring the collaborators “turns Hitler’s henchmen into heroes”; Ukraine’s Chief Rabbi called Kiev’s decision to name a street after Shukhevych “immoral propaganda.”    It’s true many Ukrainians see the OUN-UPA primarily through the lens of the group’s role in the fight for an independent Ukraine, and, indeed, the UPA fought a valiant guerilla war against the Soviet Union into the 1950s. But while UINM’s leader derides criticism of OUN-UPA and its leaders as propaganda, historical documentation contradicts this.    The elevation of OUN-UPA has been accompanied by a growing number of anti-Semitic incidents in Ukraine. Numerous Holocaust memorial sites - including Babi Yar, where over 33,000 Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis - have been vandalized or desecrated by anti-Semitic graffiti and swastikas.  Ukrainian officials are also guilty of a number of recent anti-Semitic outbursts. A retired general affiliated with Ukraine's security services called for the destruction of the country's Jews; a member of Parliament suggested Ukrainians use the ethnic slur  zhid ; a Ukrainian official called Ukraine’s SS Galizien division - created with the support of Heinrich Himmler - “heroes” and the Poroshenko administration awarded Ukraine's Order of Freedom to an author of two books considered blatantly anti-Semitic.  Trump has good reason to speak out against Ukraine's troubling  memory politics.” The most important is that he could counter perceptions that he's been too tolerant of anti-Semitism.  Although Trump supports the Israeli government and two of his most influential advisers - daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner - are Jewish, many Americans believe Trump failed to disavow the neo-Nazi fringe that supported his presidential campaign. More troublingly, Trump retweeted apparent white supremacists a number of times during the 2016 race and even tweeted what many considered an anti-Semitic meme about Hillary Clinton.   After his election, Trump was seen as slow to condemn the desecration of Jewish cemeteries and threats against Jewish community centers across the U.S. Even more worrisome, the White House's official statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day did not mention the Holocaust's 6 million Jewish victims.  Jewish groups are also concerned about reports that the Trump administration will not fill the State Department's office of the U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism. While few suggest that Trump personally holds anti-Semitic views, Trump’s condemnation of Kiev's actions could help dispel perceptions that he doesn’t pay enough attention to anti-Jewish behavior.     Beyond Trump’s own reasons for speaking out, Ukraine's glorification of OUN-UPA arguably undermines Washington's foreign policy goal of supporting a democratic Ukraine anchored in the West. Ukraine's veneration of the OUN-UPA also harms America abroad, with Russia's state-owned RT routinely carrying reports claiming that the U.S. backs  fascists  in Ukraine. American policy makers don’t need a major Kiev street renamed for a Nazi collaborator.  The historical revisionism could also damage Ukraine’s chances of joining NATO and the European Union. In Poland, where there’s strong support for an independent Ukraine, the decision to honor OUP leaders has angered the families of victims of OUP killings, and the country’s legislature last year passed a resolution officially terming the UPA’s Wolyn massacre of Polish civilians a genocide. A former Polish deputy foreign minister warned that a Ukraine “under the flag” of the OUP “will never join the European Union.” And, as one German commentator points out, honoring Nazi collaborators such as Shukhevych  is out of the question  in modern Germany.  It’s possible, of course, that Trump did raise the issue privately with Poroshenko in Tuesday’s meeting. But if he did, he needs to make it public. For Ukraine’s sake as well as his own.   About the AuthorJosh Cohen is a former USAID project officer involved in managing economic reform projects in the former Soviet UnionThe views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cohen-antisemitism-idUSKBN19B2SS"},

The minutes are likely to delve into details of interest rates, with a high likelihood that more members softened their inflation outlook, said DBS Group Research in a note. The broader NSE index was down 0.37 percent at 9,618.25 as of 0600 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.25 percent lower at 31,219.12.  Markets are just consolidating after seeing a steep run-up, as every now and then markets have hit fresh highs,  said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice-president of research at SMC Global Securities. Oil explorers fell after global oil prices hit seven-month lows, with Oil and Natural Gas Corp falling as much as 2.54 percent and Oil India down as much as 1.91 percent. Airlines stocks however rose on expectations of lower jet fuel prices, with Spicejet Ltd and Jet Airways up about 2.5 percent, and InterGlobe Aviation , parent of IndiGo Air, climbing 1.6 percent. Price of aviation fuel is the biggest cost factor for low-budget carriers. Financial stocks also dragged the NSE index lower for the second straight session, with the Nifty Financial Services Index down as much as 0.5 percent. Larsen & Toubro Ltd rose as much as 1.8 percent after the government's Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) sold a 2.5 percent stake in the company for more than 40 billion rupees ($619 million). Plummeting oil prices put Asian investors on edge, overshadowing a decision by U.S. index provider MSCI to add mainland Chinese stocks to its global emerging markets benchmark index. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.8 percent.

A PAC-3 Patriot battery drove on to the Asaka Self Defense Forces base near Tokyo, deployed its radar antenna and raised its missile launcher to firing position. The drill is one of four being held across Japan.  Making this public is a way to reassure people about their safety and bring peace of mind,  Akinori Hanada, an Air Self Defense Force major, told reporters. North Korea has pushed ahead with its missile and nuclear weapons programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and regularly threatens to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this month North Korea's advancing weapons programs were the  most urgent  threat to national security and that its means to deliver them had increased in speed and scope. South Korea has deployed the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system to protect against the North Korean threat, angering China, North Korea's lone major ally. Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) soldiers hold a drill to mobilise their Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile unit in response to recent missiles launch by North Korea, at JSDF Asaka base in Asaka, north of Tokyo, Japan, June 21, 2017.Issei KatoJapan's PAC-3 batteries are the last line of defense against any incoming warheads. With a range of around 15 km (9 miles), they are only able to protect larger cities and key government installations.  Advances in North Korea's ballistic missile program have raised concern in Tokyo that its PAC-3 batteries and Aegis destroyers in the Sea of Japan could be overwhelmed.  Slideshow (6 Images)Japan has begun a $1 billion program to upgrade the PAC-3s to extend their range and accuracy, but the first of those will not be ready until 2020. In addition to public PAC-3 exercises, some Japanese prefectures have also conducted missile attack evacuation drills in recent weeks.  Japan will follow these up with a series of 30-second public information broadcasts and newspaper ads beginning Friday advising people what to do in the event of a North Korean missile attack, the Yomiuri newspaper said. A Japanese government spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about the report. Editing by Nick Macfie","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-japan-idUSKBN19C0JM"},

The Nikkei fell 0.5 percent to 20,138.79 points, moving away from near two-year highs marked the previous day. Wall Street stocks dropped overnight after energy shares lost ground, which also hurt sentiment in Asian trade. The mining sector underperformed and fell 1.3 percent after oil prices fell about 2 percent on news of increases in supply by several key producers.  A stronger yen combined with a fall in oil prices had made investors stay on the sidelines,  said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 111.220 yen, off a near one-month peak of 111.790 touched on Tuesday. Inpex Corp stumbled 1.2 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co dropped 1.9 percent. Conversely, cheaper oil prices helped airline shares as fuel charges are a major cost component for operators. Japan Airlines rose 0.3 percent while ANA Holdings Inc gained 0.5 percent. Banking stocks took a breather after being bought recently. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropped 1.3 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group fell 0.7 percent. After opening higher, Toshiba Corp ended 2.2 percent lower in volatile trade. Sources said the firm will pick a Japanese government-led group of Japanese, U.S. and South Korean firms and funds to buy its chip business. Takata Corp remained untraded with a glut of sell orders and ended at its daily limit low of 244 yen at the market close. Sources said last Friday that the maker of defective air bag inflators is preparing to file for bankruptcy as early as this week. The stock has nosedived 50 percent in the past four days.

The slide in energy costs boosted bond prices and flattened yield curves as investors priced in lower inflation for longer, while safe-haven flows underpinned the U.S. dollar. The spread between yields on U.S. five-year notes and 30-year bonds shrank to the smallest since 2007 as investors wagered the Federal Reserve might have to delay further rate hikes. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.8 percent, with Australia's commodity-heavy market down 1.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei eased 0.45 percent. In Europe, futures for the Eurostoxx 50, DAX and FTSE were all off 0.3 percent. Oil had shed 2 percent on Tuesday as increased supply from several key producers overshadowed high compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC producers on a deal to cut global output. The drop took U.S. crude down 20 percent from its recent high and thus into official bear territory, a red flag to investors who follow technical trends. On Wednesday, Brent eased 10 cents to $45.92 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures lost 6 cents to $43.45. Adding to the uncertainty was news Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had replaced his cousin in a sudden shift that made King Salman's 31-year-old son next ruler of the kingdom. The hit to energy stocks saw the Dow end Tuesday down 0.29 percent, while the S&P; 500 eased 0.67 percent and the Nasdaq 0.82 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P; 500 were 0.1 percent lower on Wednesday. Joining the Club The acceptance of some Chinese  A  shares into MSCI's Emerging Markets Index  was seen as a symbolic win for Beijing after three failed attempts. Yet the step is still a small one. Only 222 stocks are being included and, with a weighing of just 5 percent, they will account for only 0.73 percent of the Emerging Markets Index. MSCI estimated the change, due around the middle of next year, would drive inflows of between $17 billion and $18 billion. China's market cap is roughly $7 trillion. The index provider set out a laundry list of liberalisation requirements before it would consider further expansion.  We suspect that it will be a long time before this happens,  wrote analysts at Capital Economics in a note.  While China's weighting in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index may ultimately rise to 40 percent or so, this rise is likely to be slow,  they added.  The upshot is that any initial boost to equities is likely to be small.  The initial reaction was indeed restrained, with China's CSI300 index up 0.5 percent. MSCI also said it would consult on adding Saudi Arabia to the emerging markets benchmark and that Nigeria will remain a frontier market, but it shocked many emerging market investors by declining to upgrade Argentina from the frontier market category. In currency markets, the flight from oil benefited the U.S. dollar - the two often move inversely. Against a basket of currencies, it was holding at 97.736 having touched a five-week peak overnight. The euro stood at $1.1131 after hitting a three-week low, while the dollar eased a touch on the yen to 111.27. Sterling was still nursing losses at $1.2626. It took a spill after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney hosed down speculation that he might soon back higher interest rates, saying he first wanted to see how the economy coped with Brexit talks.

Late on Tuesday, the Anglo-Australian miner's board opted for an upgraded $2.45 billion bid from Yancoal, instead of taking $100 million more from Glencore. Concerns about Chinese regulators must have played a role. The Swiss trader might need to come up with lots more money to stay in the game. On June 9, Glencore submitted a late-breaking $2.55 billion bid for Rio's Coal & Allied division. That came five months after Rio accepted a not-quite-financed pitch from Yancoal, the Australian arm of a heavily indebted state-owned firm from Shandong province. At first, this looked like a shrewd attack on a weak competitor - but Glencore seems to have misread the depth of Yancoal's support. Two days later, Yancoal's bid suddenly got the regulatory green light back home. The intervention then prompted Yancoal's parent to come back with payment guarantees, and promise cash upfront, and that appears to have assuaged Rio's worries.  Glencore's bid is still higher. The deciding factor, alluded to in Rio's statement, appears to be concern about whether Glencore would get official approval in a  timely manner . That presumably refers primarily to Chinese regulators. Economically there's little reason for the Ministry of Commerce to object to Glencore's bid on antitrust grounds. Almost none of Coal & Allied's output is sold to China. But that doesn't mean MOFCOM has to move quickly. Rio also does plenty of business in China, and counts state-owned Aluminum Corp of China as its largest shareholder. That probably influenced the board's thinking, too. It is unclear whether Glencore will actually engage in a bidding war. It certainly has more firepower, but has also promised to keep debt under control.  However, MOFCOM, or the fear of MOFCOM, is playing an unhealthy role here. The regulator is supposed to safeguard competition in China, not reinforce bids by state-owned enterprises for offshore assets. Commercially speaking, this deal could result in a weaker bidder defeating a larger, more sophisticated rival that could extract far more synergies, given that it owns properties next door. Still, Rio can be forgiven for playing it safe. BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Since the departure of former chief operating officer Nikesh Arora last year, Son has been without an immediate candidate to replace him should he step down. While Arora's resignation at the time raised questions about bench strength within the company's senior management, significant changes in its board of directors, the launch of Son's massive new private equity fund and recent acquisitions have made it one of the more dynamic companies in Japan's recent corporate history. Son, aged 59, told investors at the group's annual general meeting in Tokyo on Wednesday that he had no intention to step down anytime soon.     I feel energized. I couldn't possibly retire,  he said, noting he had no successor in mind since Arora's departure.  Over the next 10 years, that's the challenge I should keep addressing,  he said, adding that a successor would most likely come from the company's management ranks. FILE PHOTO: A man talks on the phone as he stand in front of an advertising poster of the SoftBank telecommunications company in Tokyo October 16, 2015.Thomas Peter/File PhotoSince Arora's resignation in June last year, Son has raised $93 billion dollars for his Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund, and made a string of acquisitions of technology firms, including robotics startup Boston Dynamics from Google earlier this month. Separately on Wednesday, SoftBank said it had invested $100 million in cybersecurity startup Cybereason. The group has also boosted the number of directors with the election of the heads of key overseas subsidiaries to an expanded board of directors. The board is now majority non-Japanese, reflecting the company's increasingly global ambitions. Outside director and chief executive of Nidec Corp Shigenobu Nagamori struck a note of dissent at a broadly congratulatory shareholders meeting, saying that he thought Son had massively overpaid for chip designer ARM Holdings, bought for $33 billion dollars last year.  New directors include Marcelo Claure, chief executive officer of U.S. wireless telecommunications service provider Sprint Corp, Simon Segars, CEO of ARM, and Rajeev Misra, the head of the Vision fund.  We combined knowledge of technology and financing to establish the fund,  Son said of the Vision Fund, pointing to the range of investors from oil rich Saudi Arabia and UAE to tech firms Apple and Foxconn.

On Wednesday, the Queen will open the new Parliament announcing the government’s legislative priorities. The event was delayed so the British prime minister could court a sectarian Protestant party in Northern Ireland to secure the parliamentary majority she lost in this month’s elections. If May loses a vote of confidence in the House of Commons, her government will fall and the UK will have to have another election.  May is trying to avoid this by getting into bed with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to secure the support of their 10 members of Parliament. That is foolish. While attention is focused on Britain’s departure from the EU, the situation in Northern Ireland is fragile. May’s alliance could undermine the Good Friday agreement, which ended decades of sectarian violence and was a major development in the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s. The British and Irish governments were parties to the agreement, and Irish voters approved it in two 1998 referendums. It was also approved by eight Northern Ireland political parties; the DUP was the only major political group there to oppose it.  The Good Friday Agreement requires the British government to be impartial in using its powers in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin, the Irish Republican party, has questioned how that can happen if May’s government is cohabiting with the DUP. It is a good question to which the government has no answer.  She blundered ahead regardless. But after a week of haggling following her election debacle she has decided to call the DUP’s bluff, going ahead without a formal agreement with the Irish party. To remain in power she will depend on DUP support. The more her government gives to the DUP to buy a parliamentary majority, the more it will stoke up demands in Scotland, Wales and England for equal handouts of public money.  MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY John Lloyd: The problem with Oliver Stone and other Putin friends Tim Weiner: What Sessions didn't tell the Senate The talks with the DUP coincided with last-ditch negotiations to bring back a power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. Unless Sinn Féin and the DUP agree to go back into a devolved government by June 29, direct rule will have to be imposed from London. That will undermine the Good Friday agreement and put the peace process at risk.  For its part, the Dublin government - a member of the EU - is worried by the adverse political and economic effects of May government’s courting of the DUP and her negotiations to leave the union.  May’s problems are not entirely her fault. Her predecessor, David Cameron, should take much of the blame. His greatest error was last year’s referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Union. Cameron was sure he would win.  His successor, Theresa May, made the mess worse by putting party before country. Before the referendum she wanted the UK to remain in the EU. Afterwards she decided to appease the Europhobic wing of her party, the UK Independence Party, and the forces of populism by threatening to leave the EU without negotiating a deal.  May’s government has published a Brexit White Paper that fails to explain the key issues. It claims that the UK’s constitutional arrangements make it “the world’s most successful and enduring multi-nation state.” Tell that to people in Scotland and Northern Ireland. According to the prime minister, “after all the division and discord, the country is coming together.” That is untrue. The referendum and its aftermath have been an agent of fracture, not of healing.  The White Paper claimed that “the Great Repeal Bill will ensure that our legislatures and courts will be the final decision makers in our country.” It did not say how that would be done. It said that it would end the role of the European Court of Justice that protects supreme EU law. Again, it did not say how that would be done.  May’s government said it would work with the EU to preserve UK and European security, and to fight terrorism and uphold justice across Europe. That must mean the European arrest warrant and EU databases and information exchange systems. It did not explain how that could be done without the European Court of Justice’s protection.  May’s next major blunder was to call the June 9 parliamentary election. She thought that she would increase the Conservative majority in the House of Commons because Jeremy Corbyn, the Marxist-inclined Labour leader of the official Opposition, lacked voter appeal. Instead, the more the voters saw of her, the less they trusted her, while Corbyn, a rejuvenated Pied Piper, won support from a new generation of voters for expensive promises he will not have to keep.  After a misconceived presidential-style campaign against the background of a stagnant economy, increasing inflation, and a reduction in the amount of money workers take home, May lost her majority. She apologized to her members of Parliament, but not to the public for the mess she has made. She clings to power, relying on her colleagues’ fear of another election and on the support of the DUP.  If the Brexit negotiations fail and the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal, May will have made her worst blunder of all.   About the AuthorLord Lester of Herne Hill QC is a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords and a member of the English Bar practicing in Blackstone Chambers.

U.S. index provider MSCI said on Tuesday U.S. time it would add a selection of mainland Chinese  A  shares to the benchmark, tracked by around $1.6 trillion, in a long-awaited landmark development for global investment. All eyes are now on FTSE Russell, which compiles the other key global emerging markets benchmark, to see if it follows in MSCI's footsteps at its own classification review in September. Mark Makepeace, CEO of FTSE Russell, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, said the company had recently canvassed its client base on including China's  A  shares, noting that many investors continued to have reservations on the China market.  There is not a major push at the moment among our clients for inclusion,  Makepeace told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.  I am personally for inclusion, whether today or in two or three years' time, but we should be trying to build a consensus - and the obligations of China with respect to opening up to international investors in the event of inclusion need to be clear. There is no point in us trying to do something if we don't have the support of our clients.  FTSE Russell launched in 2015 two transitional indexes that include China  A  shares, allowing clients keen to allocate funds to domestic Chinese stocks to do so at their own pace. Vanguard Group, one of the world's largest passive investors, was the first manager to adopt the transitional benchmarks. This year, FTSE Russell also launched an index tracking Chinese shares that can be traded through the Hong Kong-Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect programme. These indices give FTSE Russell greater flexibility on its timeline for including  A  shares in its global benchmarks, Makepeace said.

They cited her lack of experience in running commercial solar projects, even though she had spent years installing off-grid systems across Thailand. Her new project was a first for the country and too risky, they said.  Back then in her early 50s, they also told her she was too old.      The more people say, 'You should not try it, you should not take a risk,' the more I want to do it,  Wandee said in an interview. Her goal was to prove Thailand could use solar energy, so that  we can change the form of energy production, instead of relying on only conventional means . Wandee had retired in 2006 after decades as an entrepreneur running multiple businesses. But when the Thai government announced permits for solar power plants that could feed into the grid, she became the first to secure them.  Financing was a major struggle, however. Finally, the tenth and last bank, Kasikornbank, whose president was an engineer, showed interest.  She needed $20 million, but the bank would only fund 60 percent. So Wandee decided to sell some land and the house she had been building.  My mum said, 'Do what pleases you.' My husband said, 'Let me think for three days',  she recalled. Her response was that she would sell it anyway, she said, roaring with laughter.  Her first solar farm opened in April 2010 in Korat, in Thailand's sunny northeast.  Thanks to her efforts to unlock private financing of about $800 million, by 2014, Wandee's Solar Power Company Group (SPCG) had 36 solar photovoltaic plants with a capacity of 250 megawatts, nearly a fifth of the country's solar production that year.  SPCG is now one of Thailand's largest solar firms. Between 2013 and 2016, its revenues more than doubled and its profits more than quadrupled.  As chairman and CEO of the listed company, Wandee has been recognized by the United Nations for her commitment to clean energy, and in 2015 Forbes dubbed her one of Asia's most powerful women.  We are helping the world by reducing CO2 (emissions) by almost 200,000 tonnes equivalent per year,  said Wandee. This amounts to taking more than 40,000 cars off the road, according to the World Bank. Green and Cheap  The company is expanding into solar roof systems and plans to invest in other Southeast Asian countries. It is also looking at Japan, having received financial support from Japanese electronics firm Kyocera during its infancy.  Solar is the future for the region, Wandee said, with Thailand leading the charge.  The Thai government's 2015-2036 Power Development Plan aims to increase solar energy production to 6,000 megawatts, and boost the share of renewable energy from 12 percent to 30 percent of final energy consumption.  Wandee is particularly keen to venture into Myanmar, where millions of people lack access to electricity, but says it is difficult without a concrete national policy on renewable energy.  Worldwide, solar power costs have fallen by 90 percent and wind by half since 2009, removing the need to choose between green or cheap, say experts.  Yet many Southeast Asian nations are still looking to build more coal-fired plants. Thailand has put on hold an 800-megawatt coal plant planned in a region known for its pristine beaches following protests, but the power sector here is dominated by fossil fuels. According to the United Nations, Thailand's greenhouse gas emissions grew by almost 70 percent between 2000 and 2010, although it now has a target to cut them 20 percent from business-as-usual levels by 2030.   For Wandee, time is of the essence - and solar farms are both quick to set up, taking months rather than years, and clean.   We are talking about saving our next generation and the future of the planet. Nothing can compare,  she said.  Listen Up  After SPCG opened its first solar farm, Wandee was told to wait six months to see how it went before starting a second project. Back then, she had an office of 25 square meters (269 square ft).   I would call Korat almost every hour asking, 'What's happening? You have enough sun? How many kilowatt hours?'  she said, chuckling in the modern building now housing the company in a fashionable part of Bangkok, with soothing green walls and images of a lush forest on the glass doors and walls.  Luckily, the project outperformed expectations and within three months, she was looking for more investors.  The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private-sector arm, and the multilateral Clean Technology Fund gave early backing.  Wandee, who still lives in her old house, wants to continue blazing a trail even though she is nearing 60.  She used to get nervous when talking in public, asking herself what people wanted to know. Now she just focuses on what she's got to say.   Women... have to have confidence in (themselves),  she said.

Since the departure of former chief operating officer Nikesh Arora last year, Son has been without an immediate candidate to replace him should he step down. While Arora's resignation at the time raised questions about bench strength within the company's senior management, significant changes in its board of directors, the launch of Son's massive new private equity fund and recent acquisitions have made it one of the more dynamic companies in Japan's recent corporate history. Son, aged 59, told investors at the group's annual general meeting in Tokyo on Wednesday that he had no intention to step down anytime soon.     I feel energized. I couldn't possibly retire,  he said, noting he had no successor in mind since Arora's departure.  Over the next 10 years, that's the challenge I should keep addressing,  he said, adding that a successor would most likely come from the company's management ranks. FILE PHOTO: A man talks on the phone as he stand in front of an advertising poster of the SoftBank telecommunications company in Tokyo October 16, 2015.Thomas Peter/File PhotoSince Arora's resignation in June last year, Son has raised $93 billion dollars for his Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund, and made a string of acquisitions of technology firms, including robotics startup Boston Dynamics from Google earlier this month. Separately on Wednesday, SoftBank said it had invested $100 million in cybersecurity startup Cybereason. The group has also boosted the number of directors with the election of the heads of key overseas subsidiaries to an expanded board of directors. The board is now majority non-Japanese, reflecting the company's increasingly global ambitions. Outside director and chief executive of Nidec Corp Shigenobu Nagamori struck a note of dissent at a broadly congratulatory shareholders meeting, saying that he thought Son had massively overpaid for chip designer ARM Holdings, bought for $33 billion dollars last year.  New directors include Marcelo Claure, chief executive officer of U.S. wireless telecommunications service provider Sprint Corp, Simon Segars, CEO of ARM, and Rajeev Misra, the head of the Vision fund.  We combined knowledge of technology and financing to establish the fund,  Son said of the Vision Fund, pointing to the range of investors from oil rich Saudi Arabia and UAE to tech firms Apple and Foxconn.   We are not just targeting financial returns ... we want an information revolution across the world.

Instead, chief executive Patrick Pouyanne told Reuters he can find an edge over rivals by going after cheaper reserves elsewhere, including from shale in Argentina and deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through new gas technology.  Shale oil is too expensive,  said Pouyanne, who has clinched strategic deals for Total in Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Iran since taking over as CEO at the end of 2015. Rapid growth in U.S. shale production has led to a sharp increase in global oil supplies that depressed prices. This year, it is forecast to increase by up to 1 million barrels per day to more than five million, or almost 10 percent of the country's total crude output.  Low production costs and relatively short development times have made shale attractive during one of the worst downturns in the oil industry's history. Companies including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Statoil have invested billions in recent months to enter U.S. shale areas such as in the Permian basin in Texas.  The problem lies with asset prices, Pouyanne said in an interview. The cost of buying land to exploit shale deposits below the surface has rocketed, as has the purchase price of companies which already hold development rights. An acre of land in the Permian basin rose from $1,000 in 2012 to $50,000 last year, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie. Pouyanne therefore remains reluctant to expand beyond Total's current gas fields in the Barnett and Utica shale formations in Texas and Ohio respectively. Total has cut costs throughout the downturn, leading to a surge in first quarter adjusted net profit to $2.6 billion, up 56 percent on the same period of 2016. Now Total, which is France's largest company, is cautiously returning to new projects. This year it gave its first go-ahead since 2014 to develop Argentina's Vaca Muerta gas project, one of very few exploited shale deposits outside North America and where land costs are significantly lower. The first phase will cost around $500 million. In U.S. production, Pouyanne sees greater opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, where Total along with only a handful of the world's other top oil companies have the necessary expertise in deep water drilling.  Today it is a game of only five or six players,  he said. Many smaller producers abandoned capital intensive projects in the Gulf of Mexico after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in 2010 killed 11 people and led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history. That cost BP $60 billion in clean-up costs and fines. Deepwater production costs fell sharply in the wake of the oil price crash, as project cancellations forced service companies to cut their prices. Today companies such as Total, Royal Dutch Shell and BP can develop some fields at around $40 a barrel, on a par with the most competitive shale. Total will raise its production by around 30 percent during this decade and has already surprised the market with better than expected growth rates in the past few quarters as projects in Angola, Russia and Brazil added new barrels. Pouyanne's formula is to concentrate on fields that will still be competitive after global oil demand has finally peaked and begun declining.  Let's concentrate on low cost oil. Don't tell me I need to invest in the highest technology barrels because low cost oil is the answer to volatility and peak oil,  he said. Last year, Total became the first major energy group to renew a giant long-term production concession in Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates, which alongside OPEC leader Saudi Arabia has some of the world's lowest cost reserves.  That's why I told Saudi Arabia: 'Don't panic, the last barrels that will be produced will come from your country',  said Pouyanne.  It is why we have taken the position in Abu Dhabi.  Focus on Gas Last month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-member producers including Russia agreed to extend production cuts until March 2018, aiming to drain a global oil glut. Pouyanne said he thought the oil market would take another 12-18 months to rebalance supply and demand, adding that he still believed prices would be high in the long term due to the lack of new project start-ups and cuts in investment in the last three years. Like many of his peers, Pouyanne aims to shift Total increasingly toward less polluting gas as the world seeks to reduce carbon emissions to near zero by the end of the century. For the 53-year-old, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind will make up around 20 percent of Total's portfolio within 20 years.  However, Pouyanne says coal remains the main threat to gas and he supports a drive by some oil majors for more countries to impose punitive taxes on carbon emissions, which are much greater from burning coal than gas.  Gas might be undercut by coal. Renewables will grow but the real fight is against coal. That is why we are advocating a carbon tax,  he said. Britain could serve as a model after its imposition of a carbon tax helped to reduce coal usage drastically.  The UK has managed to shift its power system to gas from coal in one year. The UK has demonstrated it works,  he said. Total will also prioritize using new technology to lower the cost of gas infrastructure around the world, making it  affordable for more smaller economies. This includes regasification plants, where liquefied natural gas shipped in by sea is converted back into gas for fuelling power stations.  We are building more and more infrastructure around the world. Disrupting technology for regasification is changing the world because for $200-$300 million you can build a new point of regasification. You can have a network in the world of more producers and more points to sell your gas,  he said. reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by David Stamp","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-total-strategy-idUSKBN19C0HO"},

But one policy pledge hangs around its neck like a millstone: its plan for a referendum on Italy's membership of the euro currency. If it backtracks on the referendum plan before the election, its rivals, and possibly voters, will pillory it for broken promises. If it doesn't, it has little chance of obtaining the international and market acceptance it craves. 5-Star, Italy's most popular party according to many opinion polls, appears to be aware of the predicament. Carla Ruocco, a prominent 5-Star deputy, told Reuters the referendum was  a negotiating tool  and said:  Big investors and markets should be able to distinguish it from the real intentions of a 5-Star government on the subject of the euro.  The party wants several changes to the euro zone's economic rules to help its more sluggish economies, like Italy. These include stripping public investment from budget deficits under the EU's Stability Pact and creating a European  bad bank  to deal with euro zone lenders' bad loans.  If you sit down to negotiate you have to have a plan B, and the euro referendum is our plan B,  said Ruocco. A 5-Star insider who asked not to be named said the party, which started out in 2009 on an environmentalist rather than a eurosceptic platform, planned to make as little reference as possible to the referendum from now on. Ironically, if the party were to backtrack on its referendum pledge, its own voters may not be disappointed: A survey this month by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre found 58 percent of 5-Star supporters took a positive view of the EU.  Very Pro-Europe  The change in tone is striking, however. Only two years ago 5-Star gathered the signatures needed to pave the way for a referendum that it said was vital to restore Italy's fiscal and monetary sovereignty. Now it is hitting the brakes on the idea. Luigi Di Maio, the deputy widely tipped to be 5-Star's candidate for prime minister at a general election due by May 2018, has said the euro referendum could not be held for at least a year after the vote. The highly complicated process would be unlikely to be completed even in a full five-year term of office, as Italy's constitution bans referendums on matters governed by international treaties. It may therefore first be necessary to hold a referendum on whether the euro referendum could go ahead. Even if it did, the result would not be binding. Last week Di Maio met ambassadors from 28 European countries in Rome to reassure them about 5-Star's fitness for government.  He was very pro-Europe, talking about reforming EU institutions from within,  said one ambassador who asked not to be named.  I got the impression he regretted the euro referendum commitment.  Even in the 2013 election when it made its stunning breakthrough by winning a quarter of the vote, a referendum on the euro was not among 5-Star's policies. Its hand was forced by growing competition from the right-wing, eurosceptic Northern League, whose support was surging as it tapped mounting anti-euro sentiment among Italians who blamed the single currency and its fiscal rules for a stagnant economy and falling living standards. In 2014, when 5-Star promised a non-binding, consultative referendum on the euro, it seemed a good way of not handing anti-euro votes to the League while respecting its own credo of direct democracy. Now the idea has come back to haunt it. Outside Italy it is 5-Star's best-known policy, and any risk of an  Italexit  from the currency bloc is a sign for markets to dump Italian assets.

I am disappointed to report higher than expected operational disruption from the migration of the home credit business to a new operating model,  CEO Peter Crook said. Operational disruption had caused increased uncollected home credit and hit sales penetration and customer retention, Provident Financial said. The lender said shortfall in contribution, mainly because of weaker collections during the transition period, was estimated to be about 40 million pounds ($50 million) in the first half of the year, up from the 15 million pound hit the company forecast in April. Provident Financial said recent collections performance had  deteriorated , particularly in May. June collections were  stabilising , with performance expected to normalise next month, Provident Financial said. Credit issued for the five months to May was 37 million pounds lower than a year earlier, the company said, adding softness may continue.  This will have an adverse impact on profit performance through the remainder of the financial year,  the company said. The impact of higher operational disruption on collections and sales is forecast to reduce 2017 pre-exceptional profits from the consumer credit division to around 60 million pounds, from 115 million pounds a year earlier. The company, which provides credit cards and loans to 2.4 million customers who are unable to meet the lending criteria of mainstream banks, said the business had been hit by attrition, and recent vacancy levels of 12 percent were double the rate anticipated by the specialist lender. Analysts at Jefferies, who rate the stock  buy , cut earnings per share forecast by 15 percent for 2017 and 12 percent for 2018. Subprime, or non-standard, lending has been growing more popular in the UK as banks have tightened their lending criteria and some people find it necessary to borrow small sums for short periods to help manage their finances.

Key facts: - Born on April 21, 1956, Samaraweera obtained a fashion and textile designing degree from Central St. Martins in London before entering politics in 1988. He represents the southern district of Matara in the national assembly. - In the January 2015 presidential election, Samaraweera played a key role as a joint spokesman of the opposition coalition candidate Maithripala Sirisena, who unseated former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, one of Asia's longest-serving leaders. - Samaraweera was the foreign minister until May 22 and had worked hard to ease international pressure on Sri Lanka over alleged war crimes by the military in the 26-year war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. - As foreign minister, Samaraweera was able to get a two-year extension to implement fully the commitments that were made under the 2015 resolution, though the United Nations had expressed concern at the  slow progress  of reforms in Sri Lanka. - Samaraweera was one of the most trenchant critics of alleged corruption and human rights violations by the Rajapaksa administration. - Previously, he was foreign minister under Rajapaksa from 2005-2007, but Samaraweera formed a new party and backed the opposition after Rajapaksa sacked him. - He had also served as minister of port and aviation, urban development, media and information, and post and telecommunication since 1994. - As the telecommunications minister between 1994-2000, he revived the island nation's telecom sector with the privatisation of state-run Sri Lanka Telecom with NTT of Japan buying 35 percent, and introduced private operators. - From a political family, Samaraweera has been in parliament since 1989. - In October 2013, a local court issued an order to arrest him and 10 others for alleged involvement in obstructing a peaceful protest to oust party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, the current prime minister. - Popular for his political shrewdness and strategic decision in winning elections, Samaraweera is considered as one of the kingmakers in local politics.

Prince Mohammed is architect of radical reforms to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil, and his promotion gives further assurance that key parts – including a plan to sell a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, and austerity measures to close a budget deficit caused by shrunken oil revenues - will continue.  This isn't unexpected though it came earlier than expected,  said a Jeddah-based fund manager.  There won't be a risk of the reforms being scrapped.  Also, MSCI announced overnight that it will start considering whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging market status; the upgrade would occur in two phases, in May 2019 and August 2019. MSCI's announcement has largely been priced in, but could still prove modestly positive for the market in the short term. However, the overall environment for Gulf markets is poor; Brent oil sank to around $46 a barrel overnight, its lowest level since November, before global oil producers agreed on output cuts. Also, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan is down 0.7 percent.

New Zealand, Taiwan and the Philippines are all expected to hold rates on Thursday. Indonesia and Japan stood pat last week, as Australia and India did earlier in June. China's central bank, which raised some interest rates after the Fed's March move, kept them unchanged this time.  Unlike in past Fed tightening cycles, Asia is much more reliant on China than on the United States.  There is a common thread and it is that China, Asia's economic engine, continues to stutter,  said Frederic Neumann, HSBC's co-head of Asian economic research in Hong Kong.  We have more central banks on hold or even with an easing bias because China is weighing on demand and the western world isn't strong enough to compensate for that.  In 2016, U.S. trade with 10 top Asian partners rose by roughly 25 percent from levels before the 2008-09 global financial crisis. But China's trade with the other nine grew almost 60 percent in the same period to $1.05 trillion, according to Reuters calculations. The United States' trade with those nine countries is about half as much. Fading Momentum? China has seen fairly solid first-half growth but momentum is expected to fade as crackdowns on riskier forms of financing take effect.  Chinese demand remains subdued, placing a cap on growth and prices across Asia, where virtually no central bank is in danger of overshooting its inflation target. India's retail inflation is lowest in at least five years. In the Philippines, pencilled in by many as the Asian country most likely to increase rates, May inflation was a four-month low.  When you look at where their mandates are, there's no real pressure on any of these central banks to be following the Fed in hiking rates,  said Khoon Goh, Asia research head at ANZ in Singapore. A key reason why emerging Asia used to hike when the Fed did was competition for funding. Higher U.S. rates can spark pressure on currencies and outflows from other countries if their yield premium erodes. But while recent Fed hikes have lifted short-term U.S. yields, there's less impact on the long-end. Thirty-year bond yields US30YT=RR, at around 2.75 percent, are closer to 2.1 percent record lows than the 4 percent levels of four years ago, and have unwound the surge on Donald Trump's election as the new president struggles to implement policy. Good Conditions In May, when last week's Fed move was largely priced in, $5.5 billion came into emerging Asian stock markets while debt markets got $8.7 billion, according to ANZ analysts.  Conditions are still good for risk taking,  DBS strategists said in their third-quarter outlook, noting that U.S. long-term yields are likely to remain low in a highly liquid environment, despite expectations for further rate hikes. Another reason why Asia needs to keep rates low is debt. Moody's Investors Service last month cut China's sovereign ratings a notch, saying its financial strength could erode as growth slows and debt continues to rise. In parts of Asia, household debt is worryingly high, and mortgage rates - unlike benchmarks - have been rising. South Korea on Monday announced tough rules to cool its housing market. At 92.8 percent of GDP, South Korea's household debt exceeds that of the United States and Japan.  If the Fed hikes rates by 200 basis points, would Korea hike by 200 bps or by 50-75bps? Every hike would have a bigger tightening effect than in the U.S. because of the high debt levels,  said HSBC's Neumann.

They have decided that – at least in the short term - they may well be on a loser if they try to fight the People’s Bank of China, the nation’s central bank, which has been taking a series of measures that appear aimed at keeping the currency stable. This is particularly the case ahead of an autumn congress of the ruling Communist Party of China, that is expected to allow Chinese leader Xi Jinping to consolidate his power. Also, the Chinese economy has been more robust than expected, the nation’s authorities have taken stiff measures to reduce capital outflows, and the U.S. dollar has been retreating from gains it made last year. Major global fund managers – such as Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Old Mutual Global Investors, Standard Life Investments and Aviva Investors -- have taken off short yuan positions even as many of them see some weakness further down the road. The PBOC has made some moves to defend the yuan, which is also known as the renminbi. It has pushed up the cost of short-selling the currency and even changing the way it sets a daily mid-point used as a benchmark.  They are not happy with a really weaker renminbi,  said Mark Nash, the London-based head of global bonds at Old Mutual Global Investors.  People obviously don’t want to fight the central bank.”      Nash, whose firm manages $44.7 billion globally, said he had been short the yuan at the turn of 2017 but took that position off early in the year. But he said he believes the strength in the yuan is reflective more of  an exercise in financial regulation  rather than an improvement in China's economic outlook and hopes to go short again soon. Standard Life Investments' Hong Kong-based emerging markets fixed income fund manager, Mark Baker, said he gave up his short yuan position in the first quarter of 2017, after seeing the success China was having with capital controls and some improvement in economic data.    There is a desire to rein in expectations that the currency is merely a one-way bet,” he said. The PBOC did not respond to a Reuters request for comments for this article. The yuan has risen 2 percent against the dollar so far this year. In the latest policy tweak, the PBOC has included a  counter-cyclical factor  in its method for fixing the daily mid-point around which the currency is allowed to trade.        The adjustment to the fixing method in May was the second this year and came after a string of capital control moves, all aimed at stopping domestic Chinese investors from moving cash abroad. That has put a floor under a currency which fell 6.5 percent in 2016 and 4.5 percent in 2015. Concern about the decline led the central bank to spend a trillion dollars over 2-1/2-years to defend the yuan.     Short yuan positions are expensive. It costs about 5 percent annually to own and short the yuan directly based on short-term borrowing costs, though there are a myriad ways in which an investor or trader can structure a short bet. Some investors interviewed for this article said they mainly use offshore forward currency contracts - settled for cash at a particular date - which makes the trade somewhat cheaper.          Intentions Unclear       Beijing is also keen on keeping the yuan strong so that U.S. President Donald Trump isn’t given any reason to take tough trade measures against China. During the election campaign, Trump had accused Beijing of manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive, hurting U.S. companies.     The stronger yuan also helps to dissuade Chinese companies and citizens from moving money offshore.     Jonathan Xiong, head of the fixed income alternatives group at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said he closed out his short yuan positions at the beginning of the year as China’s growth prospects improved.      Stuart Ritson, head of Asian rates and FX at Aviva Investors, with about $453 billion under management, removed his short position around the end of the first quarter, and is now positive on the yuan owing to the PBOC's preference for a stronger currency, reduced capital outflows and because the yuan offers one of the best yields relative to volatility among emerging market currencies. Ritson hasn’t taken a bullish bet as yet.     Not everyone has left the trade. Kyle Bass, the founder of Dallas-based hedge fund Hayman Capital Management, has kept his short position because he says he believes the nation’s credit bubble problems are “metastasizing.”  Bass, has long argued that the Chinese yuan is set to fall 30 percent against the U.S. dollar. “The numbers are telling me that we are right. The numbers are getting so bad so quickly,” he said.     But even those who see the currency weakening have pulled back their forecasts. Deutsche Bank's chief China economist, Zhiwei Zhang, sees the yuan ending the year at 7.1 per dollar, rather than the 7.4 he was forecasting at the beginning of the year.  There should be some weakness, he says, because economic growth is likely to slow, capital controls could become less effective over time and the dollar may not continue depreciating.      At the other end of the spectrum are fund managers such as Jan Dehn, London-based head of research at asset manager Ashmore Group, who says he believes the market shouldn't be blind-sided by conspiracy theories.   The recent stabilisation of the yuan has perfectly sound foundations and can be explained without having to resort to some suspect or obscure schemes on the part of Chinese policy makers,  said Dehn.

Sale gave up four hits and struck out 10 in 8 1/3 innings as the Boston Red Sox breezed to an 8-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals Tuesday night. Sale (9-3) increased his major league-leading strikeout total to 146. He has struck out 10 or more in 10 starts. The last Red Sox player with 10 or more such starts prior to the All-Star break was Pedro Martinez with 11 in 1999.  A little frustrating,  Sale said of not throwing back-to-back complete-games.  But at the end of the day we got the win. We're good.  When Sale gave up two runs on two hits and a walk in the ninth with his pitch count reaching 110 on a hot humid evening, manager John Farrell summoned Fernando Abad to get the final two outs.  I'll never settle,  Sale said.  When you start settling, you get complacent. When you get complacent, you suck.  Sale dominated the Royals, retiring 19 in a row after Alcides Escobar lead off third inning single. It was Escobar's 1,000th career hit as a Royal. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at RoyalsBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatch We've seen him enough to realize how good he is,  Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas said.  He locates all his pitches, throws hard and has great stuff. You just try to put the ball in play, try not to get to two strikes. I was able to do that in that first at-bat.  It was no sale for the Kansas City hitters.  He was good,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  He threw more changeups tonight. His changeup was really good but so was his fastball and slider.  The Red Sox banged out a dozen hits, led by Chris Young going 3-for-4 with a run-producing double and scoring a run. Xander Bogaerts and Sandy Leon each collected two hits and two RBIs.  We scored a bunch of runs and that takes a lot of pressure off a pitcher,  Sale said. The victory moved the Red Sox (40-31) into first place in the American League East, a half-game in front of the New York Yankees, who have lost seven straight. Boston is 19-10 since May 21. It is the first time this season the Red Sox are in sole possession of first place. Sale prevented the Royals (34-36) from reaching .500 for the first time since April 19 when they were 7-7. The Red Sox added three runs in the sixth with Leon scoring on a Young double. Bogaerts drove in two more runs with a single. Jorge Bonifacio, who struck out in his first three at-bats against Sale, homered with Whit Merrifield aboard in a two-run Kansas City ninth. Mike Moustakas hit his 100th career home run in the second, driving a Sale 1-0 pitch 440 feet to right, giving the Royals a 1-0 lead.  I wish it would have came in a win for sure, but it's definitely pretty cool to hit a hundred home runs in the major leagues,  Moustakas said.  It's definitely pretty special.  The Red Sox tied it in the third with Mookie Betts' single scoring Devin Marrero, who led off the inning with a double. Royals rookie left-hander Matt Strahm (2-4) failed to make it out of the fourth inning, facing four batters in that frame and all scored, as the Red Sox seized a 5-1 advantage. Jackie Bradley Jr. opened it with a single and scored when Sam Travis drilled a double to left. After Josh Rutledge beat out an infield single to Moustakas, Strahm uncorked a wild pitch as Travis and Rutledge each moved up 90 feet. Leon got both home with a double and finished Strahm's evening after 75 pitches.  Just making quality two-strike pitches was my nemesis today,  Strahm said.  I thought I had good command. I just wasn't getting it down. I was throwing all four pitches for strikes early in the counts and just couldn't finish them.  Scott Alexander replaced Strahm and promptly threw a wild pitch, advancing Leon to third. Marrero's sacrifice fly to center fielder Lorenzo Cain brought Leon home. Strahm's final line was five runs on seven hits, a walk and a wild pitch. He faced 17 batters. NOTES: The Red Sox made four roster moves. They placed 3B Pablo Sanchez on the disabled list with an ear infection. They optioned RHP Austin Maddox to Triple-A Pawtucket. They recalled 1B Sam Travis and 3B Deven Marrero from Pawtucket and both were immediately inserted into the lineup. ... Royals LHP Danny Duffy threw to hitters before the game for the first time since going on the disabled list May 30 with a right oblique strain. ... Royals RHP Nathan Karns will throw Wednesday for the first time since having a setback in a June 10 bullpen in San Diego. ... Royals prospect RHP Luke Farrell, the son of Red Sox manager John Farrell, allowed one run and three hits over eight innings, while striking out nine and walking none as Triple-A Omaha beat Iowa 5-1. ... Red Sox LHP Drew Pomeranz and Royals RHP Ian Kennedy are the Wednesday probables in the series finale.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-royals-writethru-idUSMTZED6LVP39ZM"},

Vargas hit a mammoth three-run homer to pick up a struggling Ervin Santana as the Twins outlasted the Chicago White Sox 9-7 on Tuesday. Vargas' blast was part of a five-run third inning for Minnesota, which snapped a four-game losing streak. Miguel Sano added a two-run homer for the Twins, who were out-hit 16-12 by Chicago. Minnesota was swept in a four-game series over the weekend by Cleveland, but got back on track Tuesday thanks to Vargas and the offense.  I like home runs, but I just want to produce,  Vargas said.  Home run, double, whatever it takes. The fans like home runs. They get excited.  The Twins didn't get a clean outing from their ace Santana, who has struggled in his last several outings. The veteran right-hander lasted five innings and allowed six runs on a season-high 10 hits. Two of those 10 hits were back-to-back home runs by Chicago in the third inning. Still, Santana earned the win to improve to 9-4 on the year.  The good thing was our offense and bullpen did a good job,  Santana said.  They had my back today.  Related CoveragePreview: White Sox at TwinsChicago White Sox - PlayerWatchLeft-hander Derek Holland (5-7) took the loss for the White Sox. He couldn't get through the third inning, allowing seven runs on nine hits in 2 2/3 innings. Holland has given up six or more runs in three of his last four starts.  It was a pretty embarrassing performance,  Holland said.  To go out to the game and let it slip up like that is just unacceptable, especially when the guys are out there working as hard as they did to put the runs back up on the board for me after the first inning.  Minnesota jumped out to an early 2-0 lead thanks to the two-run homer by Sano in the first inning. Chicago answered back with four runs in the third before the Twins scored five in the bottom half of the frame. Chicago had the tying run on third base in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings but couldn't score the equalizer.  We had some opportunities,  said Chicago manager Rick Renteria.  The more chances we give ourselves, the greater the chance is in the long haul that we're going to drive those guys in.  Errors on back-to-back plays by right fielder Avisail Garcia allowed Minnesota to score an insurance run in the eighth. Sano's single got past Garcia, allowing Ehire Adrianza to score from second. Adrianza had reached base one at-bat earlier on a Garcia error. Brandon Kintzler earned his 18th save of the year by pitching a scoreless ninth inning. Kintzler topped his mark of 17 saves from a season ago. The Twins' home record is now 15-24 after Tuesday's victory. Chicago fell to 16-26 on the road this year. Trailing 2-0 after Sano's two-run homer, Chicago took the lead with a four-run third. Jose Abreu put the White Sox on the board with an RBI double down the left field line. Two batters later, Garcia hit a two-run homer off Santana to put Chicago up 3-2. Matt Davidson followed Garcia's blast with one of his own. Davidson's solo shot, his 16th homer of the season, made it 4-2. For Santana, it marked the third time in his last four starts that he surrendered multiple homers after doing so once in his first 11 starts. Minnesota used a big third inning to regain the lead. The inning was highlighted by Vargas' long homer. His three-run shot traveled an estimated 475 feet and landed in the second deck in left-center field. After an RBI single by Eddie Rosario capped the outburst, the Twins had a 7-4 lead. Chicago got back to within a run in the fifth. Yolmer Sanchez lined a two-out, two-strike, two-run triple off Santana to the right field corner to make it 7-6. Byron Buxton's RBI single in the bottom of the inning pushed Minnesota's lead to 8-6. NOTES: Twins RHP Phil Hughes is scheduled to pitch Wednesday in relief with Triple-A Rochester as part of a rehab assignment. Hughes has been dealing with shoulder stiffness and hasn't pitched since May 21. The veteran right-hander was 4-3 with a 5.74 ERA in nine starts before landing on the 10-day disabled list. ... Minnesota RHP Hector Santiago will pitch in a rehab assignment Wednesday with Triple-A Rochester. Santiago was placed on the 10-day disabled list on June 7 with a left shoulder strain. He is expected to pitch four innings or around 60 pitches in his rehab outing Wednesday. ... White Sox CF Adam Engel was recalled Tuesday from Triple-A Charlotte. Engel played in eight games with the White Sox earlier this season and was 6-for-20 with seven strikeouts.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.  Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.    Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'     These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.  Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.  Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment's $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury's nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.  Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.  Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.  A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.  Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.  Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.  “The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.   Being Mindful of Tax Planning   Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.  “It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”  Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”  Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.  Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.  New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.  “From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.  Coal Interest Dates to 2011  Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.  Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.  Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.  Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.  Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.  Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.  But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.

It's called  be ready at a moment's notice no matter what you're called on to do.  The Texas right-hander was more than ready in a spot start on Tuesday. Martinez threw 6 1/3 strong innings and made Texas' four runs in the first inning stand up in the Rangers' 6-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Martinez (2-3), who thought he was back in a long-relief role until Andrew Cashner went down, yielded one run on two hits and two walks while striking out three for the Rangers, who snapped a two-game losing skid. Working on six days' rest, Martinez set down 18 of the 23 batters he faced and never allowed more than one runner on in an inning. It was his second straight quality start. The right-hander worked around base runners in the second, third, fourth and fifth innings. He left Justin Smoak on as he left after 103 pitches in the seventh. Right-hander Jose Leclerc worked out of a one-out jam to put down the Blue Jays' best scoring opportunity.  Just be ready whenever your name is called,  said Martinez, who is 1-0 with a 1.72 ERA in his past three games, including two starts.  You have to battle and grind it out. Whatever they need me to do.  It was a great game overall. The guys came out swinging, got some really good at-bats and we were able to execute a game plan today.  Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at RangersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchLeft-hander Francisco Liriano (3-3) took the loss for Toronto. Adrian Beltre had an RBI in the Rangers' four-run first and a solo home run in the eighth. Carlos Gomez and Nomar Mazara also homered, while Jonathan Lucroy and Mike Napoli each had an RBI. Beltre moved past Harmon Killebrew and into a tie with Miguel Cabrera for 35th all-time with 1,585 RBIs. The homer represented his 1,079th extra-base hit, moving him past Cal Ripken Jr. for 23rd all-time. The hit was career No. 2,960. Mazara has homered in two straight games and four of his last 12. Liriano, in his fourth start since coming off the disabled list with left shoulder inflammation, took his lumps. The lefty gave up five runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out three over 4 2/3 innings. He gave up two home runs.  It's a tough game to be good every time you go out there. I'm talking about everybody,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  We struggled out of the gates on the mound, too. They put four up ... and then they added on early.  Every Rangers player in the lineup reached base safely. Up 5-0 in the top of the seventh, Martinez left after issuing a walk to Smoak with one out. Leclerc entered in relief and proceeded to walk the bases full. He struck out Steve Pearce in an 11-pitch at-bat for the second out before surrendering a run-scoring single to Ryan Goins. Leclerc struck out Kevin Pillar to get out of the inning.  We hit some balls hard tonight,  Gibbons said.  We had some opportunities but didn't get the big hit.  Liriano gave up two home runs for only the second game all season. The Blue Jays had won each of his previous six starts, supplying an average of six runs in each of those.  I think I missed a couple pitches, but at the same time they were hitting some good pitches,  Liriano said.  You have to give some credit to the hitters and just find a way to get better next time.  Right-hander Jeremy Jeffress and lefty Alex Claudio combined to pitch a scoreless eighth, and right-hander Keone Kela worked a scoreless ninth. Smoak reached base safely twice with a double and a walk. Kendrys Morales, who went 2-for-4, has multiple hits in three consecutive games and four of his last six. The Rangers jumped on Liriano in the first inning, using both small and long ball. Delino DeShields led off with a bunt single, stole second, and took third on a wild pitch. He came home on Beltre's groundout to short. Gomez, the next hitter, hit a 1-1 pitch into the left-field seats. Lucroy added an RBI double that drove in Rougned Odor from first, and Napoli drove in Lucroy with a base hit. Martinez, meanwhile, encountered little trouble, working around leadoff runners in the second and fourth innings.  I think Nick has handled every situation that we've put him in over the last three years about as good as any pitcher we've had,  manager Jeff Banister said.  He takes the ball whenever we ask him to pitch, whether it's out of the bullpen, starting role. He's done a tremendous job.  NOTES: Texas LHP Cole Hamels is scheduled to make his second rehabilitation start with Double-A Frisco on Wednesday and throw 80 pitches. If all goes well he could start Monday against Cleveland. ... Rangers RHP Andrew Cashner, on the 10-day DL with a left oblique strain, is eligible to be activated on Sunday and might be, Texas manager Jeff Banister said. ... Toronto RHP Aaron Sanchez (10-day DL with blisters on his middle finger) will throw live batting practice on Thursday in Florida.

But Hong Kong stocks were hit by the news, amid concerns that an increasingly open, and internationally recognized China market threaten to weaken the city's role as a proxy destination for China-bound investment. China's blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.5 percent to 3,564.62 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent to 3,144.71. While the CSI300 lagged a global stock rally earlier this year, it had surged nearly 8 percent since mid-May, partly on expectations of the MSCI decision. As a result, traders said the news prompted some investors to take profits in blue-chips, which are no longer considered cheap after their recent run-up.  The result is not a surprise,  said Hu Yuanzhi, Shanghai-based fund manager at Rationalstone Investment, noting that even ahead of the announcement, some investors were pocketing gains. Some also attributed the market apathy to the largely symbolic nature of the MSCI decision. The U.S. index publisher will add 222 yuan-denominated A shares to its MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with an initial weight of just 0.73 percent, and the change will only take effect beginning in June 2018.  Flows in the short term are actually (expected to be) quite modest, probably about $12-14 billion of flows from active and passive in year one after inclusion,  said Rakesh Patel, head of Asia Pacific equities at HSBC.  But on a five-10 year view, there's potential for $500 billion worth of inflows, which is huge. This is based on full-weight, full inclusion for both MSCI and FTSE.  Consumer and financials - the two main sectors to be included in the MSCI EMI - posted solid gains, up 0.9 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. Hong Kong But Hong Kong stocks fell on the news. The Hang Seng index dropped 0.6 percent to 25,700.44 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 0.5 percent to 10,413.54.

The Pirates put six runs on the board before Kuhl had thrown his first pitch and the right hander battled through five innings as Pittsburgh beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-3 at Miller Park.  They did an awesome job jumping on it early,  said Kuhl (2-6), who held the Brewers to two runs, seven hits and two walks over five innings and earned his first victory since April 8, when he made his season debut against the Braves.  An early six-spot gives you a lot of confidence.  A hit batter and four straight singles got things started and the Pirates went up, 3-0, when Andrew McCutchen drove in a pair with a single then advanced to second on an error by Domingo Santana, kicking off a three-hit day that included a solo home run.  He's doing a lot of good things at the plate,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. Related CoveragePreview: Pirates at BrewersPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchBoth blasts came at the expense of Brewers right-hander Zach Davies (7-4), who gave up seven runs, 10 hits and a walk with four strikeouts in five innings. Davies retired the first batter, Adam Frazier, but didn't record another out until he struck out Kuhl. The Pirates put six runs on the board in between, highlighted by Osuna's three-run homer.  He made some mistakes with his fastball and they made him pay for it,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  He put some fastballs in the middle of the plate and they did some damage with them.  McCutchen hit his 14th home run of the season to lead off the third inning, but Davies settled down from there, and worked through the fifth without further damage.  You have success in innings 2-3-4-5 but give up six in the first, at that point you have to hope your offense can come back,  Davies said.  But when you're facing tough pitching, you can't just rely on the hitters.  Nick Franklin put Milwaukee on the board with a leadoff home run in the second, extending the Brewers' streak of consecutive runs scored via home runs to 17. He snapped that streak two innings later, driving home Travis Shaw with a single to make it 7-2. Even with the big deficit, Milwaukee had plenty of chances to get back in the game but was 2-for-13 with runners in scoring position and stranded 11.  Felt like we had traffic in a whole bunch of innings but the hit with runners in scoring position was not there,  Counsell said.  But I'll always take the nights with opportunities. You're going to cash in on those eventually.  The Brewers added one more in the sixth when Keon Broxton doubled to score Orlando Arcia, who collected two singles and reached on an error but Broxton was caught trying to steal third, and the Brewers' rally fizzled.  We had runners on base, we just didn't get the hit with runners in scoring position,  Counsell said.  We didn't get contact with a guy on third and less than two outs then the base running mistake in the sixth cost us a chance at a big inning, too.  The victory allowed the Pirates to shave another game off the Brewers' lead in the NL Central. Pittsburgh is now four back of first-place Milwaukee, which leads the second-place Cubs by just a half-game in the standings.  You have to beat the teams in your division,  McCutchen said.

Fears over the effects of a sharp correction in the housing market mean interest rates in Australia are likely to stay at an all-time low of 1.50 percent for a considerable time - even as some global central banks turn hawkish. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last cut interest rates in August 2016. It has since stood pat, juggling the risks of record household debt, tepid inflation and weak consumer spending. RBA board members spent considerable time at their June policy meeting discussing the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy. They even reviewed the academic literature and policy experience in a number of countries, including Sweden and the United States.   This highlights the focus of monetary policy at present, with considerations around financial stability trumping almost everything else including sub-target inflation,  said Su-Lin Ong, head of economics at RBC.   This will keep housing, lending, and credit growth dynamics firmly in the spotlight and at top of the RBA's list as it ponders the appropriate stance of policy.  Australia's household sector is under severe strain with debt-to-income at a record high 189 percent while wages are crawling at the slowest pace ever. The share of national income going to households has shrunk to its smallest since 1964 while the savings rate has fallen to a 10-year low.  That is one reason the RBA is unlikely to hike official rates in coming months because to do so would push up mortgage costs for already indebted Australian families. Yet it fears easing further might only encourage more borrowing by investors to speculate in the housing market. Australia's super-easy policy stance contrasts with global central banks in the mood to nudge interest rates higher. Three of eight policymakers at the Bank of England voted last week to raise rates, while the Bank of Canada surprised by suddenly holding out the prospect of hiking rates to damp down Canada's red-hot housing market. The U.S. Federal Reserve has already moved rates higher twice this year as economic growth picked up and the labor market tightened.   The bank has responsibility for promoting financial stability within its flexible medium-term inflation targeting framework,  the RBA said on Tuesday.  The board judged that holding the accommodative stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.  Moody's Downgrade Late on Monday, Moody's Investors Service cited  elevated risks  within the household sector when lowering its ratings on 12 Australian banks.  The reduction in the savings rate, the rise in household leverage and the rising prevalence of interest-only and investment loans are all indicators of rising risks,  Moody's noted. Australia's 'Big Four' banks are heavily reliant on mortgages for earnings growth. A sharp correction in property prices would certainly hit them, although the Moody's downgrade alone is not expected to lift their funding costs. Official government data on Tuesday pegged the value Australia's housing stock at A$6.6 trillion, nearly four times annual gross domestic product of A$1.7 trillion.  House prices in Sydney and Melbourne - the two hottest markets - have broadly doubled since 2009. There are tentative signs of a cooling off since April following tighter regulation of lending to property investors.  The RBA noted it would take time for the full effects of regulatory measures to show. Australian banks have also increased mortgage rates, out of cycle. The interest-only home loan rate for ANZ Banking Group (ANZ.AX), for example, is as high as 6.26 percent.

The left-hander, who started the season in the bullpen, pitched six sharp innings Tuesday in his third start of the year as Chicago claimed a 4-0 victory over the San Diego Padres. Montgomery (1-3) allowed three hits, walked two and struck out four as the Cubs (36-34) won their third straight.  I felt strong, even toward the end, was able to get quick outs and being efficient helps in that as well,  said Montgomery, who threw 75 pitches on the night.  I think this last time in between (starts) having an extra day, really gave me a chance to get my legs under me a little more.  Anthony Rizzo's leadoff homer provided the only run needed while Montgomery set the tone from the start, retiring the first seven Padres batters and relied on the Cubs defense' to snuff out other Padres' threats. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at CubsSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchChicago Cubs - PlayerWatch When you're able to pitch like that, you give your team a chance to get into the flow of the game,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  We caught the ball really well. We made nice plays. And Anthony (Rizzo) did it again, jump starting the offense.  Right hander Jhoulys Chacin (6-6) also worked six innings and saw a personal two-game winning streak snapped as the Padres (28-44) dropped their third straight. Chacin gave up two runs on five hits, walked three, struck out six and hit two batters. The Cubs tried to add insurance runs in the sixth, loading the bases with one out. But Chacin worked out of the threat, including an inning-ending ground out to second by pinch hitter Tommy La Stella.  (Chacin) was great,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  You get past that first batter of the game -- obviously he missed a spot to Rizzo pretty badly there and made him pay -- but after that I thought he battled really well. Made big pitches when he had to.  San Diego threatened in the seventh with two runners on and two outs, but reliever Carl Edwards Jr. struck out pinch hitter Matt Szczur to end the inning. Cubs reliever Pedro Strop escaped a similar jam in the eighth. The Cubs added two runs in the eighth as Ian Happ's solo homer -- his ninth of the season -- led things off. Javier Baez singled to deep center, advanced to third on Franchy Cordero's error and scored as pinch-hitter Albert Almora doubled to center. Justin Grimm worked a one-two-three scoreless ninth. Rizzo homered to center in his opening at-bat for a 1-0 Cubs lead. It was the third time in seven games he clubbed a home run from the lead-off spot. It was his team-leading 17th homer of the season and the 150th of his Cubs career. In the fourth, Addison Russell bounced a one-out single past a diving shortstop Allen Cordoba to score Kris Bryant, who had reached base by being hit by a pitch before stealing second base. Rizzo learned before the game that he will not be fined or suspended in the wake of a Monday home plate collision with Padres catcher Austin Hedges. There was no apparent San Diego retaliation for the incident. Hedges sat out Tuesday after suffering a thigh bruise but could return to action as soon as Wednesday. NOTES: Monday's leadoff home run by OF Jose Pirela was the Padres' sixth of the season, first in the NL and tied for second in the big leagues. ... Padres 2B Yangervis Solarte was in Tuesday's starting lineup but never took the field after suffering a strained left oblique and was replaced by Chase d'Arnaud. Manager Andy Green said Solarte might be bound for the disabled list. ... The Padres send RHP Miguel Diaz (1-1, 7.36 ERA) out for his third career start Wednesday, facing Cubs RHP Eddie Butler (3-2, 4.41). ...

Prince Mohammed bin Salman becomes deputy prime minister and retains his defence and other portfolios, the decree issued by the Saudi state news agency SPA said. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, for years the kingdom's counter-terrorism chief who put down an al Qaeda campaign of bombings in 2003-06, is relieved of all positions, it said.

Maybin continued producing at the top of the order when he had three hits, including a tiebreaking homer to start the seventh inning, as the Angels totaled 14 hits in an 8-3 victory over the New York Yankees Tuesday. The Angels beat the Yankees for the third time in four meetings this season and handed New York its seventh straight loss overall for the first time since April 20-27, 2007 by getting production from the top of the order all night. Maybin extended his hitting streak to 10 games by getting three hits for the fifth time this season, and Los Angeles produced at least 12 hits for the third straight game. The Angels tied a season high with seven extra-base hits and the first five hitters were 11-for-24. The center fielder is batting .400 (36-for-90) as a leadoff man since being moved there last month and he started things off with a double on the second pitch of the game. His most important hit occurred after the Yankees rallied from a 3-0 deficit by getting homers from Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez in the fifth and sixth. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at YankeesNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchThe Angels regained the lead after Maybin hit a 1-0 changeup from Tyler Clippard into the left-field seats. Maybin's fifth homer triggered a three-run inning against New York's struggling relievers, and, for good measure, he added an RBI infield hit an inning later.  It's going back awhile now,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  He's been the spark plug for us. Cam's doing everything, playing great defense, setting the tone at the top of the order. He's hit the ball out of the park. He's stolen bases. He's giving us a big lift, no doubt.  Besides Maybin, others played a role in the Angels (37-37) getting to the .500 mark for the 18th time this season.  Extremely happy with Maybin's performance,  Los Angeles third baseman Yunel Escobar said through an interpreter.  Even when I was leading off, I was always telling Maybin that was his spot.  Kole Calhoun had two hits and scored the fifth run on a triple by Escobar off the left-center field wall. Calhoun also added an RBI single in the second after Danny Espinosa's run-scoring double. Escobar, who batted leadoff for 38 games, also had two hits while Luis Valbuena capped the productive night with a solo homer in the ninth as the Angels improved to 11-10 since losing Trout.  We did a lot of good things without our best player,  Scioscia said.  So that points to the depth we need to establish in our lineup.  Besides the offense, the Angels did enough on the mound. Parker Bridwell kept the Angels in the game by allowing two runs and two hits while working around five walks in five innings. He allowed Judge's major league-leading 24th homer, and Blake Parker (3-2) allowed Sanchez's 12th homer. Parker was awarded the win when Maybin instantly restored the lead for the Angels. While the Angels experienced an enjoyable night, it was another frustrating showing for the Yankees, who scored 55 runs in their previous five home games.  Obviously tonight didn't go our way, and it's frustrating,  Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner said.  We tied the game back up at 3-3 there, but they came back and took the lead for good. They threw the ball well and made some good pitches, and it just wasn't our night.  Despite Judge and Sanchez homering in the same game, the bullpen continued to falter, especially Clippard. After Michael Pineda settled down after a shaky opening to allow three runs (one earned) and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings, Clippard allowed three runs while Jonathan Holder allowed two. During this skid, the Yankees have allowed 16 runs in the seventh inning or later, and Clippard has allowed five earned runs in his last five appearances.  Not executing like I was earlier in the year,  Clippard said.  I didn't feel like I was that far off tonight, but it wasn't good.

The 66-year-old former government official and People’s Liberation Army veteran said it was time to hand over the reins of the company he founded in 1988 and built into a real estate powerhouse that rode on the back of China's economic boom. The move was widely expected after China Vanke was taken over by the Shenzhen government in March, ending a struggle for boardroom control and raising questions about to what extent the property giant would remain a market-driven company.  I have decided not to be re-elected as Vanke's director since the beginning of the discussion of a new board,  Wang wrote in his blog.  Today, I'm handing the leadership to (President) Yu Liang. I believe it's the best timing. They are younger but mature enough.  A shareholder meeting to elect new board members will be held on June 30, and the company said it had nominated three senior executives of major shareholder Shenzhen Metro, including its chairman, general manager and chief financial officer, as non-executive directors. The state-owned subway operator's control over Vanke was affirmed earlier this month after it raised its stake to 29.38 percent, surpassing financial conglomerate Baoneng Group, which had sought to oust Vanke's management. High Regard FILE PHOTO: Vanke's Chairman Wang Shi attends the debut of his company at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange June 25, 2014.Tyrone Siu/File PhotoWang is an unusually colourful figure in China’s staid boardrooms - an entrepreneur who also rows, climbs mountains and hit gossip headlines when he began dating a much younger actress. He has scaled Everest twice and is the first Chinese man to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents. He set up Vanke - now valued at $34 billion - from an office equipment company and donated his shares to a charity early in its transformation into a private company.   Someone who got rich overnight could be in danger, probably even be killed … and I didn’t know what to do with so much money,” he was quoted as telling a seminar.  The leadership crisis began in late 2015 after Baoneng launched its takeover bid and some disgruntled investors stepped up criticism that Wang was spending too much time studying at Harvard and Cambridge and not enough at the company. The ensuing power tussle saw Wang cede much authority to the Shenzhen government as Vanke lost its title as the country's biggest homebuilder to rival China Evergrande Group (3333.HK). Wang's departure could be a positive for the company, removing the last element of the boardroom battle and appeasing some investors, analysts said.  The Wang Shi era has officially come to an end, but he stopped managing the company years ago so his departure will have no impact to the company's operation,  CRIC Hong Kong head of research David Hong said.     Shenzhen Metro said in a statement it  respects Mr. Wang Shi's decision  and would continue to support Vanke's mixed ownership.

The 66-year-old former government official and People’s Liberation Army veteran said it was time to hand over the reins of the company he founded in 1988 and built into a real estate powerhouse that rode on the back of China's economic boom. The move was widely expected after China Vanke was taken over by the Shenzhen government in March, ending a struggle for boardroom control and raising questions about to what extent the property giant would remain a market-driven company.  I have decided not to be re-elected as Vanke's director since the beginning of the discussion of a new board,  Wang wrote in his blog.  Today, I'm handing the leadership to (President) Yu Liang. I believe it's the best timing. They are younger but mature enough.  A shareholder meeting to elect new board members will be held on June 30, and the company said it had nominated three senior executives of major shareholder Shenzhen Metro, including its chairman, general manager and chief financial officer, as non-executive directors. The state-owned subway operator's control over Vanke was affirmed earlier this month after it raised its stake to 29.38 percent, surpassing financial conglomerate Baoneng Group, which had sought to oust Vanke's management. High Regard FILE PHOTO: Vanke's Chairman Wang Shi attends the debut of his company at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange June 25, 2014.Tyrone Siu/File PhotoWang is an unusually colourful figure in China’s staid boardrooms - an entrepreneur who also rows, climbs mountains and hit gossip headlines when he began dating a much younger actress. He has scaled Everest twice and is the first Chinese man to climb the highest mountains in all seven continents. He set up Vanke - now valued at $34 billion - from an office equipment company and donated his shares to a charity early in its transformation into a private company.   Someone who got rich overnight could be in danger, probably even be killed … and I didn’t know what to do with so much money,” he was quoted as telling a seminar.  The leadership crisis began in late 2015 after Baoneng launched its takeover bid and some disgruntled investors stepped up criticism that Wang was spending too much time studying at Harvard and Cambridge and not enough at the company. The ensuing power tussle saw Wang cede much authority to the Shenzhen government as Vanke lost its title as the country's biggest homebuilder to rival China Evergrande Group (3333.HK). Wang's departure could be a positive for the company, removing the last element of the boardroom battle and appeasing some investors, analysts said.  The Wang Shi era has officially come to an end, but he stopped managing the company years ago so his departure will have no impact to the company's operation,  CRIC Hong Kong head of research David Hong said.     Shenzhen Metro said in a statement it  respects Mr. Wang Shi's decision  and would continue to support Vanke's mixed ownership. Vanke shares in Hong Kong and Shenzhen edged up 1.2 percent and 0.7 percent respectively in morning trading. The Hang Seng Index .HSI was down 0.6 percent.

The former All-Star came up big when his team needed him the most. Machado went 4-for-4 with a pair of home runs and the Orioles beat the first-place Cleveland Indians 6-5 on Tuesday night.  This was a great team win,  Machado said.  Just happy I was able to do something for us today, and come out with a victory. We played great baseball. That's what we've got to keep doing as a team, keep playing as a team. One another will pick each other up. That's all we can ask for.  The Indians ended their longest winning streak of the season at six games. The Orioles extended their American League record in allowing five or more runs in 17 consecutive games. It's also the second-longest streak in the majors over the past 100 years. Related CoveragePreview: Indians at OriolesCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchEdwin Encarnacion got his 17th home run for Cleveland. Jonathan Schoop added a solo homer for Baltimore. With the game tied 5-5 in the seventh, the Indians loaded the bases, but Baltimore reliever Miguel Castro (1-0) got out of the jam with a strikeout and grounder, earning his first major league win. Baltimore made them pay in the bottom half when Machado hit a double and scored on a liner down the right-field line by Adam Jones off Bryan Shaw (1-2).  Machado kind of took some good swings all night,  Cleveland manager Terry Francona said.  His batting average isn't where he's used to it, but he is still really dangerous as he showed. Those balls were hit. Saying that, we had a chance to win in the ninth. So, we went down fighting. Made some mistakes but we'll show up tomorrow and see if can do a little better.  Brad Brach walked Encarnacion and allowed a single to Lonnie Chisenhall with one out in the ninth. Brach then got a fielder's choice on Carlos Santana and a pop-out by Yan Gomes to pick up his 13th save. The Indians fell to 5-1 on their eight-game road trip. Encarnacion gave the Indians a 2-0 lead when he launched a pitch by Chris Tillman into the second deck of left field. It was only the fourth time in Camden Yards history a ball reached that level. The Orioles responded with solo home runs by Machado and Schoop off Josh Tomlin in the first and second innings, respectively. Machado has emerged from his most recent skid since being moved to second in the order. However, Orioles manager Buck Showalter does not put much stock into that strategy.  Manny would hit well wherever we played him,  Showalter said.  He looked real comfortable tonight.  Cleveland retook a 5-2 lead in the fourth on a two-out RBI single by Austin Jackson and a two-run double by Francisco Lindor. Machado tied the game again with a towering three-run homer in the fifth.  That's a really good hitter,  Tomlin said.  So, you make mistakes to a guy like that in big situations, and he can put a crooked number up and change the game.

Similarly, the middle of the Washington Nationals' lineup -- with Harper in the three-hole -- is also red hot, combining to drive in 10 runs in a 12-3 win over the Miami Marlins on Tuesday night. Harper, who had a two-run single, extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games as Washington (43-28) snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 4-2 on this road trip. On the pitch before his single, Harper tried to get a two-out bunt hit, hoping to drive in the runner from third with the surprise play.  I don't hit (Edinson) Volquez well,  Harper said of his 1-for-12 career stat-line against the Marlins starter entering Tuesday.  If I can lay a bunt down and knock in a run ... But it worked out to get a base knock and score two.  Almost everything the Nationals offense did worked out on Tuesday. That's especially true with the middle of the order. After Harper, Washington's 4-5-6 batters were, in order, Ryan Zimmerman (three RBIs), Daniel Murphy (two RBIs), and Stephen Drew (three RBIs). Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at MarlinsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchGio Gonzalez, a native of Miami Dade County, benefited from the support and improved his record to 7-1, allowing six hits, two walks and three runs in seven innings. He struck out eight and beat Miami for the first time since 2014. Harper said he is rooting for Gonzalez to make this year's All-Star Game. The game is set for Gonzalez's hometown at Marlins Park on July 11.  He's been great,  Harper said.  I'm hoping Gio pitches like that the rest of the first half, and he gets the start here. That would be incredible.  Gonzalez said one of his friends in the stands was hit by a bat that left the grasp of Marlins first baseman Justin Bour in Tuesday's fifth inning. Gonzalez's friend was OK after getting hit in the head, and Bour gave the fan a bat as a souvenir.  My buddy was the one that got hit,  Gonzalez said.  It's good to have friends, but put them somewhere safe. ...  He's OK -- he has a tough, solid noggin. Next time, if my friends are in the front row, they will all be wearing helmets.  On the field, Gonzalez's main worry was Miami's Marcell Ozuna, who hit a two-run homer and went 2-for-4 with two runs scored and two RBIs. The homer was Ozuna's 19th of the season for Miami (31-38). Volquez (3-8), who entered the game 3-0 with a 1.73 ERA in his past four starts, took the loss. He allowed five hits, five walks and six runs in 4 2/3 innings. He was especially wild in the third, and it cost him. He walked Michael Taylor and Trea Turner. That duo combined to execute a double steal on a close call on Taylor at third base. Harper then lined his single to center to give Washington a 2-0 lead. Miami closed its deficit to 2-1 in the fourth. Ozuna singled and scored on a one-out double to the left-field corner by J.T. Realmuto. Ozuna, who ran past the stop sign put up by third-base coach Fredi Gonzalez, scored on a head-first dive. Washington scored four times in the fifth to take a 6-1 lead. Taylor started the rally with a double, and he scored on Brian Goodwin's two-out single on a 3-2 pitch. After Harper was walked intentionally, Zimmerman drilled a two-run double to left, and Drew capped the rally with an RBI single.  That inning,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said,  (Volquez) just couldn't get the last out.  Ozuna's two-run, two-out blast to left cut Miami's deficit to 6-3 in the bottom of the fifth. Ozuna hit a 3-2 pitch from Gonzalez. Murphy, who is hitting .377 on the road this year, slugged a solo homer in the eighth -- his 12th of the season -- and Washington added five runs in the ninth, including RBI singles by Zimmerman and Murphy and a two-run double by Drew.  They put you in a box in many ways,  Mattingly said of Washington's lineup.  They can go left-right. Their record is the way it is because they can do some things.

Cindy was located about 230 miles (365 km) south of Morgan City, Louisiana late Tuesday with maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (95 km) per hour, the National Hurricane Center said.  The storm was moving toward the northwest near seven miles (11 km) per hour, and this motion was expected to continue through Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Cindy will approach the coast of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas late Wednesday, and move inland over southeastern Texas on Thursday, the Miami-based weather forecaster said. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for San Luis Pass, Texas to the Alabama-Florida border, Metropolitan New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain.  The winds aren't looking to get much stronger than they are now,  but some areas east of Houston and toward Florida could see as much as 12 inches of rain, said Stephen Strum, vice president of extended forecast services at Weather Decision Technologies in Tulsa, Oklahoma.   It's moving fairly slow, so it's going to produce rain for a long time,  he added.  Heavy rains and wind could disrupt oil supplies at the massive refining and production centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could drive up prices for consumers. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations ahead of the storm, but said it expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. Royal Dutch Shell said it suspended some offshore well operations but production was so far unaffected. Anadarko Petroleum said it had evacuated non-essential staff from its Gulf of Mexico facilities.  Exxon Mobil Corp, Phillips 66, and Motiva Enterprises said the storm had not affected their refining operations.  Cindy was expected to produce six to nine inches (15-23 cm) of rain with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches over southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle through Thursday, the NHC said. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency. Officials in Houston, New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast said they were monitoring developments. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned residents in the northwest part of his state to stay alert for flooding and heavy rain. The storm could cause a surge of one to three feet along the coast and possibly spawn tornados from southern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said. The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, also home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.  Crude oil prices for physical delivery along the U.S. Gulf Coast were relatively stable, but cash gasoline prices rose as traders expected heavy rains and possible flooding to hit refineries in the region.  Prompt U.S. Gulf Coast conventional gasoline firmed to trade as little as 2 cents per gallon under the RBOB futures contract, its strongest in four months. WeatherBell Analytics LLC forecast 11 to 13 named tropical storms in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season, according to a May outlook. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, and has an annual average of 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes. Southeast of the Gulf of Mexico, a second tropical storm, Bret has been downgraded into a tropical wave.

For an earlier INSTANT VIEW on reactions to the decision, see   Key points MSCI plans to add 222 Chinese shares to its Emerging Markets Index, with an initial weighting of 0.73 percent. The full inclusion of domestic Chinese stocks in the widely tracked MSCI Emerging Markets Index .MSCIEF could pull more than $400 billion of funds from asset managers, pension funds and insurers into mainland China's equity markets over the next decade, according to analysts. Comments  Rakesh Patel, Head of Asia Pacific Equities, Hsbc  The launch of Stock Connect has been a pivotal part of making this happen over the last couple of years or so. The reduction in suspension of stocks has also been quite important.  Flows in the short term are actually quite modest, probably about $12-14 billion of flows from active and passive in year one after inclusion. But on a five-10 year view, there's potential for $500 billion worth of inflows, which is huge. This is based on full-weight, full inclusion for both MSCI and FTSE. For global equity funds, China only represents 3 percent of global equity funds right now in terms of weighting. This is versus the second-largest market cap in the world. So there's a big lag between where equity funds are positioned globally and how big China has become. As you start to see more inflows, China gets a bigger weighting in equity funds, which actually represents really where the market is today.  SEAN TAYLOR, ASIA PACIFIC CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT DEUTSCHE ASSET MANAGEMENT   From today, international investors who don't know the A-share market, and who aren't looking at Asia from Asia, need to focus on that. Going forward, China and Asia are already a big part of the emerging market index, and will become increasingly bigger as time goes on.   We're positive on the Chinese market but we prefer H-shares because we think there's more chance of A-share investors buying the H-shares... But we have to note that in certain stocks, we can get exposure in the A shares to industries we can't get in H-shares.  China has been given a big tick in the box from the international investment community and the MSCI. And it might mean that over the next few years, they will accelerate reforms. It gives them the confidence to know that they are doing the right thing. KEN JARRETT, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, SHANGHAI  The inclusion of some China A-shares into MSCI's emerging markets index is another sign of China's ongoing integration into the global financial system. We hope that the MSCI decision will spur domestic regulators to bring China's stock markets in line with global norms and make the regulatory environment more predictable, improve transparency in the stock market listing process, and bring stronger rule of law to the wider securities industry. This would mean not banning major stockholders from selling shares during periods of market turbulence, not suspending the trading of stocks outside the use of predetermined circuit breakers, and therefore not creating the conditions that lead to moral hazard.  Medha Samant, Investment Director, Fidelity International  This has been a long awaited decision, so it's not entirely surprising. It will definitely now put Chinese companies on the map, these companies which were seen to be largely the domain of retail investors.  From a sentiment and symbolic perspective, it's significant. But for those active investors who wanted to participate in this part of China's economy, they've already done so. The 0.7 percent inclusion, on an absolute level, doesn't look that big. But the fact is, when you look at the availability of companies, the size of the market, even a small shift makes a significant difference...A lot of them are in consumer and services sectors, which is what foreign investors find the most interesting part of China's growth.  As we move ahead, as more details emerge, there will be more interest...It's making it easier for foreign investors to understand and have access to these companies. As things develop further, and we think the regulator will be working on that, it will definitely mean expanding the universe a bit.  KEVIN ANDERSON, ASIA PACIFIC HEAD OF INVESTMENTS, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS (via email)  In the short term, certain market policies and arrangements may continue to weigh on some investors’ minds. For example, trading suspensions of China A-shares, which most recently peaked in 2015, can create challenges for investors. Chinese stock exchanges also require pre-approval of any financial products linked to China A-shares. MSCI has highlighted the potential for disruptions to offering existing financial products based on the MSCI EM Index if a Chinese exchange denies approval of MSCI’s licensing of that index. Reservations remain over pre-approvals and technical issues related to Stock Connect, including the timely execution of trades and settlement, as well as a segregated accounts model that remains out of line with international standards. By and large, however, investors appear to be confident enough about the current framework. With China continuing to pursue its reform agenda, and the domestic market now too big to ignore, China’s ultimate aim of full inclusion should be the focus. China A-shares are estimated to grow to as much as 15 percent of the EM Index market cap, yet the timeframe for that remains uncertain.  JOHN SIN, HEAD OF ASSET SERVICING FOR GREATER CHINA, BNY MELLON (via email)  Despite the reduced A-shares index weighting of 0.73 percent, today's announcement represents a defining moment for the Chinese stock market. China's inclusion to MSCI's Emerging Market Index symbolizes the continuation of China's inevitable rise and increased relevance within global portfolios. While the short and longer term impact will have to be monitored, investors will be cognizant that China's weighting and influence continues to increase.  GREG KUHNERT, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT INVESTEC ALL CHINA EQUITY FUND (via email)  At long last MSCI has included the second largest equity market in the world in their indices, thanks to improved accessibility from the Hong Kong and Shanghai/Shenzhen Connect programs... We believe Chinese A shares bring great benefits to global investors, namely the ability to invest in a broader universe of ideas (over 3,000 listed A shares) that are more representative of the Chinese economy and its new growth drivers, along with greater diversification benefits from an overall portfolio volatility perspective. We believe in the long term that China as a country will play an outsized role in regional and emerging portfolios and may in itself become a unique asset class for asset allocators across the world.

Considering the size of global funds that track the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, we see possible outflow of about 600 billion won ($525.92 million) to 4.3 trillion won ($3.77 billion) from our equities,  Jeong Eun-bo, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission said in a policy meeting in Seoul. While such an outflow is a possibility from South Korea's benchmark index KOSPI .KS11 and junior KOSDAQ, the overall impact won't be significant on South Korean equities, Jeong added.  Early on Wednesday, U.S. index provider MSCI Inc. (MSCI.N) said it will add domestic Chinese equities to its widely tracked Emerging Markets Index .MSCIEF, which will draw billions of dollars to China's A shares and decrease South Korea's weight in the index. The South Korean regulator said the country's weight in the index will shrink by 0.23 percentage points to 15.2 percent, as China's weighting increases to 28.4 percent from 27.7 percent.  Seoul shares will shrug off an outflow of few trillion won, analysts said, as the total market capitalization of stocks listed on the benchmark main Korean Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) .KS11 reached 1,536 trillion won as of closing on June 20.   Foreign investors generally buy and sell quite large amounts of local stocks, such an amount (4.3 trillion won) will not be a source of fear for local market players,  said Rhoo Yong-seok, a stock analyst at KB securities. South Korean equities saw a 9 trillion won of net inflow from foreign investors between January and May this year, which will more than offset any potential outflow following China's inclusion in the MSCI index, the FSC said.  The KOSPI .KS11 fell 0.93 percent to 2,347.10 points as of 0035 GMT, and the won KRW=KFTC was quoted at 1,141.6 to the dollar, down 0.5 percent versus Tuesday's close.

Riyadh opened its market, the Arab world's biggest, to direct investment by foreign institutions in June 2015 and has been bringing its settlement and other systems closer to international practice since then. So many fund managers expect a positive decision.  Inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index would be a transformative catalyst not just for Saudi Arabia’s stock market but for exchanges throughout the entire region,  said Bassel Khatoun, chief investment officer for Middle Eastern and North African equities at Franklin Templeton Investments.  With approximately $2 trillion in active and passively managed money tracking it, MSCI’s EM Index is a significant dictator of equity market flows. Inclusion into MSCI EM will put Saudi, and the MENA region, firmly on the radar of international investors.”  MSCI estimated 32 major Saudi stocks would gain emerging market status, giving the country a potential weight of 2.4 percent in its index. That calculation does not include the planned public offer in late 2018 of a roughly 5 percent stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, expected to be the world's biggest IPO. Listing Aramco in Riyadh would approximately double Saudi Arabia's weighting in the emerging markets index, fund managers estimate, possibly making the kingdom a bigger presence in the index than Russia and Mexico.  Fund managers estimate an MSCI upgrade - as well as an expected decision by FTSE this September to lift Riyadh to secondary emerging market status - could bring over $50 billion of foreign money into the country in the next few years. That estimate includes  passive  funds which track indexes as well as actively managed funds. The Saudi market currently has a capitalization of about $445 billion. With the economy and state finances squeezed by low oil prices, Riyadh is eager to attract foreign capital, partly to help improve the management of Saudi companies. But an MSCI upgrade would not guarantee a strong rally in share prices from current levels. The bourse is not cheaply valued - its 12-month forward price-earnings ratio is 13.9, while the MSCI Emerging Market Index .MSCIEF is at about 12 - and the economy faces difficult times in the next few years. The government is imposing austerity policies to cut a huge budget deficit and will introduce a value-added tax next year. Partly because of such pressures, all types of foreign investors currently own only a little more than 4 percent of the market.

Cindy was located about 230 miles (365 km) south of Morgan City, Louisiana late Tuesday with maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (95 km) per hour, the National Hurricane Center said.  The storm was moving toward the northwest near seven miles (11 km) per hour, and this motion was expected to continue through Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Cindy will approach the coast of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas late Wednesday, and move inland over southeastern Texas on Thursday, the Miami-based weather forecaster said. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for San Luis Pass, Texas to the Alabama-Florida border, Metropolitan New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain.  The winds aren't looking to get much stronger than they are now,  but some areas east of Houston and toward Florida could see as much as 12 inches of rain, said Stephen Strum, vice president of extended forecast services at Weather Decision Technologies in Tulsa, Oklahoma.   It's moving fairly slow, so it's going to produce rain for a long time,  he added.  Heavy rains and wind could disrupt oil supplies at the massive refining and production centers along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could drive up prices for consumers. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations ahead of the storm, but said it expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. Royal Dutch Shell said it suspended some offshore well operations but production was so far unaffected. Anadarko Petroleum said it had evacuated non-essential staff from its Gulf of Mexico facilities.  Exxon Mobil Corp, Phillips 66, and Motiva Enterprises said the storm had not affected their refining operations.  Cindy was expected to produce six to nine inches (15-23 cm) of rain with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches over southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle through Thursday, the NHC said. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency. Officials in Houston, New Orleans and other cities along the Gulf Coast said they were monitoring developments. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned residents in the northwest part of his state to stay alert for flooding and heavy rain. The storm could cause a surge of one to three feet along the coast and possibly spawn tornados from southern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, the NHC said. The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, also home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.  Crude oil prices for physical delivery along the U.S. Gulf Coast were relatively stable, but cash gasoline prices rose as traders expected heavy rains and possible flooding to hit refineries in the region.  Prompt U.S. Gulf Coast conventional gasoline firmed to trade as little as 2 cents per gallon under the RBOB futures contract, its strongest in four months. WeatherBell Analytics LLC forecast 11 to 13 named tropical storms in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season, according to a May outlook. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, and has an annual average of 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes. Southeast of the Gulf of Mexico, a second tropical storm, Bret has been downgraded into a tropical wave.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays bullpen struggled again, but Cincinnati Reds rookie starter Amir Garrett was bad enough it didn't matter Tuesday. Tampa Bay's bats stepped up and the Rays held on for a 6-5 win over Cincinnati at Tropicana Field. The Rays (38-36) had been 8-16 this season against left-handed starters, the second-worst winning percentage in the American League. Their bats came through early and often after a disappointing 7-3 loss on Monday night. The Reds (30-40) lost whatever momentum they had from breaking a tie score in the eighth to win the night before. Down 6-3 in the ninth, the Reds made it interesting with three hits and two runs off closer Alex Colome to put the tying run on base with two outs, but Colome got Scott Schebler out to record his 20th save of the season. Rays starter Alex Cobb (6-5) gave up eight hits, but held the Reds to two runs in seven innings for his third straight quality start. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at RaysCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatch I thought he showed some pretty good command with his fastball,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  When he has command of his fastball, he can mix in the curveball and he's thrown some good changeups tonight, so that was great.  Garrett (3-6) didn't survive the fourth and raised his season ERA to 7.41, among the highest in the National League.  (He) wasn't real smooth mechanically,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  The bottom of the lineup hurt him -- he walked (Taylor) Featherston a couple of times, a two-out homer to (Jesus) Sucre ... those are guys you've got to be able to get out to manage a ballgame.  Cobb only allowed two hits in his final four innings, one of them officially a double on a defensive miscue when a ball went off the glove of leftfielder Corey Dickerson, who had two big hits at the plate for Tampa Bay. One night after the Rays bullpen gave up four runs in the final two innings of a tie game, there was another scare, with Cincinnati getting a run in the eighth. Colome then gave up a solo home run to Joey Votto with two outs in the ninth -- Votto's 20th this year -- to cut the lead to 6-4. Colome gave up a double to Adam Duvall and an RBI single to Eugenio Suarez to put the tying run on base before Schebler's out. Two Rays outfielders combined for three defensive miscues that resulted in extra-base hits and two of Cincinnati's three runs. With two outs in the eighth, Tucker Barnhart hit a triple that got past a sliding Peter Bourjos in center field, allowing a run to score to cut the lead to 6-3. Another run scored after a triple dropped between Bourjos and Dickerson in the third and when Barnhart hit a double off Dickerson's glove in the sixth. After falling behind 2-0 in the third, the Rays tagged Garrett for three runs each in the third and fourth for a 6-2 lead. Dickerson, continuing to make a case to be an All-Star, had an RBI single to start the scoring in the third, then a solo home run -- his 16th this season -- to finish the scoring in the fourth. In between, the Rays got a clutch two-run, two-out single from Logan Morrison in the third inning, and a two-run home run by backup catcher Jesus Sucre -- his third this year -- to start the scoring in the fourth. Garrett, who came in with an 11.17 ERA in his last four starts, managed to make that worse, leaving after six earned runs in 3 2/3 innings.  The command wasn't there,  Price said.  Too many mistakes.  Cobb had trouble getting third outs early in the game, as the Reds had six two-out hits in the first three innings, but got only two runs from them. Tucker Barnhart and Devin Mesoraco had back-to-back singles in the second for a 1-0 lead, and Rays outfielders Dickerson and Bourjos both pulled up on a deep fly ball from Adam Duvall, allowing it to drop for a triple. Eugenio Suarez followed with an RBI single for a 2-0 lead.  I don't care who we are facing right now, we need some wins badly and we need to get them abundantly,  Cobb said. NOTES: Rays SS Tim Beckham did not play Tuesday after being hit in the left hand by a pitch Monday and leaving the game early. He's listed as day-to-day but would likely rest Wednesday with a day off Thursday. Tampa Bay played Daniel Robertson at short on Tuesday and he had a hustle double. ... Reds RHP Homer Bailey, on the disabled list all season recovering from elbow surgery and making his third rehab start for Triple-A Louisville, gave up two earned runs on seven hits in 5 2/3 innings on Monday night. ... Reds RHP Asher Wojciechowski, designated for assignment Sunday, cleared waivers and accepted an outright assignment to Louisville. He went 1-1 with a 6.75 ERA in six appearances for the Reds after being cut by the Diamondbacks in March.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-rays-writethru-idUSMTZED6LVN72UI"},

Purchases are then recorded on a computing platform based on blockchain - the technology behind bitcoin. Iris recognition devices at the checkouts of the camp's supermarket authenticate customers' identities and deduct what they spend from sums they receive as aid from the World Food Program (WFP). The U.N. agency launched the futuristic system in May as a one-month pilot involving 10,000 of Azraq's more than 50,000 inhabitants in a bid to explore blockchain's potential to cut costs and bottlenecks. It is now looking to scale up the project to reach more than 100,000 refugees in several camps across Jordan by the end of the year.   We feel this is a starting point,  said WFP's director of innovation, Robert Opp.  There are a number of potential uses of blockchain that could dramatically change the way we reach people in terms of our efficiency, effectiveness and security.   Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralized authority. It has become a key technology in both the public and private sectors, given its ability to record and keep track of assets or transactions with no need for middlemen. Such features have drawn investments from big business and banks around the world, as well as the attention of a number of humanitarian agencies, including WFP. Fees and Frauds In recent years, WFP has increasingly shifted its aid giving towards cash-based assistance, which now accounts for about 25 percent of all aid it delivers.  Handing out money rather than food allows recipients to choose what they buy and eat, while helping to keep afloat local markets and economies in crisis-hit areas, it says. In 2016 WFP's cash transfers amounted to a total of $880 million.   To move the money across the about 80 countries in which it operates, the agency relies on the services of a large number of banks and financial intermediaries that traditionally apply transaction fees of up to 3.5 percent, said Opp. Blockchain promises to cut those costs, an alluring feature for an agency facing a chronic shortfall in funding. And there are also other benefits.  As blockchain automatically records transactions on a secure ledger, WFP accountants can easily follow the flow of money without spending time and energy triangulating reports from stores and banks, said WFP finance officer Houman Haddad. There is no need for advance payments, financial risk is lower and so is the possibility of fraud - such as a bank and a store colluding to inflate bills, he added.  Before WFP had to exclusively rely on external sources of data,  he said.  Now we have our own immutable record of everything that happens . Mining for Ideas  Misappropriation of funds is an issue across the whole humanitarian sector, so it's little wonder that other agencies are also studying blockchain, said Yoshiyuki Yamamoto, special adviser for blockchain at the U.N. Office for Project Services (UNOPS).  In 2012, former Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said 30 percent of all U.N. development assistance was lost to corruption.  If we don't know where 30 percent of the money is, that's a big concern for everyone,  said Yamamoto. In January, innovation units at UNOPS, the U.N. Development Program and U.N. Women started an informal grouping to exchange information about their blockchain work, he said.  The club has since grown to about 10 members, including the U.N. children's agency UNICEF and its refugee agency, UNHCR.   It's a waste of time and resources if 16-plus U.N. organizations are doing the same thing separately in a silo,  said Yamamoto. In April the group asked private companies for ideas for possible applications of blockchain to the U.N. system. The response was overwhelming, underscoring the growing hype around the nascent technology, said Yamamoto.  In a word, it's crazy!  he said, adding they received more than 70 responses, while other requests usually draw only a handful.  Finance is just one use of blockchain, and many more are yet to be explored, said Opp. For example it could help track deliveries of food aid or securely register land titles in developing countries, he said.  That would help small farmers - who now struggle to prove ownership of their plots in the absence of paper documentation - to secure loans and increase food production.  Another potential is to help build identity for refugees,  added Caroline Rusten, head of U.N. Women's humanitarian unit. Blockchain could be used to create a secure, paperless record of skills and education that refugees can carry with them, to which information can be added as they are on the move, she said.   (This would allow) people to be appreciated for who they are and the qualifications they have and not just seen as refugees,  said Rusten.  A blockchain database with information on refugees' identity and the type of support they receive would also help avoid duplications of work between different U.N. agencies. Creating a centralized United Nations out of a  gigantic bureaucratic system  is still some way off, said Yamamoto.   It can't be done overnight,  he said.  We are at a very early stage .
